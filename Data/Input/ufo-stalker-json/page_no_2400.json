going in circles, up, down, zig-zagging, in close, out far, left to right all at an incredible speed. we could also see lights fading in and out. bright white, green, red, yellow and blue. we talked about it being an airplane, helicopter or weather ballon but knew that there was no way that anything man-made could travel like these were. we watched it until our room-mate got home about 18 minutes

need to urinate. went to the wc (which is located next to the sleeping/living area - i currently live in a university staff dormitory room. after urinating i poured myself a glass of water. my partner (girlfriend) had stayed the night but awoke and immediately complained of having had a bad dream. i asked about the dream. she said she had dreamt she had been 'examined' by 'ufo' people  - indicated where by pointing to her mid-torso region at the base of the ribs on her right-hand side (if looking at her face-on). i quickly asked her what kind of examination and she said, \"stuck a needle in me.\" surprised and bewildered by what she had said i immediately turned toward the window (the only window in the room) with the intention of looking out the window - i was thinking half-heartedly that perhaps a ufo would be hovering somewhere nearby - we had discussed ufos and aductions earlier that evening. the window faces in a southly direction. i live on the top floor of this five floor dormitory building - unobstructed views (mostly) of the southern sky. the instant i got to the window and looked out i saw the object in the upper right-hand corner of the sky. it was very bright (against a pre-dawn sky - dawn at this latitude and time of the year happens around 3:30am). in fact, it was bigger and brighter than a satelite (which i see as smaller dots of light when viewed in the night sky over this city). in fact, it was bigger and brighter than venus (at least i think it's venus), which can be viewed at this time of the year (from around 8pm low in the western sky and tracks slowly across the sky to the east). the object moved swiftly across the sky - no faster than a jet airliner would (at that altitude). i immediately yelled to my partner to come to window and see the object. she got to the window in time to see it for about 4 or 5 seconds before it disappeared out of sight (passed behind the dormitory building opposite mine). we stood stunned and amazed. upon seeing the object (though i had half-heartedly expected to see a ufo) i first thought it was a satelite, but quickly realised it could not have been because of its altitude - lower than a jet airliner track (because jet airliners 1) do not pass so low over this city and 2) it was not following the usual jet airliner track over the city - east to west or west to east track. i guessimated its altitude as low because it passed through the rising vapours of a nearby medicine factory (the vapours are similar with those of a power plant); the medicine factory is approximately 3 kms from my dormitory building - in a s.S.E. direction. the object passed through the vapours not behind them like it would if it were higher than those vapours.

asked my girlfriend if she could see it moving and she agreed that it was. i first thought it may be a satellite, the star like object began moving north, at this point from my viewpoint it was like 3 or 4 houses down from my backyard. i then told my girlfriend to keep an eye on it as i was going to run and get the camera. when i returned outside the object was now directly over my house, i snapped about 7 pictures using a casio exilim 7.2 mega pixel camera hoping to catch the object. i also took a short movie after pictures hoping to catch this on film. at that point the star like object either disappeared, or went like back up into space, because as soon as i began to take the pictures the star like object dimmed out, basically like someone just unscrewed a light bulb is the best way i can describe it. we then both noticed that there were random flashes in the sky, one to west, one to the north and then one the south, around the same part of the sky above that we had just witnessed this star like object just fizzle out. then searching the sky in hopes of seeing the object again, i witnessed a shooting star. 3 anomalies in time span of about 7 minutes. we then went through the pictures and the movie and discovered that we did catch something on one of the pictures but none of the rest or the movie. i have no idea what it is. \r\n\r\nin the picture, the star like object is

the beginning...We went camping in deep northern ontario.  at dusk, i took out the camera and tried to get some pics of the fire and perhaps some strange shapes in the fire.  took a few pics and some around the camp site, then put the camera away.  about an hour later, i saw some strange lights across the lake.  the lights were strange because there is nothing on the other side of the lake and all the boats were in.  the lights were just above the tree line on the other side of the lake.  i watched them dance around for awhile, then took out the laser pen and they seem to be responding to it.  i would get an occasional flash of green light back at me like a laser.  there was no sound.  i was playing with the lights for about an hour and then went to bed.  i quickly fell asleep and my wife says shortly thereafter, the tent was lit up with lights.  indeed the entire camp site was lit up.  the next morning i asked the park warden, what was on the other side of the lake.  he said nothing and nobody was on the other side of the lake.  there is no developement, roads, or towers on the other side of the lake.  i asked if anyone was hiking around the lake.  he said absolutely not.  the trail that goes around the lake takes about a week to ten days to travel and anyone attempting to take this trail, must report to the park warden before attempting it.  nobody would dare attempt this trail without letting other folks know where they are.  after we arrived home, i downloaded the vacation pictures on the computer and to my surprise, i actually got a picture of the lights.  i was totally amazed since i never tried to actually get the picture, i just got luckey.  we have reserved our same spot on the same day, (aug.22) in the hopes of seeing the strange lights again.  this next time we are bringing, not only the camera, but the telescope, and binoculars, and tape recorder.  if you can advise me what else would be good to take, i would greatly appriciate it.  you are also invited to join us if you like.  bring your own tent.  :)  p.S. contact me if you would like to view the pic i got from last year.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1

area. i have a great view of the sky amongst the many pine and oak trees in the mountains where i live. i often see ufo's at night but the particular one was in daylight and it is the first one i videotaped. my son spotted it first and directed my attention to it. he had seen several ufo's as well as my family. he asked what it was. it was studied it for a moment and new it was a ufo. it looked like two 1/2 balls ontop each other with a very bright light dividing it. it was about 2:00 high and only about 6,000 to 8,000 feet above my house. it would have been a total of around 13,000 feet from sea level. i live about 5,500 feet in the san bernardino mountains. itseemed to float underneath a cloudlayer going west to east. i estimated, it to be aproximately 30 to 50 feet in circumference. at least it look that way at first until it started changing shape. then it flattend out some. i ran into the house to get my binoculars and video camera. i told my son to keep his eyes on it at all times while i did this. i was in the house for about a minute then ran out and looked to see it in my binoculars first. at that point the ufo traveled a good distance to the left and it was much smaller to the naked eye. i was dissapointed that i didn't have my camera sooner. in the binoculars it looked much different from when i first saw it. at first my son thought it was a giant hot air balloon because it has a dark middle and a dark bottom. i saw it the same way but it was perfectly round and had no bucket at the bottom whatsoever. it was a perfectly shaped sphere. the metal glowed from either itself or the reflection off the sun. because it was a little cloudy, i believe it glowed on its own accord. at times it looked like two ufo's, one on top of the other. i zoomed in on it with my video camera and began to tape it. i had trouble finding it again but then it came out of the clouds and i filmed it for about 6 seconds before it dissappeared into the cloud layer. it was deffinately was a silvery metalic on parts and the other parts looked like bright energy surges which exibited some unatural shapes. at one time it looked like a typical disk ufo with a domed top and domed bottom, then back to it's unusual shapes. when playing the tape in a frame by frame mode many details can be made out. it was amazing to say the least. i showed the tape to several people and they agree it was a ufo. i called bill ryan of ufo magazine and left several messages with him but he has not gotten back with me. this tape is as good as many other videos, perhaps better because it has target points of referrence. it also show clearly, it is not a balloon, plane , helicopter or anythang conventional. it made not sound and just seem to glide throught the sky.I have not been able to transfer the video to computer yet. i will attach a drawing of what it looked like when i first saw it. peter you have my # and left a message on my business phone. i have more other exciting stories to share with you if you like. one is a first hand account of a visit with two extraterestial beings that can be proven. my brother witnessed first hand the ufo's over the capital building while on vacation in new jersey in 1952. he had also seen severl others while in the army. my father has seen several and my mom has seen a ufo above our house in pennsylvania where i grew up. she said it looked like a chandlelair. my daughter at 3 years of age saw a blue disc shaped ufo fly right over our car. she said if she were 10 feet higher she could have touched it. she told me about it when it happened. i ran out but couldn't see anything. at 3 years old she said she could tell me in words what it was but that it was a large blue light coming down the street. later as an adult she was able to tell me exactly what she saw and this case is awesome because it had to do with warping the whole area around it as it came down the street. much more to these stories and others that will blow the average persons minds. i was fortunate enoungh to have had several encounters and then being aboard one with great conscience detail. i have also talked  stanton friedman and preston dennett about some of them. they wanted my story but i was hesitant to give it because of possibly writing a book about it. don't know if that will work out without some professional help. dennett offered to help but i haven't pursued it yet. i saw your 2 hour show several times and was impressed to write to you. please call back if you would like more details or would like to view the video. it would be well worth the time.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Appendage(s),  Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

was ten til midnight and my nephew and his wife and children went home, everyone went to bed but myself and 9 year old son. at midnight, my son said he was going to bed and went into the house. i sat there gazing at the stars, i noticed my neighbor was washing dishes at her kitchen window, her outside entrance light was on and her kitchen light. my light were all on inside my house also. all other neighbors lights were off. there was one lamp post light on across the street to the right. the woman doing dishes was to my left. between these two houses was a large yard with a garden planted. it belong to the neigbor on the left.\r\n\r\ndown the street about a half a block i seen a fireball as big as the sun, yellow red orange fire turning clockwise, as the fire was turning counterclockwise. it went up into a arch as it crossed my street, when it reach tall trees i could not see it anymore. boy, i yelled at my son you just missed the biggest meteorite, you will ever see in your life. he yelled from the window from above the portch roof, mom i!M going to bed, it is gone now. i looked back at my neighbor doing dishes, as i did i heard a big bang like machinery breaking down. the sound and the flurecent aqua green floodlight hit the ground between the two houses across the street. filled up the intire yard, right up to the neighbors window. i was stunnd, and thought what is a helicopter doing here, but i heard no noise. next thing i notice was the street went dark the neighbors light went out in the kitchen and backdoor, the post lamp went off the transformer on the pole blew out for everyone on that side of the street. my electricty stay on.  i stepped off the portch and look down the street to my left toward the intersection two doors down, there in the sky about 80 to 70 feet in the air was a hugh lighted porthole with a beam coming out. i was not surprised at all. i remember saying, why are you in town sucking up my neigbors corn, when this is the corn belt of america. they could of took any road out of town and found corn.. then i went into the street and walked toward the craft. i had to see inside it before it took off. it was really an amazing event,it just hung there over my head making not a sound. i did not look to see if my neighbor had come out of her house, i was so wrapped up into what i was seeing.\r\n\r\nthe green floodlight came out to the right of the craft, which landed in the yard across the street. i told my self barney and betty was telling the truth. so don!T leave the street and you will not be in that beam. i knew from the corn, it could levitate. i guess i thought i was being smarter than they whoever they were. as i walked under it there was a circular room about 15 feet in diameter. and the wall was nothing but bright white light, so bright you could not see a structured wall. the light was the wall. as i turned and followed it with my eyes, i notice looking to the right side of a iron looking rim, i was looking through the green beam which was lighting up the under hang of the craft. just a small part, i even remember bending my knees think i may see it better, it was a dull grey but not smooth, it had rough bumps like knobs on it.\r\n\r\ni had seen enough, and was coming to my senses, i got to get in my house. i keep saying stay in the street every two steps i turned around to make sure the light had not moved, i was finally getting scared. about my third turn around, i was looking up the beam, so i looked down at my feet, i was in the neighbors yard near the corn, i can!T explain what i felt, but i ran across the street in three leaps, yelling at my son, who i thought may still be awake, it had only been five mins. \r\n\r\nhe did not answer so i went and utterly drug him downstairs, to the living room window. the beam was still there, as he got in front of me to look out the floodlight went out. i remember saying, oh, they were only here for my eyes. he ran to the door as i looked at the clock time, it was 3:35 and wont never forgot that second in the 36 years since. i ran to the door, he said lets see it take off. i put my body against the door and would not let him out. at the same time i was pressing my hands into both sides my head, saying thank you god, for making them put me back. i had four children and the nine year old was my oldest. my husband never believed me. he said i must of seen the search light from the airport. it was no use. i called the radio talk show the next day and ask if anyone had seen any thing usual in the sky last night. the radio man laughed and ask if i had seen any little green men. i bang the phone down, and new i would never be able to tell anyone. i did tell friends and family. i had a headache the next day that went on for years 33to be exact. i could not walk straight and could not tell the doctors what happen. i light up lights a few times in my living room while dusting end talbles, i remember that. finaly in 2006 i went into an mri and it showed i have white lesions on the left side of my brain. it controls the right side of my brain. the doctors said that is why you fall to the right. well i never told them what i thought cause it only the year when it started, which is a half truth. there is nothing they can do for it. they also said they do not know why or how it got there. i know, and that is all that matters. no one would believe me if i told them. i do not have ms, which, i knew that also, as after all these years i would of gotten worse. white lesions sometimes means ms. \r\n\r\ni never approched the lady across the street as she would of thought me a loony, also i did not know her personally. i know she had to come outdoors as the green was in her window where she stood in the house darkness from power loss. maybe they had her too, but memory of the craft was wash out of her head. that part they let me remember. some say it was so too much trauma and i dont want to remember. maybe so.  but i did have a dream about the craft 30 years later, i was inside the porthole turning looking at this wall of light, and it was like a florescent light but instead of bulbs, it was light flat slates of mirrors stuck together emitting this light. i could see the seam between the slates. but from the street, it looked be all one wall of light. i was so scared and told myself lois you have to wake up you cant go any farhter into this dream and i woke up, i did not sleep the rest of that night. i want to know and yet i dont. this is the truth the honest truth.\r\n\r\n[witness name

light was coming from behind me (coming from west moving east) very fast, but very low - lower than a plane would fly over.  it was pretty cloudy and it was below the cloud line because it was clear as could be.  no cloud obstruction at all.  it was shaped like a v, the point of the v moving at the front, looked very fireballish, but it was pure bright light and there was no tail like you would see if something was on fire - it was illuminated and glowing, but not burning... all bright white.  it flew over my head and then angled to go south east from here.  i tried to get a better view with my binoculars, but it still looked exactly the same, not a defined crisp outline - because it was so bright and still looked like a v shape glowing pure white.  i was so amazed and was thinking wow, that was the best, and then i walked to the middle of the yard to see if there was anything else out there and i thought i heard a train in the distance and then omg a very low flying helicopter came out of nowhere right over my yard - actually right over my head - and headed in the exact same direction.  it was flying faster than i knew a helicopter could fly.  i know the helicopter saw me - how couldn't he as he went over me.  i thought to myself, that helicopter isn't going to catch that thing - and why did they send a helicopter to chase it?  because it was so low and a helicopter would bring less attention or because nothing else was around to go after it?   doesn't matter, i was sure he wasn't going to catch up to it anyway.  it was miraculous and amazing and an experience i'll never forget.  and it made no noise at all. completely silent.  if something like this was flying over during the daytime, no one would see it because it was so bright white.  the totally silent thing was neat, but the totally noisy fast helicopter was shocking.  i think that if anyone saw this thing they would probably think a meteor was crashing to earth, but like i said, there was no tail on this thing and the glow was almost fluorescent in how it was illuminated. \r\n\r\nlooking over the left at the questions....  it was so smooth in its flight and i was so impressed with its appearance.  i actually after seeing the helicopter felt a little angry at the helicopter for chasing it.  what the heck, it was beautiful to see.  i came in the house to tell my son about it and asked him if he heard the helicopter in the yard and of course not, with the air conditioning on, no one can hear anything outside.  i looked around to the neighbors to see if they came out because the helicopter was so loud someone had to think something was going to crash into their house... but no, not a soul.  it's so humid and hot everyone has their air conditioning on.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

going into the horse arena to spread with our manure spreader when he noticed them.  i was home all weekend and did not hear anything out in the arena.  \r\n\r\nthe only thing that i can think back about that was unusual was that sometime late in the night on saturday, i woke up to find my lab pup up on the love seat in our bedroom looking out at the arena.  once i spoke to him, he just gave me a strange look and laid back down.  when there is someone or something on or near the property, he and my other dogs bark quite loudly.  he did not even growl!!!\r\n\r\nthe circles are approximately 20 ft. in diameter and approximately in the gound about 1-2 inches.  there are absolutely no tracks leading up to the arena from anywhere on or hear our property.  \r\n\r\nif you would like pictures, i can send you an e-mail and also there is a video that a local tv station did on tuesday the 15th.  if you go on koat.Tv and type in the search engine \"crop circles in east mountains\" it will pull up the page with the segment that they did along with the aerial view of the arena.\r\n\r\nyou will see tire tracks in the arena, which was made by us with our manure spreader, but no other tracks can be found.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11617,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0922109,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07182008-0007","longitude":-106.6434667,"occurred":1215846000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

was early spring i think in 1987 and it was a clear warm day. i was walking between a hotel and the 401 in brockville ontario, i had a feeling i was not alone so i looked up and was surprised to see an object at an altitude of about 2000 to 3000 ft. it changet shape from a circle to a star which may be an optical illusion because it was bright, glowing, colour chageing object and as it changed colour it may have appeared to change shape to a star. ir changed colour from red to blue to white and then greeni layed down on the ground to watch this strange object and i am not sure how much time elapsed but it would cjange colour and brightness but it was not moving but it was hovering.I found myself strangly calm about the whole thing which was unusual due to my negative reactions to ufo shows, i ussually get anxious and fearful but in this insident i was calm i think i even fell asleep that is why i am not sure how much time lapsed i put the encounter at about 60 mins but am not really sure. the next thing that happened was 2 f15 eagles flew up and started climbing towards the object. at that point the object moved off at speeds that were far faster than that of the f15\"s trying to approach it. i have told few people but i was not the only witness. i pointed the object out to at least 4 other people at that time but they were in to much of a rush to watch the object, they would just comment how strange it
