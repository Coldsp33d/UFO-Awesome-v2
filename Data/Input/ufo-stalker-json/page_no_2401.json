they had sent us home early. we usually worked until 4:30 am. this was around midnight. there wasn't much open late in those days and we couldn't sleep or watch tv when we got home so we decided to drive around in the country and kill a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nmy friend, terry malich saw it first. he had just returned from vietnam, where he had been an artillery spotter. we were driving on a backroad when he saw something from his side of the windshield i couldn't see due to the curvature of the windshield's upper corner on his side.\r\n\r\n he told me at first he thought it was the north star but it appeared to jitter in his peripheral vision when he wasn't looking directly at it, and that got his attention. \r\nthen he saw it make an extremely high speed descent. at this point he said \"what's he doing here?\", as he knew the only aircraft that could descend that fasi was a huey cobrajet, and he was wondering why a huey was doing combat manuevers in a civilian airspace.\r\n\r\nas he was watching it descend, the object did a series of intense zig-zags that terry said would have torn the wings off any traditional airborne fighter. at this point he began shouting and got very animated. i still couldn't see what he was talking about. we were approaching an s-curve lined with trees on either side and he began yelling at me to get through the trees so i could see it too.\r\n\r\nwhen we got through the s-curve i looked over at terry. he didn't have to tell me what to look at. past his face, about a quarter mile from the road, a large disc was hovering about 3-6 feet from the lines on some high tension towers.\r\n\r\nwe got out of my car and stood there looking at it for a moment and i said,\"let's go check it out.\" \r\n\r\nit must have been spring, as the line of high tension towers were located in a farmer's field and the ground was roughly turned. it was most likely a moonlit night, as visibility, overall, was quite good.\r\n\r\nwe walked across the field towards the object. i kept expecting it to turn into swamp gas, or a weather balloon, or other such nonsense the authorities expect people to believe. it didn't....\r\n\r\nas we got closer i realized i was seeing something not of this world. something we simply don't have the technology to create. it was a large disc, approximately 100-150 feet in diameter and at least 20 feet tall hovering dead silently by the high tension wires. it was remarkably, absolutely stable, as if on invisible columns. i had the impression it was refueling from the power lines in some way.\r\n\r\nit was a smooth, seamless, perfect disc with a row of segmented white lights around it's circumference. the segments were around the size of a cement block. the lights were white and stayed on all the time but they were flaring sequentially around the craft. the flare was brilliant, like an airport runway strobe. occasionally a light would flare a blue-green or red-orange, but there was no discernable pattern to this.\r\n\r\nwe got very close to the craft. as we approached it,i recall thinking,\" i could pick up one of these dirt clods from the ground and hit the side of it.\"\r\n\r\nthat's when the gravity of the situation struck me.\r\n\r\nwe were in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, very close to a real ufo. and for the first time i felt someone was looking at us. i turned to terry and said,\" i can't handle this.\" and he said, \"i can't either.\" and we turned around and walked back to the car.\r\n\r\nwe sat on the fender of the car for 10 minutes or so and discussed what we were seeing. eventually, the craft began to move. the acceleration was very slow, approximately 4 mph. what was striking was the grace of the motion when it began to move. i have never, to this day, seen a machine operate that smoothly.\r\n\r\nwe watched it track the line of high tension towers (which went for miles in a swath cut through the woods and fields, until it was just a small flickering white light in the distance.\r\n\r\nwe finally left and drove for most of the rest of the night talking about what we'd seen. i wanted to report it to the police, but terry, having been freshly discharged from the army, had a very low opinion of authority and said it would cause us countless problems, so we finally just went home.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

people outside) when one of us pointed up to the sky, drawing our attention. a rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed. we had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted. at first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion. i went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me. surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief. we���re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well. we gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them. they were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed. after watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear. the size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another. it did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out). we are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards).

tent around 9pm watching the stars and meteors with my tentmate.When we noticed a green streaking meteor for a couple of seconds.We thought this was strange because all other meteors streaked white.About 30 seconds later i saw a stationary green light about the size of a nickel directly over us several miles up.The green dot started to descend and get larger to about the size of a quarter then it disappeared.Ilooked at richardnext to me and he obviously saw  it also.About ten seconds later directly overhead i next observed it becoming more visible  to more solid,it was directly overhead about 200 feet up and i could see it shimmering with stars visible through it.As it became more visible and solid it became the shapeof a large disc.Suddenly the object was clearly above my haed about 20-30 feet up.It was a green disc roteing clockwise.The bottom of the disc had windows with more light shineing out with a green glow.In the center of the object was a darker circle spinning in the opposite direction of the outer disc.As i was trying to comprehened what this silent disc was it became more than my mind could absorb and i believe i passed out.When you see something that is clearly observed by your eyes and yet it is too much for your mind to comprehend apparently you blank out.The next thing i remember i came too or snapped out of my trance and there was the disc same as before.Now the disc started to rotate faster clockwise.As it sped up it's rotation it started to make a low pitched hum like a electric generator.It rotated faster and then the center axle which was counter rotating earlier sped up as well.The disc with the center sped faster and faster and thenalow hum became a high pitched whine that went beyond my hearing range.Then all of a sudden the center axle  popped out about 10 feet  below the disc which caused the spiining disc to flip over.It flipped over and over as it spun so fast it became a glowing ball of light and suddenly shot up to about 2-3 miles high where it sat for about 30 seconds.I saw it clearly again then it made a cross shaped pattern as if lineing up above us.Then it streaked away so fast up ther it left a green tracer trail for a few seconds.I was so astonished at what i had seen that i turned to richard on his cot next to me and asked if he saw it too.To which he replied no i didn't and i'll be damned if i tell anyone.We were not scared but i soon noticed that the moon had moved from about 30 degrees above my left horizon to 30 degres above my right.I was pondering this when all of a sudden about 30-40 large military helicopters cam over the lake and milled aoround over our heads,then we realized we were not the only ones to see it.They milled arond 5-10 minutes and headed in the direction it left.Iwas not obsessed with what i saw,but the only way i could feel better about itwas to tell myself that god must have sent some angels to check on me.Several days after the event my mom and i noticed some very strange lumps on my arms,sort like lumpy warts.We went to several dermatologists and they could not say what they were.Also i noticed a scrape mark behind my right calf about 3 inches long i could not explain,to this day a scar remains.Anyway whatever happened has left me with an open mind.I did not want to talk to very many people about this event though it was almost 40 years ago.I am a respiratory therapist and would be worried for my current job if this became known.However i am willing to discuss this with an investigator if you would like.I believe there are some propulsion clues as well as military involvement since the helicopters came.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

baking a pumpkin pie prior to going to pick up my daughters girlfriend to spend the night. i took the pie out of the overn and my daughter and i went to go pick up her girlfriend. i was in a hurry because i also had to pick up my husband at the airport at 7pm ish. we traveled north to cactus ave and then turned right on cactus heading east. we picked up her girlfriend as was returning home. at the intersection of cactus and 51st ave, the girls were talking as teenagers normally do and i was the first to notice a huge triagular ufo above us approximately 300 feet into the air. my mouth dropped and i recall saying to the girls \"oh my god\" \"oh my god\" look at this, look at this. we were out into the intersection of 51st and cactus and we just didn't move the car at all, just staring at the object. it was huge, i mean the biggest thing i have ever seen flying in my life. i could only compare it to larger than the length of a football field or bigger. it was completely silent and it was blinking multi-colored light around the outer frame of the object. the lights were blinking in it seemed like a musical pattern, while the craft just hoovered over the same exact spot not moving at all. i looked around at the other cars to see if they were looking at what i was looking at and they did not seem to be seeing the same event. when the light turned and i had to get out of the intersection i turned and the craft began to move golng south, at this time the lights were not blinking in the pattern anymore. i could tell when the craft moved that at that time is when i could see that the craft was actually a huge trianular shape. it seemed as though as the craft turned the appearance of the craft would change. as the ufo moved south i followed it ofcourse in sure amazement and it i believe let me stay up in speed with it, not going very fast is what i mean. when we got to the intersection of 51st ave and northern we had to stop for the stop light, and i again looked around at the other drivers and at this timed i saw the car next to me pointing up into the sky acknowleging the ufo that we were seeing, to my relief because this car was validating what the girls and i were seeing in the sky. it is at this point that while sitting at the stop light that the ufo shot straight up into the sky in a blink of a eye. of course all i can say is that i was so freaked out, i drove home to drop the girls off and i remember telling the girls that i wanted to call the t.V station and tell them what i saw or call the military but for some reason i never did it. after droping the girls off at home i had to pretty quickly leave to pick my husband up at the airport and i remember just freaking out going to sky harbor airport to pick him up. i kept looking up in the sky to see if i could see the ufo again, but there was nothing. i recall telling my husband about it and how shook up i was.  we returned home and i only recall talking about it once or twice again. i asked my daughter to draw a picture of what she saw and i would draw one of what i saw and we wouldn't let each other see it until we were dcne drawing. theyh both were drawn exactly the same.  i do not know where those pictures are today. this is the same ufo that was decribed being seen in january of 2008 in texas.","distance":"21-100

located on the eastern shore of maryland.  the estate is located on land next to a tributary which opens in to the chesapeake bay.  my friends parents were the groundskeepers of the estate.  my friend and his family also lived in a house on the property.   at about dusk we were sitting on a section of bulk head with fishing lines in the water, a portable radio playing near by, radio volume low.  my friend's car was parked approx. 3-4 feet behind us with the passenger and driver's side doors open - the dome light inside the car was lit. behind the car was an open field - no vegetation at the time - on the opposite side of the field approx. 50 yards was a wooded area.  at one point i happened to glance over my right shoulder and noticed a light in the woods.  the light was about the size, color and intensity of a large flashlight. it was moving through the woods waist high from the ground - moving at about walking speed.   at the time, the first thing i thought was that my friend's father was walking through the woods with a flashlight. i didnt pay it any particular attention and turned my head back in the direction of my fishing line and the water.  looking back on the event i realize now there would have been no reason for his father to be in the woods at that hour much less with a flashlight in hand.  approx. 1-2 minutes later i glanced back again toward the direction where i had previously seen the light - now i could see the light had left the wooded tree line and was moving across the field in a direct straight path towards my friend and i.  i nudged my friend on the elbow and said: \"look at that\".  we could see the light was an orb about the size or slightly larger than a softball.   glowing a white/yellow color - not particulary bright.  the shape of the orb was perfectly round.  the light contained within. the surface of the orb was not smooth but had a rather fuzzy appearance. just a perfect sphere of light. as it crossed the field towards us - it moved at about walking pace and was about waist high from the ground.  no sound.  it simply floated through the air in a very straight path.  by now my friend and i had dropped our fishing poles and was standing up.  we watched the orb approach his car as if it were very interested in the car itself - it hovered over the roof of the car as if it were \"checking it out\" and/or us.   it seemed to be very curious.  it hovered approx. 1-2 minutes then began to slowly move off to the right toward some nearby trees.  when it reached the trees - it climbed to tree top level and moved over the top of the trees.  that's where we lost sight of it.  i can remember as we were watching the orb hover above his car literally a few feet away  i could see my friend out of my peripheral vision -  he and i were absolutely frozen with fear.  we could not move. after we lost sight of the orb we immediately got in his car and drove the very short distance to his parents house and told them what we had just witnessed. we left the radio and fishing gear behind.  an hour or so later he, his mother, father, sister and i walked in to their front yard and looked up towards the sky.  now it was dark and you could see stars.  at about the altitude of say where a jet would fly was a dark triangular shaped craft with large white round lights along two edges of the triangle. the craft would travel at what appeared to be a short distance at that high of an altitude at an incredible rate of speed, literally stop on a dime then make sharp right angled turns. we watched for a few minutes then eventually the craft moved straight up until we lost sight of it.  the story can be documented as my mother called the local newspaper the next day to report what we had seen.  i remember seeing a very small article in the paper within the next day or so. i have not been back to the sight since that evening however i have located the exact spot where this occured on google earth.

above the clouds but it moved too fast compared to the other planes i'd seen.  it had no sound.  it was not from a bird either - much too big and above the clouds, not against the clouds.  the dark shadow looked like it was from an object on the other side of the clouds - out in the atmosphere.  it also was much larger than any of the planes and birds i'd just seen against the sky last night. by big, i mean it was very much larger than any of the other things that i had seen in the sky - maybe an inch and a half across - as opposed to the airplanes that looked like they were only about a half inch and that appeared to be much closer to me.  \r\n\r\ni continued to sit and watch for a while longer to see if it reappeared but after another 10 minutes or so i went in side and reported it to my

regarding the stephenville lights heading toward crawford, i felt i had to write. i live on a small ranch in indian gap, tx about 40 miles south of stephenville, tx. on 10-6-07 around 9:00 p.M. my two grown sons and i were outside unloading a truck. we noticed on the horizon to the west in a small cloud bank there were 2 orange lights about the size & color of a lighted cigarette moving in & out of the cloud bank. behind these lights were numberous small flashing white lights covering a large area across the horizon. these lights flashed like a sparkler randomly with no set pattern & there were too many to count. the 2 larger orange lights moved back & forth across the cloud bank at a high rate of spee then stopped, set for a few seconds, then went out. a few seconds later they would appear in another area, moved back & forth, then stop, go on & off & the move again. the whole time the little white lights kept flashing. we watched their show for about 10 minutes & then they just went away. we had a big laugh about the incident & wondered what the lights were. they every next night about the same time they showed up again in the same area. i went to my truck to get something, looked up & there they were. i hollered to my sons who were in the house. they came out & we watched again this time in disbelief. but this time the show only lasted about 5 minutes. we couldn't believe what we had seen & that we had seen it two nights in a row. i believe these 2 sightings were about 2 months or more before the ones in stephenville in january. after the stephenville sightings i would go outside 2 or 3 times a night & look at the sky but did not see anything until january 30, 2008. i heard the dogs barking went outsiede but did not see anything. as i started back to the house i looked up & to my surprise there in the south the lights had returned the same as before. this time i watchedn them for 45 minutes. i called the sheriff's dept. in hamilton county to see if anyone else was sening them. the dispatcher told me no. as i watched & talked to her, one light separated into 2 lights; then went out; then appeared again. then one light separated into 2 lights ; then into 4 lights. after i hung up i saw a small airplane flying low & slow coming from northeast to southwest. it flew right through the area i was sending the orange lights. then from the west came 3 helicopters flying real low & real slow; low enough that the ground shook. the orange lights & white sparkling lights disapeared & i haven't seen them since. i look all the time. i don't know that it was that we saw but i know what it wasn't. the same night, january 30th, there were 4 more people from goldthwaite about 30 miles south of me that saw almos the same thing i saw. only 2 helicopters investigated those lights. these lights definitely were not headed for crawford!\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

outside at 10:30 to look at the sky.Observed a large, what i thought could be a star, but it appeared to be blinking different colors. it was way off in the wsw sky. i watched it for 5 minutes, went inside and got binoculars. with the binocs, i could clearly see this object was blinking red, green, white, maybe blue lights, but i could make out any distinct shape.I watched it for a good 5 more minutes and it hadn't moved a bit. i could see planes moving, but this was just sitting there.\r\n\r\nstuck my head inside the door and asked my family if they wanted to see something weird in the sky, so my partner and son came out and both saw it. son says, \"hey, there's another one.\" he's right, there was a smaller one out to the right of the big one, but a fair distance away. taking a closer look at the night sky, i counted and verified with binoculars 6 small blinking objects, and one large one. they were spread out in an upside down check mark pattern, with the big one being at the base of the check, only one on the lower left side, and the remaining smaller 5 on the right side.\r\n\r\nnone of the objects were moving at all. we could see planes flying and they were obvious. we didn't hear anything. while it seemed like the objects were in our sky, it is possible the were in space. my partner thinks they may have been satellites. i don't think so.My family went in and i stayed out for a few minutes more, untill 11 pm, watching.\r\n\r\ni went back out at 3:30 am and the big one was gone, and there were maybe 4 smaller ones still visible but in different places.Not moving, just hovering. that was the most remarkable thing,the hovering and blinking, it's like wow, what could it be?\r\n\r\nall of us can verify the objects were clearly blinking multi-color.I made sure this morning that they weren't any kinds of cell phone towers or anything like that.My family likes to kid me about stuff like this, but that gave them something to think about. it was strange, and ultimatly a little creepy. i'll go back out tonight and look.","distance":"Over One

on i-40, i decided to take a shortcut towards soccoro,new mexico on to the texas border. i got off i-40 in holbrook, az. and proceeded on 180 to st. johns, az., it was still daylight a few hours til dawn. about 2 1/2 hours into the drive we noticed what looked like an oil rig operation(flashing lights) on the north side of 180 about 500 yards from the road. this was visible for a good long distance, the closer we got to this site we( my wife and i )noticed that this drilling site did'nt look like a typical drilling site. (i used to work on different drilling sites in texas)this site was not a typical drilling location. what me and my wife saw were 2 objects, the first one was on the ground to the left of the second object about 50 or so yards. it had at least 10 lights or what looked like port holes or windows flashing from left to right and right to left and almost from the right and left to the center, these lights somehow seemed like an eye staring at us as we drove east past it. needless to say it gave me a chill down my spine as we got closer, the realy chilling thing was that i felt this object on the the ground was somehow telling me (i don't know about my wife)to stay away don't stop. the object looked about 50 to 75 feet in length. i need to mention that the sun had set the sky was still redish just above the horizon and the sky above us was dark and the stars were showing. as i stated before i used to work on oil rigs inspecting pipe and at first i thought this object was a trailer for bunking or the site office, but i have never seen a bunkhouse or office trailer with fashing lights like this. i make trips to corpus christi, tx. from the austin, tx. area at least once a month and there are at leats 4 drill sites on this route and this was'nt a typical drill site, the second object was to the right and a little further from the road, hovering at least 100 feet and also about 50 to 75 ft. long and circular. there were small bluish-greenish strobe lights below this object (to the ground) in a cylindrical type fasion about 40 or 50 ft. in cicumference, in the center below the second object i saw a yellowish-amber light beam directly in the middle of the bluish-greenish cyclider of strobe lights it looked like a beem of consistant light from the object to the ground at least 8 ft. in circumference. this object was visibly circular,large and stationary and no visible structure attatched to any of these lights below the object at all. while driving past a typical drilling tower or rig you can visibly see the metal structure of the rig blocking lights attatched all along these type rigs, this was not the case at all i could see the strobe type lights clearly from one side to the other . from the distance i noticed a large dim yellowish-amber dome light on the top-center of the object, the closer we got to the objects the stranger they looked. this was the basic discription of what me and my wife saw. during this expierence while driving i asked my wife if she noticed the drill site and she did, as we got closer to the site i said something to the effect \"that does'nt look like a drill site, do you see what i see?\" and i quickly asked her for the video camera. i then realized that she was really scared because she raised her voice at me and told me she did'nt know where any of the 2 cameras were (1 video & 1 small typical type camera) i then tapped on the brake to turn off the cruise control so i could slow down so she could look for either of the cameras. my wife then yelled at me and said she did'nt know where she left them and in the same beath she told me not to stop or slow down while grabbing my right forearm and digging her fingernails in me. so i told her to calm down and continued to resume a speed of about 55 to 60 mph, during these moments i asked her to confirm the 2 objects we were looking at, the flashing lights on the 1st object on the ground,the strobe lights and the yellowish-amber beam on the 2nd object and the shape and size of the 2nd hovering object . all while asking her and confirming what we were looking at, we talked about it until we got to st. johns, she was visibly shook-up and nervous looking back at times while driving away. when we arrived at st. johns, az. i stopped to fuel up at an old gas station along 180 and asked a women at the counter there if she knew about a drilling site west of there,she told my wife and i with a confused look on her face that she did'nt know of any type of drilling that way so close to the road. well thats what me and wife remember about that summer in 1997 around the time kids were let out for summer break. i remember this because we left the grand canyon the day families with their kids started showing up by the dozens, we wanted to see the grand canyon before the summer rush and we did.

(when i first saw it, i thought: \"that looks like a ufo. what is that doing here?\" at some point in time, i remember looking out the windshield, up near the truck's top, and seeing the bottom of the ufo, very close.) then, i remember turning the curve from rfl road (cr 74e), driving fairly fast, and going north on the creedmore lakes road. i don't remember how and can't explain how i got from just west of the hilltop store on hiawatha road to the curve where rfl road turns into the  creedmore lakes road. i drove up the hill on creedmore and \"sensed\" that i was going to see a ufo. i looked over the schoolhouse, and it was hovering just above the roof. the length of the schoolhouse, estimated, is 400-500 feet long. the ufo covered most of that area in length. i wasn't able to get a \"bead\" on the width, but the bottom of the ufo, (looking out of the truck's windshield prior) looked circular. the ufo appeared to be shaped like a cupcake, with a raised disc in the center, on the top. somehow, i \"received\" information (telepathically?) that the bottom of the ufo had opposing rows of magnets running simultaneously, one group going clockwise and the next group going counterclockwise. i don't know if there were just 2 circular tracks, or additional tracks, lying side-by-side. somehow, i received the impression that the \"window\" area just above the magnets was the radiant energy source (nuclear?). i noted that the light radiated out onto the trees around the school and in the immediate surroundings. i'm not sure what the rounded top of the \"cupcake's\" function was, but seemed to understand the the raised disc on the very top was the observation area. as i was driving to and away from the ufo, time seemed to stop. the ufo shot away at a sharply upward and oblique angle, going in a southwest direction. in a blink, it was gone. i saw it shrink into a dot in less than a second and disappear. i don't remember any noises. my sense of time was all shot to hell during this whole experience. at times i seemed to be in fast-forward, and at other times, i was in very slow-motion. i drove north on creedmore lakes road and found my way home. i looked at the clock at home, and noticed that it said 11:30 pm or 12:30 am. i was supposed to have been home by 10:15 pm. i'm reporting this 13 years later because i'm beginning to remember things, and back in 1995, i didn't know there was a place to report ufo sightings. currently, i'm a retired health professional; we are taught to be accurate observers. also, in my preteen-teen years, i was trained, (in the northeastern u.S.), by the air force in the ground observer's corps. a group of us kids and adults in our community volunteered to observe the sky and to report detailed information to the nearby air force base. ... currently, i am working through some of the feelings from the 1995 experience. i can remember feeling fear, looking at the bottom of the ufo over/in front of my truck. however, i feel that, in general, the experience was a \"good one\", but very unusual. at this point, i don't remember any specific contacts with e.T.'s.
