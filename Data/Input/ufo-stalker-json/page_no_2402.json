(witness words as he has had flight time in small aircraft experience and a military background).\r\n\r\n  i could not make out the sides, color or top of the craft in terms of shape and size. i do remember the craft which was stationery over my head rotated and maneuvered across my neighbors property flying over the top of their tool shed. the craft was able to maneuver over short trees in the back yard and around bigger trees. the craft maneuvered from the back yard to my neighbors back door. it came within three to four feet of the ground at times. when it got to my neighbors back door the craft maneuvered to the top of the roof of their house, went over the top of the roof out toward the street and out of sight. the sighting lasted about 15 minutes.","distance":"20 Feet or

gulf of mexico from the window of a beach house on stilts-a tiny star like object possibly satellite or plane appeared to be making an orbit-it stopped and began to go back and forth-up and down-no pattern-awoke person sleeping with me-as we watched it drop in the sky it changed to a huge saucer like object directly in front of the window-couldnt determined size-300 ft might be close-football

that appeared to be the power source-it moved slowly up in the sky-we ran outside and got under the object pleading to let us board-it made another ascension into the sky and from stand-still it zoomed with no sound  to the southeast and eventually out of sight. we were very excited and telling the experience always comes with a letdown due to disbelief.\r\n\r\nwe have no missing time but alot of facts came to mind that i had never considered-strange things about how we evolved and how we connect to them-they were from orion-pelates-siris connected-i do not have recall what they might have looked like-why would we think these things without boarding-we never talked about missing time because it didnt seem to matter\r\n\r\nthe strangest thing about this for us is the fact that they knew i was watching the sky-made the fact know from a distance and come close for observation.  the person that had this encounter with me is dead but it was a habit to call each other just to go over

seeing in the night sky (and once in a bright sunset sky).  it happened again last night and now i feel simply frustrated wondering what it is.  \r\n\r\nagain, i emphasize: i know aircraft flight patterns and behaviors locally.  i grew up in the approach path to seatac airport, my husband flies fixed wing and helicopter, i also grew up in a family where my father was a teacher and one of our regular summer activities was sleeping under the stars and watching satellites.  dad would write the satellite sightings down on a pad and call some number in seattle the next morning and then report to us what satellites they were and what country they originated in.  we even saw a blinking satellite on several occasions and learned about satellites with mylar on them rolling and \"appearing\" to be blinking as they rolled in orbit.\r\n\r\nthese \"flashes\" i have been seeing are different in that:\r\n\r\nthe flashes are brighter and whiter than strobes or aircraft lights (except in the case an aircraft is banking or turning in the sky and you get a strong flash when it is directly at you...But you see the aircraft and its trajectory).\r\n\r\nthe flashes are erratic when multiple are viewed.  you'll see i.E., one bright flash...3 to 5 seconds of nothing...Then another flash...1/5 second, another...Then nothing no matter how long you fix your eyes on the spot scanning peripherally for any flight movement.\r\n\r\nthe flashes have a slow \"blink\" time.  like someone opening for instance, a lens a shutter and closing it. \r\n\r\ni saw the multiple flashes sunday night 7/13 under the handle of the big dipper around 10:30pm or so...I didn't look at the exact time.  it was same spot i and my daughter viewed the flashes in early may.\r\n\r\nlast night, 7/14, i saw a bright flash straight over head and the nw slightly.  just one bright white flash and although i stared at the spot to pick up any aircraft and as with the others, there was simply nothing after the flashes.  just dark sky.\r\n\r\ni need to point out that i hate sensationalizing and stories that obviously are embellished for excitement.  i need to also point out i have seen many flashes over my lifetime and when they are an aircraft, you eventually see their flight pattern take up at some point and see navigation lights.  these are just so different.  brighter, longer flash time, and no movement accompanying the flashes.  i was pretty excited last night to see the flashes two nights in a row.  i'm telling you begin to think it's \"personal\".  i'm really trying not to go there, but it was like it was flashing at me.  i feel stupid for even suggesting that but i figure you hear it all.\r\n\r\ni'm not quick to jump to conclusions regarding ufos probably because of growing up with aircraft and satellites.  i'm even wondering if there is some metal debris out in space that floats around our atmosphere and periodically rolls so it reflects the sun back really bright.  i just don't know if you'd simply see one to three sporadic flashes and then nothing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":11576,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.2190645,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07152008-0008","longitude":-123.0943066,"occurred":1216103880000,"potentialRelations":[11561],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1216103880000,"summary":"Bright

but you could observe it sort of rocking back and forth slightly. i crouched down behind a railing, since the wood of the railing blocked out the nearby street lights, giving me a slightly better look. the harder i focused on it, then looked away, then looked closely again, i could easily swear it was not a star, plane, helicopter, meteor, or anything else i can think of. it was far enough away that shape is very hard to say; but it did seem to have a vague cigar-shape, and the flickering i first noticed was easily (on really looking at it and focusing) identified as flickering lights. as for color, the best i could make out was yellow and red. the object moved very slowly; i watched it for about ten minutes, still not really moving other than the slight zigging back and forth, then went inside for a few minutes to call a friend. watching it continuously it did not appear to change its position in the sky, but after being gone and coming back, it had clearly moved further across the sky. after another fifteen or so minutes watching, it vanished very slowly. it didn't streak off into space; just very, very slowly faded into the distance. i kept my eyes on it as long as possible, then lost it; it became too faint, or moved too far away. or both. the part that should interest you is not only have i just had this experience now, right before i wrote this, but this was actually the third time. july 12th, 1am, same experience. ditto for july 14th. same time, same duration, same everything. so it seems logical to assume it will be back tomorrow night or the night after. i would be more than happy to send you more information as i observe it, but i also know you have people in the area. i would give anything for binoculars or a telescope to get a better look at this thing if it returns again, since it has now faithfully appeared three times in four nights (might have been four-for-four; i wasn't around the 13th) at the same time and in the same area of sky. but it is way up there, and i wish it would come closer. i'm sure you do, too. thanks for listening.

loading the car and she noticed the bright light in the sky. i at first thought it was just venus. but she pointed out it was in the wrong part of the sky. my next thought was it was a helicopter, with the large spotlight on. you couldn't hear any sound from it but i thought that was because it was too far away. a few minutes later a small airplane flew towards the light and circled underneath it, in large circling loops.\r\nwhat really caught my attention was that you could hear the airplane clearly. there were cloud layers and the light & plane were below cloud level. i also new a pilot would not be circling under a helicopter..And i now new if i could hear the airplane, i for sure would have heard the chopper.\r\ni went upstairs and called the airport at lax & told them i was watching a large light in the sky, with a small plane circling underneath. the man i was talking to said they were tracking it on radar and did not know what it was.\r\ni got really excited and said something like, \"wow, it is really an ufo?\".\r\nhe answered something about no, it wasn't a ufo, they just didn't know what it was. i hurried back down stairs (we were watching this out in front of our apartment house) i guess we watched for about15 minutes..The light didn't move, the small plane continued circling under the light..(not up close to the object, but still under it) here comes the good part.. \r\nthe object was in the north west part of the sky. i looked over towards the east and a military jet was flying towards the direction of the light. i remember we said , \"this is going to be interesting.\" the jet was flying at the normal jet speed, as far as i could tell. it got about half way towards the light (half way from where we first saw it) the large light just turned off and a small light was there, like a small star would look in the night sky. as soon as it blinked off & became star sized, it just shot off, towards the pacific ocean. there was no sound at all.I've never seen anything move like that. way faster than a shooting star, way, way faster than that jet was moving.\r\nonce it was gone, i went back upstairs and called lax again.. this time whoever i talked to denied they were tracking anything. \"i have no idea what you are talking about\" was the basic message i got. \r\ni looked in the paper the next day but didn't see anything.\r\ni have no idea why it would stay in the sky that way..I'm guessing we watched it for about 20 minutes in all.\r\nwe were living in the redondo  beach area, not close to the beach, maybe a 10 minute drive to the actual beach. i don't remember the exact time, but it seems to me it was just starting to get dark. probably after sunset.\r\nis there anyway you guys can check lax's information , like in the freedom of information act? would they tell the truth about tracking it on radar? or has too much time gone by?\r\nthanks, just wanted to share my story..I've told many friends about it but i've never shared it in written form.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":11564,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.8519216,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07142008-0013","longitude":-118.3858578,"occurred":-58032000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

break from my freelance artwork. i was gazing at the night sky full of stars and had been looking at the sky for a few minutes. i turned towards the house, looking up over the roof, when my eyes locked on to the sphere. it was a very bright yellow-white color and had very clean, crisp edges. it made no sound and was streaking in a straight line. had i blinked, i don't think that i would have noticed it. i can only relate the experience to when your eyes catch a glimpse of a lightning bolt- my eyes were looking in the right place at the right time. only this sphere was moving at what seemed a slower speed than lightning but still at an incredible rate of speed. i couldn't see any trail or exhaust wake behind the sphere. it traveled a straight path, west to east, over my roof top and i lost sight of it when it passed over the trees on the other side of the horizon. our house is up high on a hill so i gestimate that the distance covered by the sphere in the two to three seconds viewed had to be 10 to 20 miles, more or less. there were no clouds in the sky at the time of the sighting. i think the sphere was thousands of feet above my head, but since i don't know the actual size of the object that altitude is questionable. \r\n  the sky was so clear that night and the clarity of the sphere was optimum. i was excited to see it because i knew that what i was seeing wasn't a commercial jet, civilian plane or meteor. i thought to myself, if it was military, then i congratulate the armed forces on building such a speedy and quiet craft that possibly doesn't pollute the environment like our stock aircraft do.

blips in the west at sunset, so the sky was very bright, but the flashes were sporadic and in 3 separate places close together in the sky.  2nd time we noticed the flashes was in early may.  my daughter and i watched a single sporadic flashing light under the big dipper.  last night was the 3rd time - again under the big dipper.  it flashed a very bright light, white in color. a few second later it flashed twice.  my husband is a pilot.  we are very familiar with both fixed wing and helicopter \"behaviors\" and light patterns.  these \"flashes\" are never associated with seeing any further flight pattern in any direction.  when we have seen these flashes  we tend to stand staring into the sky for a long time afterward, waiting to see if any flight pattern emerges.  an individual can stare into the sky and catch any peripheral movement, such as a helicopter or fixed wing continuing on in some direction.  we are aware also of aircraft turning or changing direction appearing like flashes as they turn, however...These flashes we are reporting never have any such aircraft.  they are simply very, very bright white flashes in the sky followed by nothing, no matter how long you stare.  we have found it interesting that the flashes have always been approximately in same area of the western sky, although from different perspectives.  the first was from olympia wa (25 mi from our current home), the second two incidents were seen from our back deck in shelton, wa. we also have mcchord air force base and ft lewis within 50 miles from us.  we are very accustomed to seeing military aircraft as well.  i had one other ufo experience as an adult and two as a child.  the first experience is very awkward to talk about but perhaps someone else has experienced something similar so i will recount it:\r\nin 1965 i slept in a dormer bedroom with windows facing west.  the head of my bed was against this western wall to the left side of the window (facing the window from inside). i woke to a sense of extreme panic.  at an angle through the dormer wall were two red lines of light the circumference of a pencil or one of those laser lights.  they entered the wall about at the 5' mark on the wall above my head and laid at an angle from there to the foot of my bed, as though i had two red lines of light the width of my bed.  i couldn't move anything but i could see the light-lines.  inside of myself, i knew there was something outside the house shining the lines of light through my wall and i instinctively knew it was the red lines that were making me paralyzed.  i was extremely terrified for a moment, but next thing i knew it was morning so i knew i had fallen back asleep.  i have had no residual effects from that experience.  when i was ten in 1966, i was on a road trip around the usa with my family.  we were going through the deserts of utah when we all observed two large cigar shaped objects with a 'string' of 7 smaller objects between them.  it was way in the distance and seemed very high. we watched them in the sky for approximately 45 minutes as we traveled.  the 3rd time was when i and my two children were at mount rainier camping in 1986.  after dark we walked to the large river that runs from the nisqually glacier to lay on a blanket and watch the stars for meteors.  we all watched as a blinking object moved in the eastern sky toward mt rainier at a rate of speed that would not be uncommon for an aircraft, but as it approached closer to the silhouette of the mt., it suddenly just shot off like a shooting star.  it shot off on the same trajectory line as it was flying and blinking which angled up into the sky.  when it shot off, it truly was fast as a falling star.  like a blur of light.  we all remember it clearly.  i have never thought of reporting any of these experiences, but i figure if you are compiling reports, perhaps what i myself, or us as a family have experienced may match what someone else has reported as well, so for the reason, i thought it would be good to share these events.  thank you for listening.  i feel a bit goofy knowing i am sharing with these with someone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

\r\n\r\n     on sat august 20, 2005 at 11:45 pm i was outside working in my back garage workshop. i heard a loud whining noise that sounded directly over the top of the garage where i was working. i walked outside holding a 3 million candlepower lamp light. when i walked outside and looked up to the right side of my garage directly overhead approximately 10 feet or so i saw a triangular shaped craft. i was so dumbfounded i didn't turn my flashlight on to take a look at it and it was so close to me if i had my pole from the barn i could have reached it. the craft was approximately 12 feet by 12 feet by 12 feet for all three sides. it had 3 red lights-one in each corner of the triangle and a white light in the center approximately 12 inches in diameter. the white light was not very bright. more of a clearance light.(witness words as he has flight time in small aircraft experience and a military background.\r\n\r\n    i could not make out the sides, color or top of the craft in terms of shape and size. i do remember the craft which was stationery over my head rotated and maneuvered across my neighbors property flying over the top of their tool shed. the craft was able to maneuver over short trees in the back yard and around bigger trees. the craft maneuvered from the back yard to my neighbors backdoor. it came within three to four feet of the ground at times. when it got to my next door neighbors back door the craft maneuvered to the top of the roof of their house, went over the top of the roof out toward the street and then went up the street and out of sight. the sighting lasted about 15 minutes.\r\n     ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

the three shells beach as me and a friend were sitting eating lunch. my friend pointed out that there was somthing flying over the estury. it appeared to be hovering over the refinery in kent. it appeared to have a slightly larger diameter than the tanks we could see across the estury. it firstly appeared to be a long cigar shaped object but as it moved out from infront of the clouds, we could see that it had a pearl shaped top. it was shadowed underneath and had light reflecting off of the top. it was moving very slowly so we decided that it could not be a plane. the object was about 2000 feet above the ground, judging by the cloud base which was 3000 feet. the object drifted westwards towards london and appeared to be getting closer rapidly before drifting further away, this pattern began just before the craft reached the other side of canvey and continued until we lost sight of it after it had passed canvey. just before we lost sight of the object, it appeared to be about half way between the clouds and the horizon. my friend claimed to see a flash just before it went out of sight but i did not see this flash as i had already lost sight of the object.\r\n\r\nthe included

unknown reason i didn't feel tired, so i went outside to see if i could spot the black widow spider that had been making webs from the rosemary bushes to the sidewalk in front of my house.  i saw no spider.  then i began to look at the stars.  as i was taking in their beauty, i noticed one star-like object traveling northward.  when i spotted the object it was straight above. i knew it was moving, because it passed the other stars. i assumed it to be a satellite.  it made no sound and stayed on the same trajectory.\r\n     \r\non this monday morning, i got up to take a wiz, and then just thought, 'i wonder if i could spot that sattelite again'.  at approximately 3:00am,  much to my surprise, i spotted two star-like objects.  they passed the same stars that i had seen yesterday.  that's how i knew they were moving.  at first they flew parallel, about four fingers apart.  then they began to converge.  as they were converging, a very recognizable commercial jet flew underneath them.  the jet was heading east and made the usual noise.  the star-like objects flew silently and northward.  they then flew closer to each other, two fingers apart. then they disappeared into a cloud.  i watched on the other side of the cloud to see if they would reappear, but the distance must have been too great.  i could not see them anymore.  i came in and checked the time on the micro wave oven and made a note for me.  then i thought maybe i should share these experiences.

dvd documentary called \"capturing the light\" about one contactee case in canada (dorothy izatt, an 81-year old woman who captured over 30,000 feet of 8mm film of ufos/orbs/lightbeings over 30 years), me and my friend steve went outside for a cigarette. the moment we went out, we both noticed a strange bright light off on the horizon, just about due northwest, hovering off in the distance above the trees. we both initially thought that it was a plane or a star, but the object started to move back and forth, sort of wobbling a bit, before shining so brightly as to outshine the moon for a moment. i have seen plenty of airplanes in my life (i used to work at catholic health association in st. louis and they are right next to the airport so i've seen plenty of aircraft go directly overhead as well). the light wobbled back and forth for a good minute or two, my friend and i standing there transfixed by the object. several times, the light went completely out, to reappear nearby a second or two later. there was definitely a strange, other-worldly feeling while we watched it. it seemed to respond to us in a way, once we stated that it should \"do something impressive\" and a second or two later, it would light up. also, i noticed that when it lit up brightly, i got a strange electric sensation throughout my body, and my hairs stood on end, like when you touch the van de graaff generator at the fun house. i got excited and went inside to yell to my friend ali to \"get outside now!\", but i found that when i ran back out, the object went off to the right behind the trees, and dimmed, as if it didn't want my friend ali to see it. she went back inside after a few minutes, and i felt compelled to walk across the street and across a grass field to the edge of a corn field, in the direction of the ufo. i remember thinking to myself \"where did you go?\", and a moment later, it popped out again from behind the trees, lit up for a second, then dimmed and went back down behind the trees. it was still far away. i'd say the entire time it was a good 5-10 miles away, but it's hard to tell because it was so dark. the most incredible part of the experience was the fact that it seemed to respond to our thoughts and voices, and the light it emitted was of a quality i've never seen before. it was such a bright white as to appear almost blue-ish white. i've been hoping to see an actual ufo, as i have been researching ufos quite a bit lately, and looking at alot of amazing video evidence. but there's no words to describe the real thing. it's such a strange feeling, so compelling as to leave one with no choice but to believe.\r\n\r\nsomething is about to happen, i feel. more and more people are seeing lights in the sky, and more video is being captured, and the frequency of sightings seems to be increasing. maybe we are about to finally make contact, and the government coverup will finally end. one can only hope.","distance":"Over One

the trees and bushes on both sides of the highway.  it was dark, but the half moon was out and bright in the sky.  on the west side of the freeway, beneath the moon, i saw stars in the dark sky.  my attention was caught by a dark mass in the sky that seemed to be backlite.  i looked bact to the object several times until i finally noticed the there seemed to be lights under the bottom half of the object.  the lights were very bright, and the object was moving very slowly.  i slowed down trying to maintain eye contact. i finally pulled my truck to the shoulder and got out of my tractor.  the object was still moving slow enough to be mistaken for a balloon and that was what i thought i would see.  the object was rotating. the lights on the bottom were now facing me and were clearly in an oval pattern around the outer edge of the object.  i tried to take pictures with my camera but it wouldnt focas.  it was maybe 1.5 miles to my west.  maybe 50 to 60 yards in length.  and floated across the sky while appearing to corkscrew through the air.  it seemed to stop.  and then right itself.  the lights on the bottom of the object brighted, and suddenly the object \"rocketed\" forward.  it moved away very quickly, but i still saw the light for a good 60 to 75 seconds.  there was no sound.  when i finally lost sight of it in the night i jumped back into my truck and headed to my destination. i was excited by what i saw and sent text messages to a friend and a nephew.  by the time i got to benton harbor michigan i was on my c.B. trying to see if anyone may have seen anything.  one driver told me that he saw fighter plans in the night sky but i wasnt sure if he was telling me the truth.
