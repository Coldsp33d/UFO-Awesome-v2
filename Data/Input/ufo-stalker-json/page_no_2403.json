on the football practice field next to the basketball and elementary school building. we had been there for about an hour. after playing around that long we needed a rest. the time was around 7:45 p.M., we were sitting in the middle of the field on the fifty yard line. we had been sitting there for about 5 minute's when we heard a very loud noise coming from the south. the sun had just went down, you know that dusk time, but you could still see the outline of the tree's just across the street. the keep getting louder and closer, it sounded like 3 or 4 frieght train's coming at us, but there were no train track's near our town. we looked at each other, and exclaimed to each other; i wonder what it is, and just about that time the noise stopped. then we saw the outline of an object coming right at us over the tree's across the street to the south; there was still no noise, and the craft stopped right above us (approximately 40' above us) and you could not feel any wind change or hear any sound at all from the craft. we were mesmerized looking up at the craft, saying nothing, not moving, and barely breathing, to not make any noise. the craft was just hovering over us, it was in the shape of a triangle but not pointed on the end's; the corner's were more rounded, with neon like round blue and yellow light's approximately 3' in diameter. at the center of the craft there was a larger set of neon light's. these light's were round like the light's on the corner's, but there were 4 round graduating down to the center; purple, green, blue, and yellow in the center. they were not blinking. the craft itself was approximately 150' in width, and 225' in length. the craft seemed to be a medium grey color, but that could have been from the time of day; however, we had plenty of time to see all of the underneath and we really believed the color was right. then, all of sudden the craft started moving off very slowly, and when it got just above the gym building it took off very very fast, but there was not a sound. we ran as fast as we could to one of my friend's house, it was about 1/2 a block from the practice field, and took us only about 6 or 7 second's to get there, because you can run much faster when your that scared. and when we entered his home the tv was on, just as we entered the house, a news flash came on channel (kswo) in wichita falls, tex.. they reported that \"sheppard air force base\" which is 6 mile's north of wichita fall's, had just reported that an unidentified flying object had just flown over the base at a very high rate of speed. the \"sheppard air force base\" is approximately 38 mile's north of archer city, texas. so, it took us 6 second's to get to the house, and with approximately a 5 second delay for (kswo) to pick up on the info from the air base; that mean's that the craft which was just above us, covered approximately 40 mile's in \"1\" second. which if my calculation's are correct, the craft would have had to be traveling approximately 2,400 mile's per second, or 144,000 mile's an hour. now, i'm no scientist, but wouldn't an object traveling at that rate of speed through our atmosphere make quite a noise that could be heard well ahead of the craft? plus, when it took off from visiting my friend's and me, there was not a sound of acceleration. we made a promise to each other not to tell anyone about our \"ufo\" experience. but, this is something you just can never forget, and since that day i have known for sure that there are \"et's\" out there watching and studying us. the only people that i have divulged this information to is my immediate family (until now), and you may think that i am just another person trying to get a little attention, but i'm sure that if you investigated this \"close encounter\" with the \"sheppard air force base\" radar record's back during that time period, and also the (kswo) tv station's record's; you will believe me. however, everything that i have stated in this letter to you; (is the truth and nothing but the truth so help me god). you know, i know a polygraph isn't a 100 percent tool for getting the to the truth, but i would even agree to be given \"scopolamine or thiopental sodium\", this is my prof to you  that all i've stated in this report to you is the truth.\r\n \r\n\r\n                              may god bless us all\r\n                                ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":11546,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5956593,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07132008-0007","longitude":-98.6256128,"occurred":-81638100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-81638100000,"summary":"This was a close encounter.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Archer City, Texas","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:360197"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Orlando","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Fast moving from distance toward i4 route to west from orlando;

awhile but awoke and started looking out my windows 3-4am.  i didn't see anything except a strange large light hoovering out of my east windows at a distance, over farmersville maybe.  smaller lights were coming and going and i got tired of watching, nothing was happening.  i wanted to take a picture but couldn't locate my camera and it is a hassle getting the batteries in it(digital) esp that

wished them away.  not sure about the next night if they were there but still hearing the sounds, getting really annoyed with this as it was disturbing my sleep.  the next day i am hearing stories

coctail lounge.  i was sober.  i was near the corner of convoy and armour streets in san diego, california.  i observed 4 large white lights fly almost directly over me.  i immediately went home and filed a report, within 2 hours, to the national ufo reporting agency.  it has been posted and i have copied and pasted the report below.  \r\n\r\nafter a few months, i think january 2008, i joined mufon.   i thought i should also post this sighting with mufon.  \r\n\r\nalso, i watched larry king live last night and they talked about the stephenville, texas sighting with multiple radar contacts.  my sighting last october should also have multiple radar hits since the craft, or crafts, passed over miramar and montgomery air fields.\r\n\r\nin reading my old report below, i see where i could make it more clear.  the v-shaped lights were above the lowest level of clouds (rain clouds); but below the highest level of clouds (wispy clouds).  this is not very high.  the lights were 4 times larger than the largest star.  if these were military craft lights, there would have been a loud roar, there was no noice.  also, when i saw this formation of lights, i immediately knew it was unique and i did not think these were military or civilian crafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\noccurred : 10/27/2007 19:48 (entered as : 10/27/07 19:48)\r\nreported: 10/27/2007 9:53:35 pm 21:53\r\nposted: 11/28/2007\r\nlocation: san diego, ca\r\nshape: light\r\nduration:5 seconds\r\n4 white lights in a v-shape flying above the clouds across the sky in about 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nthis evening, saturday, october 27, 2007 at 7:48 pacific time, i saw 4 lights, shaped in a tight v-shape (2 on each side), fly across the sky from north to south almost directly over me; but passing slightly east of my location. i was in a dark area near the corner of convoy and armour streets in san diego, california. this area is directly under the flight path of montgomery field and a few miles south of miramar marine air station. i have lived around the miramar marine air station for 20 years in several locations. i have seen just about every possible plane and plane formation flying over me in this area and i have never seen anything like this.\r\n\r\neach light was about the 3 or 4 times the size of a normal star (so they were very obvious). a plane close enough to have a light that large would be very loud; but there was no sound. the distance between each light was about the same as each light (making it seem like all 4 lights were linked) but i could not see anything in-between the lights. this was a tight formation. this v-shape of lights traveled from north to south across two-thirds of the sky in about 5 seconds (5 seconds is not a quick glance---i watched it clearly).\r\n\r\ntonight, at 7:48 pm, there was about 10 to 20 percent of wispy cloud cover and these lights were above the clouds; but i do not know how high above the clouds. i could see the lights through the clouds as they passed over the clouds.\r\n\r\nthe quality of the lights needs mentioning. the lights were solid and bright; but not a bright light like a star or blinking plane light. these lights were different, maybe softer. these lights did not blink. i guess the best description of these lights would be a slightly dim, off-white. i say they were a v-shape; but the open end would be wider than a typical v.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

mind. several days later the reports from stephensville texas started trickling out. sometime later we seen the video on larry king...It was the same thing we seen only our reports were buried by texas...Call me? \"i was in the front yard feeding my dogs and it was early evening probably 7:15 pm and the stars had enough time to really start shining. the night was crystal clear and the stars were thick. as i scanned the universe and took the time to admire each cluster before moving on to the next  airplanes flying overhead and at a distance like a long train every couple of minutes (we live under a hartsfield international flight path) their lights gently blinking as they made their way, they paled in comparison to the pinpoint radiant lights of the stars. even took in and wished on two shooting stars. it was very serene, very peaceful. i was scanning east to west and as i hit the tree top horizon i noticed a glowing, light pulsating, large cloud. it was obviously in outer space, there was a plane flying in front of it and the plane looked so tiny in comparison. then it moved...Quickly. almost like it was falling towards the earth. the first thing i thought of was that comet you wrote of recently. but this thing moved and behaved like nothing i ever seen before, the lights were multicolored almost like flashers on the airplane just much brighter and methodical, and it was so big. too big to be a plane, to high to be a chopper. i called several friends and neighbors through out south central ga spanning a radius of 100 miles in every direction and requested they all go outside and look west, they all seen it and were as stumped as i as too what it was. imagine the excitement of a real live ufo? finally i looked up 13wmaz.Com in the yellow pages and called the first three of 4 phone# s and nobody answered until i tried the last number, i simply said \"go outside and look west\" they replied they were looking at it and had the entire evening staff out there trying to figure out what it was. initially they were confident it was \"the comet\" but would check with ben jones station meteorologist and let us know the official conclusion. we had all kind of comet theories the next day and questions to go along, still do. the next evening ben jones while doing the 6:00 o'clock weather responded to the flood of inquiries the night before and stated he spoke with somebody who told him what we all seen was a rocket dumping fuel.\r\nwhy does a rocket have enough fuel to dump after he gets into space and would it not make more sense to only take enough fuel to get into space? that is only one of many questions. the tv station has made no more mention in any other newscast or on line forum about the ufo. i do believe it was some kind of man made craft, just have not ever seen anything that large, visible and behave like that...Anyway just wanted to share that with you, i felt it ironic considering we were discussing ufos.\"","distance":"Over One

\"stars\" and as i watched, they began to move first slightly and then almost playfully, back and forth and in circles.  i called to my neighbor who was on her deck and she walked over and also sighted the objects speculating it might be a satellite.  i told her i didn't think so, not two separate objects literally dancing around in the atmosphere.  she left and i continued to watch and within minutes there was suddenly at least six objects moving about in no particular pattern, like children playing circle tag!  i knew it couldn't be aircraft flying in such a frivolous manner, it was far too high for helicopters which also could not make such maneuvers so there was therefore only one explanation--et's.  i had no particular \"feelings\" while watching--i wouldn't expect anything that playful would be likely to be dangerous.  i wondered while i watched if they were seeing me far more clearly and just putting on a litle show for me!  i didn't lose sight but simply went inside and left them to their play time.\r\nthis is not the first \"sighting\" in my area by far.  my son says he saw four objects high in the sky at a nearby lake a week ago.  a group of us in my old

look at the sky. it was the perfect summer night. all i could hear were crickets, and the skies were clear. i was looking about 40 degrees up to the east, and that's when i saw it appear. it was such a shock to me that i can't tell if it rapidly decelerated to a speed at which it was visible (who knows?) or if it just \"turned on its lights\". i literally jumped in my seat! we've all seen meteors, they reach a point at which the friction and pressure of the atmosphere builds up heat which produces incandescent light that we see for usually no more than a fraction of a second. if this was a meteor, then i'm santa claus. it was already moving when it appeared (like a meteor), but its brightness didn't fade (the lights did pulsate, however), there was no rapid descent, and i was able to follow it to the horizon. fireballs have been visible over several states before they either impact the ground (or someone's unfortunate car), but this object wasn't as bright as jupiter, it left no trail, and nothing was seen breaking off of it. i could be one of the lucky few who have witnessed an earth-grazing fireball, but i doubt it. here's why: the object had red and white lights, but not lights as you'd expect to see on an aircraft. they weren't points of light; rather there was a center that was brighter than the periphery around it. that's the best i can explain it. the center part wasn't even that bright, but the smooth glow of the light around it really set it apart from anything i'd ever seen. this object definitely had some size to it. let's assume this was something entering the atmosphere. from my point of view, the apparent size of the object was no smaller than a commercial airliner at cruising altitude, possibly larger. i'm no expert on which altitudes objects start to glow at as they enter the atmosphere, but it has to be more than 40,000 feet, making this thing at least as big as an aircraft. there are lots of variables involved, but that seems logical to me. this thing had to have been seen on radar. it was going northward, possibly nnw. there was no sound whatsoever. if this was an aircraft, it would have to at least be going mach 1 at roughly 10,000 feet. that's as slow and as low as this thing could have been going. the higher up this thing actually was, the faster it was actually going. i should have been able to hear something if this was an aircraft. b-2's and f-117's are pretty quiet, but they're also subsonic. i don't know of any pilot who'd put his butt on his line just to fly at supersonic speeds over the continental us. that's a pretty big no-no. please call or email me if you have any questions, or if i'm flat-out wrong about something. thanks for looking into it for me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

according to heavensabove.Com, at 10:36:16, on 7/11,  there was a predicted iridium flare located at 11 degrees altitude, on the azimuth at 250 degrees wsw, at a -2 intensity/magnitude, due to occur about 86 km e of mesa, az. \r\n  ok, just made sure that zero misidentified i.Flares are even similar to what i just saw.  interesting...Anyways-i was on the computer on my patio when i had a strange feeling i'd forgotten something, and i looked at the clock and realized it was 10:37, and remembered the flare prediction for 10:36.  so i jumped up and found my bearings direction-wise, and looked right around where i'd assume the wsw to be.  the altitude was rather low-only listed at 11 degrees, so i tried to look almost straight ahead (i'm on the 2nd floor of my building), with the moon nearly directly overhead of where i tried to focus.  there are street lamps in the distance, barely higher than the roofs of the buildings i was overlooking, and-almost as soon as i had began to focus on this spot (that i believed to be 250 deg wsw, low 11 deg alt) i noticed orangish looking \"things\" kinda circling the orange street light.  \r\n  it really looked like the way large bugs do that you see circling clumsily around a large, parking lot-type light at nightime.  i had my binoculars and quickly looked at the street light and noticed not only 1, but 3 or 4 orange lit objects sharply circling this light (or so it appeared) at an amazing speed.  i mean like hows you see atoms(protons?) circling a nucleus in an animated example--kind of an eliptical pattern(right word?  an oval orbit moreso than a circular one), super sharp/quick at the turns yet more prolonged motion from end to end(of the turn)--it was incredible.  quickly gathering that this was no flare i yelled for my roommate to come out.  i put the binoculars down for a sec and glanced to see if he was coming, then looked up and saw them with my naked eye for a second, and put the binoculars back to my face.  these things were going around in all different directions, as in orbiting/circling from, say, top left of the light to bottom right and back-top right to bottom left-etc, yet they were all going the same unbelievable speed and the same motions.  i yelled back much louder for my roommate to come, and looked over again to see if he was comin, and when i looked back-they were gone.  unbelievable.

 after watching this for at least 5 minutes we heard the sound of jet engines approaching from the east.  suddenly a military fighter jet came into view heading directly at the red light.  three seconds before they merged the red light dropped an unlit secondary sphere which was only visible by the reflection from the main object's light.  the red light blinked off and was gone just as the jet passed it's location.  the secondary object could not be sighted.  the jet did a wing dip as if he was trying to re-aquire the target, he then made a right turn and departed the area heading east.  after a few minutes more the ups planes were back in line and the whole encounter was over.\r\n\r\n   there should be radar tapes of this encounter somewhere, and at least a few of the ups pilots had to have seen this as well as the fighter pilot.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":11517,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2775702,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07112008-0001","longitude":-85.7371847,"occurred":865666800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":865666800000,"summary":"Deep ruby red colored orb with detachable secondary sphere.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Kentucky/Louisville","timeZoneName":"America/Kentucky/Louisville","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Jeffersonville, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:360222"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Daytona Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Five ufos sighted, one cigar shaped and four flattened christmas ornament shaped, thicker than movie saucer shape anyway.  we live near moody and are both military brats, now middle age.  have seen a lot of planes and these were not planes.\r\nnoticed the cigar shaped one first and did not see others until i got out binoculars to look in that area, as they had some cloud cover.  with binoculars i could see the metal and steam-like haze around them.  excellent \"camo\"; we were impressed. one was huge.  could not believe it was real but metal could be seen with haze cover with binoculars.  without blended well with clouds.  had to have known to look.\r\nif i had not been very used to seeing planes, i would never have noticed the cigar shaped object.  i attempted pictures also but they did not turn out well.  i do not expect anyone to believe us, as beach folk were walking and did not appear to notice that we could see.\r\nmost eyes were on several groups of porpoises swimming northward close to the beach, one group after another that went on for about an hour before, during, and after the sighting.
