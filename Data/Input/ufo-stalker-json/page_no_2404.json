were at about 9800 feet above sea level.  when i first saw the pictures and the spot, i thought it was a spot on the lense or light refraction off the top of lembert dome. it couldn't be a spot on the lense since i took a few pictures in between the three that had the object and there was nothing on those.  i still think it could be light refraction off my camera lens but there is purple shadowing on the forest trees below us (in pictures #2 and #3) and there seems to be some density to the image.  it also looks like it is beaming down on the people in the photos.  no one saw or heard anything and my family thinks i'm silly to think it is anything but light refraction.  i just thought i'd ask (after all these years) and see what you guys think.  i am sending you the original photos,

there business. i had to turn left at the light, so i lost it. my son said it took off really fast! it really did look fake like the old 1950's ufo photo's that you see. but it was not fake. it was metal, i don't remember it being shiny though, it was dull like an old pie tin i guess. my son drew a picture of what he saw. his eyes are much better than mine and he actually saw the port holes on the thing. i tried to call the police that evening to report it, but they didnt really care. at arms length it was the size of a football.","distance":"21-100

enough to be a satellite. i stood and watched the object for about 15 minutes until it went out of range and i couldnt see it anymore. the strange thing was that at 05:12 in the morning there is usually traffic planes in the air, but this morning there wasnt any planes until the object was gone.\r\nnow im not sure what the object was. a real alien ufo or something else. but to me, sense i couldnt identify it, it really in all sense of the word was a ufo.

it was flying north to south, presumably out of dfw airport.  suddenly i saw a ball of light which appeared to be slightly behind and below the plane shoot forward extremely fast and get ahead of the plane. it turned red at the end and disappeared. my first thought was that it must have been a meteor. then i saw the light moving above the plane toward the back (it probably was a good distance away from the plane).  i lost sight of it again. i began to scan the sky and saw a red glowing object just hovering through the upper branches of some trees that were about 50 feet away to the southeast. this was much lower than when i had seen the ball of light. the object appeared darker, more solid, in the center with a see-through red glow.  it was more oval as i recall. it suddenly shot straight up, wobbled near the top of the flight, then stopped and hovered. when it shot up it was a ball of light with no hint of red. at some point it went rapidly north, stopped and hovered. then with no visible turn went rapidly south. a couple of time it went staight up and down making zig-zag moves on the way.  it made several maneuvers and i got the impression of it being defensive moves. it eventually took off to the northwest, going faster than a plane but nothing to compare with it's previous movement. i lost track of it as there were some thin clouds in that area. i knew of nothing to consider it but a ufo. the dfw naval air reserve base was about 10 miles to the northwest of me but this was certainly not like anything i had ever seen and i have lived in this area most of my

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Friends and i were at the site of an abandoned well, north, perhaps 4-5 miles, off hwy 62, between joshua tree and yucca valley (a mile or less east of yucca mesa road), far away from surrounding lights.  i don't recall any moon out that night.  i said july 15, but that's a guess.  somewhere in july or august, has to be about right, because it was still very hot, probably 95 degree f., that late at night, and the wind was hot, and characteristically out of the south for that time of year.  \r\n\r\ni was scanning the sky, when i thought i spotted a satelite, moving from south to north, nearly directly over us, perhaps 80 degrees up from the eastern horizon.  i had seen satellites in the night sky previously, and this was about as bright as those--though the ones i had seen previously had not been in polar orbit.  the others i'd seen moved from west to east--and moved at about the same speed in comparison to background stars.  \r\n\r\nas a child, when satellites were relatively new, i had learned to look for them at a summer camp.  a counselor had pointed one out to us, and it was not hard to see.  but it would have been hard to notice, without his use of a flashlight to illuminate the sky immediately surrounding it.  he pointed out that to be sure about it, you had to track its movement against the background stars.  \r\n\r\nhe said they could be spotted by someone who was patient and took the time to slowly scan the sky, stopping to focus on small patches, looking for movement among stationary objects.  i had spotted a couple of others over the many years intervening between that night in my childhood and this one.  i had also used the technique described to identify many obviously terrestrial aircraft, at a great distance over the many intervening years, far before friends ever spotted them.  the technique was automatic by then.  \r\n\r\ni was about to point out the \"satellite\" to the entire group, having spent a minute or more verifying what i was seeing, when a friend, r, asked me what i was looking at.  after he failed to spot it with me meerely pointing at it, i pointed it out to him--using a very bright, focused beam flashlight--and he also began tracking the progress of the light.  \r\n\r\nfrom the ground, it appeared slow, steady, traveling in a straight line, with a brightness slightly less than an \"average\" star, easily visible to the naked eye--though its motion against the background was not at all easy to see without use of the technique of gazing steadily at a small patch of sky, and looking for motion within that small area.  \r\n\r\nlike the others i'd seen previously, it was clearly there, clearly moving, slowly, in a straight line, against the background of the surrounding stars; but it would have been easy to miss, unless you just happened to look at or near it, and you were accustomed to viewing small patches of the night sky with particular attention to motion-detection.  r said he'd never have spotted it without my use of the \"flashlight-pointer.\"\r\n\r\na minute or so after r began watching it, a few other friends heard us talking about it, and i tried pointing it out with my outstretched arm, and finger, as i had done previously with r, but to no avail.  so i quickly hit the spot with my flashlight again, for the  second or two that it took to turn on the light and get it directly on the spot, leaving it there long enough to make it clear the target was in the middle of where the light had steadied.  i knew that the presence of that light would degrade night vision, so i kept exposure to that light as minimal as possible.  \r\n\r\nr and i had both acquired the target, and the light was not enough to make us lose it.  but the others never had a chance to acquire it.  as soon as the light was off, the little spot of light, still moving slowly, changed direction slightly.  before i had any chance to even think about that, it made what can only be called an instaneous acceleration, and simultaneoulsy began zig-zagging, appearing to increase its altitude as it made very sharp, pointed, zig-zags and its brightness dimished with the apparent increase in altitude, until it was no longer visible.  \r\n\r\nr and i turned to each other, mouths both agape.  we discussed what we saw, and what we both saw was what i just described.  our skins were crawling, because we knew what we had just seen was no damned satellite.  satellites don't change direction, even slowly like that one did, at first.  even while still moving slowly, that first change of direction was perhaps along the lines of 20 degrees right, relative to previous trajectory.  they also don't accelerate instantaneously, and they certainly don't then start to zig-zag.\r\n\r\ni tracked the object through perhaps 20-25 degrees of arc in the sky--using, as a rule of thumb, the horizontal width of a fully extended fist against the sky is 10 degrees.  r saw it for pehaps 60-70% of that travel.  the time from its first change of direction to its disappearance was 1-1.5 seconds.  from the time it started to zig-zag, to its disappearance was about a second, if not slightly less.  \r\n\r\nthe first, slow, change of direction didn't last long, maybe half a second before the first, severe change of direction occurred along with the instanteneous acceleration.  the next change was around 135 degrees right, farther still--which meant it reversed direction, and flew for a very short time in south-easterly direction, then it zigged and zagged, growing ever dimmer, until its disappearance.  there were perhaps 7-8 zigs and zags during this very short period, each around 90 degrees.\r\n\r\ni've often tried to describe verbally what i saw, never with much satisfaction.  so, i take the time to write it here, as precisely as i can.  it was like watching a pool ball bounce between opposing, but also converging banks on a pool table, speeding up as it went, not slowing down, and becoming smaller as it went.  of course, it wasn't becoming smaller, but dimmer, instead.  \r\n\r\nif one believes, as i do, that what i was watching was maintaining a steady size and brightness, but was only becoming dimmer due to increasing distance, the the apparent \"convergence of the banks on the pool table\" was an illusion similar to seeing railroad tracks converge in the distance.  my thoughts are that the zig-zag course was tightly maintained, in terms of the real distance traveled over each leg of any particular zig or zag.  of course, i have no way of verifying that.  \r\n\r\nas that light zig-zagged out of sight, it appeared circumscribed within an angle of about 30 degrees.  not 30 degrees of sky, but as if the banks on the table were spreading out from a point at about 30 degrees of angle. from the first, severe zig, to the side of the next zag was, maybe 2.5-3 degree of arc on the background sky--growing ever smaller with each succeeding course change.  the size of the patch of sky would be around that of your thumbnail, or slightly smaller, extended at arms length against the night sky \r\n\r\nas i said, none of the others got a chance to see it.  about 7 or 8 years later i learned that r, who i hadn't seen in during the preceding 4-5 years, was deceased.  he had signed up for a 6 year stint in the armed services; and, tragically he had taken his own life while on duty.  so there is no surviving witness to this event, save myself, and one or two others who heard us talk about it, but didn't see it themselves.  in fact, 2 of the other 3 or 4 people who were present are also deceased--those two of more natural causes.\r\n\r\ni know what i saw is not something explainable as some damned experimental aircraft of ours or anyone's on this planet.  not unless someone has the ability to take an object with volume and convert it into an object without mass or structure that would be torn apart by the forces of inertia that would have been generated in those severe and pointed changes in course.  any living things inside such a craft would splattered like bugs on a windshield.  it was also no natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\ndo i make a big deal about it?  no. only after i know someone very well, and if he or she brings up issues about ufo's will i venture to mention this one instance.  do i think this event had anything to do with r's death?  i couldn't say for sure, but i doubt it.  talking with mutual friends and acquaintances, it appears r had issues i'd have never known about involving an absolutely horrendous childhood.  childhood friends of his told me about them after his death when i was so mortified to hear of his suicide.  \r\n\r\ni suppose i should mention one other instance. it was about 1974, i was about half way between joshua tree and twentynine palms, in the same general area, exept i was north of hwy 62 this time, about .6 mile--i was at our family's weekend retreat--so i know exactly how far that is off the highway.  it was mid-to-late spring.  a friend (j--who i haven't seen virtually since that time, though i'm sure a few times after that day) and i were outside.  the sky was clear and blue.  it was, pehaps 3:30 in the afternoon.  we were looking around with 7 power binoculars.  i think i was using his, which were 7x35 wide-angles, and he was using mine, which were 7x50 regular view, though i couldn't swear to that.\r\n\r\nwe were spootting aircraft, mostly, and tracking them across the sky, also birds, and also land-based objects at great distance.  i was looking north-westerly when i spotted something in the glasses that i couldn't identify.  i've never had any idea what it might have been.  it appeared to be something in the sky that was just slightly brighter (slightly whiter) than the surrounding sky.  it's shape was \"fuzzy.\"  it had no distinct edges, though it's overall size and shape remained constant. it was eliptical, perhaps twice as long as wide.  it was easy to track, moving downwards at about 30 degrees of angle, from west to east across the sky.  \r\n\r\ni tracked it probably across 60-75 degrees of arc through the sky.  i had been watching it for about 1.25-1.5 minutes, all the while trying to imagine what it might be, and trying to focus the glasses very slowly, for a better view, but fuzzy was the best it got.  i had made overall adjustments of focus that suggested it was getting slowly closer.  then, it changed directions, making what i'd call about a 115 degree shift in flight path, to the right.  i was still tracking one way, when it went the other, which meant it went quickly down, backtracking slightly on itself, and out of my view.  \r\n\r\nthat shift astonished me.  i couldn't say if it changed speed.  i lost it too fast to know.  i tracked one way, and it zigged the other, instaneously, like on a dime.  considering the small angle of view, wide-field or not, it was lost too quickly to say anything about a change in speed.  i couldn't think of anything that would be able to make such a turn, except maybe some sort of raptor, but this was no bird.  i was not able to spot it again.  \r\n\r\n(and, writing this now, one thought from \"science fiction\" occurs to me.  what if it was something like the \"switch-blade\" jet in the \"i spy\" movie with eddie murphy and owen wilson?  something with an almost perfect invisibility cloak?  something like a technological chameleon, or some of the sea creatures that change their appearance to mimic their surrounding areas?  a clear, blue sky wouldn't be too tough to immulate.  just a thought)\r\n\r\ni thought maybe i'd been seeing a relection of the sun off one or both of the lenses--which was no viable explanation.  the sun was west of us when i started tracking it, also to the west, but the sun was always somewhat behind my head, in the southern sky, and as i tracked this object over to the eastern part of the sky, that such a reflection could have stayed constantly there producing and anchanging apparition, if such a reflection had ever been there at all, became totally implausible.\r\n\r\ni don't recall what i was viewing or might have been seeking to view when i first noticed it.  after a few moments, thought the desire was great, i knew trying to point it out to j would have been futile--it was in such a small patch of sky, and moving, and so hard to distinguish even with the best focus possible.  i knew if i tried pointing to it, i'd have to take my eyes and glasses off it, and that would be that.  it was not something anyone could have spotted with the naked eye.  \r\n\r\ni had the impression it was within a mile or less, but that's more due to the quickness of it's movement across that much apparent sky, and to the focus used on the glasses than it is to having any sense of scale about the object.  it was against nothing but sky, and nothing else ever came into those few degrees of view to provide any scale.  \r\n\r\nuntil the object changed directions abruptly, i was still trying to keep it steady in the field of view and feeling great curiosity about what it was.  after the change of direction, it dawned on me, that \"technically\" anyway, i'd just seen a ufo.  i thought about the sun, or other sources of reflection, but was unable to explain anything other than i had been watching something real that turned abruptly, and i then lost it.  i told j about it, but i made little of it to anyone else.  \r\n\r\nif what i at first saw as a \"satellite\" is a 7.5 on my \"richter\" scale of amazing things, this \"slightly whiter patch of sky\" thing is, maybe a 3.0 to me.  i only mention it because it involved an instantaneous, sharp, angular change in course, of which i'm  certain, and it occurred in the same general area, though more than 5 years previously.\r\n\r\ni've heard joshua tree, giant rock, and that whole morongo basin are supposed ufo hotspots.  i've been going out there since the early 1950's.  i've always been facinated by the night sky.  other than someone who's lived out there for many years, i probably have more time watching that sky than any casual visitors to the area you'll ever find.  and i have those two incidents to tell about.\r\n\r\nthe first incident made me wonder just what the heck i'd been seeing, and made me wonder if, perhaps, i'd seen something otherwordly.  but, i didn't take it too seriously.  the second incident left me with little doubt of it.  unless we have technology so secret that we've never used it (and it would be foolish and pointless to go to the massive expense of developing unused technology that advanced), the technology needed to produce that satellite incident was advanced way beyond anything we had then or have now.  \r\n\r\nnothing but wildly advanced and intelligently applied technology could have produced that satellite incident, at least, not so, in my opinion.  the movements were far too precise and controlled to have occurred naturally or by any sort of chance.  perhaps r and i, a few hundreds of years ago, could have grunted to each other about \"the gods,\" maybe even built a shrine or something.  not today, or even 30 years ago.\r\n\r\nwell, that's it, for what it's worth.  just thought i should share it with people who have more time than i do to attempt investigating this stuff.  hope it helps.  good luck.  you'll need, and i hope you have, it.","distance":"Over One

there looking out the window next to my bed (a large casement window 5'x5'  & faces due north & gives me a panoramic view of the sky beyond the tree line at the back of our property) i saw a small gray cloud off in the distance. the rest of the sky was clear, no other clouds, & you could still see the stars. as i stared out at the sky i noticed the small cloud was moving closer in my direction at a very slow speed. the closer it got the more it didn't look like a cloud & began to take a definite shape, that of an elongated hexagon, dark gray in color just a shade darker then the backdrop of the sky. i could not say how high it was because there was nothing in the foreground to compare it to.  also, this object was very large, which made it very hard to tell its size or how high it was. if i had to guess, i would say if it was at an altitude of about 600 ft, its size was well over 100 ft. wide & long, with two of the sides slightly longer.  if it was at an altitude of about 1000 ft., this thing was immense. as i got out of bed & went to the window (which was open) i noticed there was no sound coming from it, although it was only about 400 to 500 ft. from the back of my property, but because of its altitude i could still only see the bottom.  at that point it began to make a right hand turn toward the west & continued doing almost a 180 degree turn.  however it did not turn on a flat plane, but dipped slightly as it turned. i have never seen anything turn like that. the only way i could describe it was a very fluid sliding turn.  as it turned, i could see that above the bottom there was a single rectangular light panel or window on each of its sides, i am assuming all sides, but i only saw three as it turned. these windows or panels were very dimly lit, just a shade lighter then the backdrop of the sky & i could not make out any framework or detail above. after the turn it went back at about a 15 degree angle from the direction it came & went a short distance, made another right turn, & came back along the same line it originally came on toward the south.  it must have been gaining altitude because it started to look smaller. from the time it was over my back yard until it made its final turn, was less then a minute or so, but seemed like eternity. all i could think was \"i can't be seeing this\" or \"its not really happening\"!  as it approached & was just about to cross over our house, it got distorted like looking across a hot asphalt road or something giving off a lot of heat like a grill, & then it was gone! by the time i got out my front door on the other side of the house, there was nothing but clear sky, stars, & not a cloud in sight.  running to the front door woke my wife up (she sleeps in another bedroom because i snore) i said to her, \"you won't believe what i just saw\"!  and she didn't!.\r\n\r\np.S. the following day, june 4, 2008, i called our local newspaper the intelligencer, to see if anyone called about seeing anything strange in the sky the night before. they said they hadn't received any, but put a reporter on the phone (freda r. savana, who covers my area). she wanted to know why i asked, did i see something i wanted to talk about? i told her basically what i wrote above, but did not give her my name. i told her i might call back in a few weeks to see if anyone else called to report something similar to what i saw. i decided to file this report with mufon, when i saw an article in the paper & newscast on channel 3, about people reporting seeing strange crafts in bucks county, pa. i am including my name & contact numbers, but want to be assured my identity will be kept strictly confidential at this time. the only people that know of this incident are my immediate family, & i would

about 5:15 pm and we were turning right onto old coleridge rd off of manor rock rd., when we witnessed what looked like an enormous solid black v hovering in the shallow valley area, over the back side of the ridge i live on. sitting in the back seat was xxxx, she is a federal agent and she had a clear view of the object at hand. i was sitting in the passenger seat and took the pictures through the vehicle since i still had my camera around my neck from taking pictures earlier in the afternoon. xxx was driving and didn't see anything but the road ahead! i've included the two photos that i took, once i realized we were seeing something unusual.  i could see the objects as they began dispersing very quickly in different directions. xxxx was straining to see the larger object, to closer identify it before loosing sight because of the tree line. as we were rounding the bend in the road, i witnessed an object shooting away to the south at incredible speed, as we turned back into viewing range the large object was gone, but several smaller objects in various shapes and sizes appeared and disappeared as they dispersed in different directions. there was one bird in the air at the time.  xxxx could not conclusivly identify the large object.\r\n \r\ni believe that the valley behind my property is a \"hot spot\" for some reason. this is my first hardcore visual sighting of the object(s) that seem to be attracted to our area.\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

overlooking sebago lake to smoke a ciggarette. i noticed what looked like an extremely bright star, but then realized it couldn't have been a star as i had never, ever seen one this bright. i grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look - it was hard to see cuz it was night time but i could see the object was like 2 white orbs on top of each other, and it was hovering stationary over the lake! there was no noise. all of a sudden, a red orb appears directly below the white orb and starts flying around at incredible speed. i watched for several seconds in disbelief and then ran upstairs to grab my camera, which has a crappy video mode also. i was able to capture about 15 seconds (the limit on my camera) of the red orb (the white one wasn't easily visible against the backdrop of the stars). i could tell the two objects were miles away, but the red orb moved across the lake in a split second - it must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. soon afterwards the red orb appeared to go above the white, stationary orb and then disappeared from view. i was shocked. the video attached is very low quality and only the red orb is visible moving around. i have no idea whether this was a camera defect but it was not a firefly - that was what i thought originally until it was obviously acting under intelligent control and interacting with the white orb.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional
