(north tampa) florida on bruce b. downs super walmart.\r\n\r\ni was walking out of walmart, and i saw a bubble... so i thought. at first it seemed to be about 25 feet off the ground and about 50' ahead of me. i kept walking toward it to where my car was... and as i stared at the bubble i wondered \"how would one lone bubble survive out here too long? i walked... expecting to see it burst any second. it didn't. as i watched it... i then saw it wasn't a bubble at all as it started to get almost above me. i stood next to the car. \r\n\r\nit had been cloudy and drizzy... and there was a low canopy of clouds. i noticed it had two round looking lights and a lighter third. nothing blinking. the lights were very clear... not like you'd expect headlights on a plane. i listened for sound... and heard nothing. then i suspected i was seeing something unusual. i then checked... and true nothing blinking... and watched and made study that the lights were not real bright but were very pronounced... without halo or atmospheric glaring quality. the blueish roun lights seem to be directional... as like laser light travels, defined. then as it started to get over walmart... and by then i knew it was not a plane or chopper. i hoped it was a black triangle and i watched to see something that would reveal it. then... it slowed down very gradually... and before it had a chance to stop... it ascended straight up. i appeared to have traveled fast up than it had since i spotted it. as it moved up, the position of the lights stayed fixed... meaning that it didn't turn nose up to ascend. it went up what looked like around 1000' until it pierced the cloud cove and disappeared.  no noise.I detected no shape to it... but the lights suggested a triangle. a plane climbing like that would have made noise. this thing moved silent and very smoothly. it matched the triangle video taped at zephyrhills a couple months ago... very close... minus the blinking read light. i'm glad i saw it... because now i know they are real. i immediately text messaged a friend to time stamp the sighting. i did a photoshop of what i saw attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

unbeliveable and mind boggling. here is what happened.\r\nwhile staying at a cottage for a small family gathering we hopped on the family pontoon boat. it was around the 4pm hour. this lake is very small and is surrounded by small cottages and a farm. as we spun around for our second around the lake i saw what looked like a blackish grey triangle shaped fighter jet come banking out of the tree line from the west. because i thought i was seeing things, i nudged the person sitting next to me and pointed to the object now flying towards the north. what they said was \"i hope its not iraqi\". what was so odd besides a black fighter triangle jet basically coming out of the trees in front of us in the middle of nowhere, was that there was no noise from the plane or object. there was no markings, lights, windows. it happened just like that and it was gone. also, what was interesting is that it came out of the tree line on a tilted angle so i was looking at it as a whole object. it was not shiny, it was dull and flew at a very high speed.\r\n \r\nlater on that evening around 9:30 pm, i decided to go sit on the now docked on the pier pontoon boat and take pictues of the moon in the west. i was out there for awhile taking pictures while the rest of the family was on the shore. my cameras were not taking good pictures because it was getting dark so i brought them inside the house. i decided to go sit back on the boat and enjoy the millions of stars that were now in the sky.\r\n \r\nas i sat facing north i turned my attention to the east sky because i noticed what looked like a huge white light blinking on and off as well as smaller orange starlike lights blinking on and off and moving around. at first i thought it may be a plane and or fireworks. but it wasnt, this blinking white light then blinked on and moved towards the smaller orange lights that kept moving into several foramtions. triangles, squares. in the binculors these lights looked like they were 4 dots that formed a square. while this was happening, then some of these orange lights started moving to the north tree line away from the formation. as these orange lights made there way to the tree line other orange lights appeared from the tree line as though they were meeting. then all of a sudden these orange lights dropped what was an object atleast 3 times its size from itself. these objects were glowing red and had 3 parts to them. the glowing red pulsating objects were dropped into the trees. as they dropped inside the tree they got smaller and turned white. they just hovered there. another one of these pulsating lights just hovered over the tree line. i was going crazy in awe, alittle scared and trying to watch two seperate sightings at once!! thats when my friend came to see me on the boat. i pointed to this pulsating red object over the tree line and it started moving to the other formation still going on in the east. my friend saw this and got scared and left. this was so crazy!!!!\r\n\r\njust as this red pulsating light went into the other foramtion all the lights in that formation just went crazy and started moving around and made more formations. then from behind me i see what i thought were 3 helicopters flying in a straight line towards this formation in the east. these objects were red, orange and yellow and made no noise. i thought this is it and really got scared!!!!!!\r\nthe first one of these objects stopped dead just before it reached this light formation in the east. the other 2 objects that were following all melted into this first object and then it proceeded to join the formation in the east. it started fading into a smaller orange light. this foramtion slowly faded almost one by one light until it was gone. the other lights in the north were still there and also in the trees as it seemed like they were watching. \r\n\r\nplease note that this was a family gathering and there were many children there and were kept unaware. at least 2 other adults witnessed something and we kept it under wraps because we did not want to scare them. this was the most incredible, amazing and scary experience ever!!!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional

had been abducted it was only once. however, while doing some work on the gps trails for fishing i got another shock. i had found a way to put the trails on my map program. the map of upper carlyle lake had an odd pattern on it, a rapidly moving curve that takes me over the railroad track and back! as i looked at it, i remembered that when i had gone under the bridge i had stopped and opened a map. what i had seen was that there were many stumps sticking out of the water and i needed to find the main channel and as much as possible follow it. \r\n\r\nsuddenly, without any memory of getting there, i found myself well into the lake section going in the wrong direction. i was quite confused. i remember waving my hands up and down. because i was unsure, as to what side of the bridge i was on. i got the map out again and a compass straightened myself out and inexplicably proceeded to suppress the seemingly sudden position change. i then got back to exploring and fishing the area. the date was october 28, 1999. this date came from my fishing log. this is the only time i fished in this area of carlyle lake in a boat.\r\n\r\n i do not remember anything about the trip over the tracks, which requires the boat to be airborne! when i looked at the trail on the map the memory of the position change came back as if unlocking a safe and seeing a long forgotten item. as time went by, i remembered more details of the position change. \r\n\r\nthe degree on confusion and disorientation is reflected in what i did. a compass is not needed on the north side of carlyle���s railroad bridge. all one has to do is to line the map up with the bridge. i should have known what side of the bridge i was on by the many stumps sticking above the water. how someone can suppress an event of this magnitude i do not know but in several of the cases i have read about this is exactly what happens. as in these incidents, it took many months or over a year before something jarred my

discoveries regarding the human dillemma of this planet- i had also came to the solid conclusion that the extra terrestrial presence is very much a reality. in late march, i was driving home from arroyo seco [mountain village on highway 150] to my home in des montes. the topic of extraterrestrials came up during our ride, and almost simultaneously my co-worker pointed to a flashing orb hovering over the taos metropolitan area. this did not come as a surprise, but it sure was exciting. we spotted several of these lights surrounding the taos county airport on the mesa, and proceeded to drive there. when we arrived to the airport, as if it were all just a mirage, they \"turned off\", nowhere to be seen. to our dissapointment, we left. along our way home, we decided to stop at the rio grande gorge bridge. after sitting in the car for several minutes we saw a similiar orb \"turn on\", and moved in ways that defied \"common logic\". from this orb emerged three, it literally split into three. a strong energy seemed to surround us, enveloping our physical body in waves of essence. symbols began appearing in my mind, i then understood that these lights were not only extra terrestrial, they are extra dimensional. going home amazed, i felt a sense that i would see \"them\" again. sure enough, i have had countless et experiences since this time, if anything i say the presence is increasing in visibility and connection to myself, and those around me. i don't know too much about my new friends in the skies, but i do know that they are there because i can simply feel their presence. they leave my younger brothers gifts, as well as myself and my girlfriend. countless witnesses to this local phenomenon are gradually evolving telepathically, emotionally, and mentally. many are getting in touch with the star brothers themselves, many are channeling extra terrestrial viewpoints and perspectives. this includes the pleiadians, andromedans, sirans, and other benevolent et civilizations. i am willing to assist anyone who desires to educate themselves with the true knowledge of the universe. our higher self is our greatest teacher! \r\n\r\nct- new

it happened. \r\nat 11 pm edt, my friend tom b. called me and requested that i go out side with the phone and look up in the sky to the east. he said he was viewing two big amber or orange globe-like lights moving slowly across the sky toward the southeast. i did as he requested but my view was blocked by trees. as i attempted to get a better look, tom informed me over the phone that they had just vanished \"into thin air.\"  he said he had stepped out of his front door just before eleven and saw the lights above the apartments across from his. tom said they were large, dime sized globes, amber or orange in color about 1000 feet apart and low in the sky. they were making no sound and moving very slowly. he then called me and watched as they moved to the southeast sky and vanished without warning. he said they were round and globe-like and definitely not like anything he had ever seen before. later, we learned that another person living several blocks away had seen them as well. it should be noted here that tom also lives further down the street from me, about 200 yards away toward the east.\r\nwhile telling this story to my friend rick d. this morning, he informed me that he and his mother had seen apparently the same or similar globe lights on the evening of june 19 at about 9:30 pm and these lights were directly over their heads in the back yard. they were exactly the same in description and completely silent. they were stationary and then moved slowly to the north and then suddenly changed color to a glowing white and zoomed off at intense speed to the north and out of sight. this occurred on a street to the north of mine in east palestine. another person know to my friend sighted the same lights that night of june 19 north of town by the water tower. all witnesses said they were taken by surprise and all said that these \"globes\" were impossible to confuse with any craft they were familiar with. they also said that these objects were more like some kind of lights and not like anything resembling crafts. rick and his mother, who observed them directly overhead said they looked like transparent amber globes but intensely bright. all the witnesses i have spoken to are willing to tell their stories and reveal their indentities to any

to go out. we were driving to a place called red rock crossing, and i was taking photos of the mountain landscapes out the window along our drive. i had my camera set to \"sports\", so it can capture images while moving wihtout blurring them. the next day, i uploaded my photos to my computer and was looking at them, to weed out the good shots and delet the crappy ones. anyway, in one shot, i noticed a werid diamond shaped cloud, and a weird rectangle to the left with what looked like a rectangle shadow above it and to the right. i went into photoshop and brought up the contrast to try and see the weird shapes more clearly, and cropped them. i emailed them to some about 5 people, one who is an astronomer, and nobody knew what it was. nobody knew. but, the last night of my trip, my brother had a party. i showed the photo to some locals and one guy told me to turn the photo sideways (landscape to the right) and zoom in to the diamond, becuase he said some \"ships\" fly sideways. sure enough, it looks like a saucer!!!!!!!!! alos, i noticed more rectangles in the shot to the right. the upper right sectoion and another one really low to the horizon on the right. there are some shadows of dots, but that might just be birds or something.  anyway,  the diamond shape is clearly not a cloud. the craziest thing is i never even saw them when i took the photo. of course, the window was down so i had ind in my eyes, and i wasn't lookng for weid objects when i took the photo. aftter the party night, i couldn't sleep wel and woke up from 2 \"nighmares\" becuase i was scared f aliens. i thought i saw people walking in the room i was staying in, but they were dreams. sometimes i think i see people or weird see throguh things in my room when i am in that weird in between realm between sleep and wakefulness. i have always been interested in ufo stuff, and had some dreams years and years ago. but honestly, i haven't thought abotu it in years, and i wasn't thinking about ufos or aliens on this trip...Until i saw the weid phtoo. i can hardly believe i took that shot! so, pleae investigate the photos or yourself and let me know what you find out.  i can email you the original phtoo wihotuu the contrast and cropping. but i am at my friends house in atlanta and my computer won't get online, so i had to send the email versions i emailed he form my

right (east) and saw an orange oval shaped light moved in a downward angle. it stopped and just sat there. i originally thought it to be a plane coming out of dia and that the angle was just an optical illusion. but then it stopped and just sat in place. i tried to judge the distance and i put it over about 104th and federal or maybe 104th and washington. i sat there watching it and it faded out for a moment and then came back in the same location. a second light (identical to the first) swooped in from the right hand side very quickly and stopped instantly, directly next to the first light in a vertical line. at this point, i had my wife start looking for the video mode on our camera. directly following, a third light appeared coming in the same manner as the second (same approach pattern, same direction, same speed. it stopped suddenly next to the other two lights and the three lights formed a vertical line. after about a minute of them sitting in a line. the first light moved in a circular pattern over the second light and the third light moved in between the two lights. it would be similar as the first and third light were chasing each other or 'playing tag' as the second light sat motionless. by this time, i had just gotten the second camera out of the car and started trying to take a video. the battery was dead on the camera so it shut off on me as the first and third light moved off in the direction the lights had originally come from. i managed to get the camera to work for a few seconds and caught the third light as it was leaving. unfortunately, when reviewing the video, it simply looks like an orange light in the distance just turned off.\r\n\r\nnow, i can't really say what the objects were but i can tell you what it wasn't. currently, there are no aircraft that can move like that, to my knowledge. they moved very quickly, in tight patterns, and stopped instantly. i can tell you it wasn't distant fireworks, because they cant stay in the air and form perfect vertical lines. i can tell you it wasn't a spotlight of any kind because the lights were orange in color and very bright (indicating they were powered units) unlike a spotlight which just reflects off of cloud cover and can only be seen brightly on a cloudy night.\r\n\r\nanyway, i am hoping that out of the thousands of people outside watching fireworks in that area on july 4th, that someone caught it on video and just hasn't come forward with it yet.","distance":"Over One

back at the sink wich faces a set of trees and back pasture as i looked out the window i was admiring the large full moon through the trees when it dawned on me that we had just had a full moon the week befre so as i looked closer i realized it was slowly moving through the trees i was very excited and ran to wake up my boyfriend who was sleeping on the couch at the time.He got up and looked out proceeded to tell me it was a helicopter in the short amount of time it took me to reach him and return to the window no more than 20 feet there and back it was over our house we have a round circular turn around in our yard with trees in the middle maybe 10 trees in a small cluster where you can go around to get out of our yard anyway i could see this totally silent craft hovering above with multi colored lights on it.I just stood there watching this thing for the next half hourand suddenly i just went to bed.This is where things get crazy in the morning i woke up after having wild realistic dream of 3 aliens (grays )by my bed then going up in ufo then nothing.I honestly thought it was just a dream but when i got to work that morning i was not feeling right my face felt puffy like sunburn and i never go out in sun because i work inside all day and it felt like a red hot poker had been stuffed up my nose and my left ear hurt later when i got home i inserted q-tip in my left ear which had blood on iti kept that q-tip for the longest time just for proof to myself. also when i took a bath that night my whole body stung when i got in the hot water and for a couple weeks after and when i put my hands in cold water it literely felt like my skin was peeling off and my skin would welt up where the water hit it like acid or something and last of all my hair started turning gray more like white at 38yrs old never had it before i have new white hair growth out the side of my head that was facing object its now 5 inches long mixed in with my real hair very strange.I dont understand what happened but without a doubt something did and now im afraid they are goung to come back someday to take back what ever they put in me.I want to go be hypnotized but maybe not rembering

grange hall road. i was coming back from dropping off a volunteer that i work with at an art center in davison. i didn't drink anything and wasn't on any medication or illegal drugs. i was drinking soda and i didn't feel that tired even though it was late. \r\nmy speed was slower than the posted limit, about 45 on mph, and my brights on. i do this so i can be prepared when a deer decides to cross my path. no other vehicles were present.\r\n\r\nas i was driving, i slowed down because there appeared to be a very large \r\ncreature digging in someone's trash next to the right sight of the road. \r\nit was located 20-25 feet away from my car. i began to slow down to get a better look. this thing was really tall and too huge to be any 'average' animal that i normally see in roadside trash bins at night. my first thought that came to mind was, \"what is it??\" i remember calling out words of animals in my head to determine what this thing could be. i thought, \"rat no to big..Kangaroo? its grey! red eyes..Rabbit..No.Not a cat..It jumps and leaps kind of like a rabbit...I don't know what i'm looking at..Can't be a chupacabra??..Could it..In michigan??\"\r\n\r\nthis creature was holding a piece of trash..Didn't appear to have paws..\r\nmore slender hand-like. it had huge, round and red glowing eyes. \r\nit reacted and looked kind of surprised to see me as if it thought\r\nno one will ever find out that it existed. that was my impression.\r\nit's eyes just stared at my vehicle while holding onto a piece of\r\ntrash for nearly 4 seconds. its triangular like grey face reminded \r\nme of a dog but it was more pointer and triangular towards the end \r\nof the nose and mouth. its presence didn't seem ordinary and those\r\ngigantic glowing red eyes made me feel something was out of \r\nplace here.\r\n\r\nit's ears were large and rounded sort of like a mouse. its arms\r\nwere bendable and closer to its body then its long flexible legs. \r\nthe body was heavier in the bottom and kind of \r\nreminded me of a kangaroo body but he was completely grey. maybe, \r\ngrey short haired fur i am not sure, but the body was definitely \r\ngrey in color. it had a skinny tail that was similar in appearance\r\nto a rat's tail but it was much longer and slightly wider. i barely \r\nnoticed the creature's tail until it maneuvered out of the way from the\r\ngarbage can. \r\n\r\nin summary, this is the way the creature reacted when i came upon it.\r\ni noticed the creature digging in the garbage and it was holding\r\na piece of trash. it stared at me for 3-4 seconds then dropped the\r\ntrash forcefully like a human would with both hands. it was\r\nstanding upright and appeared to be over 3 feet tall in height. \r\nthe creature bent down to the ground and jumped forward on all fours \r\nthen got up a bit and turn to the left to aim for the woods. it \r\nreached for the ground again with its front arms and jumped forward \r\nwith its back legs swinging in front of it like a rabbit. \r\n\r\nthe creature didn't make any sounds that i could hear even with my windows\r\nopen and it didn't try to attack me or hiss at me. when the event\r\nwas over i wanted to turn around and find out what that thing was.\r\ni knew that would not be a good idea. my gut tells me that this\r\nthing had to be a chupacabra. i looked up a chupacabra on the\r\ninternet the next day discovered a photo that was taken by\r\na rancher in 2004 that shot and killed one. the creature in that\r\nphoto looked very similar to the one i witnessed, except, the dead\r\nanimal had less flesh on its bones and i couldn't see slender hands but\r\nit was hard to tell from the photo. i was planning on getting some \r\nland so i could let my pet cat out at night but now there is a change \r\nof plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11461,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.8017727,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072008-0002","longitude":-83.6181155,"occurred":1215258060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1215258060000,"summary":"Strange

spotted a reddish object, top to bottom in length more so than side to side, in the distance that was alone in the horizon apart from any other stars, moon, or sun -- on the lefthand side (sw from hwy 71).  it appeared to be larger than the planet mars when viewable but as mentioned, longer from top to bottom.  it was very discernable from any trees or building objects and was viewable unobstructed for the full duration of 5-7 minutes (along with the next object) .  after spotting the object, i then noticed what apparantly was a plane following the same direction with a short vapor trail that was obviously a reddish coloration very distinct from the typical white.  it was easily in contrast of the bluish near dusk sky.  it continued in the same direction of the initial object (for aproximately 3-5 min.) and eventually became smaller to the point that it became the same size as the initial object.  as mentioned, it was intially spotted to be similar to your typical plane with a vapor trail, only distinctly reddish in color and shorter in length.  the trail maintained existance until the object eventually became the same size as the initial object and then disappeared.  this was far and beyond any interpretation of a plane with its vapor trail or any other way of the sun reflecting off the coloration of a white vapor trail.  it was extremely distinct and short in length almost to the point of a large flame projecting from the object as opposed to vapor trail.

balls about seeing ufos cause i'm basically a fanatic and am constantly looking, but anyway, i go outside and sure enough i saw something. at first, i thought it was just a helicopter going to one of the local hospitals in the area cause at night, they tend to fly by with red and white lights. however, this was no helicopter for it made no sound. i continued to watch this ufo and its red and white lights. it either remained stationary or moved very slowly. then, all of a sudden, another one of these red and white lighted objects appeared. i could not make out the size or shape of them, but it was basically in a horizontal pattern of red, white, red. before i knew it, there were four of these objects, some of which were moving around almost doings laps, some of which did not. i went walking around to get a better view and then i saw one very huge white lighted object almost coming toward me getting brighter and brighter before it just disappeared. when this object disappeared, the red and white ones did so too. for my first ufo sighting, it was quite incredible.\r\n\r\njune 25, 2008: i figured maybe what i saw last night could turn out to be like a \"scranton lights\" kind of thing the next, so i went outside around 10:00pm and sure enough, i saw saw something again...Only this time, i saw just one red and white lighted object over by where the scranton/wilkes-barre international airport is. it remained stationary for a while. then, the freakiest part of it all, i saw a plane heading in the airport/ufo's direction and thought to myself, this could be very interesting. i wish i could have been that pilot. anyway, as the plane was approaching the airport/ufo, what looked like a shooting star, passed almost through the plane out of nowhere. then, the ufo over the airport disappeared and another red and white light object flew over my house only to disappear in the distance. was that shooting star thing a shooting star or was it ufo related? i really think it was the latter. it was insane to see.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11457,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.416209,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062008-0017","longitude":-75.6564222,"occurred":1214370000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1214370000000,"summary":"Ufo

greenville michigan, i stepped outside with my canon eos 40d digital camera to catch some images of storm clouds and possibly some rotation from the approaching storm. i took several digital images of the storm clouds before being forced inside by the heavy rain and wind gusts from the storm. my only intensions were to capture digital images of the storm and nothing else. after the storm left the area, i took the compactflash card from my camera and inserted the card into my card reader in my computer. i downloaded the digital image files into adobe photoshop cs3 bridge. i took the compactflash card out of the card reader and put the card back into my canon eos 40d camera and reformatted the compactflash card for storage of new digital images.\r\n\r\non the afternoon of july 5, 2008, i started to review the digital images from the storm from the afternoon of july 2, 2008. as i started to enlarge each digital image file, i noticed an odd object that appeared on the right side of the trees across from the condos near my apartment. i enlarge the object trying to see if i could make out what the object was. i sat at my computer and stared at my lcd display in total disbelief. then i started to check other digital images taken about the same time and i found another object near the storm clouds in another file. i enlarged that one and found an object that appears to be coming out from one of the storm clouds.\r\n\r\ni had no intentions of trying to capture digital images of strange objects in the sky as my original intent was only to try to capture interesting cloud formations to send into one of our local television stations in our area. these photos are 100% original and we not altered in any way except for cropping and enlarging the images to try and determine what they actually were. i know this object is not a conventional aircraft anyone around this area has observed before. i have my own impression as what this object appears to be but as of now, i will not divulge my thoughts to anyone until further study has been completed.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11454,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.1775314,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062008-0014","longitude":-85.2527987,"occurred":1215036060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1215036060000,"summary":"Object
