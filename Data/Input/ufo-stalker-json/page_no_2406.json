(i've had others) anyway, the guy sought me out because he said he had been seeing ufos in albany ny, one he said was manta shaped, but turned up as a cloud when he took a photo. i was suspect of his sightings for several reasons, but to make a long story short, he also has a camp here on the lake and called me the day before this particular photo was taken- to tell me that he was also seeing and  taking ufo shots here on the lake and was \"vectoring in\" the craft. i was ready to write him off mainly because he said an et was watching him from the balcony across the street from his apartment, and because he also told me that the ets were \"aware of me\"... then, the next day, shooting pictures on my beach, this turns up. huh. needless to say, i no longer throw out the baby with the bath water. i was amazed and am still, a year later, a little spooked. thanks, brett allen-former pyx106 disc jockey with a number one show on the number one albany ny radio station.

200 yards off the freeway and about 100 yards off the ground. she said, 'what is that!?', and i replied, 'i don't know'. she slowed down a bit,  we kept watching this thing moving around in the air, and i took two photos with my iphone. eventually, we passed it, but decided we should turn around and go look at it again. we exited, went over the overpass, and got back on the 5 south. again, we saw the lights moving around off in the distance, and got off the freeway at exit 379. we crossed the overpass again, headed towards the onramp to the 5 north and pulled off. i was scrambling around trying to find our camera, my wife was calling a friend of hers, and i eventually found a little flip cam video camera with which i began filming the object. unfortunately, the camera was just about full, so i only got about 23 seconds of footage. then, i started looking for our still camera again, but wasn't able to find it, so we just kept watching this thing. i got out of the car to use the restroom, and kept watching it. i looked down for a second, and when i looked back up, the object was gone.\r\ni would describe this thing as triangular in shape, with bright, crystal clear, slightly bluish lights underneath, at each apex of the triangle. it was moving very smoothly. i can't say that it was doing horizontal figure 8's, but that's pretty close. it moved almost like a kite gliding through the air, making sharp, turns. it had 5 or 6 lights on one 'end' of it, because we could see that row every once in a while. when it banked on a turn, we could see the three on the bottom of it. it did not have any blinking lights on it, and all of the lights were the same bluish white color. it was moving, stopping, turning and banking, and did not make a sound. the impression i have of this thing is that whatever was driving it had a mastery of physics and aeronautics that i have never seen before. we have never seen anything move like that and we can't stop thinking about it.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

east. they were at least as large as water skiing kites and were at least a mile away and about quarter-mile apart. they had one or more lights on them (i think they were white), and the lights were flashing in synchonized patterns. for example, first the left-most one would blink, then the middle one, then the right-most. the lights flashed in various patterns. they were not moving, and they

which is facing lake erie - the show was going on a while but i began my watching at l0:30 pm - there in the sky was a pulsating disc star-like object first just sitting there watching the fireworks i assume-suddenly the star zig zag fashion changed its location and came closer -i noticed it was pulsating then and had green lites - it kept changing location towards me then towards the falls to see their fireworks - it never became invisible which surprised me.  after a few hrs. it was joined by 3 discs who were running only their outside edge running lights around their crafts, solid lites on not pulsating, not shiny.  they flew up nearby the shiny pulsating craft and then shut off their running lights and sat there; funny part of that was that their lights went off like a dimmer switch and some did not fade from view completely so their were still visible in the sky; and some did go completely invisible.  after watching for a few more minutes the 3, now 4 total were suddenly joined from the sky below in the area of lake erie by l0 similiar craft which jolted me fully awake at this point and i thought to myself well now that was interesting to say the least and kind of proves that there may be a base close by!  the others were straight in their flight path got into their respective positions and just sat there not moving after that zip across the sky. the larger shiny ship apparently called the others to join him as once he had company he stayed in one location and no longer zipped back and fourth as he was previously doing; guess he was in charge of chosing the best location to see both shows perfectly judging from his attempts at going over the falls and then back to my location. i watched until 3 pm waiting for someone to move closer or do something else or be joined by more craft. nobody moved and i fell asleep holding my bedroom window curtain, then falling into bed. i thought to myself how nice, they like fireworks too, then when all the others came i was more then amused and remember saying out loud holy god to myself! i was amazed at how many there were not the fact that they were there and i was angry that they were too far away to see up close.  i especially wanted to see the large shiny one up close like the others but he stayed far out and let the others have the best location and views since he watched quite a spell by himself before calling others to come see. i had the feeling he wanted them to get there and sit invisible and not call attention to themselves.  i got the impression that they want to not have to change their base and move away from here. i have never seen so many crafts in one spot, at one time before - that was unnerving and i felt fear followed by a protection for them - i was not sure if i should report this information or not - maybe we ought to just let them live there in peace period and not disturb them.  ps a plane on final into buffalo came past my house just before the fleet of ships came out and i remember thinking they had waited for him to begin his descent before they came into sight so it is obvious they want to remain hidden etc. etc. etc.

morning that he requested.It was a hot summer night, clear skies in the end of week of july 2006. there were several men working on the street with construction near the mobil gas station not far from the intersection of olden/pennington ave. there were cars out, but it was not very busy. i attempted to turn on my radio of car once i left the store,but it was not working correctly.I even thought, umm. something is wrong with the radio is it so static..So, i turned it off. approx.1:25 am after leaving the store, i made right turn onto olden avenue in direction to the high school, pass mcdonald's and pass offices on my left hand side of car. at that point pass the little white stone bridge of the near the church property, across the street, i viewed a reddish/green light circle approx.3 ft circle, in the trees on my driver's side which never in past seen before. olden avenue is a normal route to get to my home approx. 3 blocks away from that specific location where i saw this object. i drive this road daily, it was the first time i had ever seen something like this. i have lived in the town for over 20 years.  i thought it was strange seeing this light circle object,  and i passed it slowly on my left side driver side.It was about 100ft away. it was inside the trees. i expressed,\"what is that? where is that comming from?\" i didn't see anything projecting from it. there were a few cars infront of me in a distance on olden ave the same direction i was going, but they were ahead of me,by the time i saw this, no cars where infront of me.It was quiet on olden avenue. it was in the trees above near the side of the house i continued to go slowly passing it on my right side of car, alittle further at the next street which was less than several feet away, i saw a very large boomerang object, size 1/2 football field in length hovering over treeline of homes open space area from my driver's side window. i was on olden avenue and this huge object was adjacent to my view on the left side while i was in my car from the street. it was approx 300 ft away from me seeing from the distance.It hovered over several homes, and i couldn't see the other side of the object. it was silent, bobbing alittle, not in moving position.I didnot hear any noise from it. i said, oh.My god, what is that? that is huge ufo!! that is not a plane, helicopter,or anything i had seen before.No miltary craft would be out doing this above these houses.( airforce base is about 35 min. by car in south direction of town.We have an airport in town too, but not anything flying object seen shape like this before.It was no stealth flyer. this thing looked like a mothership of a huge object. we are about 10 minutes from delaware river) that thing is too close to the ground. i got to get out of here, now!!\" i did not see any people walking on that specific street that night. the v shape bommerang was a solid object, silvish color,with long end pointing to direction to north. the sideof the object had with several lights which hovered above treeline of the homes.(glendale sect.)it was very noticable, and i wondered if other neighbors saw it. i was overwhelmed,scared and shaking.I never seen anything like this before. i could only view one side of it, that how large it looked from its expansion, i saw a blub white object on the bottom of it. i have never seen a shape of a strange flying that low proximity at all near ground level.I even tried to say to myself it was a military object, but logically i said they would not be doing this kind of miltary exercise over people's homes.There is no reason for them to do this.This is wild!! it was so close to ground level over these peoples houses. i was totally overwhelmed what i viewed.I continued to drive slowly.Less than 10 miles a hour.I checked if cars behind me and none around.I took the next rt turn onto glen mawr to get to my house several blocks away from this location. i had no time elapse and i was not abducted. i was saying the lord's prayer driving home to myself. it was about 4 minutes later from what i just viewed to my house. i remember still shaking in my car when i turned into my driveway. i had to calm down before entering my house, because my teen children were watching a movie at the time.I entered the house, and my oldest child saw my expression on my face. my daughter knew something was wrong. i sat with them and explained what i viewed and tried not to frighten them. i said maybe it had to do with the military. at that time, the skies were active with planes around here. my daughter admitted hearing a story years ago at the fields near trenton state, someone expressed a craft was seen. i had no idea that this stuff was happening around here. i told them that i was not going back to see it again lets forget about it until we speak to their dad..My husband was on a trip, expect him the next day. i said no one is going to believe me if i call the police.I didn't want to call him because it was late.My son and i went to computer to see if this object had been seen before. i saw a drawing that looked so similar like the one in hudson valley sightings in the l980's.I didnot sleep well that night..My adreline was up and deep down inside i was concern what i had seen a few hrs before. next day, my car in driveway didnot work in morning for several hours, unusual behavioral pattern of wild yellow bird and a large turtle shown up my frontlawn consectively 2 days in a row in the same location on my our property after this ufo incident the following day. the car started up before my husband returned home.When my husband came home and i told him what happened, he laughed and told me not to worry about it.I even thought i may have a wire loose with system in the car, but then i canceled so see the mechanic since the car started to work okay.If it happen again, i will bring it to the shop. then the unusual things started to occur outside of my house on my front property..First, i saw this yellow bird little larger than a canary when i was in a car with my husband when we were talking privately in the car in our driveway. the bird flew onto the review mirror of passenger side.It was like it was trained and not frighten of humans. it stayed on the car for a while atleast 10 minutes.It went on the mirror to the car hood near the front glass of the car..My husband and i both commented what a beautiful bird and how friendly this wild bird behavior coming onto the car when we were sitting inside of it. we thought it was sweet alittle unusual, but neither of us didn't think anything about it. we then went inside and didnot see the bird again. that afternoon, i found a 2ft size turtle on my front lawn before plans were made to mow the grass. i don't live near a forest at all and this was the first time this ever happen to see one around on my lawn. i called my son out of home and let him view it.It reminded me of my late father when i was a child would bring turtles to my home..I would take care of them and then let them go in the wild. i said that is strange, seen 2 living creatures never been around before on my property on the same day..Never seen any yellow bird before at all, but i know they are around in nj. when time to mow my lawn, turtle was gone, and didn't see the bird except when i was in the car speaking to my husband...I even went out checking the bushes, didn't see the turtle at all. i was afraid that my dog would get it since he had a tendency to run out of my house at times..Second day, was very strange. next day,i was in my car in my driveway in the morning about 9am, reading the paper that i just went to get before entering the house.  the same yellow bird showed up again and began erratically attacking my car side window when i was in it for 15 minutes.I timed it. i said, what is wrong with this crazy, wacky bird? i am not getting out of the car until it calms down.It really acting weird. never seen a wild bird doing this kind of reaction of behavior out of the blue. i ask my neighbors yesterday if they were missing a pet bird and they said they didn't have one. i am reading the paper and it is pecking at my window of the side of car.I felt like it wanted me out of the car. i finally decided to get out of car with my roll newpaper saying to myself if it comes near me, i will swat it like a baseball flying in the air..Hahahaha..I had to laugh it was so crazy.I opened my side of drivers door and it flew off..Well, i walk onto front area to steps..The turtle that i seen the day before at another part of front lawn is now at the steps going to my front door.I said, where did this turtle come from, i checked the bushes yesterday and it was not around. i called my son and husband out of the house to see the turtle.My son even said, isn't that the turtle we saw yesterday? how did it get here? i said, mr. turtle is definitely not comming inside this house. i said something weird is going on..Too concidential that we see these things 2 days in a row first time out of all these years on my front lawn. i was wondering if it had a connection to the ufo situation.I said i see a ufo, car not working then started up again, and then reptile and bird show up that never seen at all before on our property, let alone on our frontyard? i said something is not right.  i said\"i don't know where you came from since you were gone yesterday and you show up at my doorsteps?\" my husband was quiet about it and said, lets just leave it alone. it will go away again.\" i didn't touch it at all.When we came back from store, it was gone. nothing out of the norm happened again until next early morning hrs. i was up doing my work while family was asleep.I went to bedroom about 3 am.I said my nightly routine prayers. i was sitting on my bed and turned to the window. didn't notice anything happening at all when i entered the room. the hall light was on, but not my light in my bedroom.  about 5 minutes later, i saw a very bright white light from my bedroom window with the shade partially open that faces the outside of my street. this bright light was projecting to the ground on my street going upwards the top end of the street. didnot go near window to see what created that light from the sky. but it was very bright.I was saying please god don't let it shine on this house. i didn't turn the lights on in my house, because i was frighten it would create attention to whatever was creating it..It was so noticable, it lit up the street up. my street was completely quiet. i covered myself with my sheets with my head direction to window, and i counted it for 9 seconds. when it disappeared,i said.\" what was that??I said that is no lighting, and the lamp post didn't create that light.\" i was fully awake. at that point, i was shook up. i know what i just saw and that was not a normal occurrance. i didn't wake up my family because i felt they would have been scared.I finally feel alseep about 6 am when daily light.  i woke up in the morning, i decided to go outside. i saw a marking on the street that left a residue white chalky substance at the place i saw the light first protruding to the ground on my street.I refuse to touch it.I have photos of it. that specific mark has not disappeared under any weather condition since this bright light occurred in july 2006. i never touched the marking left on the street at all. i thought it was important to write this today since someone else also admitted viewing an ufo in glendale sect. on your website.This is not far from where i live in the same town in ewing twp, nj. there have been increase sightings around this area. i have not seen any ufo's after this occurance in 2006.I don't go out looking for them at all.It was my first time ever seeing itin 2006.I have not seen one since it happened. i never believed in these things were real until i experienced it myself. i don't have hallucinations or use drugs/alcohol at all.I worked in professional field until i retired 10 year ago. i know exactly what i saw that night, including the other strange occurances that happened a few days in a row afterwords.My family witnessed the yellow bird and turtle seen too. i have spoken to a few individuals in my town who have admitted to seeing other objects in this town and surrounding area after i have discussed my own personal experience.I would take a polygraph and pass too!! something is going on around this area..","distance":"101-500

our two separately organized trips, something we learned after we were married when looking through old photos. i still remember the ufo sighting vividly and may have caught the craft on film, since i distinctly recall taking photos of the environment, hearing the sonic boom, falling back on my butt and seeing the craft in the sky for brief instant. i'm pretty sure it was a chevron/triangle shape. the craft couldn't have been more than 200 feet above ground during daylight and was just hovering for a few seconds. i know some others in my school saw it and we talked about it during the bus ride to the next city. this happened at the age of 17, and i didn't \"meet\" my wife until i was 28.\r\n\r\nthe second time was while i was living in japan at the age of 24 while living and working as an english teacher on a tiny island in the seto inland sea called mukaishima, across from onomichi, a famous city in hiroshima prefecture which was once one of the most important centers of trade in all of japan. onomichi has a population of about 100,000, and mukaishima i recall was around 19,000. the event took place at fireworks festival in the channel that ran between mukaishima and onomichi. i was seated on the western coast along the channel of mukaishima with five other friends, three japanese and two americans, sarah from boston and jacqueline from new york city, who also lived on mukaishima. during the fireworks display, we all noticed a chevron/triangle shaped craft appear from behind the mountains on the north side of the island, hover and then disappear into the mountains and then the sky. we all looked at each other and confirmed what we had seen. it was unmistakeably unusual because there are no airports or landing sites in mukaishima and the winds around the bridge from onomichi to mukaishima on the north side of the island are too strong for someone to even consider flying there.\r\n\r\nthe third time was when i was 34 and living in orange county, new york, where i now reside with my wife - the same woman i may have met while i was in scotland in high school - and two kids. my wife sleeps upstairs with the kids, and i sleep downstairs since i wake early to travel to new york city for work. we were both awakened at an early hour around 3am to a very loud ongoing noise near the house that for some reason did not awaken either of the kids. we were drawn to the very large window on our second floor landing that overlooks the front lawn. there right in front of our eyes was unmistakeably a ufo. it was the closely either of us had ever been to a craft unlike anything we've seen. i've seen a lot of crafts and was fascinated by ones that were built by humans at an early age. there was a blue light eminating from the craft and visibly shining into our window. it must have hovered for what seemed like two or three minutes. we were both in a state of shock and just froze. i recall saying to my wife to go check on the kids and make sure they're alright because i just sensed fear. the only emotion i can recall was fear. what appeared to be two creatures unlike anything i had ever seen maneuvering this craft no more than twenty feet from us outside our window scared the living daylights out of me. i'm pretty sure we left the scene long before they took off. i was really afraid.\r\n\r\nthere have been numerous instances in the past four years since i was 34 where my wife and i distinctly recall seeing unusual things, whether the sightings are ufo's or not who knows. the most recent was last month at the age of 38, where i was home alone. my wife was still at work. the kids were at school. i am a consultant and was working from home that day. i was sitting in my office near the front of the house doing some work at my laptop, which is right next to a desktop computer that was switched off at the time. all of a sudden the speakers to my computer started emitting a signal that sounded oddly comprehensible at times but at times like a foreign language. i can speak japanese and at one time knew hebrew and spanish. my wife can speak 4 or 5 languages, as well. i even learned a bit of swahili in college. i never heard any language like this. there were clearly patterns in the signal of a language. but regardless the amazing thing is that my computer which is off is emitting signals. this is simply not possible. i work in the field of technology and have been around a lot of emerging technologies. then my television in the living room, also off at the time, and a stereo system which wasn't even plugged in, all turned on and started to display random programs. nearly every electronic device within 20-30 feet of me was on, not by my own doing. as i walked around my house, the electronics in whatever room i went in turned on. i don't smoke, do drugs or drink. i may have a glass of wine once or twice a year. it was about 2-3pm in the afternoon. after noticing all of this, i had the urge to go outside and see what the heck is going on. i immediately thought maybe it's a military craft from west point or some other military installation hovering close to my house for some unknown reason causing all the electronics to go haywire but i was startled to find a chevron/triangle craft just above the house maybe 80 to 100 feet in the air just above the treeline. again fear. i ran back inside and went for the videocam in the closet but by the time i went back outside the craft was gone.\r\n\r\ni do not want fame. i do not want people on my property taking photos. i just don't want to be abducted or whatever. you know i just want my family to be safe. whether it's the military or aliens, somebody is really interested in me, my family or my house. my house used to be a farm property and i was told there used to be a barn where my house now sits. the property is full of slate just a foot or two below the ground surface. the visits from such crafts have become so much more frequent that i'm really scared, to be honest. my wife and i picked up the kids from pre-k the other day and on the way home listened to 99.1 fm where they had a program on mufon. we talked about it, and several days went by. i am now writing just as much to get this off my chest as i am to seek guidance. i've never revealed this to anyone but my wife. i am a senior executive in information technology and can't explain any of this logically though i consider myself highly intelligent and logical.\r\n\r\ni want to remain anonymous but i feel i need some expert advice to the extent that i don't want to get abducted and fear that the frequency of sightings may lead to some kind of undesirable event, but i don't want to draw attention to me or my family. i would privately welcome input from those more experienced in this. lately i've been having a lot of bizarre dreams, too. i don't know what it all means. my wife commented just the other day that \"they\" seem to be very interested in us. we are both very educated with masters degrees and of sound mind and body. if it's just the military, great. maybe i'll sleep a lot easier. i even called the police to see if they were searching for someone or if there were any planned military exercises in the area that i should know about. not that they would tell me anyway, but of course they said \"no.\"\r\n\r\nthe last thing i want to say is that i am looking for a new job and just realized yesterday when my wife asked me where some of the leading jobs are located that two of the three leading ones are within 2-3 hours of roswell, nm. i've never been to that part of the country. i have no reason to want to live or work there. i have no family there. call it chance or coincidence. just the same, it is a bit unsettling to think subconsciously i might be drawn to that area. possibly for a reason.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),

the sky was clear of clouds and other obstructions. as we got in the car, i looked up to the sky at random and noticed 8 hovering lights. at first they just seemed like lights reflecting off the ground, or maybe even fireworks because of the upcoming holiday. not very big ufo believers, me and my mom just kind of shook the suspicion off. however, we still had to head into the direction of the lights to get back home. after about 15 minutes past and the lights didn't seem to fade or move away, we played with the idea of 'aliens.' we've seen the movies, especially signs, which was filmed in bucks county. and i've always been a fan of the hit tv series the x files. it seemed a little odd to me that 8 random lights would just be sitting in the sky. we didn't want to seem a little crazy to the idea of ufos in bucks county. i don't know anyone who supports the theory and i didn't want people to think i was off the wall, so me and my mom toyed with the notion of it, and then let it
