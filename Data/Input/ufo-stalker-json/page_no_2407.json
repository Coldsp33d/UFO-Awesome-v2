(note: i've since been able to calculate certain details like direction from memory.)  i looked in the direction he was pointing and saw what i initially thought was a full moon in the night sky partially obscured by the corner of the apartment building.  there was no movement at this time and as such i returned to look at the boy(richard) who alerted us as if to say o.K. it's a full moon partially obscured by a building.  (at this time it felt like everyone there was moving in unison)  richard at this time re-asserts his position still pointing toward the object and saying \"no, look at that ball, look at that thing.\"  i looked again at the white sphere and as all of us were looking directly at it,  the object slowly moved behind the building and out of sight. (this took about 2 seconds max)  at this point i estimate the sphere to have been no more than 5 ft. in diameter.  everyone there instinctively took off for the corner of the building looking behind it to see where it went.  i've been asked before while recounting this sighting to others why i ran toward this object instead of away from it(in fear).  there was nothing at this point to fear as nothing traumatic had occurred.   if anything this object had just interacted with us by moving out of sight as though it had been seen.  we also looked over a hillside and saw nothing.  this search process may have taken about 4-5 minutes. \r\nafterwards, all in attendance mulled around processing what it was we had seen.  the adults there were asking richard what he'd seen since he was the first to notice it.  everyone was excited and talking about the \"flying saucer\" we'd just seen even though it was spheroid in shape.  i heard richard say that the object came from behind the building the same way it moved behind it and he stared at it briefly making sure he was seeing this thing before he alerted everyone else to look at it.\r\nduring this time, some of the other kids started throwing rocks over the hillside i guess in an effort to \"protect\" the neighborhood from this thing that again had demonstrated no hostile action whatsoever.  if anything it was simply observing us.  shortly after these kids started throwing stones over the hillside(maybe 30 seconds in duration), this object rose rapidly from the hillside at what looked like a 45 degree angle at an incredible speed making no noise or sound zig-zagging from: south to north, north to south, south to north, and finally north to south and off into infinity.  it left a trail as a meteor would that dissapated within seconds only this thing was moving up in the sky.  everyone who was there simply stood there momentarily, stunned in wondrous silence knowing we'd just witnessed and interacted with something that definitely came under the category of ufo.\r\nthis has remained one of the most powerful and clear memories of my life to date and has stimulated an interest in ufology.  i also know the existence of some form of extraterrestrial life is real.

white like a meteor. i kept watching expecting it to act as metoers do as they fall. this very bright light kept falling, when all of a sudden it came to a complete stop, and hovered about a mile or so above lake michigan. i continued to watch, then it began to go from left to right, as it manuvered around in a small area, it allmost went in a pattern like a square ...Suttlely left, right, and up and down.\r\nfinally after making these turns, acents and decents, it came to a complete stop \"hover again\" and at a very extreme speed it went out the exact path it came in, it went back up, this object shot out towrds space. going from a very large \"fireball\" to a ball less than half it original size, finally down to a pin point size, kept going straight up untill it dissapeard into space. from my observation the change in size was due to the extreme distance and speed that it went back into space at. \r\ni know you guys probably get alot of people making false claims, trying to get on

years i have seen 5 sights of unexplainable crafts. i have never been a skywatcher untill my first sighting over lake michigan august 8th, 2001.\r\nand i know my august 8th sighting was not something

air port, ten miles noth is the grand haven air port, and ten miles south is holland air port. i see planes of all shapes and sizes, and i know what air planes look like, especialy their lights at night. air force jets, and coast guard hellicopters fly over daily. these craft were no heeli's or planes. i would love to tell you guys about all of my sighting, i am not a spoof, a mentally disturbed person. i an an honest young man who has seen the things in the sky, that have the same charecteristics as hundreds if not thousands of ufo reports all over the world. i keep what ive seen a secret from a lot of people, and the people i do tell laugh at me, and treat me like im crazy.Well im not crazy, i allmost wish i would have never seen any of them, especially my first sighting. it was scary, yet very intreging. but at the same time it broke my moral and religous fabric of my life. i hate to assume that what i saw was alien, but nothing else explains it? i feel i will never know what ive seen, and thats where people like you come in. we need answeres, we need the truth, and i know that some american out there has it. thanks to all of you, we need many more groups like mufon.

from 3:00 to 5:00 am. the object stayed in the same place in the sky for many hours, moving left and right very slowly, back and forth. we watched as the lights flashed on and off, appearing either white, blue, or red. the rate at which the light flashed changed many times, and i got the feeling that it was meant to attract attention. my friend and i both felt very peculiar after watching this craft for a few minutes. i felt as if something was putting pressure on my brain, i am convinced it was reading my thoughts. a very odd feeling took over my entire body leaving me feeling weak and drained, and shaking from head to toe. my friend felt the same way as i when i asked him about the experience. we stopped watching the craft and the feelings that we felt went away almost instantaneously. after a few minutes of viewing the craft again we felt the same weak, quivering tightness in our bodies and felt as though something was reading, or reaching into our minds once again. i have never felt any sensation remotely similar to what i felt that morning. my friend has apparently seen it many times before these past few weeks, though never witnessed it moving before.

enthusiast. i work in the lower area of bucks county pa. i do not have the specific date and time of the event, but i know it was in late may of this year. i will have to check my police report for exact time and date. our department received a few calls in regard to the object in the sky. the event took place around dusk. there was still a good amount of light in the sky and the object could be easily seen. the object appeared due east of newtown pa. i would say that it appeared to be hovering over the area of i-95 and rt 332, if i had to guess, but the distance could have been further or closer because i couldn't really determine the size of the object as it was like nothing i had ever seen in the sky. the object appeared to be shaped like a comma, but sideways. the curved, fat end of the comma appeared to be larger than a regular comma shape. the object appeared to turn in place and this shifted the shape of the object. the object would rise suddenly higher and move slightly side to side, similar to a helicopter, but the movement was faster than a traditional helicopter.. the object did not have any audible noise coming from it. my first impression was that this was something i had never seen before. it appeared to shutter while moving, almost vibrating, which i thought was strange because i could see this action from quite a distance. after several minutes the object began to descend slightly and drop below the tree line only to re-emerge about a minute later. i attempted to drive toward the object following an eastbound route and noticed that the object began to descend very quickly toward a tree line in the distance and disappeared. there were no helicopters in the area covering any news events. as an aircraft enthusiast i have seen many helicopters in flight. this was no helicopter. it also did act like any jet or prop aircraft i have ever seen. i work in area where military bases are nearby. i have seen and can name just about every aircraft. this was like nothing i have seen from any military craft. i am reporting this to your agency because i have heard that other bucks county communities nearby have experienced unidentified objects in the sky. i have never seen anything like what i saw before or since.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was working the night shift at good samaritan nursing home located on e 6th st., alliance, ne.  i began taking my break at 3am, outside in the inner courtyard - it was the third week of june, the middle of a heat wave, and despite the fact it just finished raining, i was sweating profusely, so i was drinking iced tea.  i was sitting on a bench, facing north, and the rain clouds had just broken and were moving westward - leaving the eastern half of the night sky clear.  my break was almost over and as i stood up, i stretched, looking upwards and that's when i noticed a \"v\" formation of 6 amber \"oval-shaped\" lights coming out of the clouds - they were traveling from west to east.  i was immediately overcome with a mixture of strong feelings - \"wonder\", \"awe\", and a feeling that i was seeing something more amazing than i had ever seen before.  at first i had an impulse to run inside and bring out another witness, but i quickly rejected that idea because what i was seeing was so amazing, i didn't want to take my eyes away and \"miss\" any part of it - plus i was afraid that it would all be over by the time i returned.  so i continued to observe, when suddenly, 3 of the \"lights\" (2 on one side and 1 on the other side - the last ones of the trailing \"v\" arms) all switched positions with each other in a \"blink of an eye\".  i liken it to the way \"checkers\" jump position - if you understand what i'm saying.  after that i knew that type of lateral move was impossible by anything i knew about.  after that the \"formation\" continued heading eastward briefly, but then angled upwards, and away from earth, then they all accelerated at a speed i couldn't even guess, and were gone in a flash.  i stood there, completely dumbfounded, and i remember thinking that so far there had been no noise of any kind - i thought if i stood there and waited a while longer, that i should be able to hear any type of engine noise \"following\" the flight - if they had been traveling faster than the speed of sound.  i waited for at least a couple minutes - but no sound was ever heard.  afterwards i ran inside and tried to report what i saw to the charge nurse, but she thought i was just trying to play some kind of joke - unfortunately, i had a reputation for practical jokes and keeping our shift laughing and in good spirits.  afterwards, i talked quietly with another co-worker - a rancher's wife who had lived in the nebraska panhandle all her life.  she seemed to believe me, but she advised me to keep my observation to myself - if i wanted to be taken seriously.  she went on to say that she had witnessed many \"strange things\" in her lifetime - as had many of her friends and family out in that part of the country - but they held on to a tradition of just not discussing such things publicly.  so i then went back and recanted my story to the charge nurse - however, over the years, i have told this story to members of my family and trusted friends.  that part of the country is very deserted - the night sky is beautiful, the milky way is visible.  i was amazed that when i checked out the mufon \"weather maps\" that entire part of the country - the area where i would have guessed the highest amount of sightings - actually has the lowest, almost non-existant.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

horizon, there was this oblong object moving to the south, very slowly.  at first i thought it might of been a helicopter, but there were no navigation lights blinking. it was coming closer to my

with the oncoming jet i figured the object was just part of an excercise.  but when the jet got directly over me i galnced at the object and it was no longer there.  so i watched the jet, it seemed to be doing high speed manuveurs.  after about five minutes, the jet headed south at a high rate of speed.  then almost directly above me, high in the sky, the object flickered for a few seconds then was fully visible.  it began moving towards the south.  as it passed to where i could see the back of the object i could definitely some kind of bluish exhaust exiting from the rear.  it began moving faster, than with a bright flash of blue light, it zipped towards the south in the blink of an eye and was gone.  i waited a little while longer and neither the object or the jet returned.  i was really excited about what i witnessed.  maybe it was a new plane they are testing at the air base.  or maybe it was something else.  either way i've been looking skyward since.  i hope this can help in your research.  thank you for your time!  i have ten minutes of video footage but the file is too big to transfer to my computer.  although it only shows static, i didn't know if you may have a test you can run to find what caused the interference.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

quickly noticed what i thought was a shooting star and said to my friend, while pointing at it, \"look a shooting star\". (the object was  approximately 25-35 deg. above the horizon traveling from east to west, about the brightness of a medium star, it did not twinkle and had no trail, kind of like a sattelite but moved much faster, no blinking lights or aviation lighting, we were in east central phoenix looking south-southwest,  it was a clear night) my friend aknowledged also seeing it and as we both were looking it the object made a \"sideways u-turn\" completely reversing direction, now traveling from west to east, then we lost it. we both looked at eachother in amazement saying \"did you just see that?\"  yes infact we both did. we turned off all outdoor lights and in 2-3 min. saw it come back, now from the east going back west, and lower on the horizon 15-20 deg. we stood there not beliving our eyes and watched this starlike object fly all over the sky, staying  5-25 deg. off the horizon moving in every direction possible,using 80-90deg. laterally and being able to vary its speed and direction at will.  it could change direction with out slowing down. we watched it do this for about 30 min. then lost it. we called out my friends room mate to have him take a look and in about 5 min. the object reappeared. i don't think he belived what we were telling him until he saw it for himself.  sure enough though he did see it.(one of the guys there described it like a bee flying, i would agree except it never appeard to hover, it was always in motion but very much like the flight path of an insect a gnat maybe)  as all three of us are wacthing a second one appears. they were not flying in any type of formation but it was evident that they were quite aware of eachother.  darting adround in the sky sometimes paralelle to one another, somtimes opposite directions, sometimes trailing eachother, sometimes doing their own thing.  there was no rhyme nor reason to their movments.  their movement would go in a straight line then change direction, then speed change, then zig-zag, then speed again, then straight line again ect., not keeping any patterns or staying concistant however it was all done very smoothly and what seemed to be very percise manuvering.  we watched the two do  this for  about 45 nim. then the thrird one appeared. same in every way as the first two. all three were visible in the sky for about another 25-30 min., then it dropped down to two. our last sighting was at 01:15, 2 july 08. during this whole period of time we were never out of veiw of at least one and if you lost it could find it again or multiple ones in less than 1 or 2 min. we would see them for minutes at a time and multiple times over 10 min. straight.  \r\n  i saw this object do things that are not possible to do and have no explination for what i(we) saw.  for the record i have never in 30yrs of looking up at the sky ever seen anything even close to this.  i am a profesional instructor pilot(for a major airline) with over 2000 hrs of flight time (over 400 night).  i know what aicraft, sattelites, flares, flares on chutes, and most anything you can think of that flies looks like and how they move through the sky. this was none of those. these objects manuvered like nothing i've ever seen. while watching we started timing it between 2 points compared to aircraft were saw transitioning the area in the same direction(the aircraft were on jet routes, those start at 19,000 ft. msl and usually top out around 30,000 ft. msl) the aircraft would take about 20 sec and the things we saw could do it in 3 or 4 sec.  they could also go slow.  we saw one pace an aircraft(passenger jet) for several sec the star object was in front by a few miles then all of the sudden accelerated away, quadrupling its distance in 1-2 sec., then \"pulled up\" making that \"u-turn\", then went right over the airplane, pushed down  \"u- turn\" and now right behind the aircraft. it only did the once but also did many other weird and crazy manuvers sometimes looking as though the two star objects would collide with eachother then not at the very last sec.  \r\n  ok...   so now can someone tell me what the hell we saw??","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

 cool i don't often get to see a shooting star.  as i watched this object at some point it started to travel horizontally and was no longer falling. looking at the road and back up at the sky the object moved pretty fast changeing direction once.  the object appearered to be over nj on the other side of the delaware river. and just that fast while i was starring at it the object dissapereared.  it was like turning off a light switch and i could not see it anymore it was gone.  i felt like i had just witnesed something extrodinary, about 30 seconds later the object reappereared  on the pa side of the river. the red/orange object hovered around for about another minute, then the light went out again. i believe that the object never left ,  it just turned out its lights. i am a little confused about what i saw, i felt  that the object did not want to be detected and that has left me feeling a little nervous.  if anyone saw something like this in our area, please respond here.

( the area of 422 curves around and gets closer to the powerplant area) the more i realized it wasnt a plane but a ufo.\r\nit wasnt flying fast or high. as high as those high powerlines over highways. it was fyling along side the powerlines  very close. the whole experience lasted about 2 minutes from me first seeing it until i got closer to it , until it passed over me and over 422 and i continued to drive on 422.\r\nit looked like a drone craft or something.\r\nat first when i saw it these thoughts came into my head.\r\nthe first thing i thought was it looked like something out of star wars.\r\nit was low enough that i could clearly see it and know it was nothing of this world, or at least nothing that any civilians have seen.\r\nthe other things i thought about were:\r\nwhy is this thing flying along side the powerlines.\r\nthe ufo made no noise whatsoever.\r\ni passed the area where the powerlines and overpass are on the highway of 422 headed west the same exact time the ufo flew over 422 going across.\r\nit was only as high as powerlines and made no noise whatsoever.\r\nit silently glided through the air.\r\nit was round and had several lights in the center. like 3 infront. and had these weird side wings. it looked like only one wing on the side. to the left side of the circle center. it would actually be the right side of the ufo but coming towards me headed over route 422 it was on the left side of the craft.\r\ni dont know anything really about ufo's so my descriptions are out of sci-fi movies. the first thing that came into my mind when i saw it and realized it wasnt a plane when i was close enough was it was a ufo and looked like something out of star wars. then the words i've heard before drone, just came to mind.\r\nsmall, one wing, round with lights, slowly gliding rather low, with no sound.\r\ni told family and friends, and everyone believed me.\r\ni was freaked out when i was driving afterwards, and immediatley called various family members on my cell as soon as i passed it on the highway.\r\nthat's how unnerved i was.\r\nwhen i got home i hardly slept at all and was very freaked as i know it was no plane.\r\ni have wanted to report this story for a while but didnt know where to report it or what sites are out there. this was just about a year ago.\r\nabout 3-4 months ago i saw a news story on aol of a ufo and a picture of it a guy had caught on film in broad daylight over a light post/powerline and it was featured on aol. as soon as i saw it online i realized it looked very simular to what i saw at night here in pa last june.\r\nthen i heard on the news people seeing ufo's in pa the past couple of days and found this site.\r\ni still wonder if anyone else drving on 422 last year in late june saw this same ufo as there were a few other cars driving west bound while i was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11391,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.2453741,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07022008-0018","longitude":-75.6496302,"occurred":1183186800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1183186800000,"summary":"I was driving on 422 passing limerick area around 12:30am in june 2007 and saw a ufo moving very slowly  towards the highway from the right, level with powerlines and parrell to limerick powerplant. it was low enough that i saw it very clear","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Pottstown, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:361316"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2407}
