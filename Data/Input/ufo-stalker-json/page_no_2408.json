it had white lights from the points of the boomerang spaced evenly to the middle of the boomerang and had a football shaped body with mirrored lights on both sides of the body with the back light being red the middle white and the last being green. it moved at a fairly slow pace. if you put your arm up at a 45 degree angle and move your arm right to left slowly for 1 second then from fingertip

tower.Canadian athourities have told me theres a 3,500 foot restricted airspace around the falls and heicopters are also not allowed to fly below the crest or in the mist of the falls.It also appears theres this extended probe pointing at a right angle from the top of this thing-- from one of my zoomed in enhancements.I dont think this is a seagull by no means.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

oriented almost east to west, looking to my left(southerly). i was there almost 2-3 min looking at the stars.  i had the feeling to look to the northern. when i did, i focused upon a star sized light moving to the ssw from the nne about, from my perspective, two inches below the last star in the \"handle\" of the big dipper.  the light traveled         about two & one half inches. it was constant in its white color and had no blinking pattern. we have all heard that these high altitude lights, in a straight flight path, are satellites orbiting the earth reflecting the suns light like the moon.  as i thought this, the object took a sharp turn to the south, traveled at an accelerated pace for about a half an inch and disappeared.  there were clouds to the west, but not near this area of the sky and none of the other stars in the area became obscured during this part of the event.  i shouted for my girl to come out to the deck and as 4 or 5 seconds past the light returned.  this time it was traveling to the ne.  it traveled about 3/4 of an inch and disappeared 1/2 inch to the west and 1 inch below the last star in the handle of the big dipper.  as my girl came out on the deck the

the light return in the same area from which it had disappeared.  she watched the object for about 10 seconds before it again disappeared.  i feel extra good and lucky to have seen something like this

near downtown houston, tx, when i leaned back to use my contact solution and noticed a particularly strange formation in a cloud overhead.  the cloud was approximately 300-350ft. wide and elongated in shape.  nothing strange there except what caught my eye.  \r\n\r\ni noticed a perfect dome of air being pressed up under the cloud.  i've heard of this perfectly normal weather phenomenon before, but never had seen it so i inspected it more closely and noticed a perfectly round whole in the top of it which exposed something black.  this still wasn't to out of place, but it was unusual to me, so i continued to stare.  \r\n\r\nthen what caught me eye next is something even more remarkable.  in the top upper left hand side of the cloud was a perfectly shaped cube.  i say cube because it looked as if a cube had punched through it leaving a square on the bottom and a square on the top.  i could see two sides of the cube in the middle and another parcial side. the square in the top exposed blue sky. it was about 40' from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nit looked as if something had gone from the ground up because there where tiny wisps of the cloud coming from the sides of the flat surfaces of the cube and they where caught in an upward draft.  this is when i began to inspect it more closely and entirely.  \r\n\r\ninside the cloud was a dark mass, but the mass was a perfect triangle!  i began to become excited.  i knocked on the door to show my mother whom i had just woken but she didn't answer, so i knocked on her bedroom window.  later we realized that she was passing through the door to use the restroom and i had just missed her at both places.\r\n\r\nthe cloud was drifting, so i had to crane my neck to see it and when i did, the tip exposed itself.  it was black in color, perfectly shaped and awe inspiring.  i tried to follow it but it passed over my neighbor's house and into the trees.  i did get to see it for about 10 seconds and since the cloud had a silver lining from the sun and it was a good distance ( approx. 30 -35 feet from the silver lining.  i definitely could tell it wasn't part of the cloud and was solid.\r\n\r\nsince i no longer could see that, i turned my attention back to the cube, but it was beginning to break up.  so i focused on the dark shape inside the cloud.  that's when part of the cloud opened up and i saw the back of what was in the cloud!\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was the tail end of a craft of some sort.  it was enormous!  i couldn't see the entire tail end of what was in the craft, but i did see multiple rows of rectangles not all the same in size and length, but perfect in shape and they were laying horizontally.  they weren't all the same in color either, but where all perfectly shaped.  they were earthy tones like copper, khaki, beige and light browns. they shined like metal, but not overly so. \r\n\r\nafter watching this for a moment as the cloud began to envelope the back end, a pod of 8 or 9 purple martins floated into the scene.  i've grown up with these birds and they weren't acting normal in nature.  they almost looked metallic in color.  i instantly felt the feeling as if something was trying to sway my attention.  the birds where riding a thermal, but none of them flapped their wings, which is unusual for all 8 or 9 martins to not be doing.  my mother later pointed out that maybe they where riding the thermal of this craft and/or what punched through the cloud.  but i begged to differ, but do consider.\r\n\r\ni could no longer see the darkness in the cloud when returning my attention back to it.  \"they succeeded,\" i told myself.  i finally returned my attention to the door and wanted to tell my mother of this experience.  she was very upset that see didn't get to see it, but if i turned my head away then it would have darted off.\r\n\r\ni got on the road and went to work.  on my way, i was looking at other clouds trying to find it or find something else.  there where other dark masses in the clouds, but none like what i had just witnessed and what a perfect way to cloak itself.\r\n\r\nnow this is what's important to what i was saying about my mother and i disagreeing that i mentioned in the beginning.  i went to work twice yesterday.  once in the morning and again at 10:30pm central time.  because i was looking for it in the day while driving, i was on my way to work and not coming home.  she tells it as if i where on my way home and not on the way to work.\r\n\r\nshe and my grandmother both complained to me of having a terrible headache when i returned home from work around 4:30 pm.  but i can't get her to understand that how could i be looking for a cloud with sun on it and dark shapes in them if i'm at home and not driving?  she remembers me telling her that i would tell grandmother about it over coffee on sunday morning (june, 29, 2008) because i wanted to take a nap before returning to work that evening. \r\n\r\ni thought i had it explained to her, but she refuses to believe me.  as i type this, she's telling me that i'm still wrong.  \r\n\r\ninteresting footnote, last night i dreamed of fibers being pulled from my head.  but i know i was looking for it in the day because i saw it during the day while it was day light and how i could look for a cloud with sun on it at 10:30pm?\r\n\r\nthis was a most unusual experience and the fourth experience at witnessing something in the sky out of the ordinary and only 200 or 250 feet above me hanging at a low rate of speed hiding in a cloud and with so many other unusual characteristics attributed to it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Patterned

netherlands.  it was around 9 pm - late for me - and it was a rare sultry october evening in north holland.  my parents were gone that night and opa slipped into his klompjes and we meandered outside wondering why it was so humid & warm and why the little lake and the tiny canals around our farm were not frozen solid - like yesterday?  deftly he swung me over on his strong shoulders - both my legs dangling - when he pointed to the sky and we saw a cigar-shaped hull with 6-8  colored lights, in a row, on both ends.  grandma was called and said it was not a blimp in that it was too skinny and had nothing dangling beneath it.  so said grandma.  the year was 1952 - and opa and oma thought hitler was back.  \r\n\r\nfrom the middle there were several bright lights shining down on a few of our holstein cows but the beam of each light did not go all the way down to the grass.  it hovered.  i remember thinking it was strange in that it was still dark under and around the cows.  only the back of the cows were lit up brightly.  we watched this giant move slowly across our farm and then to the next farm.  suddenly it sped straight up, going neither left nor right, until it became a dot - smaller and smaller.  the whole sighting (in my 4 year old mind and as it was told to my grandmother) lasted only 30 minutes or so.  i was preparing my stallion to go to school the next day when i noticed that the lake & canals were frozen again. \r\n\r\nmy grandfather died @ 84 a few months later even though he was in perfect health.  i always wondered whether this new ufo paradigm could not occupy the same mind as the old paradigm he was so used to - and he succumbed to the discord.  my grandmother died 5 month later from a broken heart.  my parents sold the farm and we moved into the big city amsterdam.  i started montessori school the same year.  too many funerals for me.\r\n\r\ni became enlightened instead.  suddenly i was able to learn at a much faster rate than before the ufo experience and i excelled in everything i wanted to do.  within just a few years i spoke 5 languages and i was considered a child prodigy.  no one knew why.  i did.  i got my ph.D. at the early age of 19 and never stopped studying.  i became a drugless doctor and holistically healed thousands - without resorting to surgery.\r\n\r\ni'm about ready for retirement now - but i'll never forgot that time

friend however, was very scared and almost having a panic attack.  i tried to calm her down and tell her it was just some sort of advertising thing and not to worry.  i quickly dropped off the girls at their house next street over and went in search of the objects.  they had appeared in the eastern sky so i headed east to see if i could spot them again - or to see if there was anything in the sky (advertisement blimps or something) that could have explained it, but there was absolutely nothing (plus it was about 9:45 pm, so most businesses were closed then) i checked the local movie theater and they had no lights advertising anything etc.  \r\n\r\n   one more thing, when i was staring at the objects i tried putting my glasses on to see if i could see them more clearly (even though i'm far sighted) it did magnify it somewhat and the lights looked like flames shooting out of the sides.  the whole thing was very exciting to witness.\r\n\r\nif you have any idea of what it is i saw, i would love to hear from you.

around 5am. it's a clear night this morning and the stars and moon are quite visible. i was just smoking and my mind was just going over mundane things and then i don't know why, i just craned my head as far back as it could go and i saw a decent size ball/sphere/orb (not sure what to call it) of light flying pretty much right over me.\r\n\r\nfor a split second i thought it was just a light on a plane but then i reaized the light wasn't attached to anything. it was just a ball of light moving through the sky. i couldn't tell you the altitude except it wasn't very high in the sky. this is raleigh, nc and all the buildings are kind of small and this thing wasn't very high in the sky above my office building. it's hard to describe the size but i would say that it looked like the size of a quarter held at arms distance, maybe a little larger. it was a solid white color and although that sounds plain, there was more to the color of the thing.Wow, it's so hard to explain. it was just an intense, rich white light. the other thing that surprised me is that it made no sound. i mean it was completely silent. it was around 5 am, there was no one around, no traffic either. the night was so quiet except for the sounds of night (slight chirping, crickets, etc), and this thing was flying low in the sky, i could not believe i wasn't hearing any noise coming from it at all. it was truly bizarre. the other thing i noticed was it's speed. it was travelling fairly slow, kind of cruising for lack of a better work/description. it struck me as if the thing wasn't flying so much as \"gliding.\" it for the most part was traveling in the same direction but kind of wobled to the left and to the right a little bit. it seemed like it was in complete control to say the least.Again, it's so hard to explain what i saw, i've never seen anything like that before. finally the thing kind of picked up it's speed and zoomed off. more like swoshed off. it seemed to me that the thing covered a big distance in a short amount of time and then it was completely gone. the whole thing probably took 2-3 minutes but it felt longer than that for me.\r\n\r\ni have to say that the thing left me in awe. it was also kind of eerie initially. i remember looking around frantically to see if anyone was around so i could share the experience with and so it could be more real to me. i know that no one is going to believe i saw what i saw. although it was kind of eerie, it was very beautiful to me. i don't know how else to put it. in the end there's no way of knowing what i saw. i just know it wasn't a plane/helicopter/baloon/blimp/star/planet or shooting star. again, i don't know what it was, i just know what it wasn't. it was a beautiful experience and i count myself fortunate enough to have been at the right place and right time.\r\n\r\ni'm sure you get a lot more exciting reports than this one but i believe that if you experience something like this, it's our responsibility to report it. there is no doubt i experienced something amazing this morning and what that means just blows my mind. again, i wish there was someone around to share it with. if you happen to have any other reports in raleigh for today would it be possible to contact me? it would very much like to compare notes with anyone who might have seen it. it was so amazing i find it hard to believe i was the only one.\r\n\r\ni apologize for writing so incoherently, my mind is still in shock over this and i felt it would be better to get everything out as fast as possible so i wouln't forget any details.\r\n\r\nagain, thank you.\r\nsv in raleigh nc.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

state hwy 85 looking toward the east.  in the east are the diablo mountains and ajo range (mountains).\r\n\r\nwho:  besides myself, an aunt, an uncle, a cousin and a family friend all witnessed the event.  my aunt and unlce were in the front (my aunt was driving).  i sat behind the driver's seat (behind my aunt), our family friend sat in the rear passenger (behind my uncle) and my cousin sat between us.\r\n\r\nwhen:  approximately 7pm, dusk, the sun had not completely set behind the mountains on the west side of the road.\r\n\r\nwhat:  as they occured...My uncle exclaimed, \"check it out!\" he was pointing toward the diablo/ajo mountains on the driver's side of the truck as we headed south.  we all looked and immediately saw a large circular light in the sky (like the sun, or full moon would appear) above the mountains.  the light appeared two dimensional.  we rolled down the windows for a good look.\r\n\r\nthe range was approximately 5-6 miles away and the height of the mountains in this area is about 2500-3000 feet. the light was about a 1/2 a finger's height above the mountain with my index finger about 5 inches from my face using the width of my finger as the height.  the light was also the about the same measurement in diameter as distance above the mountains.  just guessing we believed about 150-200 feet across.  their was no visible aircraft or other device that the light was eminating from.  however, there was a jet cruising in the distance and the lights we saw were about 50 times larger than the jet visible in the sky.  i believe jets crusie at about 30,000 feet and this light was only about 3,000 feet in the air and was at least as big as a jet on its own.\r\n\r\nit was strange enough to see this big light.  but, it suddenly vanished almost as soon as we noticed it.  then another appeared a little higher and to the north, then off, then on and directly above.  it repeated a couple of more times making a circular pattern if one were to draw a line between the circles of light.  (remember only one light at a time was on and they were stationary.)  next, another light appeared seemingly further away from the mountain, in a nw direction from where we had just seen the other lights, then off.  then on again in a second, continuing on its nw path, then off, then appeared again about back where it started, then off.  then, two more times moving in its nw direction, then off.  after it disappeared this last time we did not see it again.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, since the event was only seconds long, by the time we got a camera out nobody had a chance to take a picture.  we gazed into the mountains for several more minutes and never saw any aircraft or other objects that may have been reflecting light.  this was my first ufo encounter and although i am not convinced it was e.T., i do classify this as an unidentified flying object.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":11362,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.88473,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07012008-0001","longitude":-112.8086,"occurred":1213858800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1213858800000,"summary":"Lights in the sky, arizona","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Lukeville, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:362226"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Royal Tunbridge Wells","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am a retired naval flight officer and retired police officer, 65 years old.\r\ni was a lieutenant and the navigator-communicator on a navy patrol plane back in the 70's. we were on a mission headed s. out of iceland and were located a couple of hundred miles w. of uk. we were flying at 300 ft. altitude and about 280 knots. the first thing i noticed was a metal sphere floating on the water. round as a beach ball and about 20 ft. in diameter. i just happened to spot it while looking out the window. we were still a long way from our assigned search area. i called it on ics and dropped an on top (electronic position marker). we were emcon (unable to turn on radar, radio or any electronic emissions for security purposes}. flight circled back and we looked for it a couple of passes but it was getting dark and we had an assigned search to do so took up our original southerly heading. this sphere may have had nothing to do with the ufo sighting that followed. i observed no connection between the two but mentioned it because they happened so close together. it could have been some odd buoy adrift.\r\na few minutes later someone called on the ics that there was a bright light on our starboard side. i looked out and sure enough there was a bright (glaring) day-glo green light i would guess 1/2 mile off our starboard wing. the light was so bright i could not see the craft that it was on, just the light. looked like nothing i ever saw before. it was at our altitude and keeping pace with us exactly. could not make a radar sweep without letting the russkies know we were coming but i sure wanted to. the whole crew watched it. i watched it as much as i could but had my navigation and logs to keep up. every time i looked out it was just out there, bright, greenish and staying in one place relative to the airplane.\r\ni guess about 20 to 25 minutes later i heard the pilots in the flight station on ics say \"there it goes, there it goes\" then state that it was speeding off in front of the aircraft. i stood up and went forward (2 steps) to the flight station but it was already over the horizon. i remember they were amazed at it's acceleration & speed. i had logged the sightings on the official flight logs and turned it in at debrief. i remember some of the officers on the crew did not want me to but i had seen it, logged it and was not going to alter logs to look less controversial. i figured i would let the wing debriefing officer figure it out or hide it if he wanted to. i was never ask about it again by the navy and no official mention of it was ever made of it to my knowledge after i turned in my logs. there were ten or twelve witnesses aboard but it would be hard to locate them. i was nav-com on one crew and tacco (tactical officer) on another and i don't remember which crew was which. i could look in my old cruise book and find out but those guys are scattered all over the world now. all of them were my friends.\r\n\r\n        ","distance":"501 Feet -
