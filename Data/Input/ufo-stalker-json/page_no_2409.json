(star like, flying sharp angles). also, for the record, i have seen navy attack aircraft making dive bombing runs over lake george bomb range at night. if you are positioned so that they fly overhead, dive going away from you them climb going away, from that perspective it makes it appear to be a straight down straight up yo-yo. it looks weird. but it's easy to explain. from the side the flight path would be a u, not a yo-yo. the object in oklahoma did all this at all angles. it was not simply perspective. i am positive of that.

while the red trail grew in intensity - and it looked like i was seeing multiple instances of an object being stretched over a great distance. when it \"snapped\" suddenly the trail of light closed in on the point in the horizon where the ball had vanished and suddenly the entire trail in the sky vanished. it was a pretty bright evening, nearly a full moon. there wasn't any vapor trail indicating rocket propulsion. the object felt like it was very close to us at first, but then when i stared at it i realized it was skimming along the bottom of the clouds. (the only way i could tell was that the light briefly bumped into the cloud layer during its travel) \r\n\r\nas i mentioned, there was no noise. absolutely none. no \"pop\" no explosions... and it was a very cold night. on nights that cold you can typically hear a car horn from 10 miles away on account of the density of air molecules. if it was a firework we would have heard it. \r\n\r\nim sending this to you guys because i'm hoping someone else saw the same thing. maybe someone can explain this. it's really been bothering me ever since.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":11349,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4340428,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06302008-0001","longitude":-117.6061325,"occurred":1213686000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,  Missile,  Fireball,  Flash,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1213686000000,"summary":"The event that killed my skepticism.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"San Clemente, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:362270"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Austin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I don't remember exactly when it happened, i remember i was about 10 or 11 years old so it would have been 1991 or 1992.  it was late at night and my mom sent me to the neighbor's becasue she was helping her with a paper for school (we lived in family student housing and my mom went to ut austin).  i stepped outside and looked up and saw a very large oval/saucer shaped dark metallic object floating motionless and silently above a golf course that was across the street from our apts. all i remember is seeing the object, registering what it looked like and then without any apparent reason (later this seemed really weird) i kept on going as though it were nothing noteworthy and did not look at it again.  i remember being at my neighbor's door knocking seconds later (they were just a few dozen feet away across a lawn)and only then, turning back to where i saw the craft, and nothing was there.  i didn't say anything to anyone until a little later, when i started to think about how it couldn't have been anything i know - i.E. blimp, airplane, helicopter, balloon, etc. and i told my mom.  i don't think she has ever believed me though, i was an imaginative kid, but i know what i saw, and the way i behaved doesn't sit well with me either. i would think a normal reaction would be to open the door, (i was right outside the door when i saw it) and call my mom out to see it with me, i would also think that i would have looked at it a long time - gawking - i mean it was weird!  but i didnt, i only remember going about my business - without any thoughts really....Not until later did i actually \"think\" about what i saw.

different.  our land is in a wooded section of town covering a good deal of sky.  however, we can still identify jets, single, double engined planes, and an occasional satelite despite the small sphere of vision.  as well, we can see polaris in our northen sky, and other important night time sky markers on our property.  so this report doesn't come from a novice.  we observe the day and evening sky with regularity.  and there have been many times we've stood out there under the night time sky disappointed to have explained away a possible unidentified flying object.  the object was star like in appearance.  it caught my attention as it creeped up in the western sky, travelling in an easterly direction.  it moved with the approximate speed of a satelite, but the light of the object would have fit better on a low flying jet, (or even a small plane for that matter, minus the blinking lights) on its approach to land.  my first impression was that it was indeed a satelite, but it was simply moving too fast, and just too bright.  it moved deliberatly with no sound.  there is a jet highway that travels east to west over our house.  on a moon lit night, you might see its trail, but otherwise just the faint blinking lights.  and the sound will take at least six to ten seconds til its heard, rumbling like thunder in the distance.  it lumbered over our heads, and we watched it cross over the road heading towards rockland.  this object was very hard to focus on.  it was like it was simutaneously close and far away.  my feelings were that we might be possibly witnessing something significant.  i remember feeling indignant, but not fearful.  we've both tried to dismiss this happening, but have no template in normal, everyday life to match this sighting with.  the only other item of significance to this event, is that the next day we rushed our eldest son to the hospital on our physician's dire concern that what we'd thought was mononucleosis, was in fact some sort of cancer.  which it was in fact acute lymphoblastic luekemea.  as to what this object was, we've no idea.  but it certainly marks a day in our lives which we just as soon wish never

object high in the sky, against a clear blue sky.  my first thought was it was a planet.  the object appeared to hover back and forth, up and down slightly which quickly ruled out a planet.  after watching it for a few moments i decided it was a bird, although at a height i could not estimate, nor had ever seen a bird fly at before.  i was certain it was a bird.  i had seen it dive at one point at which i thought i saw \"white\" or shiny, reflective bird shaped wings reflecting off the western evening sun.  well at this point a fairly low flying southwest airlines 727 or 737 taking off from houston hobby airport heading west passed between myself and the object, i.E. the object was higher than the plane whose height i also could not estimate but high enough that i am not considered in an airport hazard zone, nor can i hear planes while i'm inside my house but they do take off and land in a pattern that takes them near my house under certain weather conditions.  much to my surprise, the object seemed to come down towards the planes altitude and them chase it off in a westerly direction.  it scared me to see what i was certain was a bird hovering almost in place suddenly accelerate to a planes speed.  the object seemed to come down in a meandering but always smooth path, then meandered behind it maintaining speed with the plane.  it then accelerated to a speed greater than the planes speed and took off in a straight line slightly northerly of the planes almost due west heading.  not to an unreasonable speed, but greater than the 737's.  \r\ni struggled with whether

were and if i hadnt of visibly seen them i would not have heard them.  at some point after being outside roughly 15-20minutes all the neighborhood birds and bats and wildlife were going nuts.  i mean nuts.  i mean when i walked outside it was completely silent and then all of a sudden everyone was worked up.. the strange thing was for the amount of sounds around me i didnt see any birds or

england and it passed over us heading towards ripley and alfreton.  the whole sighting only lasted a few seconds but it certainly unnerved both of us.  to begin with we were surprised but this quickly turned to mild shock and trying to make some understanding of what we had actually seen.\r\n\r\nthe object passed by across the sky in a westerly direction out of our field of vision.  we seemed to not actually move to begin with, mostly through shock and then the wow factor.  the speed at which it moved at was incredible, many times faster than the jets that sometimes fly over us.  we live not too far from east midlands airport, the east midlands police helicopter landing site and we have a few local raf bases in the next county, so we are quite used to seeing and hearing various types of air craft flying above us, however, on this occasion it was something out of the ordinary.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

days later.  the field investigator interviewed me for approximately 4+ hours on a saturday afternoon, approximately 2 days after he contacted me to set up an interview day and time.  \r\n\r\ni reported seeing stars all around my home and the city i live in which would move side to side, up and down.  these star-like objects were always closer than most of the stars we are able to see with city street lights on during the evening.  i have never heard from this investigator again, so i'm sure he must have decided i was not a credible witness and there was no one else to back up what i was seeing.\r\n\r\ni am at my wits end now because now i have light white to light blue energy orbs floating through the ceiling, walls, windows and doors of my home constantly.  they are everywhere, including my closets!  they blink tiny lights also, mostly in green, blue, white and red.  i also seem to have a new gift (if that's what you would call it)!  i can see stranger things in the sky during the day and night, such as windows opening that looks like there are silhouettes of people moving about, like in another dimension, everything being white in color against a blue sky during the day.  i am not crazy!!\r\n\r\ni now have someone (my brother) who lives about 6 blocks down the street from me (same street) who can also see orbs on the mirrors in his house!  he says he just ignores them....Well, i've tried that but they will not leave me alone!  i actually have to go outside and run my fingers through my hair several times a day and evening and when i do that, all these energy orbs start floating away.\r\n\r\ntwo weeks ago i developed a sore throat and cough which took about a week to overcome.....Antihistamines did not work!  i thought i was having an extreme allergy attack, even though i haven't had any problems for years and have lived in the same location for 18 years.\r\n\r\ni guess i should also mention that i listed my property with a real estate agent on june 10th.  a couple of days ago, i became so congested in my head and nose as did my boyfriend.  i decided to try a differnet antihistabmine and after taking it for the second time in 24 hours which was well within the doseage limits, i became extrenely dizzy, and upon standing up, i could barely walk! this is insane! i'm still having a problem with my balance from time-to-time and since then have delveoped a problem with my right eye, which seems like something is floating in the shape of an oval.  i will be seeing my eye doctor this coming wednesday.\r\n\r\nyesterday, my real estate agent introduced me to an agent of a prospecctive buyer and he told me his wife has been plagued with the same thing as me for the past two weeks (however, i did not mention the orbs in my house or the ufos, not stars dancing anymore, but ufo's, roaming all over the skies). \r\n\r\ntwo messages have been left on a patio table since may 31st, that were done similar to a crop circle.  i will include the pics i took with my digital camera.   \r\n\r\nthere is something very strange and now very scary to me that's going on in my area, and a further investigation needs to be done, possibly by someone who may have a special gift of seeing things differently, or possibly someone who has \"remote viewing\" capabilities.\r\n\r\ni really want and need to sell my property and don't want any attention drawn to my property that could affect it getting sold, and that's why i now just reporting this to you.  i have nothing to gain and everything to lose by telling anyone about my dilemma, because my property is all i really own of meaningful value and it's my only means of survival for a retirement (unless the et's or whomever is behind this engery orb attacks take care of me first).\r\n\r\nif someone could contact me to discuss the matter further, i would welcome the call!  you just can't imagine how much i regret ever allowing myself to become interested in looking up in the sky (especially at night) and taking pictures with a digital camera in case i could capture a ufo or some other strange phenomenon.  i guess i'm paying for it now!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:59:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11332,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.4635519,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06282008-0004","longitude":-122.4285862,"occurred":1212822000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1212822000000,"summary":"Energy

\r\n\r\nwe was driving along the a21 sevenoaks bypass, traveling towards the m25 and london \r\n\r\nit was 1055pm on the 21st of june 2008, when i noticed out of my left eye a fleet of ufos they were like a constellation of red to orange to white and back to orange colour orbs,\r\nthey were just above the horizon of the fields trees that were silueted to my left side around a hundred feet up and around 3 hundred feet away,\r\n\r\ni said to sam my mate sitting on my left next to me,  look at that, there,\r\n\r\nhe said that's a constellation,  i said no way it's too close to the ground and look at the colour of the other stars, there white these are orangey red and white, so he laughs at me for being too quick to call it ufos.\r\n\r\nwell we hadn't got a min up the road when again on the left side of the\r\nroad in the next field along, we all saw hundreds of them, again this time\r\nthey were not only on the ground and all spread out over this field they\r\nwere hanging there just above the ground from left of the field to right,\r\nabout 2 hundred feet across this field, and what i noticed most was that\r\nthey were like getting into line and making a pillar of spiralling lights\r\ngoing up around maybe 3 to 4 hundred feet into the air,  but keeping this shape of a tube or strait line of lights \r\n\r\nlike something was slowly vacuuming them up a glass tube but not so fast,\r\njust like a floating motion \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwell sam said  john don't stop on the road if a car comes up from behind\r\nthey might hit you so i keep going don't stop,\r\nwell the road didn't have any hard shoulder to stop on and i had a few cars\r\nbehind me now, but i did slow down to around 20 miles an hour and the cars\r\nbehind me slowed also, there must have been around 5 or 6 cars behind me but no one seemed to mind that i had slowed my cars speed down ,no one gave me a toot on their horn, they all must have seen it too, it was like christmas lights out there, they were lighting up the hole field in this orangey red colour\r\ni continued watching them in my rear mirror , i asked if everyone is ok and my little girl in the backseat said im scared so we just kept driving \r\n\r\ni wanted to stop i did have a phonecamera but didnt take any pics as i couldnt stop on the road \r\n \r\n\r\ni did see this and thay were not thai  lanterns \r\n","distance":"101-500
