i was travelling home with my 3 daughters. my 6 year old daughter said “daddy, what are those flashing lights in the sky?” i was travelling in the southwest direction and i looked up to my left and i noticed several (approximatley 6) flashing lights up in the sky that appeared to flashing and what i would describe as dancing in the sky. at first i wasn't sure what to make of them. i thought they were some sort of flares or even military aircraft doing some sort of exercise. but since i live in the okanagan valley and there is no air force bases in the area, i knew they were not any of conventional military aircraft. the objects that i was observing were absolutely silent. given the way these object were moving in the sky, i then realized that what i was witnessing was not a normal or easily explainable occurrence and was most likely extra terrestrial in nature. \r\n\r\ni quickly pulled off to the side of the road and grabbed my phoned got out of my vehicle to start video recording the lights. thats when i noticed a second group of (approximatley 4 or 5) that suddenly appeared below the first group. they looked like they were flying closer to okanagan lake before the flew upward to join the first group. the two groups formed two separate formations and proceeded to fly eastward towards kelowna. i had my camera zoomed in and locked on both groups and continued to record them as they were flying away. or so i thought. after approximately 20-30 seconds of “recording”, i realized that i didn’t actually hit the record button on my phone. i quickly hit the record button and was able to zoom in on the luminous objects as they were flying away. i was able to record the lights, (which were flying in two groups, one approximately 6, the other approximately 4) for about 30 seconds until they essentially were out of sight. \r\n\r\nimportant points:\r\n\r\nalthough it was early evening and the sun was starting to set, there was still plenty of daylight outside. these objects were extremely bright in sky. i am absolutely certain they were neither airplanes of any type or birds.\r\nthe objects appeared to be well below the clouds when i first noticed them as well as below the tops of the mountains. the second group of lights appeared tore flying lower in the valley near the lake\r\nalthough it did not occur to me at first but what i witnessed i would describe as orange glowing orbs since i did not observe any sort of metallic craft with any visible lines. only lights\r\nthe objects that i observed were absolutely silent.\r\n","distance":"Over One

couldn't see anything in the sky.  i rushed over to their apartment and saw it from their front door area.  it appeared to be a bright light in the sky to the west of bakersfield, ca.  it was very bright and was larger than a star or planet.  as i was watching it, i noticed it would become very bright for a minute or two, and then would quickly dim the lights and then completely turn them off.  \r\n\r\nas we all watch this, my sister and brother-in-law said when they noticed it, it was changing colors; however, i didn't notice any other colors than white at that time.  we watched it there for about ten minutes, thinking it would quickly go away, but it didn't.  we then decided to get in the car and see if we could get a closer look.  it took at least 30 minutes to get out to where it was, which was just west of bakersfield and east of the i-5 freeway nearest to snow rd.  \r\n\r\nwhenever i would start to get close to it, it would turn it's lights off for a minute or two and then

feeling of fear and dread.  \r\n\r\nlater on that night, the news put a picture up and did a story about it since they received so many calls about it.  they also covered it the next night too since

i was in the same location on my driveway facing west looking at about the same angle on the east side of my house. watched for about 3-4 minutes, nothing, so i moved around to the back side, west side of my house to have a further view west to watch for a few minutes. within just a moment i seen three groups of them coming from the sw heading in the same direction as the night before and about the same altitude, but not moving as fast. each of the three lines of groups had 6-10 dimly lit light tan orbs moving and acting the same as the night before. this night i had my very bright flash light with me and shown it right at them but there was to reflection or change in their path. then about 3 or 4 seconds another object following the same path and at the same altitude came into view but it was definitely a triangle with just 3 lite tan orbs, one of each corner. solid body this one was and i shined my light on it and could see it was solid, and as it passed overhead it would block out the stars behind. it appeared to be about 8 to 10 foot on each side of the craft. the surface of it appeared to be a dull gray with no reflection from my light, and it did not react to my light either.\r\n\r\nthis sighting lasted just a few seconds also as they all passed to the nne and out of my sight. pretty exciting. my cell phone camera could not detect them as they were not bright enough. i am going to be out there again tonight with a digital camera that might pick them up of there is another event. seems odd that both sightings were following the same path and at about the same altitude, with just a slight speed difference.\r\n\r\ni have had a number of sighting while living in this town over the last 17+ years, as have many others here.

feeling of extreme discomfort. we realized it was not a planet, but was positioning itself in a way to appear as one. it had a distinctive hypnotizing effect with its blue light/glow (darker blue to lighter/almost white then back, varying shades and intensities and patterns, very hard not to look at). felt as if it was fairly close, perhaps ~100m. it is hard to be sure, as it felt camouflaged or cloaked to some extent.\r\nas soon as we noticed it and became vocal to one another about it, it may have slightly moved before it vanished for perhaps 1 minute and then reappeared in almost the exact same spot. it disappeared again a moment later, and we made the decision to leave quickly.\r\nwe got back onto the freeway, continuing southbound on i-5. as we left we looked back and could not locate the ufo. there were a couple vehicles as we re-entered the freeway, but they ended up out of our vision shorty after.\r\nwe continued to drive, thinking it was gone. there where no vehicles on the interstate in either direction during the encounters both when we where sitting still and driving.\r\nthen 2-3 minutes later, my girlfriend saw it reappear above and in front of and to the right of the car. it seemed to be matching our speed and course precisely.\r\nit felt larger than it looked, and it had a significant effect on us psychologically. it did not feel \"right\".\r\nas my girlfriend was pointing out the object, several odd events occurred.\r\nmy girlfriend describes getting a sort of tunnel vision, in which she became so fixated on the object as she drove, that she felt as if the rest of her vision was filling in with (black)static, around the object (leaving only the object in her center vision).\r\nbecause of the reaction of my girlfriend, instead of looking at the object, i looked at her in the drivers seat.\r\nat that moment it was as if all the lights went out momentarily and everything was pitch black. as i was looking at her, it felt as if everything \"turned off\", and in that sense i mean my own cognitive processes (sight, sound, feeling etc.) as well as electronic and mechanical. my girlfriend experienced this is the sense that everything disappeared momentarily from her mind except for the object and she felt as if she was being hypnotized. for me it felt like i was numbed completely for a moment and lost all sense of input and it felt as if i was alone in the car, quiet and still but observed. my girlfriend also felt this feeling of being alone in the car suddenly, an uncomfortable void of one sided observation.\r\nneither of us feel we were abducted, it felt more like we were scanned in some way and it was so powerful (or intentionally designed) it overloaded our mind and all of the electronics and car momentarily.\r\nmy girlfriend remembers simply not being able to look away, and being worried about crashing the car due to her inability to focus on the road/fading concentration. something like an insect attracted to light.\r\nafter this moment it disappeared as we both began to exchange animated words. at this point we attempted to find another vehicle. we found a truck and followed it. it never reappeared. we tagged along with other vehicles for the rest of the i-5 mountain range because it seemed to want to isolate us from its behavoir.\r\nour observations and intuition make us believe it was likely no larger than 3m although it did seem to mask itself and undesired of being observed.\r\nit felt cold, calculated, robotic, methodical, curious.","distance":"101-500

live). we were approaching the part of the highway where the speed limit changes to 40 mph because you are going through downtown. we both noticed a light in the distance behind the trees on our left. it was just one dot of orange light that would get brighter and then fade and turn slightly yellow looking. it was around 1:15 am on april 26, 2017, so there was no one else on the road. i slowed down to about 25 mph to try and get enough time to see it before it disappeared behind the trees. after watching this object for about a minute we went around a corner and lost sight of it. when we came all the way around the corner the object moved away from the trees and began to move across the highway towards the parking garage. we noticed that it now looked like three bright orangeish yellow lights, and was clearly some sort of object. the placement of the lights made me think it was triangular in shape. it was not an airplane because it's lights were very large, and not flashing. i also rolled down my window, and even though the object was no more than 200 feet away from our car- there was no sound at all. i turned into the parking garage and raced to the top floor to try and get a good view of it, but by the time we got to the top this object was gone. it must have been able to accelerate at an incredible speed to be completely gone from sight in the 60 seconds or so it took me to get to the third floor of the parking garage. i also feel that it wasn't some kind of drone or toy, because i could tell that it was at least 15 feet wide (based on surrounding objects). my conclusion is that it wasn't any kind of conventional aircraft, like a plane. i've lived near the placerville airport for the past couple years and can easily spot what plane lights look like. this object was not a plane.
