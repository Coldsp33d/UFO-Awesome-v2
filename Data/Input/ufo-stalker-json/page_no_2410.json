(5/30/08). not even a week later (monday june 01, 2008), i witnessed the most alien craft in 1 day.\r\n\r\n9:30 driving with my buddy lucas to go pick someone up. i see a floating light descending from the sky ahead to the north as i have seen ufos do before. i was a little wary but continued driving.\r\n\r\n9:40 as we were arriving to justin's house, i look to the north again and see 6-7 flashing and glowing light descending from the sky like earlier. they move behind the trees as we arrived at justin's house. we leave with justin heading west towards the gulf of mexico. \r\n\r\n9:45 we turn north onto a street that runs along side clearwater beach we are now headed to brandy's house to pick up max, brandy, and john. now we can see the objects clearly. they were floating triangles. they had descended onto north clearwater and were now dispersing in all directions. the closest one was about 0.5 miles due east flying at 500-800 ft silently. it was an easily discernible triangle shape and it was wobbling as it floated. each tip was illuminated with intensely bright yellow lights and a red light in the middle. each light was flashing at separate intervals. the flash would create an intense glow around each corner. the middle red light would also become brilliantly bright. there were 2 other exact triangles in our immediate vicinity. we arrive at brandy's house.\r\n\r\n9:50 max, brandy, and john tell us they can see the triangles at brandy's house. now collectively there is me, lucas, justin, max, brandy, and john. there is not enough room in lucas's truck so i had to sit in the trunk (which i kinda wanted to do anyway so i could see the sky). we proceed south towards largo. as we drove i could see the triangles every few minutes dipping around. as i am staring at one of the triangles hovering the car stops because we thought there was a big triangle approaching from the north. it actually turned out to be a 757 flying low. we laughed at the irony, but as we laughed i noticed that the triangle i had been staring at disappeared as the 757 arrived. \r\n\r\n10:00 we continue south and arrive at a duncan donuts in largo. a few minutes after we arrive we spy a ufo headed east to west with a triangle formation of light on a bigger scale. it was about 150 long and was enormous. it was bigger than the 757 and made no sound as it floated slowly. we could see how thin the triangle was and were becoming frantic. \r\n\r\n\r\n10:30 we head back north towards dunedin to john's house. halfway up there are twin white lights headed towards us from the north. the craft was enormous and the tip was pointed south. the strange thing was is that it was floating east slowly without turning. as we drove directly under it we can see a complex light pattern with up to 10 lights. i can see the design of the craft and it looks similar to an sr-71 blackbird, or the the ship that the x-men used in the movies. it was silent and stopped. the tip suddenly turned east and it rapidly accelerated towards tampa. we then arrive at john's house.\r\n\r\n11:30 all of us had been chilling for awhile at john's house outside and i was still pretty excited about all the crazy things i saw so i looked towards the northern sky to see if anything was there.  immediately i see a classic dark grey disc hovering and rotating about 100 ft directly above dunedin high school, the school i graduated from.  i pointed it out to my friends and then it started moving.  it flitted down and to the right really fast, and then quickly back up to the top right a little bit.  it kept flitting around in the same general vicinty and every once in a while a faint blue light would turn on and spin around with the disc.  from just seeing a few minutes of this event we are all wiggin out so we run out into the street to meet up with the ufo.  as we approach the saucer it's movements become more erractic and then it zooms off out of view in an instant.  we returned to john's house and didn't see anything else the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nsome conclusions that i can draw from these sightings is that there's alot of crazy shit flying around here right now and i've noticed that ufo sightings have exploded around the world in the past few months.  what i can concur is that either the governments around the world have invented and distributed super technology and have not released it to the public, or aliens are starting to make contact and have given the technology to the us government.  it just freaks me out that i don't know if what's flying around is human or alien beings.  i don't know how a human would be able to fly the disc i saw because it accelerated away so fast that the g forces would probably crush our heart.  i'm guessing that the triangles are human aicraft because they just love chilling around macdill airforce base, but i'm sure that some of the rainbow and orange spheres, discs, and star like ufos i've seen are celestial beings.  i hope they make contact soon because i want to have a space ship of my own and escape this planet with my friends and family!\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

with bushwick. it was her last night over and her subletter came so we took her to the roof of the apartment, to show her a perk to the place. while there a bright light, like headlights from an oncoming jet, was shining in our direction. all three of us looked at it in curiousity. the light was slowly sinking and eventually it blinked out. 5 minutes later i looked back in the direction the first light came from, and saw it again. the light seemed to me like it was over the east river, adjacent to the empire state building meaning 34th street.\r\n\r\ni watched the second object, noticing that it was again slowly sinking, only suddenly without realize it'd restart again at it's top point (i could not notice this as it happened rather instantly). i then scanned the skies thinking perhaps there are more of these ufo's around. what i noticed instead were about half a dozen helicopters, all seeming to converge in the vacinity of the single object that originally caught my attention. the object it self, as i said, looked like the headlights of an oncoming jet. \r\n\r\nas the helicopters drew near, all but one of them turned about. the one that remained began to do circles around the object. i was astonished, and ultra curious as to what was going on. on it's third or fourth pass around the light source there was a laser, or some sort of flash, coming from the original light source onto the circling helicopter. the helicopter flashed and then began to flicker, motionless in the sky. my girlfriend thought the helicopter was on fire with the way it was flickering. as the helicopter never fell and crashed i assumed it was attempting some sort of light communication with the light source. after about 10 minutes of the flickering helicoptor the original light source seemed to expand in size and then break apart into three smaller light sources. all three were equal size to the original one. soon after this display all the lights blipped out, except for the flickering helicopter. the flickering on the helicopter continued for a few minutes while i observed the other 5 helicopters return to the location. once all together the flickering stopped and the 6 copters seemed to scower the area looking for something they had lost, and eventually my girlfriend lost interest and asked me to come inside. i oblidged. \r\n\r\nbefore coming in i scowered the sky one last time, and noticed a similar light far south over what seemed to be coney island, or manhattan beach. i didn't stick around to watch it however.\r\n\r\nany other reports of a similar sighting around the same time/area?\r\n\r\ni'd like to point out, as this mufon report is a couple weeks after the sighting, that the times i gave with this report are not very accurate. \r\ni do believe it was around 1:30-2:30am.\r\n\r\n\r\nbelow was my ats report, which will follow with a link to the thread.\r\n\r\n\"last night i saw something in the sky that i couldn't identify, thusly i believe it to be a ufo. i was at my girlfriends house in bushwick, hanging out on her roof when suddenly my attention turned towards the city where i saw half a dozen helicopters, all seeming to converge in a single direction. i correlated the direction they were flying too but saw nothing. i began pacing back and forth and then boom i saw some very bright yellow/orange light hovering, almost gliding over the east river around 34th street. this light was very uniformed and slowly sinking until eventually it blipped out. in it's place a second light appeared, brighter and bigger, swaying ever so slightly left and right. the helicopters came close to the light source, and suddenly all but one turned around. the one remaining moved ever closer. after doing a 360 around the light source it erupted in flickering light. my girlfriend said it was on fire, but the helicopter looked more like it was putting on a light show, perhaps trying to communicate with the light source with patterns of light. after about 10 minutes the light source the helicopters were converging onto expanded in size, looked to me like it split into three light sources, and then blipped out. the flashing helicopter started flying back and forth as it's helicopter buddies returned and then seemed to scavenge the area. after 5 minutes of making circles around each other the flashing helicopter turned

 the plane was over the atlantic about 45 minutes or so from crossing newfoundland (i know that because i was watching the map monitor in the front of the plane's cabin which displayed where the plane was). above i say massachusetts and the u.S. because i had to put something in order to send this (and of course it was neither). it was, as stated above, over the atlantic. off to the left, ahead of the plane and considerably below was a very bright white light.  at first i wondered what it might be, and when i realized that we were nowhere near land my curiosity picked up.  it seemed too  big for a ship (considering the plane's altitude) and there was too much light for a ship to display (especially given that there was still a fair amount of daylight out there).  it did'nt seem to be moving, and eventually we passed it, and looking out the window and this time behind the plane i could still see it. it still shone with that very bright white light, and the shape seemed a little clearer (kind of like a pyramid except that the tip was not centered but significantly to the right).  i assumed it wasn't moving, so i figured it wasn't a ufo or something (i have never before seen one, and it certainly wasn't another plane.)  i wondered if it wasn't a big iceberg catching the sun's rays.  a couple of days later i saw the story, with pictures, about the sightings in england. the shape of the ufo in one of the photos was exactly like i had seen, and the light was also white!  then i began to think about what i saw and it occurred to me that it was highly unlikely that it was an iceberg catching the light of the fading sun.  to be specific, the light was the same (white and intense) when i looked at it ahead of the plane (to the west) and when i looked at it behind the plane (to the east). the sun was starting to set in the east, so how could it so brightly illuminate it as i observed it both to the west (ahead of the plane) and to the east (behind the plane).  that didn't seem to make any sense.  also (though i don't know for sure), it might have been moving.  it didn't seem so to me, but the plane was probably flying at about 500 mph, and an object moving -- but at a much slower speed (say 50 or 100 mph?) -- wouldn't necessarily appear to be moving. in any event, a very curious sighting (especially given all the events and photos happening just a few days later over england). unfortunately, i didn't have a camera, so i didn't take any pictures.","distance":"Over One

15.  as i recall, it was about 1am.  her room was on the first floor at the front of the house.  i was sitting on the bed & she was in a chair to my right with her back to the window.  i looked over at her in conversation and a bright orange light outside the window caught my attention ��� i don���t recall any curtains or shades on the window so my view was clear.  i said ���look��� & ran to the window.  she followed & we just stood there in silence and watched a craft lifting off from the front yard.  i didn���t see the top or sides of it, only the underside.  it was larger than a car but smaller than a house, rectangular in shape and the underside was just an indescribable mass of flashing lights and tubes and completely bright, neon orange in color.  it was completely silent and slowly lifted up over the house and then was gone from our line of vision. we immediately ran out the front door and looked around but it was gone.\r\n\r\nthe whole sighting lasted for probably under a minute but i can still see it in my mind���s eye perfectly like it happened yesterday.  i never felt any fear, just completely amazed and excited.  we knew what it wasn���t (plane, helicopter, blimp, etc.) but i don���t remember the word ���ufo��� really entering my mind, though i think we both knew deep down it was the real thing.  at that time ufos weren���t really something i thought about or knew anything about.  i wish now we had searched the front lawn for evidence of a landing sight, or knocked on the neighbor���s doors to ask if they saw it, but that just never occurred to us at the time.\r\n\r\nwe woke her parents who i think were a bit doubtful, but believed us to a certain extent because we were so adamant about what we saw.  nobody knew what to do so we called the local airport (dulles int���l) & asked if there had been any other reports of strange flying crafts & were told no.  so after that, and for the next 25+ years, i pretty much didn���t think about it.  anytime i mentioned it people would just laugh and roll their eyes so it was just easier to ignore the whole experience.  however lately, the last 6-12 months, i have found myself thinking about this experience daily, almost compulsively.  i���ve felt the need to research and do as much reading on the subject of ufos to try and understand what i experienced which has also led to me filing this report.  \r\n\r\none other interesting thing to note is during this same time frame (my late teens, early 20���s) i did have a few experiences of waking up in the middle of the night in a state of paralysis, unable to move but mentally awake.  i also developed at that time what i considered a completely irrational fear of the dark and would watch tv (in my room) as late as possible trying to stay awake and then eventually sleep with the light on.  i was way too embarrassed to ever mention this to anyone and i never associated it with the ufo sighting.  however, now that i���ve been reading about visitation/abduction experiences i���m wondering if there was a connection. \r\n","distance":"21-100

thinking it was landing, it passed over a car about 7/4 mile ahead of me.\r\ni came to a stop and it began to move over the fields to my left(north).\r\nit was about 200ft. up and just off the roadway. i turned off my radio\r\nand rolled down my window. there was no sound. it was moving very slowly\r\n(2 mph). after 5-10 seconds a truck passed the intersection for the arsenal.\r\ni put my car in first and went on to work. when i got to the pena on-ramp\r\ni looked back and it was still over the same area.\r\n\r\ndescription- a large white globe type light near the front of the vehivle,\r\nbut on the left side. this light illuminated the area to about 10ft. all around it. i could see the left side and it looked metallic and gray in color. there were 2 more light on this side of the vehicle(both red).\r\nabout 30ft. to the right side(my left) there was another smaller white light. i couldn't see a wing on the left side(my right). it was maybe 25ft.\r\nfrom nose to tail and maybe 30ft. from the red light on the left side to the smaller white light on the right. the red lights were blinking.\r\n\r\ni've worked around all types of airplanes for 15 years. this was not any

seen. \r\n\r\nthis probably could have been seen from c tower at dia. certainly could have been on their radar.","distance":"101-500

star/venus like object moving slowly(30-50mph) due north to due south. very brightly reflecting the sun, or ceating it's own light. if i squinted, i was barely able to make out a silver cigar like body, very hard to see with the glare. altitude was about 10 thousand feet. i've never seen anything like it. i have an aviation background, so i'm familiar with aircraft. i was in the military for 10 years, as a flight operation specialist( atc). eventually(20 min) it got about 5 miles away, and was still brightly visable lower on the horizon. as i watched, it made some sudden turns, and sped away at a rate that i can barely explain. almost like going to warp drive. that is a crude referance, but that is the closest i can come to describing it. i have 20/20 or better vision, and i don't require glasses. i thought it may have been a drone aircraft at first, but why was it where it was, and the performance that it had when it left, was beyone what i know that unmanned drones can do. i is literally the first time that i saw something in the clear blue sky, that i could not identify. i also had 3 other witnesses. i believe one other was as intrigued as myself. the other 2 thought it may have been a helicopter. but it was too high and just did not fit was a copter sounds like or looks like. i have a helocopter aviation background, and i very familiar with them.","distance":"Over One

beach on the shore of sredneuralsk water reserve basin. we were not under effect of any alcohol or drugs. we only had mango juice and mineral water with us to drink. it was evening but the sun still shined hot. on the sky there were 2 layers of clouds, both rather sparse. there were several low placed, typical pillow style, dense clouds, and way higher above these, at about the height jet planes fly, there were the feathery thin, fine, semi-transparent clouds.\r\n\r\nironically, it was my habit of drinking *all* the fruit juice from the box that made me discover the ufo in the first place. i raised my eyes to the zenith while putting the juice box to my mouth. at first i noticed some tiny flies going chaotically about 30 to 80 cm above our heads. and then, looking through the gathering of flies, i noticed the ufo. it was a very small, wing-shaped (german ww2 era fw-190 fighter wing shape comes to mind as a close match) body that reflected solar light as if it was made of metal. at first split second i mistook it for a gleam of reflected light produced by my glasses, but it moved independently from the movements of my head. my next thought was that it's a small, sunlit spider borne by wind on a piece of its web (the wind close the ground was directed that way, roughly in the direction of the sun). but i looked harder, and the sharp lines of the ufo, perceived distance to it and its determined behavior made it clear to me that it was not any living creature i could compare it against.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was traveling unnaturally fast for a plane, much less a helicopter. it produced no audible sounds. it changed its course slightly and abruptly, making a zigzag shaped trajectory (whereas man-made airplanes change course in a curve, and helicopters have to slow down before changing course at a geometrically precise angle; this ufo just went a different course without warning). i tried to show the ufo to my girlfriend (unlike me, she has perfect vision), but it was just too small and too fast moving. in less than 10 seconds i could no longer see it because it went under the high, thin cloud that was lit by the sun, making the ufo invisible on its background.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend was extremely interested in the ufo, so she began purposely staring in that region of the sky. in about 3 or 5 minutes, she noticed it again, because it came back and stopped, hovering up there at a height of several kilometers (we both coincided on such height estimate; the ufo was located in between the two layers of clouds).\r\n\r\nwithin 15 or 20 seconds she explained to me where to look at to see the ufo, and i too was now able to see it. the ufo hovered in place. it looked like a cigar made of metal, orientated horizontally. it was making turns about the vertical axis, as if sniffing for something or looking around. the sun was to the right of it and slightly higher. when it turned to us its right side, we could see it reflect the sunlight. when it turned left side, we could see it as a dark shape, as if the object was opaque. when it turned away from us, we could not see it, as if it was thin in cross section.\r\n\r\nafter about a minute of hovering, the ufo took off abruptly and flew away, disappearing over the background of clouds just like it did before.\r\n\r\nour feelings were nothing beyond the expected. we are not ufo seekers, meaning that we don't take active interest in paranormal phenomena. because of not being accustomed to seeing this stuff, we were thoroughly interested and happy from the fact that we finally saw a real ufo. we did not perceive  our feelings or anything to be externally, explicitly manipulated by the ufo presence.\r\n\r\nall the other people on the beach were too busy with themselves (in their usual routine of drinking and cursing) to notice anything so sublime. besides, they are the kind of people that seldom look at the sky at all.","distance":"Over One
