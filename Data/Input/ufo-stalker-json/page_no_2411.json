were on 31e, heading into madison tn., when a glowing silverish red object, tree top high, crossed the highway in front of us. it looked as if it had just entered the earths atmosphere. the glow looked similar to a nasa module that is red hot on the fringe of the craft but shiny silver in the center during re-entry. the craft definitely had a fuselage because of the glowing blue flame that was emitted from the rear and clearly visible compared to the glowing area in the front. the shape was similar to a light bulb but more teardropped in the front. it was actually similar to staring at a light bulb on its side.  you could see the parameters of the outside but the glow restricted the sharp outside edge of the craft, except in the rear. it was approx. 30 ft long and 8 ft high. the craft crossed the highway parallel to the ground from south to north and disappeared over the trees to the north. it made no noise, but the bunson burner like blue flame flickered from the rear of the craft at the same pace as the approx. 30 mph speed it was traveling.  it was viewed by us to be an ufo from the very beginning.   i am a retired aerospace tooling liaison engineer and i worked 5

(witness basing on the mileage between sedgwick and ovid exits being about 7 miles). the lights appeared to be about 5 foot off the ground moving slowly around the field. witness stated that she thought to herself that she would get a newspaper and see what happened in the area where such a large search would be going on. \r\n\r\nwitness then recalled that at / or in the same tree line she had seen  amber blinking light(s) every night  during the 21/2 weeks prior to this incident as she was there as site (generator) operator. this night was her last night on that work site. she had thought the lights all along were city lights, but now they were not in the tree line (north of the river) they were down into and over the field. she thinks now south of the river. witness did not recall a moon, stated if there was one it wasn���t giving any light as it was pretty dark that night.\r\n\r\na large mass of lights that appeared to be on one craft and seemed to be stationary and hovering. the lights were in an organized pattern or formation. these groups of lights were about 10 to 20 foot high, she could not really see the side of the craft but thought around the actual lights it looked solid or be a rim of some sort. kind of a holograms or illusion of some type. \r\n\r\neast direction, more toward the ovid exit. 36 individual bright intense white lights, about the size of softballs were moving about the stationary ones. witness stated she thought it looked like they may have been attached to something. all lights appeared to be to be staying in a formation or pattern staying about 5 foot of the ground, the area these lights covered was about 4 miles. witness could see lights in at about knee level and above the tall grass at about 5 foot high. they seemed to be moving toward the ���stationary��� set of lights. the lights reminded her of a long ���airport runway���. \r\n\r\nwitness stated the whole mass would move, stop, and just hover. then move, stop and hover.\r\nno noise, no smell just lights.\r\nwhen witness realized this just was not ���normal��� the tree line lights moved and were covering a ���huge��� area in the field. witness grabbed her camera exited her work truck and tried to take a picture. (camera was at full battery power). her camera kept powering off. she attempted 3 times to take pictures. she was unable to take any pictures at this point it would just turn off. she stood watching the mass of lights for a few minutes, they continued to move and hover and stop and move again. the whole thing remaining all part of a ���pattern��� or formation. witness stated that she had an ���overwhelming and extreme, again ���extreme��� sense of calmness came over her��� she was not scared in the least. \r\n\r\nat this point, unable to use camera, she went back to her truck, got in and tried using her binoculars which didn���t impress her.\r\n\r\nthe witness stated that she had an overwhelming voice in her mind tell her ���you have to record the pattern of lights. you must record them. write the light patterns down. it will help people to understand and believe this story���.  she stated ���it��� was telling her to do this and she knew it was. no doubt! she proceeded to write on paper what the pattern of lights was. she stated that it kept strongly coming into her head that there was a ���meaning��� in these patterns and it was very important she write it down.\r\n\r\npage 2 of 4\r\n\r\nthe witness stated that 2 semi truck drivers had seen what was going on and had stopped right in the traffic flow pattern and remained there about 10 to 15 minutes. they did not exit their vehicles then they left.\r\n\r\nall at once the the craft went from being about 4 miles large to about 2 miles long and about 20 feet wide. the individual white lights covered an area about the size of a football field at this point. still making the same movements but no noise. witness stated it was if she blinked and it was all a different size. smaller.  then what witness referred to as ���the mother-ship��� was about the size of a large two story house. it did not appear to be moving when it changed size.  all the lights just covered a much smaller area. everything just looked long and narrow. camera still would not operate, she kept trying. lights remained in same formation, reminding her of an airport runway.\r\n\r\n(confusing) \r\nwitness seems to be ���oddly��� confused and could not sort out the chain of events and how and when she took pictures and was getting in and out of the truck. the picture taken out of the passenger side window seemed ���out of sequence��� to her. she stated she just could not remember. she further stated that the chain of events as far as her in and out of the truck and how she took pictures didn���t make any sense to her. why get out get in like she said she did. \r\n\r\nif understanding witness accurately, the mass of lights moved very close to her. within 20 feet. it again changed size as if she blinked and it was different size.  it went from being the size of a two story house to the size of about a coffee can. still all the independent lights remaining around it. the independent lights covered and area around the ���mother-ship��� about 5 feet long all around it. at this point it was about 1 foot over the top of her generator while the generator was operating. the generator operates quite so she could not detect a power change in the generator.  at this point she was able to take a picture through the truck passenger side window; she took the one from inside the truck and jumped out of the truck. slowly she inched her way closer toward the generator. she thought she ended up about 5 foot from the generator. she was ���allowed��� to take 4 more pictures of the lights over the generator. it was at this point the camera batteries went ���abnormally��� dead. the mass of lights remained over the generator for 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nwitness stated it started to get light outside and the mass of lights jumped to being larger again, then larger like it was originally. it moved back out into the field and spread out again. as the sun came up it just disappeared.  the field was just empty again. \r\n\r\nwitness shut down and closed the generator down for the day and left the site. witness has not returned to this site since incident.\r\n\r\nthe witness stated that the whole time all the lights always seemed to remain in a pattern or formation.\r\n\r\nlights did get brighter as the came closer to the ���mother-ship���, then diminished some in intensity as they moved farther away from it. but the ���mother-ship��� lights always stayed the same brightness, not really changing.\r\nwitness stated she got the sense like maybe the smaller lights were pulling power from the larger mass or ���mother-ship���. the lights on the ���mother-ship��� where always bright and very intense. they did change color (no color pattern indicated by witness). the colors changed from; blue, green, red, white and yellow. \r\n\r\nwitness told coworkers that were to take over that work site what she had experienced there. a couple of days later she received a message that a couple of the workmen had walked out into the field where the generator is located and where this occurred and had found 3 dead cattle. they were freaked out and left the field. they called mary to tell her of their find. there are no known farms in that immediate area with cattle. if unable to locate corpses, or if more information on exact area where cattle are, mary maybe able to contact these men through proper work channels to locate them. may take sometime. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npage 3 of 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen witness went home that day she downloaded the pictures into her tv to show her brother. that is when she saw the ���creature��� standing near the generator looking back at her. the ���creature appears to be more of a side view. in the picture it is located in the lower left hand corner of the frame. witness stated that there was another object which she was not sure what it was. maybe a hatch looking object. this was the first picture she was allowed to take. it was while she was in the truck, looking out the truck passenger side window. witness indicated there is an amber type light in the picture. not sure if it was from overhead street lights or something else. but that the creature was kind of transparent, you can see grass through his body behind him. witness stated he was only about \r\n3 or 31/2 foot tall. the crafts are in the main part of the picture. \r\n\r\nmary indicated that she definitely now has a different outlook on life. she has always believed in god and jesus. but the experience has given her a closer feeling spiritually. for sure a reality checks of sorts. \r\nthe incident has given her a more ���carefree��� insight of life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother information:\r\ntree line where lights were first noticed prior to the incident. \r\nif your back is up to the generator the hitch will be east side. you face north and west. right in front of that tree line north of the river is where the lights were noted ongoing for the 21/2 weeks prior to the incident. \r\n\r\nmary���s photos are copyrighted. she does not want them posted on any web site or on the internet, she is not releasing for public view or domain. she will not e-mail them to anyone. \r\nshe will set up a meeting with a comufon investigator to review any information and show pictures to, and give sketches and map drawings to the investigator.\r\nshe would release pictures to comufon state director to download into her laptop computer for analysis for research and investigation purpose only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npage 4 of 4\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":11278,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9605474,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06232008-0007","longitude":-102.3879647,"occurred":1210834800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1210834800000,"summary":"See below incident","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Ovid, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:362398"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Garland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I came out of the  movie theater to notice a bright light in the sky. on the way home i watched the light with the truck window rolled down. when i got home i thought i would take some pictures of it to see if anything turned out. i used the full zoom on my digital camera. i also was able to film the object. i tried to compare a red blinking tower on one side and the moon on the other of the object in the video. i think they showed up brighter than the object as red and a bright light, but they didn't show up very well. they also showed up on the far left or right side of the video quickly. the object is smaller and looks like it is blinking and possibly changing colors.

daily and we have several files of wildlife pictures using this camera with no previous anomalies. there were 33 pictures taken june 19-june 20, 2008. the event pictures began with image 18,june 20, 2008 at 4:29 a.M., where a deer is looking back toward the tree line where the object was photographed. picture 19 shows the image of the cylindrical object at about a 45 degree angle. this object was stationary and did not appear to be moving. unfortunately, i tried to enhance the object by zooming in, and ended up cropping the picture so the deer was not visible. however the cylider is very clear in this picture. image 20 was taken at 4:46 a.M. with the deer and the object is clearly visible in the background, still at about a 45 degree angle on the tree line and it had not moved. image 21 still has the object in the same place, however i tried to zoom in and cut out the deer. image 22, taken at 5:05 a.M. shows the deer, but the object has moved and is in a horizontal position. there is also a white light to the right of it, however that may be a drop of water on the lense of the camera. image 23, taken at 5:46 a.M. shows just the deer. the cylindrical object is gone. i am including images 24,25,& 26 because they show the background and the tree line. this camera is stationary and is never moved. i am only able to submit images 19,20, & 22.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

notice bright disk through trees up and forward of us. being an airline employee i first assumed the object to be a commercial airline with the sun reflecting off of its aluminum fuselage coming in for an approach to a local airport. i would guess object was 2,000 feet asl and it did not show any airspeed. the object was bright for one of the three seconds that we saw it and then for the two remaining seconds was a dark gray disk. the craft cloaked and became invisible after that so we pulled over to get out of the car to maybe hear or see the craft reappear but with no such luck

static in the air that raised the hairs on my arms and neck and what could only be described as the feeling of walking through a giant magnetic chamber as to the waves of magnetic resonanance that i felt when the thing first got my attention. the object was like an elongated tear drop shape that didn't alter orin any way and as i stated earlier, it would dart off in one direction then come to a dead stop from a blazing speed with out slowing down and then wouldjust as suddenly change direction some times without even stopping.
