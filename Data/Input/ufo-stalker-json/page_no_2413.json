when i see something out on the lake. hard to even focus on at first on the account of it being so dim. a few seconds later it begins to get a lot brighter, to the point where it is clearly clearly visible. then the object starts to move about, going right, left, up, and down. never moving in a circular motion, only at angles. it moved so fast at one point that it a created a red trail, or so my eyes perceived. then another astonishing movement, it disappeared then a few seconds later the object re-appeared about 50 feet away from its original point of origin. yet preceded to return to central point after every spasm. at first i thought it could just be some kids on the shore on the other side playing with some sort of light, but when i say it was hovering over the water, you could see the reflection on the water directly beneath the object. so i could put a perspective on where the object was placed, obviously not on shore. it was in front of all of the trees and bushes and looked quite large. the first thing that made me notice this was a weird kind of sound emanating from that direction. did not sound mechanical. it had more of a grunt. something sounded vocal. but not necessarily human. this happened once, and a sound was never heard again. what ended the confrontation was just a disappearance. it just stopped blinking and that was the end of it. i couldn't see a rough outline of maybe a solid object. this object was more ethereal. i take things like this very seriously, and am not hoaxing. the point of this report is for my own knowledge to see if anyone else in the area has seen anything similar.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you for your

neighborhood and i would spend alot of time just walking around and talking about our lives in general. on one such night we were doing just that when we turned a corner and noticed what we at first thought was a large star hovering over the hill across the street from where we lived. after watching it for a few minutes we realized that it was no star -- it was too large and too close. as soon as we realized this fact the object suddenly changed into a football shaped orange light and began to move to what was our right until it was out of sight.\r\n\r\ntwo weeks later we were out walking again and, turning the same corner, there it was again. and again it turned into an orange football ahaped light and slowly moved away to the right. \r\n\r\na few weeks later i walked into chemistry class to find that another class had joined us in the room and we weren't going to be discussing chemistry that day. evidently, three of the teachers in our school had been involved in a pretty spectacular ufo sighting one morning while driving to work on rt. 16. they had reported the experience to mufon and had asked the field investigator to come to our school and talk to us.\r\n\r\nnear the end of his talk he mentioned that he had been out in our neighborhood recently looking to verify a report he was working on -- a bright star-like object that turned into an orange football shaped light!! i told him that i had seen it also but that he was too late in the evening--it was already gone by that time. then another boy in the class spoke up and said that he had also seen it -- he lived on the other side of the hill where we had seen it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

like it was yesterday.  my mom, dad and my sisters went in the store.  my two brothers and i stayed outside and played a game of chase in the lot across the street.  i was the youngest of the two. probably around 7 or 8 yrs old.  now, had it not been for my two brothers to colaborate this story i would have wrote it off as a dream.  every now and then i confirm it with them. it seems that my parents weren't in the store very long which seems strange.  nevertheless,  the then long john silver restaurant was full of dinners. the parking lot was parallel to an alley wich was perpendicular to another alley forming a t-intersection.  we were interupted by a bright combination of lights which started at the end of the perpendicular alley.  it was flying like right at the top of the houses which are no more than two stories.  it was dead silent, cigar shaped with lights on the outer perimiter all the way around.  it seemed  to have had every color in the spectrum.  it slowly aproached us at the t-intersection.  it turned side ways right above the parallel alley and in front of us. i remember a long second and then it vanished before my vary eyes.  i've never seen anything move that fast then or since.  we looked at one another knowing what we all had experinced something unreal.  it seems imediatlly after that my parents exited the store. we looked at one another knowing what we all had experinced.  no one believes me when i tell my story.  after that i remember having weird dreams of climbing invisible stairs into the stary heavens and of being abducted by aliens.  my dreams are very vague now.  \r\n\r\nwhen we moved to north carolina i would get the so called \"stick\".  like i'm being held down and when i would open my eyes there would be this huge unearthly head beside me where my brother's should be.  all those things have ceased.  that's not to say that they are related to the incident.  however, watching the program about metalic objects in the bodies of those who have witnessed sightings, caused me to remember an object in my right lower leg like right on top, slightly to the side of my shin.  it seems to move freely or slip away from my finger when i put pressure on it but for years has stayed in the same place.  i always wondered if i had, at some point in time, fell and injured myself allowing this to enter my leg, but there is no visible scar.  i remember being up at night investigating my leg and playing with it only to get irritated.  just tonite 06\\21\\08 i attempted to relocate it in my leg since i've not felt it in a while only to discover that it's still there playing the same tricks.  it's kind of sore when i press down on it now, maybe i'll get a magnet to check it out.  i have a sister who swears that she remembers being on a ufo being probed and stuff.  that, of course, was when we lived in garland, north carolina a very rural area.  i would be willing to go under hipnoces to get some closer.  i don't believe, i know they exist.  i don't beleve my parents beleived us.  even though i can still hear my dad say, \"you think this is all god got?\"  \r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely \r\n\r\nlovie hunter\r\n36 years

 i���m getting out of here.���, and attempted to accelerate around the craft.  her young son, according to the witness was crying and lying on the back seat floor.  the witness does not recall passing the craft or turning left toward meredith.  she had no continuous memory of what came next.  as if no time had passed, her next memory was of driving on the northbound ramp exit 23 on the opposite side of i-93.  her son was no longer crying.  shaken, she pulled into a garage on the north side of route 104 owned by mr. (anonymous), whom she knew.  she described her emotional state as laughing, crying, scared and excited. \r\n\r\nthere were several men in the garage and she asked them to join her outside to assure her she wasn���t seeing what she thought she was seeing.  they all observed a boomerang shaped craft that was up on its side between the garage and the trees adjacent to the garage.  she couldn���t estimate its size but said that it was almost as long as the garage in height.  there was a pattern on the craft that she couldn���t reproduce exactly.  the silent object moved slowly behind the garage.  orange and yellow steady lights lined the front edge of the boomerang.  \r\n\r\nthe witness and her friend returned to her car and proceeded east on route 104.  they observed the craft which seemed to pace her vehicle \r\n\r\nthe witness stated that when they arrived at their destination they were excited, happy and scared.  her son, who was normally outgoing and active, sat quietly on the couch.  the witness���s father went outside to attempt to observe the craft but it was no longer in sight.  the gospel singers had completed their practice and were preparing to leave. the witness guessed that she arrived at her parents��� home least an hour later than expected.  \r\n\r\nthe witness���s eyes were burning pressure and pain about a week later.  both witnesses would occasionally experience this strange tingling between their eyebrows, which signaled them that a ufo was nearby.  they drove to the sensed location and observed ufos on several occasions. they saw a light (like the one on i-93 and the boomerang) moving above the lake.  it was never as large as the ones in their first sighting.  orange, white, blue and maybe green.  they could go up, down, sideways, zigzagging, moved away at an incredibly fast rate, almost as if it had turned its lights out.  \r\n\r\nthe witness stated that she and her friend often experienced a tingling sensation between their eyebrows after the ufo encounter and ���sensed��� that they should drive to a designated location to observe a ufo.  they complied with this sensory input and observed what she described as 20-30 ufo sightings over a two year period.  on one occasion her mother videotaped the ufo but her grandmother accidently taped over it, she stated.\r\n\r\nat night she sometimes would feel this sensation like they���re coming and felt that they were coming before she went to bed at night.���  she felt that they could come through walls.  witness reported that she hadn���t read any books and had never heard that they could pass through walls.  she recalls the sensation of someone in her bedroom but does not recall observing anyone.  she said it was the feeling of getting a physical from a doctor.  she could see shadows a lot of big black eyes all around her and touching her.  she felt like she was suspended in the air.  she would feel like she didn���t like it and wanted to go back home. this would frighten her and she would remain awake for a while.  she would have these flashes of memory when she woke up in the morning.  she has considered hypnosis and stated that she would like to know, but at the same time doesn���t want to know.  \r\n\r\nthe witness���s friend m----- remarried and moved to england.  i have emailed an inquiry to her but have not received a reply.  l----- informed me that m----- intends to respond to my inquiry, so i am waiting to hear from her.\r\n\r\nthe garage owner refuses to discuss his ufo observation.  he suffered criticism and humiliation following the newspaper publicity and wants to ���forget about it.��� additionally, he is caring for his aged wife and wants to be left alone.  \r\n\r\ni traveled to laconia, nh���s library and spent the day researching its newspaper archives for september 15, 1978-march 31, 1979 and september 15, 1979-march 31, 1980.  it was a 150 mile round trip journey.  i wasn���t able to locate the ufo sighting report.   \r\n\r\ni have researched the mufon, nuforc and nicap archives and have not been able to locate this sighting report. my investigation is temporarily on hold until i receive more precise

Arthur","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i was at my friends house waiting on him to come home. it was sept 10th or so at 3:00 am or so, it was a friday . he was a musician and got off work about 2:00 in the morning. i was sitting on the hood of my car eating a pack of m&m's looking down this road i had lived on for 3 years or so (i lived there from about 11 to 14 years old and had spent many nights walking this street. in those days it was not dangerous.)i had just gotten my drivers licence at 15 ( a hardship licence ) i was looking at what i thought was an arial antena light that i thought must surely have just been installed. but it looked strange the light was kind of big for an arial light and the light did not glow. you know streams of light from the light. it was about 1 and 1/4 a mile and a few feet from me.\r\n  as i looked i thought i'm going to get closer to it and while still looking at it i started to move off the hood of my car. as i slid to the edge of the hood it started moving slowly and smoothly to the left of my position. at that point still looking at it i kind of freaked and jumped off the hood when i did it started moving just a little faster.\r\n  at first i just stared at it for a minute. then for some unknown reason to me i decided to follow it. i guess being 15 years old and somewhat wild in nature i did not realize that it could have been dangerous. it was not. that side of town was set up in a large rectangular grid. from 61st to 66th the streets were and are about 2 miles long, at one end the cross street is west port arthur road. at the other is jade rd. the sreet crossing in the middle is garnet ave i believe. i was sitting on 65th facing jade in between west port arthur and garnet. almost dirrectly center between the two roads.\r\n  as i took off following it, it went towards 64th on my left. i went down to jade and turned left, i saw it slowly moving passed 64th and 63rd and then it went below the trees. i drove down and turned left down 63rd. then left on garnet then left again on 64th. i saw it again then and it flew kind of in a circle ( not exactly but it vered around me.) when it came around again it went below the trees and came up closer to me.\r\n  at that point i got the distinct feeling it was playing hide and seek with me. it flew up a little higher and flew west toward dick dowling elementary school. i followed it out there and lost contact or my visual of it. i was on the road next to the school, the south side. i got out of my car and stood on the running board with one elbow on the roof and one elbow on the top of the door and i looked around in the sky for a while, a minute anyway. \r\n  i looked right above me and about 2 to 3 miles straight above me it was just sitting in the sky. as i stared it, it just took off west at what can only be light speed. it disapeared not behind anything, but in about 1 second it went so fast in that direction it got to small for me to see and left me looking around for it, for about 7 or 8 seconds. then it came back from exactly the opposite direction, or like it had went around the earth once and stopped at the same spot exactly. and when it stopped it had no wobble, like you might expect something moving that fast to have when it stopped. \r\n  it scared me at that point and i took off. but i was not the kind of kid that scared easy. and as you might imagine no one believed me. my brother said it might have been something nasa was working with, (nasa was only about 100 miles away in houston.) and the reason we don't see it in the papers is it is secret or it is just to expensive to run. but i do not believe what i saw was man made. and if it is a man made craft i can tell you now that man and probably woman have been out of this solor system and probably at least fairly deep into this galaxy. and maybe way out of this galaxy.\r\n it was not man made, it was to small for a man in the first place and if it was remote control our technology is very advanced. much more than anything the common man can imagine. reguardless of where the technology  comes from, again i think it was alien made and alien run.

(it was a very clear and warm day.) to my amazement, i saw a large, onyx-color, trianglular ufo in the southeastern sky (just over the cities of san diego/national city/chula vista and the 32nd st. naval base.\r\n  \r\nthe object was vertically stationery throughout viewing, with occasional twisting motions (left-to-right) of the object. the object's triangular shape had rounded edges, with a luminescent inner layer, and a see-through \"sky\" core. it was really high in the sky, and i made sure i knew it wasn't a helicopter, plane, hot-air balloon. there were no propellers, wings, flames, basket... nothing. just a blackish, triangular, almost diamond-shaped object. \r\n\r\ni immediately pulled over to the curb and put my emergency flashers on. i began to take two pixs on my cell phone camera while still in my car. however, i could not see the object, so i had to snap the shots in the general direction of where i was seeing this object. it took me about 10 minutes. it was hard to see at times because of the glare of sunlight. \r\n\r\npreparing to take the next two pixs, i took my glasses off (which are translucent glasses--changes to uv tint when outdoors) so i could see the object more clearly. to my surprise, i could not see the object at all, only the clear-blue sky. when i put my tinted glasses back on, i saw it clearly visible. what i found was that it was not visible with the naked eyes, only visible when wearing my tinted uv glasses. immediately, i got the sense it knew i was watching it and taking the pixs, and suddently the object vanished--not flew away! i was excited by the event and it stayed on my mind aftwards for about 2 hours. i then went home and decided to draw what it was. i struggled with it, because i noticed it appeared to shape-shift. from diamond-like to triangular to twisting and turning.\r\n\r\nironically, the naval base was near its vicinity. the fact that there were no jets dispatched, led me to believe it had cloaked itself--if i couldn't see it with my naked eyes, only when i had my tinted glasses on, i imagine it wasn't making itself obvious to anything else. however, this object was of significant size. wow, what an experience!!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11251,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.6804085,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06212008-0004","longitude":-117.0953767,"occurred":1213987500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,  Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1213987500000,"summary":"I saw a large, onyx-color, trianglular ufo in the southeastern sky (just over the national city/chula vista/north island naval base areas.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/11251_submitter_file1__UFO1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/11251_submitter_file2__UFO2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/11251_submitter_file3__UFO3.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"National City, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:362453"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Escondido","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My daughter was sitting at the computer. our front door was open due to the warm weather. she looked out the doorway and noticed something falling from the sky. at first she thought it was a shooting star, but it lasted far too long. she then said \"do you see that\" and pointed at the sky through the door. my husband then looked and saw the object. his comment was that it looked like the moon was falling. my daughter said it first flashed green lights, then glowed red like a meteor enterring the atmoshpere, then it smoked, then it glowed geen again, then fireballed. it finally dropped down between two trees to the northwest of our house. the object was so large that she expected to hear or feel a large boom when it actually landed, but we didn't hear or feel anything.\r\n\r\ndid anyone else report this sighting?

cousins.I pulled to the side of the road and stopped to light a cigarette.After doing so,i noticed some strange looking lights in the sky very near us.My son and i then observed two brightly colored orbs of light.One blue-one red.They seemed to be going into and out of a small cloud.Visible one moment,and obstructed the next.That's when we saw it.We watched in shock and disbelief as the disc shaped craft emerged from the small cloud and silently and swiftly ascended to less than fifty yards from our car.It continued to slowly move to about thirty yards from us.They were close enough for me to see them looking at us through windows.They seemed to be somewhat small from that distance.Sudden fear overcame me and i remeber attempting to drive off as fast as i could.Then next thing we remember is we are still in the car the cigarette has burned up in the ashtray,the car is not running now,and we are sitting slumped over in the seats.I looked up and watched the craft leave the area.I started the car and we drove home as fast as we could.We both felt like we had been asleep or drugged or hipnotised.We checked in with my cousin upon returning home.He confirmed our hunch about the missing  time at least thirty minutes,maybe forty five minutes were missing not to mention the cigarette i didn't get to smoke.Three days later i removed from my own finger a triangle shaped object that looked semi transparent like silicone but it was harder than a rock.The object was a little smaller in size than a b.B.Back to the craft - it seemed to float unaffected by earths gravity.When it left,it moved off slowly at first then accelerated at so fast that it seemed to vanish.There were no clouds in the sky that night except for the one it came out of.Visibility was very good.We had a close encounter of the third or possibly the fourth kind.I went from skeptical to a absolute believer in the first five to ten seconds of the close up visual of the craft with the litte beings peering at us.You would to.We decided we didn't talk about it outside of each other for fear people would not be able to believe the truth.I am getting older now and i think it's time to tell

(very similar the the u2 spyplane wings, except again, they ended in a point, forming a triangle as a wing, not a trapezoid).\r\n\r\n2) the ufo appeared as 100% light (meaning that i could see no 'physical' structure). this was not bright white light, but a golden/yellow/orange fire-like light. the fuselage was brighter lit than the wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nthey travelled very fast, i never saw anything moving that fast before, crossing half of the sky in 2-3 seconds. i did not hear any sound.\r\n\r\nofcourse i can't give you any definite numbers like, how high they were flying, how fast and how big the ufo's were or if it's a secret military vehicle made by us, or an off-world vehicle.\r\n\r\nall i can say, that it looked to me they were flying at cloud-level, they were not larger than aircraft we know commonly, they traveled very fast, they were essentially light and they emitted no sound.\r\n\r\nwhen this all happened, i did not 'feel' anything strange as in scared or very happy. all i felt like, and i did say it out loud, was \"wtf?\" (i uttered the words, not the acronym).\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11236,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.125843,"location":null,"logNumber":"BE-06202008-0002","longitude":4.341279,"occurred":1213339800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Flemish Region","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1213339800000,"summary":"Formation of a dozen ufo's crossing the sky in 2-3 seconds.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"Europe/Brussels","timeZoneName":"Europe/Brussels","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Schelle, Flemish Region","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:362466"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Murrysville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My 12-year-old daughter was up talking on phone to friend looking out her bedroom window (facing south) at the moon when a red-glowing pulsing craft came into view instantly (in the blink of an eye) to the right out bedroom window over a wooded valley in front of our house.  it had a row of white lights along lower edge that raced one at a time to the right, then traveled back again, repeating. the whole craft glowed red that got brighter then dimmer.  it moved slowly just above the tree line until it was directly in front of her window where it hovered silently (moving slightly, not stationary) for several more seconds.  it did this light show several times before moving off quickly to the east.  her boyfriend on the phone told her as she described it that it must be a ufo because planes etc., don't do that. he then looked out his own window (about 5 miles away)in our direction and said he saw 7 red dots all traveling in a group, got scared and ducked.\r\n\r\nnote:  we've joked that our row of solar led garden lights (photo attached) that randomly pulse colors of green, red, blue that are lining our garden wall in a half circle about 25-30 feet in length might signal a ufo-- like they might think one of theirs is in distress...  perhaps it works!

a large triangular shaped yellow/orange object hovering over the west end of the east channel bridge.  i thought it was a huge kite but, as i watched, it rose straight up then moved at about a 30 degree angle to the n.W. after it came 40 or 50 spherical silver/gray objects which appeared to just cascade up into the sky behind it.  among the silver balls were two larger spheres which were smaller in size than the triangle but larger than the other balls.  these were dark red in color. these spheres stayed more stationary while slowly rising into the air and heading nw. this morning, i tried to compare their size to the semi trucks which i can see on the bridge.  the large triangle would have been at least 5 semi trucks wide and the smaller balls about 2 semis in width and the red balls about 2 and 1/2 semis in width.  i kind of hope these were balloons but their  size was so large.  if these are from another planet, they are not very concerned about showing themselves.  i felt neither frightened nor compelled to run for my camera, just kind of stunned. they just rose out of site above the windows edge and i didn't even go outside to watch how they went away.  this is very
