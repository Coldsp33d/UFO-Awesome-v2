the object, and comparing the sizes, i figured that the object was at least fifteen times the size of the plane from my view (meaning, you could have stacked fifteen planes on top of each other in order to reach the height of the sphere), but it was certainly a good distance behind the plane, well out over the lake, so it was probably much bigger than that. it was in my view for about fifteen seconds(i do remember actually counting when i saw it)and then quickly moving clouds slid in front of it and blocked my view. i never saw it again. i remember feeling pretty shook-up after seeing that

force fighter jets chasing a silver globe-shaped object, over spanaway lake, at approximately 4:20pm this afternoon, when i was at the beach on spanaway lake, in spanaway park. i didn't see much, just enough to convince me that i saw something indubitably out of the ordinary- a silver disc almost squat-globe-shaped and roughly [from my viewpoint] the perceived size of a bb at arm's length- at an altitude roughly similar to jet fighters after they have started to ascend to their operating altitude [i am no good at judging distance, this is strictly an analagous estimation, i would say the altitude was in between that of a piper cub flying locally, and that of a passenger jet headed for the airport.  i hope that made sense to you]- this object was discernably bisected on the horizontal plane, almost like a silver wedding band placed horizontally around the midsection of a flattened chromed steel ball.  its airspeed was also similar to a passenger get on approach to an airport.  it made no sound i could hear, at least not above the sound of car/boat traffic and wind and the masses of people frolicking at the beach, none of whom seemed to notice what was happening in the sky above them.  i noticed this object out of my peripheral vision and watched it move in an easterly direction about 10 degrees from when i first noticed it [fist-width estimation] before i then noticed some very noisy [the jet-fighters turned on something which made them roar thunderously] air force jet fighters in a trio, chase after this object for about  15-20 seconds before the object simply disappeared- at this point it did not discernably go up or down, it just disappeared from sight.  the trio of jet fighters just flew threw the airspace where the object had been, and they flew approx. a mile past [the boundary of the lake] before they turned around [rightward] sequentially, the innermost plane closest to me turned first, followed by the others in a widening arc as through searching for something- they flew in concentric circles back where they came from [to my left], in approx. a 2-3 mile arc before going back towards [mcchord afb] base.  this is the first time i have ever seen anything like this object, in the flesh [so-to-speak].  it happened too quickly for me to even think about recording it.

camera.  i merged the previous images together side by side and reduced their size which did lower their original resolution.  i was only allowed to uplaod three images, and i wanted to show all three night shots plus the day photo.  i apologize as it did effect the resolution and made the images more pixelated. the camera's resolution was not set on high res, but the quality of these attached images is better.\r\n\r\nsomeone questioned if these were altered.  they were not.  my father doesn't have a computer and brings me the sd disk to clean off all the images that are uninteresting. of the 700 images that were captured in three days, most are of crows, squirrels and leaves moving.  once in a while we get a nice buck, wolf, or some other large mammal.  that's been the purpose of this camera. it was never the intention to capture unexplanable lights.\r\n\r\ni will admit i am a professional graphic artist and do know how to use photoshop very well.  i even teach it at the local college.  but that was not the case with these.  i did take the images and played with filters, brightness, etc, to see if i could get anything else to appear, but other than circular glows in a horizontal blurry motion, i got nothing.  these attached pictures are just as they came off the sd card from the scout camer.  \r\n\r\ni submitted them to this sight not to say we captured a ufo, but to get some possible explanations of what it could be other than a ghost or spaceship from beyond.  if this wasn't on my father's camera i would be making the same suggestions that it's not real and was altered.  i am skeptical of spirits and ufos, and have never seen one personally to convince me otherwise. but there are many stories that can't be explained and i doubt they are all liars.  \r\n\r\ni have tried to come up with what this light could be. i showed it to other photographer friends and no one has come up with a reasonable explanation.  someone suggested a bug, but it stays too horizontal in all three shots.  i first thought a drop of water on the lens, but it changes size and locations.  the third shot is the strangest as you can see a tree in the distance in the middle of the lights.  that tree is fifty yards away from the camera.  why is that portion of the image lighter?\r\n\r\neach shot was aprox, 10-15 seconds apart. there were no shots directly before or after these for another hour.  as i explained previously, the raccoon in the shot most likely set off the camera, not the light source.  the motion sensor only picks up a 25 ft range.  the raccoon came and went as fast as the light, otherwise the animal would have kept setting the camera off taking more shots.  the previous night there were over fifty pictures of that critter - but no lights.\r\n\r\nmy best explanition is the camera digitally did something i can't explain.  while i thank those who do come up with some thoughts of what this could be, i know for a fact these pictures were not digitally altered.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11195,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.77796,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06162008-0013","longitude":-73.07637,"occurred":1212649200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1212649200000,"summary":"Better

first evening of several days of rock hunting. we had finished a late bbq dinner 1-2 hrs after dark, aprox 10:30. while i was readying an air mattress and bedding in the open bed of my pickup,  my friend was watching the night sky and talking of seeing a couple of shooting stars and seeing what she called jets manuevering. i recall hearing sounds of jets but really wasn't looking or paying attention. at one point her voice got a little excited, saying,\"look over there\", pointing in a northwesterly direction. by the time i did, i didn't see anything. she simply said it was an odd light. this happened once or twice more within a few minutes without me seeing anything. i'm not sure of the next exact sequence, but i finally looked after her urging and saw a single light flash on, i can only describe it as, if you make a circle, cut it in half vertically and exsagerate it a little bigger, like a side view of an old style auto headlamp. just the headlamp off, not illuminated. i witnessed this once or twice then saw two, one next to each other. these flashed on for aprox 1-2 seconds. i don't recall hearing jet sounds in relation to the lights but once observed lights and noise i'd associate with an airplane(jet?)start on the n/w horizon go straight up to a 10 or 11 o'clock position make almost a u turn and head back to about the same spot close to where we saw one of the first half circle lights. i know i saw a single light at least twice, then the double set twice in different positions moving in our north sky from west to east. as a final look we both obseved two sets of two of these half circled type light flashes. i don't remember if it was then or not,(the final burst), but at some point when i saw them, i remember thinking i'd seen these same type(shaped)lights on some program on ufo's i've watched before. i still don't know which one it was but yesterday i decided they reminded me of the sightings in arizona some years back. the way those lights appeared when they first lit up, one after another. for what i saw,all the activity was over a span no more than ten-twenty minutes. my companion felt what we saw were military type manuevers with unconventional aircraft and although niether of us has any background or expertice in aircraft or military i agree with her. i forgot to mention my freind said that a little while after the final observance of four lights, that what she called a jet shot from where the four were to overhead, and gone in the southern sky. i wasn't aware of it i suppose i was in a state of semi shock. that is why i'm a little unsure of exact sequences.\r\n   i want to say that i have spent many,many nights sleeping in the openair in the high desert over the past thirty plus years and have never seen any thing i didn't think was probably easily explainable, nothing! i also am and have been extremily curious of the subject of ufo's but for the lack of undisputible evidence am not sure of any extraterestial connection. i adamantly believe in thier probable, not possible exsistence given the size of our solar system and beyond. i also would not in the least be surprised in thier known exsistence by the,\"powers that be\", simply because of these power's covert nature. \r\n   based on my limited knowledge and observance i would never on my own, say what i saw was extraterestial, but it was to me, literally an unidentified flying object. did anyone else see anything on that date in the pacific northwest ?\r\n   one note, we did spend the next night at the same campsite and did not see anything. naturally i was armed and ready with my camera then.    \r\n                       thanks,\r\n                           rick

family room, the family room has a large glass window that gives you a view of the malibu coast line-west to santa monica-south, it is common to see lots of airplanes taking off from lax and santa monica airport and helicopters flying up and down the malibu coast with their red & green nav. lights and flashing strobe, so we all knew what airplanes & helicopters look like at night, that evening jim's mother noticed unusual very bright colorful lights coming down the malibu coastline towards us, there was a telescope that sat by the large family room window and a pair of binoculars. all of us took turns trading off between the telescope and binoculars, what i saw was a multi colored (white, blue, red, yellow, green) constant bright lights randomly flickering around the sides of a thick disc shape, i tried focusing on the inner portion non lighted top area, but only saw black, it was night time and dark out, the sun was completely set with no clouds, fog or moon light, this object came down the malibu coastline towards pacific palisades and hovered about 200 feet in the air about 500-800 yards from the shore of topanga beach, malibu/charthouse restraunt, from our view, we were looking down on the ufo at an angle, it hovered there silently for a few of minutes, then abruptly went into the water, even with the naked eye you could see the greenish illuminating glow from the craft being under the water, it stayed there under the water for a few minutes not moving at all, when i looked at it through the telescope i could see the pattern of waves going over the lighted sea water, at that moment his mom freaked out screaming and started calling the police and air force in a panic. i watched the craft come out of the water and hover, in a hover as i was watching it through the telescope, the craft elongated to about 2 times its length, i couldn't tell if it turned a quarter turn and it was always longer and we were looking at it from the front, or if it actually changed its whole length & size wich it appeared to do, the same bright multi colored lights were still coming from the sides, as i told jim he grabbed the telescope from me, i was looking at the ufo with my naked eye for about 20 seconds after it elongated when it, in a split second, shot off at incredible speed from a stand still, it just streaked south towards catalina island. i tried to rationalize it and thought i might have been some kind of secret military craft but it was not, it came in slow, it hovered, went under the water and then shot away very very fast, since then i have flown helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and to this day there isn't anything that could even remotely function or look like that, i know what we experianced was probibly the most incredible thing i will ever see in my lifetime and i remember it vividly. \r\nif anyone else has experienced this event i have seen in that same time period or if there are any pictures or reports, please contact

4:40am i got up while my roommate was about to sleep and went to the rooftop for a cigarette.\r\n\r\nat around 4:45 or so, i noticed a dark blimp or oval shaped vehicle, which i first thought was a blimp but then realized there was no cabin, no indication of rudders or fans, no markings or logos and absolutely no lights.\r\n\r\nit appeared to move without wobbling or without any influence of the wind direction, but rather in a stable path over or near the east river from about the union square east area (14th street) to the 34th street area, disappearing from my field of view on the east side of the empire state building, then reappearing on the north side. this is where it changed course and turned east and quickly ascended until it reached the cloud level and disappeared. \r\n\r\nit was my intent to record this event with my cameraphone which i had in hand but i was too stunned to even remember to switch it on. i tried recording the event after it oriented itself easterly, but realized then it was too late for my cameraphone to record it with any quality. \r\n\r\ni tried sleeping it off and thought i was going insane for a minute but then realized that i had just simply seen an aircraft that didn't conform to the normal standards of flying objects in the nyc area (i.E., lights, engine noise, tags or markings identifying the craft, etc.) i checked for reports of any sightings or anything out of the ordinary anonymously. i would contact the nypd or airports to inquire about any other reports, but i'm afraid reporting it to authorities in this city would cause

20-30 feet in diameter with rectangular windows(portholes?). it continued on it's banking path and proceeded to fly in a southwesterly direction along the interstate. the kids, ages 10-13 all saw it

of turkeys, crows, squirrels, etc.  \r\n\r\nas i was scanning through the pictures i noticed a series of three pictures that had some strange lights we couldn't explain.  keep in mind this camera is

likely set off the detector.  \r\n\r\nif the light in each shot was in the same position and same location, i would would suggest it was something on the lens, or a reflection of something, even though all that is down there is trees.  but the light moves in each of the three shots as if it is getting closer to the camera and has a unusual pattern of blurry sphere-like lights.  of the 700 shots the camera took in three days, these were the only night shots that had these lights.   the lights in the last of the three shots seem transparent as you can see the tree through them.\r\n\r\ni

happens that i noticed a unusual object, solid black in color, that appeared to be \"wobbling\" as it moved. the object was slighly oval and because of its apparent altitude and black color not much detail was visible even though it was broad daylight (12:40 in the afternoon). its flight path was a straight line, in a south-easterly direction, but it seemed to sway, ever so slightly, from side to side. i watched for a about a minute or two as is crossed the entire sky, starting from directly overhead, and then watched as it dissappeared in some distant clouds. there was no audible sound that i am aware of. \r\n\r\nmy first thought was... \"hmm... that was weird. i wonder what that was? a ufo??\" i kind of laughed to myself and not giving it much more thought i continued to lay there in the sun, still working on my tan, but keeping an eye on the distant clounds just in case the object returned to view. \r\n\r\nand that's when things really got weird. about 1 minute after the object dissappeared into the distant clouds, 5 identical objects (perhaps one of them was the original?? this i am not certain) emerged from the same clouds and began circling around. all of them fit the same description: solid black and slightly oval. from my vantage point, they were moving in \"tight\" circles and appeared to be moving upwards, almost in a spiral pattern. they were not all circling the same direction either. atleast 1 of them was circling the opposite direction of the rest. \r\n\r\nat this point i jumped to my feet and called to my nephew, who was swimming, to look at what i was seeing. he stopped swimming and watched with me, for approximately 2 or 3 minutes, as these black objects continued circling around each other, all in close proximity to the same original clouds. \r\n\r\nfinally, all but one of the objects dissappeared back into the clounds and the last object made one final circle and then proceeded in a straight line heading east, with the same \"wobbly\" motion as the first. the interesting thing is that the last object, that was heading east, actually turned at an angle that caused it to reflect sunlight for a brief moment so i know it had to be a metallic aircraft of some sort (or atleast something capable of reflecting sunlight). \r\n\r\nas far as what it actually was... i have no idea!! at the time, i remember thinking \"wow... i am witnessing some ufos\" so i actually looked at my cell phone (which i had nearby) and made a mental note of the time. ive also been thinking about it for a couple days now and it was intriguing enough that i wished i had a video camera... so i went and bought one, just in case im lucky enough to see a similar event again!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

6:30p.M. and there wasn't a cloud any where near this giant wobling highly reflective disc....With what looked like a lighter dot in the middle of it. myself and a few other people pulled over in the parking lot and all got out of our cars and were speachless. the only point of size reference that we had was a cessna that looked to be about 3 miles to the left in the sky away from it, and the object was pretty hughe in comparison to it and traveling very arratic and fast. it started wobbling end to end (right to left) and then went horizontal in the sky but on a vertical angle and then start to move away very quickly in a diagnoal line upwards and it either sped up so fast we couldnt see it any more or just went invisible almost and disapeard. i stood there for another half an hour

house, illuminating some clouds. i got up and walked to the side gate to get a better view. looking through the gate i noticed a light out of the corner of my eye, so i turned my head to look at it. it was a bright, ruby-red light that was hovering in the air, some distance away towards the south.\r\ni wondered what it could be when it began slowly moving to the right, still at the same altitude. after a second or two of movement, it stopped and began hovering again. a few seconds later it moved to the left, back to roughly where it originally was. it stopped again and hovered once more. my heart rate had increased by this time and i felt excited and slightly worried. it didn't move anymore after that, but stayed perfectly still. it seemed to gently fade for a moment, then return to it's full brightness, as though a cloud was moving in front of it. it did this a couple of times. from what i could see of the sky, it was a very clear night but there was a scattering of low-lying clouds. \r\nafter a minute of waiting to see if it would go anywhere or do something else, i rushed inside and upstairs to get my camera. i came back down again approximately 1 minute later and hurried outside to where i was standing before. the light was still there in the same position, only this time it was noticeably fainter. i attempted to film it but my camera couldn't pick it up as it was getting fainter all the time. it steadily got fainter and fainter until it disappeared entirely. \r\nfrom the time of first seeing it to it's disappearance, roughly 5 minutes had elapsed. how long it was there before i saw it i don't know - i don't think it just suddenly appeared as i was looking at the moon.\r\nfrom the time of coming outside with my camera to the time of it's disappearance, roughly 1 minute elapsed, with it steadily growing fainter and not \"pulsing\" as described earlier.\r\ni waited around for a while but it didn't return. throughout this whole episode, several dogs were barking in the village, however my cats didn't seem perturbed at all. shortly (minutes) after it disappeared, the dogs stopped barking.\r\ni had initially wondered if it could have been a flare, as it was in the direction of an artillery range a few miles away, but during the whole episode there was no deviation in height, and no flickering, smoke-trails or \"auras\" usually associated with flares.\r\n\r\npicture attached was taken the following afternoon from where i viewed the ufo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

military nor civilian aircraft. there were no blinking lights, they defied the laws of physics, and they glowed -- in that the light seemed to emanate from within them than without - and were brighter than any star in the sky. \r\n\r\nall the craft were spherical. they seemed to mimic stars in their appearance. \r\n\r\nthe first two craft traveled parallel to each other and in formation. they seemed to come from the low northeast, banked south, then headed northwest. \r\n\r\nthe third sphere seemed to come from the north and moved in zig-zags. it also moved northwest, in the same general direction as the first two. this single sphere seemed to pause (from our pov) in the head of the constellation draco for at least 3 seconds before continuing its flight.\r\n\r\n the last pair (totalling five spheres), also came from the northeast and in formation, traveled south. at one point in this pair's flight, one of the spheres paused in the sky (it did not move) while the other seemed to catch up to it. the movements and flight of these spheres was very fluid, as if they were traveling through water. they were, for lack of a better description, swimming in the sky. \r\n\r\nat times all five sphere���s  light wavered into different colours, but with a soft transition between red and silver light. they did not blink. their light was constant. there was a total lack of sound. they also seemed to be flying outside of our atmosphere but not as far away as the moon. all five objects seemed to be following a definite flight pattern - but we must stress that the movements were soft - like watching swimmers. slow. lazy.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

was in the sky where there is usually no light . i live approx. 1 mile form hoosier park horse racing track,the object seemed to be about 2-3 miles from me in the direction of middletown,indiana which would have put the object close to interstate 69. i watched for about 10 minutes before getting my sony camcorder the object hovered in place for about 30 minutes of which i have video not very good but 30 minutes worth.The object seemed to rotate and shift color along its axis.The object had a top, middle and bottom which appeared to change color sometimes blue to white to orange and pulsing.Although the object moved it was very slowly, always staying over the same area.At times it appeared to have a brighter light come from out from it like a spotlight.In the video a small aircraft can be seen flying just under the object,the planes navigation lights clearly visible and flashing.My son came out and watched for about 10 minutes with me.During which time he saw the object change color and pulse. there was no sound from the object.And it was gone in a second no flash just gone.Some of the video is shaky but also some good steady footage.The shape was oval but cylindrical hard to really tell because it was so bright and pulsing.This was no aircraft coming straight at me then turning ,was not a helicopter nor a blimp or balloon. this object stayed on station like there was purpose and left when the objective was completed.It made me feel as if being watched.The approach to indianpolis international air port is in the other direction-from the northeast to southwest and the anderson airport approach is from northwest to souhteast but a good 5 miles north of my location.The area of sky observed normally has no  air traffic this time of night and no bright stars ever seen in this part of the sky here.At this time i need to convert the video from small dvd camera disk to a normal dvd do not know how to send you the video from my camera directly

bright, much like the landing floods on a jetliner. as it came closer, we had the opportunity to\r\nsee it through the moonroof and it was an oblong 70-100 feet across and traveled in a sideways motion with one corner, where the absurdly bright white flashing light was and at the tail was an array of red and other colored lights. due to the rich sunset hues, i couldn't make out if the other less bright lights were green, blue or simply both. \r\nthis sighting was very exciting simply because the entire 91 corridor was filled with families bumper to bumper enjoying the brilliant sunset

hadn't worked out the way my family had hoped so we were moving back. i was in a hurry to get back to my friends, so i went to live with my aunt for 2 weeks. one night my cousin and i were going to take some laundry to the laundromat about 5 miles away. to get there we had to go up the hill past the high school. most of ohio is fairly flat land but where we lived had some fairly high hills due to the glaciers having ended there in the last ice age. when we crested the hill and started down the other side we noticed that it had suddenly become very dark -- much darker than normal. we looked up and noticed that something had blacked out the sky. it seemed to be very low -- much lower than cloud cover would have been. we drove on down the road a few hundred yards and suddenly it lightened up and we could see stars in the sky. for some reason we both became very frightened. we drove on to the laudromat, but when we got there we couldn't bring ourselves to get out of the car. we decided to just go home. why we would have wanted to pass through that area again i don't know. when we got closer to the dark area we could see that there was definitely something there. it was huge and dark but we could not make out the shape. but there was something different about it this time. underneath the craft there was what appeared to be a long projection of sorts with a light on the end of it and it was moving around like it was looking for something. we must have been afraid that maybe it was us they were looking for as we became even more frightened. i hit the gas and flew on up the hill out from under the thing. i've seen many other ufos, both before and after this event, but this was the only time that i ever felt fear.
