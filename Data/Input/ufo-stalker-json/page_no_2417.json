came from a north eastern direction of travel. there was an elongated object (quite big) moving silently across the sky at the height of the clouds which are pretty low out here in nebraska. it had no wings and was heading in a south east direction right above lincoln. it went through or behind a patch of clouds and i didn't see it for a brief time and especially at the speed it was going i judged that it must have paused for a moment when behind or in the clouds. then i seen it again continuing along it's original course of travel. it must have been about sixty to eighty feet long and possibly thirty to forty feet wide. it was well proportioned and even in it's length and depth but more in length. there was no contrail or chemtrail behind it. it must have been traveling about 80 to 100 mph. mostly blue sky with some perfectly white clouds. 81 degrees outside with 9 mph winds coming from the south and visibility at 10.0 miles. just two days ago we had two brief tornadoes hit lincoln with one above my apartment complex and landing few blocks away. the other one at 27th and o streets.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

old. i'm helping my mother in her restaurant and service station. it was in the afternoon, there was a few people at the counter eating. there suddenly was a loud jet noise coming right at us. every one ran out side just in time to see two jet aircraft t33's from beale turn up into a steep climb headed right for three silver in color flying saucers. the flying saucers were in a tight group milling around each other. the jets got up close to them and they took off with lightning speed, one went north with a jet right close behind it. the other jet chased one off to the west. the other one went straight up out of sight. this was the beginning of many a late night events. in may of 1959 beale air force base was turned into a bombing and gunnery range. for the last year and a half i have been writting my story about these amazing events. a new mufon field investigator ( tim doran ) has been working with me on on my sightings for the last year now, i have given him much detail and

min.) stop light on ashland ave.\r\ni looked through my windshield and saw a bright white light in the sky. at first i thought it was a plane, but i realized there were no flashing lights where the wings should be. i continued to watch the object which appeared to be stationary in the sky. as i stared i saw it move slightly north and realized it had changed position and was now facing me.  i saw it was not moving and realized it was a large v shaped object with white lights down each side. again i looked for flashing lights, there weren't any. i kept staring even as the passengers were boarding. i again thought maybe i was seeing things and tried to find a fixed point in the sky to see if the object would cross it. suddenly it moved east.  if i was to approximate a distance i would say about 8 inches if i held a 12 in. ruler straight out and to the sky. it stopped, and the white lights began to fade into a gray then black. i thought it would disappear, but suddenly the color turned into a stop light green and just hung in the sky.  i started rolling down the street again and the object fade from view behind the bus.  four blocks later on damen ave., to my surprise, the object again was in the windshield of the bus, hanging in the sky. i watched the lights once again turn from white to green and not move. i remember thinking while the lights were white that they seemed to be in blocks as if windows. i have no idea why i thought that. when they started changing color they did not go horizontally across the side but vertically so i could still see the white at the bottom turn into grey then black then bam! into green. there were very high light clouds in the sky. i realized later the object was muich larger than a plane or helicopter. the v shape was so perfectly surrouding by the lights there was no center light, they went down the outside and seemed to meet perfectly at the front end point.  as i drove home that evening i kept watching the sky for it to reappear but i didn't see it again.  when it moved each time, i almost felt as if it was in answer to my question \"did it move or not?\"  each time i questioned myself it moved.  i thought that was very creepy.

near the house at night when he looked up and asked \"do you see that?\". i immedaity looked up to see what looked like a shooting star rapidly moving from north/east to south/west. it looked to me to be pale white and about as bright as a bright star. my friend said it looked to have a red color. the sky was very clear. i soon realized that this moving object or light did not leave any streak, trail, or fire or smoke behind it. it did not seemt to be a meteor. it was almost straight overhead at about 80 degrees above the horizon. i then began to ask myself if this could be a sattelite although i had never seen a sattellite move anywhere near as fast as this was travelling. i think it was travelling very fast although i am not sure how larger or how high the light was. we both felt that it was high up in the atmosphere possibly in space though. \r\nabout 2 seconds after looking at this i then thought \" if this is someting out of the ordinary and not a sattellite then maybe it will do somehing odd\".\r\n just then the light appeared to decelerate and change course to  arc in a more easterly direction. it did not stop though and then seemd to accelerate and curve back to the west into its original line of flight.\r\n\r\nthen it quickly faded out as it seemd to picked up speed although it was still up in the sky overhead. it was a clear sky and did not pass behind any trees. we heard no noise at any time or nor did we see any associated other lights attached to it or away from it. it did not blink or flash. neither of us could offer an explanation that seemed to fit. we both though it was definately odd.  felt that it was something under some sort of controlled flight and either it was closer than we thought or was far away and if so it had moved with a high

ohare. this is a normal everyday occurrance living just miles from the airport. my attention then went to a bright orange ball of light hovering in the sky in front of me about 2 blocks away facing west. i thought at first \"where did that planet come from\"? thinking i had not noticed this before. as i watched the light it  did not move but the commercial airliner was getting closer to this object, yet a bit overhead. then i realised that all the planes that usually i see in the west are further back in the sky. then i went to get my camera. as i lifted the camera and could even get it up to my eyes this ball of light started to sparkle like a firecracker and it lit up and turned into a tansparent orange square which then turned into a pin of light and just disappeared into nothing.

(i am unfamiliar with which direction we faced, so i cannot provide that information.)  as it moved it varied in size/brightness, at some points being about the size of venus as it appears from earth and getting as bright as approximately three times that size.  we both watched carefully to look for a shape or to see if it was a reflection of the setting sun on a plane or some other \"normal\" object.  that did not appear to be the case.  there were no blinking or colored lights on the object.  since it had been awhile since i last saw an unidentified object, i was fairly excited to watch it and determine its origin.\r\n\r\nlater during the concert, all three of us saw another object of the same description pass over in the same manner, although i believe it moved the opposite way, i.E. left to right.  in one of the cases, i watched the object disappear behind some clouds perhaps 40 degrees above the horizon and it did not reappear.  in the other case, i witnessed the light dim in brightness, and when it was about 30 degrees above the horizon, it simply went out altogether and did not light back up.  i cannot recall which ending went with which sighting and i do not want to guess and provide possibly incorrect information.  also, during the second sighting, my roommate pointed out the object to the people in the row behind us and they too watched it go by.  we didn't converse with them but they didn't disagree when our roommate said \"that's not a plane!\"","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

reported that, too.  anyways, i was watching the tonight show and across the lake from me there is a marshy area and then a ranch-ish looking property w/ lots of acreage.  i saw a blinking light in the sky first which looked like what i'd seen the previous night.  that light was way in the sky but it was across the lake se from me and then, and i couldn't see it very well, but i definitely saw a low, closer hovering light fairly dim in the trees more to the left next to the property and then what i thought might be people out on the property with flashlights - there were lights as if from a flashlight or helicopter surveying the ground and i couldn't tell what i saw it wasn't very clear but it was a streak of some low to the ground animal back and forth.  i thought maybe it was a dog at first, but it was way too fast - maybe a mountain lion?  it caught my attention, but i wasn't startled until the light in the trees dimmed and then flew across several properties and was changing  color to red like a laser pointer or something.  but then it would light up again in dim white and it just floated around from place to place.  i got kind of nervous when a red light got in front of my house, i woke my husband who was on the sofa and he also saw the red light.  it didn't move, it just stayed still from what i saw, but he'd talked me into watching tv instead of freaking myself out and later he said he'd seen it move.  we went to bed after him dismissing me and telling me it's some kid w/ a laser pointer.  i read for a bit to calm my mind and when i turned the light off to go to sleep - through the blinds in a room completely on the other side of the house facing west there was a very, very bright light that was hovering in the wooded area outside our house.  i woke my husband up again and he agreed he could see it and although he'll never admit it could be anything other than something explainable i could tell he got a little spooked.  he kept whispering loud - \"ok, so what do you want me to do? i see it, i see it\".  the light would change from very bright white to dimmer so you could barely see it and then brighten up again and as it would brighten a bunch of tiny little colored lights would blink so fast - red blue green.   i saw this light at around 12:45 and it lasted a little over an hour.  it moved very slowly all around and lowered into the trees and i heard noises like low whistles best way i can describe it was a soft high pitched noise between flute and a whistle.  i had trouble sleeping but nothing else happened after the thing left.  i didn't move to another window - when it was out of my eyeshot, i just let it go.  it was so bright the lights from it were coming in our window and it was like a headlights that were moving around the room depending on where this thing was positioned and how dim or bright it got.","distance":"21-100

came across this forum. in 1967 my father, mother, baby sister; and me were returning from visiting an uncle in the soundview section of the bronx. as we walked east on the westbound side of bruckner blvd. and approached the intersection of beach ave. and bruckner blvd. we saw people looking out and up from the apartment building on the west side of beach ave. they were pointing up. my family and i looked up and saw a disc shaped object glimmering gold and silver in color spanning approximately 90 feet in width across the blvd. the object was approximately 80feet high in the air and the top half of the object was spinning slowly in a clockwise direction while the bottom half appeared to be ratcheting in the opposite direction. the center of the object was surrounded by a series of large round lights that rotated clockwise while changing from red to green to blue to white. i stood almost directly underneath the object and looking up i marveled at the magnificent colors and under-structure of this object. the underneath was a maze of complex piping and components that i have to be honest i could not even begin to describe in a manner that would make any sense. the object was completely silent.  after watching this object for approximately ten minutes or so my father seemed to suddenly get spooked and called to me to move away from the object and we continued to walk towards our home. i looked back, my perspective now from north to south on beach ave., and saw that there were large arched shaped (what appeared to be) ports or windows on the very top of the object. as we walked further away i felt a strange sense of attraction coming from the object almost as if it were somehow ever so slightly pulling me back. needless to say that experience more than 40 years ago left me hoping, to no avail, that i would see it once again.

lights on but this craft is just one solid color.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

was completely without lights.  it was moving very slowly and actually crossed the strip.  we were in the vicinity of the mirage hotel.  it made no noise at all that we could hear.  i have never seen

i was right in the middle of houston looking east. the light didn't look hazy as if it were blinking because of clouds passing by, it continued to look bright. i also noticed it seemed to be changing color. i asked my brother and my girlfriend to come out to see it, and everybody, including me, thought it could have possibly been the lights on an airplane. but as time went by, maybe 5 min or so later, the lights were in the same approximate point in the sky and also didn't seem to be any closer. also, it didn't look to be clear red and green, it looked like a mixture of colors, constantly changing. we got some very cheap binoculars. i looked at it again, and this time we could see a little better. i couldn't see what the light was, but i could definitely see that it was moving very fast. it didn't seem to be traveling anywhere, it looked like it was doing all kinds of crazy patterns in the air, never leaving the same area. and it definitely wasn't just red and green, it was changing colors like crazy, every color imaginable. we all saw it for at least 20 min, i can only say that long because i was leaving, but it was still in the same place in the sky when i left, so i really don't know if or when it went away. i can't see the sky in that direction from my apartment.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11137,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.7655927,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06122008-0005","longitude":-95.3607395999999,"occurred":1213249500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1213249500000,"summary":"Distant

usually see nothing in the sky because we have a number of trees in the yard.  but tonight i couldn't help but notice this bright star looking light.  it caught my attention because i had never noticed it before.  i got up and went to the window and looked closer and could swear it was getting bigger as if it were coming my direction and it was pulsating.  i went outside for a better look, but the trees were blocking my view.  i decided to just go back to my show and take a gander every once in a while to see if i could tell for sure it was moving.  i could.  so, to be sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me, i laid my head against the back of the sofa in a crack and placed one hand over one eye and used a point of reference (shingles).  my eyes were not playing tricks on me, after a while that was very apparent.  it is still out there but now it has moved up down and left shining through 3 separate windows and once i knew for sure it was not my eyes playing tricks i haven't moved until i got up to report this.  i noticed it at 11:40 am and got up to report this at 12:45
