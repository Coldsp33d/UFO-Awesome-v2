( i was born in 1986).  my nieghbors and best friends had a neighborhood party.  the kids were outside, the parents were inside.  this was around the time that x-files was really popular and one of the boys had just received a telescope.  we decided to do a \"sky watch\" and look for ufo's, but that got old quickly because a) we were kids and b) we didnt' think we would actually see anything.  at one point, maybe around 7pm, i went back to the telescope to look through it and see what i could see.  my friend's house sits on a hill that overlooks a valley.  at the other end of the valley i could see what looked like an airplane, but only because it had lights (blue, red, white).  called my friends over, \"it's a plane.\"  so we went back to playing in the yard.  maybe an hour later i went back to the telescope.  the thing i had been looking at was still in the same spot.  over an hour it would have moved somewhere if is had been a plane, or even a star/planet for that matter.  but it was still really far away so we when back to playing.  maybe another hour later we went to look in the telescope again and the object was much closer, maybe half the distance it had been previously, but still too far away to have been an airplane.  this intrigued our creative minds so we all sat down on the back porch, put the telescope aside, and decided to watch it.  over the next hour, it was dark by now, it got closer and closer ever so slowly until it became so close that it literally flew over the tree line at the edge of the yard, no more than a hundred feet away.  it was as if it knew we were watching it and was letting us get a good look.  it was egg-shaped and looked like what i would compare to brushed-steel.  around the center there were flashing lights, flashing in no particular order, all different colors, not just the red, blue, and white we had observed before.  it was no bigger than a vw beetle.  it made no sound.  my friend (who was my age) and i ran inside as fast as we could.  i sat with my dad, terrified, and said nothing.  my friend ran to his parents and said nothing as well.  my brother, his brother, and several of our other friends ran after the object and returned 15-20 minutes later.  their faces were blank and they said nothing.  when my friend and i asked them about where they had been they got angry and said it was nothing.\r\nthe really messed up part comes in only a few years ago.  my friends and i had never discussed it, but i still could not get it out of my mind.  enough time had past that i thought maybe it had been a dream.  i was visiting my best friend from that night (who had since moved) and pulled him aside.  i said something like, \"please don't laugh or think i'm crazy, but i have to run something by you because i don't know if it was a dream or it was real and it's really bothering me.\"  he says, \"what?\"  i say, \"do you remember when were were younger, like 10 maybe, and we did a sky watch and thought we might have seen something?\"  his face goes white and says, \"i thought that might have been a dream too.\"  we were so excited we quickly ran to ask our brothers if they too remembered that night we never talked about.  scary thing is, they don't.  they don't remember it and they even got upset with us that we were trying to play a trick on them.  so the way i see it, my friend and i ran inside and remember the whole episode.  the guys who ran after it and were gone for 15-20 minutes, don't remember it at all.\r\ni think about his event often and quite frankly, i wish it had never happened.  i hope i never see anything like that again, but to this day, i have to sleep with the windows locked shut and blinds down.  maybe it's irrational, but i have never been so scared in my life.\r\nunfortunately we don't have any pictures.  i wish we did though because they would probably be insanely good.","distance":"21-100

roswell crash. while my eyes wander around i see this bright disc like object in the sky it was about half a mile away and it was kind of rotating counter clock wise and has yellow and red lights around it. but it was to far away for me to see anything else. but in the beginning i did not notice it to be a ufo so i thought it was a wishing star but i was 10 so i made a wish and i layed back down onto my bed and kept staring at it and after a little while i closed my eyes for less than 5 seconds and i looked outside the window again to see what it was doing because i believe in the paranormal and the most mysterious of mysteries and i start to see it rotating and floating from left to right very slowly but it pretty much stayed in the exact spot of when i made my wish. but being 10 years old i think it was just a plane which i highly doubt. so i lay back down again and then this sort of sensational feeling rose threw my body and i wondered if it had anything to do with the rotating object, so i look out the window one last time and i see it moving upward then differently then most ufo \"blast offs\" to lighting speed, but it starts to disappear from the right side and moves down to the point were it stops to disappear and there is a giant green flash and then it accelerates to lighting speeds into the sky. i ran outside amazed by this occurance and now im a 13 year old trying to become an expert on ufo's and im trying to research them and i have even tried to get abducted by the nordic alien species. because they are the good aliens instead of the greys that wish to perform a bunch of surgeries on you and make you drink harmful acids. but i also wish i could get an implant from an alien to see what it does to my body and if i can i would take it out after a year and see what it looks like and maybe try some experiments on it at aufo research center.\r\nso if anybody wants me to take risky jobs to track down aliens then im free for any

i had my blinds open to my large windows to let the breeze in since it was a cool night. at about a little bit after 10 pm, i noticed a set of lights pass very slowly across the left window (in my living room) in the distance. now at the time, i did not think much of it because i figured it was a small aircraft (like a cessna) landing at the indianapolis municipal airport which is a half mile north of my residence on allisonville rd.  but then i saw another set of lights passing very slowly across my right window at about what appeared to be the same altitude as the set of lights from the left window.  this seemed odd to me 2 aircraft flying so close to each other (i work for the airlines).  so i looked out the right window and i saw 3 strobing objects in the sky in a triangular formation.  i thought i was seeing things.  i went outside with my binoculars to make a better observation from my porch.  when i went outside, i got a good view of the following (with and without binoculars):\r\n\r\n1.  3 objects in a perfect triangular formation \"hovering\" about 1000 feet off the ground.\r\n2.  the distances between each set of strobing white lights (with hints of blue and red) was somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 400 feet.\r\n3.  i was using a point of reference (a neighbor's chimney) and the objects appeared to hover there for about 10 minutes and then they began to very very slowly drift off in a northernly direction.\r\n4.  the strobing lights were moving left to right from my vantage point (they could have been moving in a circular fashion but i could not observe that)\r\n5.  most importantly:  i did not hear any sound!!!!!  (i know what a helicopter and an airplane sound like).  i did not hear anything eminate from these objects.\r\n\r\nnow the objects began to move away and eventually i lost sight of them from my porch. i went back inside stunned by what i observed.  this was clearly not a helicopter or aircraft.  unfortunately, i did not have a camera to take a snapshot of what i had seen.\r\n\r\nplease note:  there could have been an object or structure within the perimeter of the strobed lights.  if there was, i could not see it because it blended in with the night sky.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

disappeared...Then about 15 minutes later...I saw a saucer shaped object head into a cloud formation at a high rate of speed.  i will take a drug test and a polygraph....I never saw anything until i wrote a screenplay called...'nightmare hall'...Then they started showing up....Man i wish i had a camera...Out there...But they were so quick....I never would have gotten a photo...But i swear they are showing up here all the time now....And i will produce evidence and post to this site for sure...I am going to work on it....Check it out���experimental or alien���it sure is fun to wonder.  once you see it���you will believe.  just watch the skies....Especially at night...I swear you will start to see something if you are in or near...Illinois....Most look like a star moving....But wait until it stops and hovers...And keep your eyes on it...And it will explode with a flash of light...And take off...It is totally amazing!!  never seen anything before....And now it is about 2 or 3 per night...Every single night since june 7th....I actually lost count.  most of them are way up there...So binoculars will help if you don't have 20-10 vision like me...But today...It was lower...And

eyes out for anything else that may have business in the area.\r\nat 11:20 pm, we swung the scope around to face north to observe a binary star.\r\nmy friend then said, \"what do we have here?\" i looked in the direction,and immediately saw a pulsating red light which appeared to be spherical in shape. since this is a strict \"no fly\" zone(for most aircraft anyway), it had my complete attention. it remained stationary for about a minute,changed color to a white pulsation, then dove at an approximate angle downward of 30 degrees.We lost sight of it for a moment, when my friend flashed it with a red laser pointer. almost immediately it reappeared and changed to the red pulsation, perhaps in response to the laser greeting.\r\nwhen in the new position, it changed to a white pulsation, then back to red.\r\nabout 45 seconds later, it zigged up to a higher position, sat there for about 15 seconds more , then took off at a 40 degree angle up and away!

friends, family and i were hanging out in the yard grilling and playing frisbee etc. the sky was perfectly blue. i noticed a bright metallic reflection in the sky and peaked up out of curiousity. what we all saw, for more than 30 minutes, was a large white/grey, circular object at approximately 10000 - 15,000 feet altitude with 2 smaller metallic objects moving around it similar to the movement of bees. compared to jet airliners that fly in the area constantly, i'd say that the large white object was 5x bigger than a standard plane. the two metallic objects flying around it, were similar size to a commercial airliner and did not follow straight paths like a plane would have to. the metallic reflection on the two smaller objects was really intense, and much brighter than any normal reflections coming from planes in the area. their strange movement kind of scared me to be honest. the large white/grey disc moved really slowly from north to south in a straight line and eventually fell below the tree line out of site. the white object was not very reflective and was kind of hard to see with the blue sky background. without the metallic objects, it may not have been seen. at the time we all were sort of mesmerized by it. a few of us continued to watch it, and a few of us tried to view it with binoculars but were unable to pinpoint it due to the bright blue sky. no pictures, or video were taken, but similar reports from mentor, ohio the following january hit the news and were very similar to what we all saw. my current feeling is that the white object was nothing of earth origin, but the metallic objects around it could have been military planes that were trying to get up close for a view. there was no sound the whole time, but that is the norm for planes at that altitude. i never do hear them. mothership is a word that comes to mind especially if the smaller objects were of unknown origin as well.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

high in the sky moving slowing from south to north coming just over step mountain. since planes sometimes fly this route on their way to the salt lake city airport, i watched the object thinking it was a plane. the object, however, zigzagged twice forming a sort of \"w\" in the sky. at that point i knew it wasn't an airplane, but thought it might be a helicopter since camp williams is just slightly to the south of us.\r\n\r\nwhen the object next executed a lazy arc flying toward the west, i knew it wasn't a helicopter. at all times, what i was seeing was the reflection of the object from the rising sun - that is, the sun coming from the east, the object slightly to the west of me, it must have created the perfect angle of reflection for me to see it.\r\n\r\nthe object then remained stationary for about four minutes, then it flew slightly south and seemed to recede becoming smaller and dimmer. it looked like a small, bright star at that point. during the four minutes, i ran and got my husband to observe the object, but by the time he came outside, the object was quite dim, and unless you knew exactly where to look, it was hard to see.\r\n\r\ni kept watching until i could no longer see the tiny, bright \"star\". given its motion, the object was not an airplane, not a helicopter, and not, as my husband wondered, a satellite. i feel quite privileged to have seen

block where we live this night however would be different as the three of us were walking i had a feeling like we were all being watch so i looked up at a very clear and blue sunset to see a very bright star like object hovering only about 2,500 feet in the northern sky i stated look! and my wife and our friend looked up and there it was, it was so amazing! i ran to get my cam but when i returned it was gone but i have our friends eye wittness account and she was a skeptic before this happened.. she stated it changed from a star to a disk and at a snap of the finger it was gone.... it left us all feeling very shayken and very tense it took us all night to calm down... these events continue today i have tryed to make contact with the disclosure project people but no reply yet... the

and you will see a 2 level parking garage.Anyways around 2am i noticed an object making passes over my site.2 solid non-blinking lights with a red oscillating light in the middle.No wings and no sound.Dead quiet.Upon the 3rd pass/fly by,i walked up on the parking garage and began signaling the object with my flashlight.This,no doubt,got it's attention.Really got it's attention.It made additional passes nearby,slowly,in an observation manner.Each time flying over head coming from different directions but the focus was where i was standing.On the 8th,9th,and 10th pass,it got really close.This is when i became nervous.This also gave me a chance to observe the object in great detail.The features were like what i previously stated also had no wings and when it turned it did not bank like a plane.It would turn in a sort of horizonatal arc.Again no sound.On the 9th pass the altitude was very low,it went out over the nearby treetops and made a u turn.It came back around for the final pass,slowly as i waved my flashlight around,making gestures with the light.It then went off over the treestops.This went on for 2 1/2 hours.I am going back out there either tommorow night or my next shift.I will bring stronger flashlight and recording equipment for proof.I may bring a witness as well.This location has a lot of activity(i had seen something on the night previous to that conncering to large objects around 3am but i will save that for another time)the goal here is to coax it even closer overhead to get a good shot maybe even try to get it to land,on top of the garage.Sounds crazy,i know but it is what it is.If you guys are interested in this experiment,email me back or come out here.We have plenty of activity.I will say though flashing these things with high powered flash lights,attract them out of curiousity being that most people don't do that ha ha.So that's it.Laters.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

saw what i thought was a star just light up so bright, and move slowly downward, it hovered for a couple of seconds, and i could see the shape of the craft this time.  it was definitely triangular.  the light that came off light up the sky all around it like an electrical charge, and the color of the light was a very bright bluish-white.  after it hovered, it turned and took off an absolutely incredible rate of speed, and followed a commercial flight that was heading due north.  it easily caught up to the flight, and passed it up as if it were standing still. i have seen some weird things up in the sky, but this was by far the most unexplainable thing i have ever seen.    only the joint strike fighter lightening ii, a helicopter, or a harrier jet can hover like that.  all i know is���both times i have seen this thing it was silent.  it is my theory the only human thing i know of that could fly like that is���the air force/nasa experimental tr3-a or tr3-b ���night-walker���, which is part of the aurora program.  or it is an alien craft from another world.  a shooting star or meteor does not hover like that, and when i see them���they flash across the sky quickly.  i have never seen a meteor turn either.  i will be out there with a video camera from this night on.  i am located in park ridge, il, but perhaps worldwide���if you want to see what i am seeing, check the skies at night���find the big dipper star formation.  i have seen other orbs fly either due north through the big dipper, or just east of the big dipper.  you may dismiss it as a plane at a high altitude���until it stops up there.   they might deny it, but the o���hare radar has to be picking these things up���unless they are cloaked or stealth.  i am located about 3 miles northeast of o���hare. check it out���experimental or alien���it sure is fun to wonder.  once you see it���you will believe.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11208,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8855636,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06182008-0001","longitude":-87.6287182,"occurred":1213766100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1213766100000,"summary":"Triangle

st, in greenwood, in.��� we just finished eating dinner with another friend, and we were all heading back home.��� randomly i looked up at the sky from the passenger seat.��� i saw two very intense bright amber-colored lights high above the sky.��� it looked like they would have been over the city of frankln or columbus in, which are��� approx. 7 and 20 miles from greenwood respectively.��� so i was looking south and saw these 2 lights.��� then a third light popped up out of nowhere.��� the three got into a clustered group and formed a nearly triangular shape.��� ��� i remember thinking up until then that it was road flares, because that was the only thing that it looked like it could have been(even though the lights appeared from thin air, unlike road flares).��� next four more of these lights showed up out of nowhere, just like the third light.��� the seven lights remained clustered, then they formed a diagonal line, very well organized i might add.��� this is when i started to get the goosebumps.��� after forming the line the seven got back into a spread out clustered formation, and many of them started to blink and flash.��� then they started to disappear.��� amazingly they all reappeared in different parts of the sky fractions of a second after they disappeared.��� it was like they were covering miles and miles of skyline in tenths of a second.��� they just kept disappearing and reappearing.��� i remember how upset we were when they were gone, then we would get really pumped up when they would reappear, it was an amazing sight.��� if i had to describe the light i would compare it to the way a large street light looks from a slight distance, however these lights were more intense and had a very high altitude.��� ��� the weird thing was that i called some local news affiliates from indianapolis, and i kept getting told it was a marine helicopter training exercise.��� oddly the police department knew nothing about the marine training exercise. these lights were not helicopters, unless they were helicopters that could disappear and reappear and not make a sound (if you see a helicopter you can hear it).��� also about 45 minutes after the spectacle helicopters started flying right by my apartment southbound, toward the area of the event.��� there were approximately 8 choppers total heading down there and they were all low and in a hurry.��� helicopters never fly around like that in my neck of the woods unless its emergency or news choppers.��� ��� some helpful information i could give would be that there is a small airport 2 miles west from where i first witnessed the lights.��� also there is a military training base (camp atterbury) about 20 minutes south from greenwood in.��� to my knowledge this base does not deal w/ military flight or aviation.��� i am a skeptical person and i tend to find rational worldly explanations for everything i hear and see.��� what i saw last night was either an extremely advanced form of human aviation, or some other form of aviation that i guess would not be human.��� i am not so concerned with it being terrestrial/extraterrestrial, i just want to know how those lights were moving and disappearing/reappearing like that.��� sorry to type so much but i am hoping someone gets on here that was in the same area last night, and can share their story, so i want to be as descriptive as possible.��� ��� in closing i want to say that the way they formed their patterns was odd.��� they went from two lights to three lights, and made a triangle.��� then four more appeared and the 7 made a diagonal line.��� then the spread clustering, and the dissappearing/reappearing.��� then it was like they worked back down to finish.��� they formed back into a cluster, then a diagonal line, then there were only two left (they left the triangle out at the end).��� i'm getting chills right now here at work as i am typing this.��� this is my first ever experience with anything like this, and i

highway 375 (otherwise known as the extraterrestrial highway). approximately 9:30 pm, after passing groom lake road, my sister saw an object in the sky, south of us. i pulled over the side of the highway and quickly exited the car. 20-25 miles south of us, over some mountains, we saw an unknown craft fluttering around with the dexterity of a moth. this craft was at least the size of a two-story house (maybe larger, it is hard to judge size in the desert), and had two strobing lights, one green, one red. it was not a jet, airplane, or helicopter, as it fluttered around the sky like a butterfly. it would alternate directions immediately, dropping and rising 50 feet instantaneously. we observed the ufo for about 2 minutes before it sank below the mountains.\r\n\r\nthree possibilities immediately entered my mind regarding the ufo:\r\n1. it was an alien spacecraft piloted by aliens.\r\n2. it was an alien spacecraft piloted by military personnel.\r\n3. it was an experimental aircraft reverse engineered utilizing alien technology piloted by military personnel.\r\n\r\nfive minutes later, the ufo appeared again. it hovered in the air, as if the pilots were skittish���somewhat afraid to be where they were. this sighting was even more exciting as we all were able to fully observe the ufo, its rapid movements making it impossible that this was a man-made craft. after another two minutes, the ufo sank below the mountains. adrenaline pumping, we surveyed our surroundings, spotting stationary headlights behind us on the highway, about a mile or two away. this light did not move. after five minutes, we became nervous and decided to investigate. we drove back and saw a white suv with government plates speed off. relieved to not find leatherface or any other deranged cannibal hillbillies in rusty pickup trucks, we decided to drive back to our observation point (approximately 26 miles southeast of the lil ale inn). \r\n\r\n5-10 minutes passed without any sign of the ufo. it was starting to get late, as i live 2 ��� hours away in las vegas, so i was ready to leave when the ufo hovered in the air once again. this time we all noticed an incredible sight: the mountain range to our left was being illuminated on the other side by a powerful light source intermittently, as if the area 51 base was trying to communicate with the ufo with a sophisticated visual version of morse code. the mountains were silhouetted in light. we were all silent, awestruck at the possibilities. this new sighting made me realize what was happening:\r\n\r\nthe area 51 base was attempting to communicate with an alien spacecraft utilizing light signals. \r\n\r\nwhy else would they utilize an enormous light source in such a manner? every time the craft came into view, the light source would illuminate the mountains in an intermittent fashion. when the craft lowered, the light source would stop. it almost seemed as if the lights somehow reassured the ufo to not fly away. we could not tell if the ufo ever landed or not, as the mountain range blocked our view of the ground and area 51.\r\n\r\nwe stayed another 15 minutes, observing the ufo twice more. the lights from the base strobed even more powerful as the ufo fluttered around. it was obvious that we were observing something important, beyond our understanding. was this the first time that this communication has taken place, or has this been going on years or decades and they are trying to refine their methods of communication? so many questions swirled around my mind, though the overwhelming feeling was one of awe and excitement. there is not a doubt in my mind that i witnessed an alien spacecraft. i plan on going back and camping out on a mountain overlooking the restricted zone boundary, and packing a video camera, telescope, and binoculars!\r\n\r\noverall, we observed the ufo for over a half hour, 5 sightings in all, about 2 minutes at a time. i was not drunk or high, nor was my wife or sister. i have completed 190 credits hours in college courses, my wife has a master���s degree, and my sister attends george washington university. we are all in agreement that we have witnessed a ufo.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional
