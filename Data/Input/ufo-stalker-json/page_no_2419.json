sumtimes looked as if it was 2 lights really close to eachother. i tried to record it on my phone but it wasnt able to catch a good video of it, so i took pictures of it on my cell phone. i took pictures of the normal stars and you couldnt see them on my phone but when i took pictures of the bright light, you could see it on my phone. it looks like a bright white dot. i went inside to tell my brother what he thought of it and he came out with his digital camera and took a couple of pictures as well. then we went inside for about 20-30 minutes untill i went back outside to smoke another cigarette and noticed it was no longer in the sky. i kind of had a shockin sensation when i noticed that it was no longer there. i have about 8 pictures i took on my phone. i was lookin towards the

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was  home on leave from the u.S. navy between may 6-12, 1977. while home near kinder, louisiana, i went and met a couple of friends that were fishing in an irrigation canal about a mile north of town on green oak road around 4:00 pm in the afternoon. my friends were in a boat fishing about 100 yards from the road as i started walking down the canal levy to meet them. about half way to them, my friends started yelling like crazy for me to look up in the sky. they were pointing in the sky to the north of the canal, but i was unable to see anything because of trees growing nearby. i yelled back and ask what it was, and they were yelling that it was a ufo!\r\n\r\nat that time, i started running toward them and looking through the trees  for an opening. as i neared my friends, i saw the object in the sky that had them all excited. it appeared to be a perfectly round silver sphere glowing against the cloudless blue afternoon sky. again i ask my friends what it was, and again they said it was a ufo as they paddled to the bank and told me to get in the boat to have a better look at the object. as we paddled away from the bank and sat in the middle of the canal watching the object for a few minutes it appeared to be getting somewhat closer like maybe it was drifting toward us slightly. i thought that possibly it could have been a weather balloon at that point, except for the fact that it was perfectly round and not long like a weather balloon and the silver glow of the object seemed far more intense that any weather balloon that i have ever seen reflecting the sun. the object became very stationary again and appeared to be the size of a quarter held at arms length. without any reference to the size of the object, i was unable to determine if it was the size of a basketball and was just above the grown pine trees, or if it was a mile across and two miles away. at it closest most stationary point, i remember remarking to my friends that there was something larger and transparent behind the glowing sphere in the sky. it was difficult to see, but there appeared to be a much larger transparent possibly saucer shaped object on top of the sphere. you could see the sky through the larger object, but you also see the outline of the larger shape above it as if you were looking through a clear glass object. \r\n\r\nabout five minutes into the sighting, a smaller very intense red ball of light appeared at the bottom on the silver sphere that looked very much like a lit road flair without any smoke coming off of it. very slowly the intense red ball of light started to lower from the silver sphere and appeared to be held in position by a very fine dark line in the sky. the much smaller intense red ball lowered a distance about four times the diameter of the larger silver sphere and then stopped in the sky and remained stationary as the dark line that appeared to be lowering the object appeared to turn into ashes and fall from the sky. the lowering of the red object took 1-2 minutes.\r\n\r\nover the period of the next five minutes, the smaller red ball of light started expanding and collapsing in size getting lighter in color as it expanded and redder as it collapsed. each time the red ball of light expanded and collapsed it remained larger each time and lighter in color until it was finally identical in size and color of the larger silver sphere in which the much smaller ball of light descended from. now the identical silver spheres of light sat stationary one above the other for another five minutes.\r\n\r\nafter five minutes, suddenly both spheres moved far across the sky to the west so fast that the eye was unable to see the movement. the objects were simply here and then all of sudden they were sitting far across the sky at a dead stop with a fine dark line in the sky from where each object was sitting connecting to were each object now sat. again, the fine dark lines in the sky appeared to turn to ashes and fall from the sky in a couple of seconds. both objects repeated these rapid unseen to the eye movements 4-5 times over the next five minutes leaving the fine dark line each time they moved back and forth widely from the east and west across the sky. each time both objects stayed perfectly spaced one above the other.\r\n\r\nafter five minutes of unbelievable and unseen movement and instant stops that lasted about a minute each, one sphere darted quickly out of sight behind the trees to the north and the other quickly cleared the eastern horizon in approximately two seconds. at least this time they were moving slow enough to actually see them move across the sky.\r\n\r\nduring the entire 20 minutes or so that we observed the object(s) moving or sitting stationary in the sky there were no noise whatsoever heard form them.\r\n\r\nafter both objects left the area, we quickly loaded up the boat and headed toward the home of one my friends in the boat that lived two miles north of our location. upon pulling up at my friends house, his younger brothers and sister came running up to the truck all yelling ���daddy saw a ufo, daddy saw a ufo���. my friend said, ���let me do the talking��� and then asked his dad what he saw. his dad said, ���that he had saw a ufo straight above his property for nearly ten minutes and that it sprayed spider webs every time it moved.���\r\nwhen asked what he meant about it spraying spider webs, he said ���every time it moved it sprayed spider webs that fell on his property and completely covered his ten acre pasture so that it looked like it was totally covered by white frost���. he said that he tried to gather the spider webs up in his hands and it would melt in his hands as soon as it touched the skin. by the time we had made it to my friends home all of the ���spider webs��� had melted off of the ten acre pasture.\r\n\r\ni then headed to town (kinder, la) to see if anyone in town had seen the ���ufo���. i met nearly a dozen different people shortly thereafter that i knew and they all asked, ���did you see the ufo��� before i would even have a chance to ask them. with so many people seeing the ufo, i figured that it had to be on the evening news so i headed home to watch it. nothing was mentioned during the newscast, but at the start of the weather the weatherman announced that 200 people had called the tv station (kplc) and reported seeing a ufo between kinder and oakdale, la (a distance of 30 miles). however, the weatherman then announced that it was not a ufo. he stated that the national weather service had called the station and said that it was only a ���special weather balloon that was equipped with rockets���. \r\n\r\ntwo days after the above sighting while riding with my brother on hwy 165 south of kinder. my brother ran his brand new ford ltd ii off the road, jumped out of the car and unto the hood yelling, ���i saw it, i saw it���.  thinking he had nutted up, i ask him, ���you saw what���. he said that he had just seen one of the silver spheres on the east side of the highway and that it had crashed into the rice field between the 3rd and 4th levy (maybe 100 yards)  from the road. he then attempted to enter the field, but i persuaded him not to enter the field as it was planted with young rice about 6 inches high and flooded with water. i assured him that if the object had crashed, we would have been able to see it from the road. i asked him if he had seen any water or mud come up from the ground when it crashed and he said, ���actually it did not look like it crashed, it looked like it went into the ground���. \r\n\r\ni was just wondering if anyone else had seen a ���weather balloon��� that could move across the sky in excess of 30,000 mph and stop and go in an instant without making any noise. i have been looking for another one for over 30 years without any luck.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path then

of a quarter on edge held at arm's length and about the thickness of a 747 when viewed from 3 miles or so. i estimate it was about 20 miles from our location and must have been huge if viewed up close. after viewing it for 30 seconds or so the shuttle launched and our attention was diverted to the shuttle. we watched the shuttle go up until it was no longer visible approx. 1-2 minutes. when i

first i thought was a fire but after watching if for a minute realized it was an orange saucer flying behind my home, coming from the north flying southeast. i yelled to my house guest who was in bed in his bedroom what i was seeing as i was rushing out for a better look at the saucer and jet. my husband in bed did not wake up when i yelled for our house guest.\r\nmy houseguest who is a retired navy petty officer and i went into the back yard for a better look at the saucer and jet flying less than a mile away from us at about 3000 feet, just above grants pass peak.\r\non the first loop it was one saucer and one jet, on the second loop it was one saucer and one jet. the next loop there were two saucers and two jets, after that on each loop there was another saucer and another jet. be a total of three saucers and three military jets. every half hour the saucers would come back as if circling a certain area in a set pattern.\r\nann said there was no fear, just many other emotions.��� i would have never thought i would have experienced this in my life time, it was awesome! i couldn't believe what i was seeing.  i laughed when the military jet was chasing after the saucer and it got

the town president bush was in and flew back again. \r\nthis continued to happen several more times with the time intervals getting shorter. the loops started out at half an hour, went down to 20 minutes, then 15 minutes and then 10 minutes. at one point we saw a fighter jet refueling in the sky. \r\nthe saucers made no noise but the jets were making a lot of noise.\r\nann watched the craft and jets for several hours before she became too tired to watch any more. ann went to bed and slept. it probably came back but i didn���t awake until my alarm went off to get ready for work.\r\nsam

as if playing cat and mouse with the jets which were going as fast as they could go.\r\nsam thought it was cool and exciting to watch the craft and jets as they flew along their flight

be classified as a nut job.\r\n\r\nlast night, not a joke, around 1:30am june 2, 2008 i made a trip to the\r\npantry to grab a snack.  on the way back to my bedroom with powerbar in\r\nhand i looked out the window slats by the front door to check on the\r\nneighborhood (westerville, oh).  everything looked fine.  however, something in the northeastern sky caught my eye traveling from north to south.\r\n\r\na very large aircraft was flashing some strange colors and traveling at\r\na very fast speed.  i tried to focus on the typical white and red\r\nflashing lights of an a usual airplane however there were none.  the colors hinted more to a red and multicolored very vibrant but distinct color flashing.  (logically, i thought perhaps it is a meteor, and i was about to call dad and val.  however, i know meteors are not long lived and i didn't want to miss it.)  so the meteor continued across the night sky at a very fast speed.\r\n\r\nso next, the large meteor made several quick manuvers from straight to\r\nalmost completely parrallel to the previous position.  the meteor seemed\r\nto be capable of making stairs in the sky.  moving again from the north\r\nto the south to completely west to the south to completely west to the\r\nsouth.  no human could have survivied the speed or the manuevers this\r\nlarge aircraft was doing.  i can't even imagine the g-forces in which\r\nthe aircraft was under as it made the stair formation.  or what sort of\r\npropulsion system allowed an aircraft/meteor to travel straight to\r\ncompletely latteral in movement and then completely straight again.\r\n\r\nat this point i noticed the meteor/aircraft (still very large and\r\nflashing a distinct pattern of redish, blueish and purplish hues in\r\nsequence) was tracking on what would be considered a normal airplane.\r\nthe airplane was the size of a fighter jet at very high altitudes.  the\r\nfighter jet was pretty much a dot in the sky compared to the\r\nmeteor/aircraft.  it had the normal red and white flashing lights but\r\nthey were barely detectable.  the airplane was moving in an arced motion\r\nin the atomosphere traveling from north to south.  \r\n\r\ni noticed that the previous movements by the \"unidentified flying\r\nobject\" were to bring it on a direct intercept course with the (assumed)fighter jet.  the \"ufo\" then in close proximaty to the fighter jet attacked or something.  because in the spot of the fighter jet was a very bright competely circular light (just to the north and east of where the\r\nfighter jet had been was a less dense red completely circular light.\r\nthey both held in place for approximately a second).  both lights\r\ndisappeared and there was no

resources to build such a large aircraft?\r\nit was definitely traveling faster than the speed of sound.  there\r\nshould have been a sonic boom at that speed.  unless what i saw happened\r\ncompletely in outerspace.  how could it make those manuvuers?  how could\r\nit just disappear into itself.  how could it make the red and white\r\ncircular lights appear and hold in place and then disappear?  and how\r\ndid it make the airplane disappear?  what happened to it?  what the\r\nheck is going on?\r\n\r\nin another e-mail i wrote:\r\ni did find one thing interesting about my sighting.  everyone always says they can tell the shape and what not.  the lights from it were so bright i have no idea the shape of the ufo.  the damn thing was moving so fast there and cutting those

rate of speed heading south. i initially noticed it with a viewing angle of approx 30degrees, 3-5 miles away. i told my mother to look in the sky, and said \"omg what is that?\" she was talking on the cell phone(driver), and told me to \"hush\" she did not see anything, nor bother looking because of traffic. my nephew however was in the back seat, and also saw the same object. as we watched it, i was amazed by the speed of this object. it was moving faster than anything i have ever seen in the sky. it kept its course and disappeared suddenly.\r\n\r\ncamera type: fuji finepix s7000 (no pics of

car parked at the bottom of the hill with only one headlight on.  although it was parked on the opposite side i slowed down because it was at the lowest point in the road and i couldn't judge exactly where it was until the parking lights went on, they were bright lozenge shaped red lights in front of the car.As i passed the suv i noticed a person standing in the road in front of the car,i am not sure if there were two, and he suddenly lit up so that i could see him/her in a head-to-toe rain gear outfit.  the head was covered with a very distinct rain hat so that the face was too dark to make out.  i also noticed a flashlight that was just a glowing half dome on a stick like a microphone.  i noticed but didn't think anything of it then, there was no beam of light coming from it.  the rain suit had reflective stripes running lengthwise sparekley so that i rationalized that the sudden light i saw was the reflection from these stripes once the parking lights came on and i saw the \"flashlights\". as i passed the suv i glanced to see the people inside and saw what looked to be two ordinary people.  a man in his mid 50's was in the driver seat, staring straight ahead with no facial expression but i couldn't make out the passanger.  what struck me as odd was there being another person standing behind the vehicle dressed exactly the same as the one in front.  \r\ni figured since they weren't police [there were no other vehicles] they must be trying to help the car that had only one headlight.  it had been raining earlier so the wacky rain gear didn't seem so odd after all.  that is until i looked back in the rear view mirror and saw the one standing in back, move out into the road and start looking for something on the ground.  again i noticed that i saw no beam from the flashlight, but i could make out that it was dressed in a silver jumpsuit with reflective bands and a helmet hat.  as i pulled away i couldn't help wonder why these two people would still be wearing rain hats when it wasn't raining and where did they come from? maybe they were taking a walk and came upon the car, but identical head to toe silver jumpsuits in rindge?And those beam less

looking out windshield during bright, cloudless afternoon conditions.  driver's side door was slightly open as it was warm.  witness was wearing polarized sunglasses and observed object traveling into field of vision from north to south (left to right) for at least 20 seconds about 200 feet altitude or slightly above a four story building.  attention was drawn to object due to its immense size (spanned over 300 feet) and low altitude.  speed appeared to be similar as commercial aircraft as observed in high cruising altitudes and no noise was detected.  color was light gunmetal gray metallic and had dull magnesium-like coating appearing fluid-like or liquid, changing shades of light gray or having a cloud-like haze surrounding it.  witness was talking on cell phone to relative at the time object appeared in line of sight and reported sighting to her.  out of fear and disbelief, witness remained on phone as long as observation took place, describing series of events.  when object was directly in front of line of sight, angular, multi-wing shape was observed most clearly with well-defined, transparent, glassy, dome-shaped canopy on top toward front, very round, like a soap bubble.  canopy seemed large for the overall size of the object, occupying approximately one-tenth of object's size and was about double in height as compared to the width of the object.  width of object appeared to be similar to commercial jet (727 is 34 feet) and was about one-tenth the length of the total object.  shape of object was a five or six-pointed star/chevron/hexagon and construction was slightly faceted (not smooth) in appearance.  although object did not have a smooth surface, it reminded witness of a stingray animal as it was flat with ample surface area, had larger angular wing-like structures in center, and smaller angular tail-like wings pointing from rear.  there were no smooth curves visible except for canopy.  shape was difficult to determine due to object being parallel to line of sight and object could have been morphing.  surface appeared to be constructed from multiple portions of metal sheeting as seams and ribs were evident but no rivets were visible. no lights, mirror-like appearance or shininess were observed.  overall appearance was of a fluid-like dull metallic which witness had never seen before and has difficulty describing.  when first observed, thought object was military craft (usaf b2-spirit-shaped, except did not have as thin of nose and had a very visible canopy) until removed sunglasses (high quality non-prescription polycarobonate custom-crafted at optical shop) to attempt better view and object seemed to disappear as if cloaked.  faint, whitish outline could still be seen without polarized lenses.  replaced sunglasses and object reappeared with remarkable detail as originally observed.  witness removed and replaced sunglasses quickly in succession at least three times when first observing object and then removed and replaced glasses again toward end of sighting.  toward end of sighting, witness became startled when commercial jet was observed in 45+ degree angle of ascent (taking off from nearby airport) and approached flight path of unknown object as it appeared there would be a mid-air collision.  jet flew less than 20 feet above object, crossing over perpendicular (from east to west) to object's path and witness was able to calculate size of object as at least three times the length of the average-sized commercial jet's wingspan.  jet was on high angle take-off and was traveling slightly faster than observed unknown object.  object never deviated from path and remained constant in altitude.  witness exited vehicle after losing sight of object to the south, most likely due to pollution haze, and walked inside building.  witness reported sighting to co-workers and later in the week to security personnel assigned to the building.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

class my friend went to talk to the teacher about about a computer problem at home at home, and myself being skilled with computer went up to join the conversation, to see if i could help. well one thing lead to another and we got into a detailed conversation \"the 3 of us\" about topics like \"the government, ets, anti-gravity, and the north american trade union\" not typical topics discussed at school, but it was after hours everyone left to go home, my teacher was basically just listening to our thoughts, ideas, and theory's. well i decided to call it a night and head home, my teacher and friend remain inside school to keep talking, i walked out the door to the courtyard witch connects to the parking lot witch only had about 4 cars in it, it was about 11:50pm \"i stayed after school about 20 min. inside\" as i crossed the courtyard to the parking lot i was about 10 yards from my truck, i constantly look at the night sky when im outside, something my father got me doing, being interested in ufo, i fittled with my keys and then i looked up because i saw a faint light above me, as soon as i looked up my eyes focused on a huge star like light about my head \"i could of put my hand up and the star like light would of perfectly fit in my, hand size wise\" if could take a guess, it was about 130-150 feet above me, hovering \"silently\". what i found really surprising and a second time experience for me, this star-like object when i looked up at i instantaneously accelerated to a speed that to me, was impossible. this encounter had a duration of around 7 seconds from seeing the light above to almost missing it take off by blinking. it seems, as soon as i focused on it, i took off. after this i had no missing time.","distance":"101-500

types of airplanes and jets from a distance. i was trying to reproduce what showed up in the picture. birds were recognizable and planes came out more spherical, probably due to either the motion of the plane or of my hand. that leads me to believe that whatever it is, was more stationary or slow-moving. it could mean something was on the lens, also. i don���t know. the photos before and after this photo was taken, were taken within the same minute and of different areas in the sky. there were no mysterious objects in those photos.  i have limited knowledge of digital cameras and would like to know what could have caused these images. please write me back with any information or thoughts you may have. the first photo (023.Jpg) is the unadulterated original. i will swear on my life to

four larger light panels flashing primary colors.\r\ni vaguely remember thick glass panels with humanoids looking out of the craft.\r\n\r\ni estimate we were less than 40 yards away from the craft, hovering silently. i remember both of us breaking away from the window and running to our parents, who were disturbed that we were awake and wouldn't listen to our story.\r\n\r\ni was about 5 at the time, my brother was 7.\r\n\r\nwe were both stunned - not even knowing what we were looking at - it was years later that the term ufo was heard by me - and i knew then that's what we saw - a ufo.\r\n\r\nmy brother and i spoke about the event often. funny, we both experienced regular ( he more than i ) nosebleeds after that for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\ni've seen 2 now, the other in 1988/89 i was about 28 years old - i was in a field in macon, ga at night, and a silent rectangular craft passed overhead - again it was 20-40 yards away from me. about 50 feet long i guess 20 feet wide and perhaps 20 feet tall. many odd shaped lights surrounded the craft. this was around 9:30 at night - i was out in the field because a very rare occurance of the aura borealis was present that far south the night before, and i wanted to get away from the city to see if it re-occured.\r\n\r\ni saw it approaching - at first at a distance it looked like a small plane but it moved very slowly - and didn't make any sound. i watched and watched and wondered how it could fly so slow - thinking perhaps like me they were out and about looking to see the aura borealis too - but this 'plane' was coming at me in a straight line - but oh so slow.\r\n\r\nit was strange - real strange - very quiet - very still. object just passed overhead at about 30 mph - not a sound - just kept on moving until i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nthese aren't teeny tiny objects seen from a great distance - these craft (both of them) were seen at very close ranges - tree top level - very very close by - not to be mistaken by
