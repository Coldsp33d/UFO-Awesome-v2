first spotted it about 700ft away and maybe 40ft high just above the tree lines. it was just hovering above a vastly wooded area. there were flashing lights what looked like on every corner of the object sometimes white green or red. while i was filming the video i noticed it started to decend a little more below the tree line as if it were trying to hide. i put my window down to get a better image and i noticed the sound that it made was not typical of any aircraft that i've ever known of, it was very quiet and had a machine type of sound no propellers or jet. i know it wasn't a helicopter. another thing that blew me away after watching the video is i saw sporadic flashes of light hitting the wooded area very fast. after i made a u turn to try and get closer it was no longer

realized there were more moving.  some larger than others. it seemed like the smaller ones were connected to the larger ones and kind of blue. one i noticed that the movements of the two were matching and kind of far from each other.  later noticed they were all over the sky moving only enough to notice if you were paying attention. also, foggy clouds came rolling in from the north.  it sort of looked like the smaller blue objects were dissipating the clouds as they moved back and fro.\r\ni sat and watched all this for about an hour.  the clouds had almost cleared about then.  there was a large building behind me, so i couldn't see the west side of the landscape there.  so, i walked around to get a better look at the whole sky and noticed 3 orange-ish shapes close to the ground towards downtown. seemed like helicopters flying around as they started to move more.\r\ni looked around the whole sky and it seemed like these orb/stars were all over. if i stared at them it looked like they were like bubbles about 20 feet above my head. like an optical illusion.It was really weird feeling. they kind of looked like chrome/gold spheres that were transparent. oh yeah, when i cam around the building i noticed the huge light hovering just above the east hills.  that was all white and glowing. looked like the shape of arrows pointing different directions inside of the glow. arrows like how you draw with lines. this is about close to sunrise so it was still kinda dark. nobody pulling into work seemed to notice anything. i guess the large form above the mountains looked like a large, bright star. i started to walk around the parking lot to find a darker area out of the warehouse lights and noticed that one of those orbs was following me around about 15 feet above my head.  if i looked away it would go higher up and as soon as i looked back at it while i walked around it would cruise back down closer to me. so i started walking back to the other side of the building again to see if it would still follow me. that made me laugh at it. it really was funny like a cartoon or something. it seemed like a soap bubble or something like that. i thought i might have lost it really. i kept looking up to see if it was still there the whole time.  i crossed through this gate with big pine trees and powerlines around it.  i noticed when i got to the other side that it was gone and i was bummed.  so i went around to see the light above the mountain and it was starting to ascend real slow, getting a little smaller. i mean it was going slow like it knew that most people wouldn't notice it to be nothing but a bright star.  so i stood and watched it go higher and higher till it looked like a super white dot on the clouds. it kinda cruised to the left on the cloud for a little then disappeared or went into the cloud. whew. \r\naround 7:30 i started checking the web to see if anyone had anything to say.  not much there really. the military said that it was a test missile launched off the coast.  i don't think i was seeing the same thing. the pictures they put up didn't look like what i saw...And that wouldn't be a hovering slow rising thing. and that was it. my phone sucks and it just looks like a dot.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

disappointed, as i would have liked to see something more interesting than a metallic sphere that flew without changing course.  that feeling only lasted a few seconds before the entire incident was

(and i have never seen a drone stay perfectly still as this object was) \r\nthe object was round in shape and dark with what appeared to be a lighter grayish ring inside. (or at least 2-tone in color) the size was impossible to determine because it was so far up, but after watching it stationary for a few minutes, it slowly descended below view level. i considered trying to go up there but it was too dark already and it usually takes 45 minutes to hike to the top. sadly, we had recorded the coyote but didn't think to record the object until it started moving. we watched for a while but it did not reappear.

of the window.  we were headed south on east broad when i saw two very large triangular crafts hovering above the city. they were very dark (dark gray to black)in color. they where covered in large, round white lights. the crafts were parallel to each other and perpendicular to the ground.  the widest part of the triangle was closest to the ground with the top pointing upward.  they stayed stationary.  i saw them above the city, fairly low flying for any sort of air traffic.  i can't say exactly how large they were, except to describe them as enormous.  the car windows were up, so i couldn't here anything, but i would expect something of that size to make a sound loud enough to be heard inside a nearby vehicle.  i will note that on the way back from the islands i did notice two or three seemingly stationary aircrafts in the distance.  unlike the triangles, these seemed to be either planes or helicopters, but they were too far away for me to give more details than that.  the night was somewhat cloudy and the triangles were far below the clouds.  after i first saw them, i lost sight of them for a few seconds, as a building obstructed my view of them.  we drove past an alley, at which point i caught sight of them again.  when we got to the next cross street, i asked my roommate to turn right.  she did, but the street was lined with trees which obstructed the view of the sky.  when we turned again, we had a clearer view of the sky, but we could not spot the triangles.  unfortunately, since my roommate was driving, she never saw them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":83466,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.0653641,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05012017-0016","longitude":-81.089123,"occurred":1493156700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1493648326000,"summary":"Two

with liquid ox in 1963. an ap was on guard at entrance to the flt. line.\r\n   i was looking at the sky thinking of home and in 90 or less days i would be home and out of the af. i was staring up the run way and it looked like a bright star was getting bigger. then i noticed it seemed moving strait at me. i called to the ap and asked him if he saw it, he wondered what it was. at first i thought it might be an f100 then realized way too fast. it took about 3 to 5 seconds to get over head, then stopped for about a second it then went right for not even a second and stopped again, it then returned the way it came over the horizon in just a few seconds. \r\n    the ap and i talked about reporting it. \r\n i told him i was short (less than 90 days left) so i wouldn't be talking to anyone. i thought they may want to extend me for a longer time to discharge. i don't know if he reported it or not. one of the tower people i new was on duty that night and we spoke about this and the tower had some tape or record but i never saw or herd anything on base about it.\r\n   at first i thought it might be a missile from russia but it was so fast and could stop instantly and start again in a

(these men were about 5 feet tall, bald heads, skin that was the shade of a caucasian person, and normal features like ours, except their eyes were a little enlarged and seemed to be extended a little laterally as well, so that they were a little longer horizontally.) \r\n     then i woke up in my bed, hearing a loud repeating noise like a chinese gong ( i heard this in the background during my dream as well.)  the gong would start immediately over the house. then the apparent source of the sound moved away and would would gong over and over again, further and further away, as it was projected out to the south east. it got softer and softer, and the gongs became closer and closer together until it faded away in the distance.  then it would repeat again, loudly, immediately over house, and then the sound was projected in a straight path out to the south east, gong- gong- gong etc. i wanted to take a look, but i seemed paralyzed and could not move to look. the \"craft\" then moved slowly to the south east for about one hundred fifty feet, and then it accelerated and was soon gone. it did not leave at some unbelievable speed, but much faster than, for instance, a helicopter could go. it was still making gong sounds as it faded away in the distance, but otherwise it made no sound.\r\n     my sister was lying on her back, wide eyed and very scared. i asked her if she had seen anything, to which she answered that she had.  she described a disk that was pretty small, maybe 20 feet in diameter- glowing red, and it had two lights flashing, i think yellow and green. she was 8 years old, so i am not sure that she saw anything, but she still says that she had. my mother walked out to the porch, and i asked her if she had heard the sound, and she said that it woke her up. we then went out into the back yard to see if there was anything that we might find concerning this event, but nothing seemed disturbed. i was 15 at the time. my brothers and  my father were still asleep. i thought it was very interesting that only the three of us were awake (not even the dog), and yet the noise was very loud.  it should have awaken anyone. we three, of course, were the ones in my dream. i do not think that we were really on a flying saucer, but it does seem strange. i never thought of reporting this, and i did not know that you could. my mother called the police, but they said that no one had reported anything. now, i just felt that some of what we experienced might parallel someone else's experience and it might be interesting.\r\n
