anyone, because i was afraid of the ridicule that i knew would come from telling my story, and because my memory surrounding this incident been so unclear. \r\n\r\ni definitely saw this thing ��� it's image is forever burned into my memory, and i still have nightmares about it, increasingly so, it seems ��� but everything after the initial moment of the sighting remains an absolute blur, including the exact time, date and location. i remember that i was driving with someone ��� my ex-wife, i think, but i honestly don't remember who. i do know that we were southbound on colorado highway 287.  the location was a few miles north of the old saw mill, just north of a convenience store called \"ted's place.\" i believe it was somewhere between 5:00 and 7:00 pm, and visibility was excellent. i got a very good look at the thing. \r\n\r\ni remember coming around a curve in the road and suddenly seeing a shockingly large delta wing or boomerang shaped object in the sky...Judging by the landmarks, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 mile at its widest point...Hovering above the cliff to my left. i served with the 4th marine aircraft wing, so i have been around all kinds of aircraft...Even some classified military aircraft...And i can tell you that it was nothing like anything that i had ever seen before, or since. the closest thing that i have ever seen to this was called the yb-49 flying wing...Only this thing was gargantuan and had no sign of an engine of anykind, anywhere, and it made no sound that i could hear...And it was just hanging there, hovering. the ufo had a much more pronounced \"v\" shape, and no fuselage or tail fins at all.\r\n\r\nat the time i owned some land in the area, and it frightened me that this occurred so close to my property...Virtually, in my backyard. i had hiked all up and down those hills and cliffs in the area, both hunting and photographing wildlife, so i was very familiar with the area. this has haunted me for years, and i would like to know more about it. i am willing to be hypnotized, if it will help me to remember the incident.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"May 2000 sighting of object over lake superior:\r\n\r\nmy wife and i live in new brighton, minnesota, which is a northren suburb of the twin cities (minneapolis/st. paul).  every few weeks or months for the last decade, we've made numerous overnight trips to north-central wisconsin, or the north shore of lake superior.  we enjoy the beauty of the lake and country around the area of washburn and ashland, in particular.  when laura and i travel to north-central wisconsin, we almost always stay at the americinn on the east side of ashland, next to lake superior.\r\n\r\non a may morning about eight years ago, i got up shortly after dawn and went out to the north patio of the ashland americinn to sip some coffee and smoke a cigarette.  as i lit my cigarette, i scanned the lake for boats and ships, noting very few.  but my attention was attracted to what i at first took to be a bird spiraling up from the surface of the lake.  the \"bird\" was initially near the surface of the lake, i would estimate at a distance of one mile to the north-northeast.  the \"bird\" was rising slowly, flying in a tight upward spiral, counterclockwise as seen from above.  after awhile, i became increasingly puzzled, since the \"gull\" never deviated from the tight, rising spiral, as one would expect some randomness in the flight of a bird.  also, i noticed that the object flashed most brilliantly when it passed through the west side of its spiral, pointing somewhat in my direction, though the sun was of course in the east.  curious, i watched the object for some minutes, as it continuously spiraled upward.  i would guess it was eight to ten minutes.  eventually, i lost sight of the object at an elevation above the horizon of about 70 degrees, owing to eye strain and growing altitude.  given the object was initially about a mile away, and its elevation was eventually greater than 70 degrees, it's altitude can be calculated as about 14,500 feet, or 2 3/4 miles.  it would seem strange behavior for a bird to deliberately fly so high.  given 9 minutes, with the time of flight of about 0.15 hours:  2.75 miles / 0.15 hours = 18 miles per hour, vertical velocity.  also, the rate of rotation in the spiraling was about 30 revolutions / minute (2 seconds per revolution).  at no time did any sound come from the object.\r\n\r\nin addition to the object being white, i had the impression that the brightness was primarily generated by the object, itself - that it was not reflected light.  as i mentioned, it went through a bright phase on the west side of its spiral, when it was visible to me.  there were very few people on the patio that morning, and i did not think to ask someone else to watch the object with me.  in retrospect, that is unfortunate.  but, i didn't realize i was watching something strange until the object had gained some altitude, such that it would have been difficult to locate anyway.                \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

southwest of austin. it���s very rural out here so there is typically great sky visibility at night. last night, may 31st, 2008, my dog was a little restless and barking in the back yard so, i got up to check on him. it was about 11:30 pm. it was a really clear and peaceful night so, i decided to pull up my lounge chair and star watch for a bit. no sooner had i sat down and leaned back when i spotted three white, star-like lights moving east to west across the sky in a fixed triangle formation. it was an uneven triangle with the two longer, equal sides leading. the lights were solid and did not blink or twinkle. they moved in a straight and unwavering path at a fixed speed comparable to the speed of typical air traffic. the altitude was at least 30,000 ft or more, maybe higher than most of the commercial planes that have a path in this area. distance-wise, this is all just a rough estimate but, to the eye, the lights appeared to be an inch or so from each other. i cannot say for certain if the lights were separate objects or corners of one singular craft as i couldn���t make out any other details.  also, i know it may have helped but, in the moment i didn���t notice if other stars behind it were being obscured or not when it passed. i watched this formation cross the sky for over a minute or so until it was finally out of sight. anyway, i really don���t think this was 3 satellites moving in unison. i don���t think this was 3 planes or military jets moving in unison as you can generally always see flashing lights & hear them. all was silent before, during and after this thing passed.\r\nwith all said, it was pretty amazing to see something like this even though it was a pretty tame sighting compared to many others with erratic behavior and whatnot.  if it were in fact one of the often reported ���black triangles��� then, this thing had to be huge based on the size it appeared to be at that distance. \r\nkeep your eyes on the skies people! oh, and pay close

the airport.  i know fighters have rotating or strobe-like single red lights on their belly  as well as make some noise no matter how high, but these small red lights did not flash or rotate.  but as it moved, i did notice one or two of the lights on the outer edges phase out and then come in again.  i could tell it was very high indeed.  i could easily view from edge to edge. it moved on up the coast until it disappeared.  feelings wise:  i didn't want to  remove my eyes from the sky, as i thought it was really rather odd, unusual and highly interesting to me - as it was for my boyfriend. i went to the supermarket on the way home, and after coming out, i searched the skies again, and i did see them travelling in the (exact) opposite direction from which they originally came.  slowly, and equidistant apart, very wide and also very silent. also with the trailing red light.  they too, disappeared over the hills of palos verdes on their way toward san diego (i suppose). after getting home, i did tune in 600 and 640 am hoping some others may have seen the same thing. nothing. i also searched the web that evening - still nothing.  the next day i thought about it, i'd told a couple of people, but shortly thereafter, i'd forgotten it.  they seemed like they might have been some kind of military surveyancy that covered the west coast on this night. however after doing some research on my own, the sighting seemed to match those of many others - but at different times and different places, and i just thought i'd throw in my twopence. i'd really like to know if there is just anybody out there who visualized the same thing at around the same time i did.

looking straight across the pond when something flashed real bright in the sky and caught my attention.After the flash i looked up and saw a bright blue light,like a circle of light.It was at a fairly low alttitude( i think )and it was moving very fast!From when i saw it to the far west up in the sky ,to when it was out of my sight heading straight east, it only took it about 3 seconds to fly across my whole field of vision! i mean this thing must have been doing like 10k mph! also it made no sound! thats the weird part. i figure at the low alt it was flying,and that speed, if it was a jet it would have broke the sound barrier and been very loud.Also im not sure if it was blinking and if was just going through the clouds(it was pretty cloudy that night),but it basicly lit up 3 times befor going out of my line of sight. i think maybe it just looked like it was blinking and it was going through some clouds.But i could see the super bright glow of this thing on the nearby clouds, anyway i dont think it was a plane/helicopter/or anything i could explain.Remeber very fast....No noise! it kinda freaked me out.I have been looking out back everyday to see if i can see it agin.If

the light, that is. it was as if the cover of a bank of fluorescent ceiling lights was shaped like a triangle. i said, \"the thing's getting bigger\", but one of the others said, \"hell no, it's getting closer. it's coming down!\" at this point, we all panicked and dove into the car and sped on down the road. looking behind us we could now see the light moving back eastward, not to the west as it had been and it was now to our left again as when i first observed it. it still appeared to move slowly by our perspective but it had to have been moving faster than us because although it was further away than before, now it caught up with and seemed to be cruising parallel to us. i understand that no road is perfectly straight and that's why a stationary object like the moon can appear to change positions, but 4 of us were watching this thing. it never got ahead of us and it never came towards us again. about 10 minutes after we had fled, the white light changed gradually to red in a few seconds, and then suddenly disappeared, not zipping away, but just vanished like when you turn out a light. how close was it when we were standing in the road? no idea. to demonstrate, i would hold my hands above my head, touch my thumbs together and my index fingers together to form a triangle and say that's how big it looked before i caved. this was not venus or the moon. i knew how to triangulate points in the sky, but by the time we first exited the car, there was no need to do that. this thing was moving. we never reported it. \r\n\r\nexactly 2 weeks later on the 21st, i seemed to be the only one interested in rehashing that night. it was just beginning to get dark. three of us were walking to the edge of the campus where our p.O. boxes and a dairy queen were located. bob had been one of the 5 in the car. he was with me and another guy and i was re-telling the tale to this third guy, using bob as a witness. actually by this time, the other 3 that had been in the car wanted me to just stfu about it but i couldn't let it go. we were standing at a traffic light across the street from a store on the opposite corner and i was right in the middle of talking about it. behind the store was a small stand of trees. directly across the crosswalk on that corner was a similar stand of trees. behind those, less than 50 feet away, was the large parking area that had the post office and dq. there was a sudden rush of wind. the noise of wind came from the left. we could clearly see a maybe 40 foot long \"craft\" of some kind whooshing by at what was maybe 40-50 miles per hour, above and behind the corner store and behind, but not higher than, the stand of trees. there was no engine sound, only the rush of wind, and what sounded like something metal flapping against something metal. there were sections of light on the side we could see that did not look like running lights, but gave the impression of a row of windows with the visible light coming from within. i ran across the street past the trees and into the open parking area and stood directly behind the path of this thing as it moved away. the parking area bordered a large field that had few trees and the thing was now moving over it. one of the other guys reached the parking area and was behind me. from this perspective, all we could see was a an object moving away from us in a straight line. just as quickly, this object appeared to suddenly move up 90 degrees for a second, then back down 90 degrees to the same path it had been on and continued to move straight away from us. it repeated this same maneuver twice more, until it was too far away to be visible. each of the 3 times it did that, bits of light that looked like flames shot out of it and sprinkled down on the downturn, but faded before they got to the ground. \r\n\r\nin the event of feb. 7, when i first saw it i was suspicious because it was the largest light in the sky but i tried to remain objective. when i realized it was blotting out \"surrounding\" stars, i knew this was a large moving object that was closer to the ground than conventional aircraft, which could only achieve that effect by flying at a very low and impossible altitude. though i did not know very much about large balloons or blimps at the time, i do know now that these would be equipped with some type of \"running lights\", not one single white light that shown downward, and they would not be out at night. also since there was absolutely no sound, no balloon can arbitrarily stop above a given spot, then change direction and speed up. we were all very frightened at the time until the object blinked out.\r\n\r\nthe event that happened exactly 2 weeks later - if i had not been discussing ufo's/uao's at the very moment of its appearance, i might have thought at first it was a low flying plane, although dangerously low, but there was no noise of a motor. after the action of the object, i was more than convinced this was no conventional aircraft. my feelings were of frustration because the guys i was with both times, one of whom was present at both events like me, didn't seem all that concerned with it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":10985,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.8040512,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05312008-0016","longitude":-81.9492812,"occurred":-91378800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-91378800000,"summary":"2 events in 2 weeks -

northbound\r\non us/95 when i reached my exit at ann rd. as i was waiting on the exit ramp i noticed a black military plane coming from nellis afb at\r\na very low altitude coming directly towards where i was. by the time it made it to the area above me i was making a left turn onto the first \r\nstreet which is tenaya. i thought it was a little strange that this military plane was flying so low in this particlar area and as slowly as it was.\r\nas i continued onto tenaya i kept my eyes on the plane and noticed it started to turn to the right as if it was heading towards the apartment complex\r\nwhere i was living at the time. as i drove around the curve before you get to the apartments i could still see the plane flying slowly as if it were looking for something.\t\r\nalso as i was going through the curve i also notice a black disc shaped object sitting completely still in the air over the apartment complex. i thought to myself nah that \r\ncant be what i think it is. so i sped up a little and turned in the driveway hoping to get a better look. when i made the turn i noticed a helicopter sitting to the\r\nleft of the driveway with to young looking military guys standing in the doorway of the chopper. they were standing there with their eyes glued on the object. \t\r\nfrom my position on the ground the buildings were blocking my view of the object so i drove up past the buildings on my left and there i got a very clear and close up\r\nunblocked view of the object. i sat there looking at the object trying to make sure i was seeing what i was seeing and it was indeed a spacecraft. i looked at the time on my dashborad\r\nand it was 6:27pm. i started to look for my cell phone to call my wife and tell her to come outside to see it but could not find my phone. about this time the plane and the\r\nhelicopter had gotten closer to the object. the plane began to circle in rather close to the object as if it were trying to provoke the object to leave. i was so excited as i was watching\r\ni wanted my wife to see so i sped off to go get her. as i was running upstairs i could still hear the helicopter but by the time i got her outside i could not hear the helicopter anymore.\r\nby the time we made it back to the area where i saw this event taking place everything was gone. i could understand the object being gone and completely out of site but the helicopter for sure should have been \r\nin site somewhere in the general area. but all three were gone without a trace. there was one guy who was outside putting something in his truck and he seemed not to pay any of this any attention. i saw him maybe twice\r\nsince the incident but i was too shy to go up and ask him if he saw it too because i know he should have. there was also two very young kids standing next to the building that the object was directly above. i couldnt see \r\ntheir faces because they had their backs to me facing the object. but the guy that was at his truck i saw his face clearly and we made eye contact. he did have a look on his face that seemed to be saying \"yeah right\" as though\r\nhe saw it but was not impressed. i wish i would have had enough courage to go up to him and ask him if he saw the same thing i saw. but reguardless i know that what i was looking at was as real as anything i have ever seen with\r\nmy two eyes. the drawing is the last scene i saw before i drove off. and the picture is of the exact location the object was. it was sitting over the building at the end of the street at about 75 to 100 ft with no lights or
