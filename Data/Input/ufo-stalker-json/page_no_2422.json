it seemed lower. within seconds it became very bright, not a sudden flash but a quick build. it continued to moving, dimmed, returned to original state and then faded off. at no time were trails, flashing, or blinking observed.\r\nour own reactions to it were surprise. given the myriad of possiblities, especially with night observations, it was, as we both agreed, something we'd not ever seen before. now, this is not quite true as i had observed exactly the same type of thing about a week prior from my home. \r\n\r\nalso, approx. a month before that i observed a very bright light descend straight down from its position in the sky. by that i mean it did not behave like an aircraft in normal flight. the sky to the back of my home is quite busy in terms of flight paths and i am very familiar with them and the behaviors of the aircraft so my initial reaction while watching it fall/descend was that a plane was in trouble. it came down straight as an arrow for several seconds until lower clouds suddenly obscured my view of it. night sky was relatively clear with some lower cloud cover. i have observed meteorites, space junk, over time shooting through the night sky and it did not have any of the many characteristics i have observed. the following day there were no reports of a plane going down.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":10938,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.6112018,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05272008-0008","longitude":-71.5745152,"occurred":1211698800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1211698800000,"summary":"Clear starry night, dimly illuminated object crossing sky suddenly became very bright forseveral seconds, dimmed down then disappeared away.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Groton, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:365575"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Tallahassee","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting at a small park on the edge of lake jackson, looking up at the blue sky and few clouds and noticing the floaters in my aging eyesight when i saw a star.  thought that was pretty neat as i don't often see stars until nearer to dusk.  i realized it was moving - almost imperceptively - but moving all the same.  i was intrigued and turned on my car to see the time.  7:26 pm.  i watched for another 20 minutes and watched this \"star\" move about 30 degrees to the north and east, almost straight above me.  called my husband who drove his car to my location.  he saw it, said cool, and started investigating the grounds.  he would check in with me every 5 minutes to see where it had moved.  intensity of the light never really changed and the movement was so slight that you wouldn't notice it moving unless you were keeping track of it.  when initially seen, i was looking ssw. over the 90 minutes it was visible, it moved over a portion of the sky that a place mat would cover if held at arms length.  during the sighting a few high flying jets went over.  i couldn't tell whether the light was at a higher or lower altitude than these jets but my feeling was it was in the upper atmosphere.  i called my sister and brother in law who live a few miles away and they both saw the 'star' from their location but were uninterested in it moving.  at about 8:50 pm it was located further west than when first seen and it just winked out - i believe due to the setting sun.  made me realize the 'star' was not giving off its own light, but was reflecting light.  during the show, i also called my nephew who works for jpl in pasadena, but couldn't reach him.  he called me later and said it could be a weather balloon, a spy plane, or some rocket that shoots straight up then unloads its cargo and comes right back down.  none of those sounded right to me, but who knows?  i didn't have a camera or binoculars and didn't think to ask my husband to bring them.  i tried taking cell phone pic but of course nothing showed up.  it was a great 24th anniversary present.  curious if anyone else saw this?

it approached the pool and flew directly overhead at a very slow rate of speed and so low the blue light reflecting from the bottom of the pool with the waters reflective ripples illuminating the craft only 30 feet above me.I was in awe and just stood erect with my mouth open unable speak or take my eyes off this beautiful craft.I soaked it all in it is burned in my memory.The craft slowly moved overhead as if it was letting me admire it,it resembled a hexagonal dumbell flat black in color the black area barely reflecting the water/light but the 2 ends of the craft the hexs were reflective gold and looked like material similar to what nasa uses on its satellites.No windows or lights,no sound,just the wind as it glided over as glider sounds,but this craft seemed totally the opposite of aerodynamic,and also seemed too small for human occupant/operator unless they were seated in the hexs on the ends.It then as it was around 40 yards past me it accelarated away in the same

was enlisted in the air force for 4 years.  i retire last year, after 19 years of civilian service.  i have worked on or have seen in flight, just about everything.  i worked in the software and electronic engineering field assisting engineers with design and testing.\r\n\r\nit was early afternoon and clear with no wind.  i was in the back yard and heard a very low frequency hum.  looking north, i saw a 4 foot high shiny metallic sphere that would pass directly overhead.  i thought that a weather balloon was about to crash in my back yard.  i moved 15 feet westward, while watching the very slow moving sphere.  i noticed no loss in altitude.  it would pass 5 feet over my home, but headed directly at the tv antenna mast.  i looked for anything flying in the sky.  i thought, ���there goes the antenna.���  observing from the front and side that it was a complete sphere, but i had no idea how it could fly.  it was moving so slow.  approaching the back part of the house, it stopped for a split second, but continued the very low frequency hum.  then, i saw the sphere move straight up, slowly.  i thought, ���this is a genuine unidentified flying object.���   my first thought, ���it is a omnidirection receiving probe.���  similar to an ocean probe observing sea life.  i was in awe of this engineering masterpiece.  i was scanning my memories to explain that straight up maneuver.  i had no answers.\r\n\r\nthe sphere moved straight up, until 5 feet above the antenna.  it stopped for a split second and moved south.  over the front yard, it stopped for a split second and moved straight down.  10 feet above the house it stopped for a split second, then continued south.  seeing this craft���s engineering drawings and manuals would be an overwhelming event.\r\n\r\ni ran to the front west side.  it came to the power lines and made the same 90 degree maneuvers.  up, over, down, about to tree level, continuing south.  it was flying an exact southern path.  i thought of driving to follow the sphere, but could not predict a west or east change in direction.  it was hard to follow as it disappeared into the trees.  i went back to the patio and sat down.  i had been a nature study for aliens somewhere in space.\r\n\r\na time warp opening and closing at 10 year intervals or alien research funds only available every 10 years.  i can hardly wait for

always go and look out a window. i went and looked out my side door when i saw what i thought was maybe an animal running across the street behing trees toward the left side of me. i live out in the country so there are always loose dogs and deer running around. i then turned my attention to the right side and there is a light pole across my driveway and power lines in a ditch beside the road. i saw this thing, its so hard to explain. at first i thought it was the web of a spider with light shining off of it. then it got bigger and closer. it was this little oval looking thing about the size of a dinner plate. i know it sounds crazy i questioned my sanity after i saw it, i still am. it was going up about as high as the light pole and power lines and back down to the ground across the street like it would touch the ground for a second then go back up. then it would zip to the right, then to the left, then back up and back down and so forth. it looked like it was going back and forth over the road. at times it would just hover there and not move at all then it would move quickly to the left or right. it made no sound at all. i kept coming up with logical explanations in my mind of what it could be, then it would move in a way that what i was thinking of couldnt. it was like it was reading my mind. it would never tilt in any direction, just move all around. i would have grabbed a camera but i was so terrified i didnt even think of a camera untill afterward. it had 3 points of light on the top of it, kind of like a twinkling star or when light hits metal and the light reflects off of it. it was like it knew i was there, and knew i was watching it. during the time i was watching it i would rub my eyes, wipe the window off, just to make sure i was really seeing this. i watched it for about 5 minutes just frozen in fear. finally i started yelling for my fiance to come look who was back in my daughters bedroom playing with our kids. it took him a minute to come and when he did i had him look out the window with me and it was gone. i stayed up untill 5am constantly looking out the window but it never came back. but when i would go back to look out the window i would feel lightheaded but i didnt at all when i was watching it. i am the biggest scardy cat of pretty much everything. i was very shooken up by this. i just wish i could come up with something to

about 1/2 mile to 1 mile away. it stopped and my mil and i looked at each other because we knew this was something strange because if it was an airplane it wouldn't just stop dead. i felt there was an intelligence to it. after sitting there for probably less than a minute, it took off at a north east angle in the sky at an incredible rate of speed, nothing like i had ever seen before. no aircraft or technology that i know about could maneuver like this. my mil and i again looked at each other and knew we had just seen a ufo. it almost felt as though it knew we were watching and then took off. i'm not sure if we were facing north,south, east or west though. \r\n\r\ni wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it for myself. i guess why i felt i knew this was a ufo was because of the rate of acceleration and maneuvering. i never really believed in ufo's before but i've noticed more reporting and discussion about it recently and decided to register my sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10912,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":24.7200224,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05252008-0009","longitude":-81.0887712,"occurred":425804400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":425804400000,"summary":"Bright

shapes forming different patterns. at times they stayed stationary and other times seemed to form patterns that became one. we noticed these objects because of the clarity of the evening and became fascinated over there patterns and movement.The experience was enthralling and went on for approx 2 hours.After watching with binoculars, all objects just disappeared. interesting, that i also observed three airforce jets, in the sky during this experience.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:01:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

were sleeping in the backseat, my wife was awake in the front seat. i had stopped just pass an overpass to relieve myself as there was hardly any traffic that early. it was a saturday morning. as i was standing behind the car, i noticed this very bright light in the sky. it was approximately as high as an airliner and did look like a star. however, i am very honest when i say this. as i stood there, this light flew down to about 50ft above me. it made no sound. i don't remember there being any kind of light on the ground from this. i don't know why, but i stood there looking at it. just as quickly as it flew down above me, it shot back up and out of sight. \r\n\r\ni got back into the car and left. that's what i don't understand about myself. i drove to cincinnati and never mentioned this to my wife until we stopped for gas. i explained to her what i saw. she didn't really believe me. i wasn't really that upset.\r\n\r\ni have never talked about it with anyone other than my wife. a year ago, i read someone had the same type of encounter. \r\n\r\ni can't say what it was. this is the only time i've ever seen a ufo.","distance":"21-100
