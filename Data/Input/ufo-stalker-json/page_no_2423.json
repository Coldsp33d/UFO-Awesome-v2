i got out of my car to see if that was actually what happened!I heard and saw nothing unusual. because of the brush,(scrub oak ) it was difficult to see down the drop, so i walked down the road away from my car. that is when it get's weird! off to my right i heard something upslope from me (meaning up the mountain above me in the brush) what comes to mind (obviously is a deer or squirrel or a bird, etc.). but then i noticed about four shapes moving in the brush , i thought hmm people hiking, maybe the people in the dissapearing truck? i then noticed i could not focus on them,when i looked straight at them i could see nothing! when i defocused my eyes and looked out of the corner of my eye i could see shapes,bi pedal, nothing more.Then i saw a flash, but it was strange just under,the visual spectrum, before,invisibility,but detectable. i then was scared this was not normal! i saw them working their way down the hill towards me ,as well as heard them working their way towards me so like any half sensible fool i decided to get the hell out of there!I beelined towards my car, at that point i heard a high pitched whine,and i started jogging! i made it to my car it started thank god and i took off! i had to drive up to a turn around point about 400 yards further up the road, or keep going up the mountain about a 1/4 of a mile before i could turn around again. i decided at that point i did not want to be alone anymore so i decided i would chance a dead run back the way i came! while driving (dangerously fast for the terrain) i looked in the rearview mirror and saw not truck lights but several lights well placed enough for me to know it was  not  a truck following me but an airborne craft of some kind! much bigger than a truck but smaller than say, a kenworth, it was somewhat round but misshapen i can see it in my mind but i did not focus on details as i was trying to get the hell away from it! it then dissappeared again! i reached the turnaround, and stopped,trying to decide what the hell i was going to do! being on that point in the mountain i could go up? or go down back to civilization and maybe some help? that clinched it! i decided to go back to where i came from! at that point the craft (yes i could see it clearly it was a craft, popped up from the drop off that many people have died on, at that point i was done with the whole situation and i punched it back down the mountain, lights following me the whole way just untill i reached the houses again. i don't know where it went nor do i care, i feel i am one lucky s.O.B.!

light just above the tree line.  it was just hovering.  after looking at it i was pretty frightened. i turned to look at my friend and he was already awake and i asked him if he was seeing what i was seeing.  he replied yes.  i took one last look, it was still hovering then we both got out of the tent and went into the camper as fast as we could.  we were both very scared.  my immediate thought was that it was definitely some kind of ufo.  after having many years of reflecting my friend and i still don't understand what we saw.  if i had been alone i would have just forget as some strange dream or something of my own imagination but my friend saw the same and can't explain it either.  i have no idea what it was that night and i can't come up with any explanation.  i want to be able to think that it was of this world but my mind has not been able to convince itself yet.","distance":"21-100

fired call.  the complainant advised there had been several shots coming from the creek behind the subdivision.   my zone partner and i responded and checked the location and found nothing out of the ordinary.  \r\n\r\nafter the checking the area my zone partner and i met at coletto baptist church which is located at the entrance of oak colony subdivision.  my zone partner and i talked while standing outside of our patrol cars.  just after sunset, while still at the same location, we noticed a bright sphere in the southern sky.  the night sky was clear so the sphere was easily observed.  the sphere appeared to be a single ball of light but did not appear to be emitting light.  the sphere was moving north and appeared to be following hwy 59 which runs north to south.  we watched as the sphere moved north and i commented that the sphere was very bright to be so high in the sky.  i believed the sphere was traveling at a high altitude because it appeared to be moving slowly.  \r\n\r\nas the sphere came closer to us we realized the sphere was traveling at a low altitude and at a low rate of speed.  my zone partner and i agreed that the sphere was approximately 2,000 feet above ground level.  my zone partner was the first to comment that the sphere was making no sound.  we both felt this was unusual because of its close proximity to the ground.  as the sphere crossed over where we were standing, i noticed there were no side marker (wing) lights or tail lights on the sphere.  it appeared there was no other type of structure around the sphere of light itself.  once again we felt it was strange that we did not hear any sound coming from the sphere.\r\n\r\nwe watched at the sphere continued to travel north.  from our point of view, when the sphere was in the area of loop 77 it appeared to zig-zag to the right and then back to the left.  the sphere did this at least twice.  we lost sight of the sphere when it neared the city of victoria.  in my estimate we tracked the sphere for approximately 5-7 minutes.  \r\n\r\nin my opinion, the sphere was no fixed wing or rotary aircraft that i have ever seen.  i feel that a normal fixed wing or rotary craft would have produced sound at the altitude it appeared to be flying.  also, there was no marking lights located in the proximity of the lighted sphere.  \r\n\r\nit should be noted that within two hours of observing the sphere, there were two power outages on opposite ends of the county of victoria.  i observed one of the power outages.  the outage i observed was strange in how it occurred.  i was driving on sigfried st. in the city of victoria.  there was a very bright flash in the sky directly behind my patrol car.  instantly after the flash, power was lost in a large area of the city and also in parts of the county of victoria.  there was not a sound of an explosion after the ���flash��� in the sky.  usually it is consistent to hear an explosion and a flash after an electrical transformer blows.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

sky. we were not under the influence of anything.\r\n i noticed what i thought was a satellite moving across the sky. if you have ever seen a satellite at night it glints with reflected sunlight and describes a precise orbital line across the sky. i was sure it was a man made orbital satellite.\r\n i pointed it out to my girlfriend and told her it was a satellite in orbit. as we were both looking at it, it suddenly darted off at about 3 acute angles and vanished. it initially appeared to be moving as a satellite would across the sky, to the northwest. it appeared to be that size, no brighter than the stars. then it darted off and made about three acute turns, at an unbelievable speed, and vanished out of sight. if this object was at orbital height, like a typical man made satellite, when it darted off, it must have been travelling at many thousands of miles an hour. this speed, as it appeared to us, defied the laws of physics.\r\n we were astonished, and couldn't explain this sighting

professional photographer from st. louis, missouri.  \r\n\r\nat the exact time of the sighting, i was sitting in the backyard of my cousin's home located off cortaro farms rd., nw of tucson off of highway 10 around 1 am.  during this time, my cousin's husband, a white-male in his mid-forties, was seated next to me as we conversed, relaxing, and gazing at the clear night sky.  as far as i am aware, we were the only people outside in the vicinity or for that matter aware of the craft that we observed for an hour. \r\n\r\nseated on the back patio, looking up and towards the distant nw sky, i noticed a small, spherical shaped object at about 45 degrees.  the object was completely stationary and didn't move as far as i could tell for the entire sighting.  \r\n\r\ni noticed it because i had been enjoying looking at the open, dark desert sky for a while that evening.  i was on vacation, i grew up in the mid-west and rarely leave the city anymore, taking the time to leisurely gaze at a night sky that is unavailable where i live.  i noticed the object because, after a while, i kept coming back to it over and over again while scanning the sky.\r\n\r\nthe object, from my vantage point and to the naked eye, was small and spherical-shaped.  it seemed like a very large, star in the night sky.  it's primary characteristic was that the distant object was emitting an intense, multicolored light.  the light, seemingly bursting out of the object, was consistent in it's multicolored strobe-like effect; it seemed that the orgin of the colored strobe was not a single lens, bulb, panel, or led, but many bulbs or lenses on the sphere pulsating different colors of light simultaneously like a transparent disco ball with an internal light source.  because of the intensity and brightness of the light, the craft may have been another shape besides spherical; with the properites of light and physics, the light i observed was eminating from obvioulsy a source and source of light in darkness descibes only the shape of the source, not the shape of the object that possesses the source.  there was no way to ultimately tell the shape but it seemed spherical.\r\n\r\nthe presence of the stationary object in the clear, arizona night sky started to really bother me.  this was way to big to be a star i thought.  way too bright and multi-colored to be a star.  it wasn't moving.  it could have been mistaken for a star at a passing glance, but after a short while looking around and comparing the object to other stars, planes, and helicopters in the night sky, it stood out more and more.  i grew up near a small airport and knew this wasn't air traffic simply because of the light coming from it and it's absolute stationary positioning.  this was something i had never seen or heard of in my life.\r\n\r\ni pointed out the object to my cousin's husband, a native arizonian and outdoorsman, and asked him if he could identify it.  he could not.\r\n\r\nwe intently stared at the light for twenty minutes.  we absolutely could not explain what we were witnessing or liken it to any object or experience that we have ever had.  our awareness of the light in the sky after about twenty minutes became extremely unsettling.  similtaneously our reaction to the presence of the object was that of intense curiosity and caution.   \r\n\r\nmy cousin's husband rose from his lawn chair next to me, walked into his house, turned out all of the interior and exterior lights of the home and property, and came back in a few minutes carrying a telescope and tripod. \r\n\r\nwe walked over to a nearby picnic table in the backyard and set up the telescope on top of it.  \r\n\r\ni manned the telescope first.  once i located the object in the telescope's viewfinder and focused the lens on the pulsating light, i clearly saw the object close-up.  \r\n\r\nthe object's purpose, positioned in the night sky, seemed more like that of an unmanned probe than a transport craft.  it just sat there in the sky bursting with different, small strobes of color.  there was no way to tell the ultimate size of the object because of it's distance.  the object had to be at least located 10 miles away from nw of our position. \r\n\r\nmy cousin's husband and i took turns viewing the object with the telescope for another 30 minutes.  we referred to it at the time of our extended sighting as a u.F.O..\r\n\r\nduring this time, i became quite alarmed from observing the object. \r\n\r\ni felt like the crushing weight of a newfound reality had been dropped on our mood and our psyches.  i felt like certainly what i was witnessing delivered unsolicited implications that would directly effect myself and the entire world in the near future.  fueled by adrenaline, an agonizing reappraisal of my awareness and existence in life raged in my mind.  during the event and reflecting back on it, i can only conclude my reaction was the process of an instinctive human survival technique that occurs when one is faced with situations that must be instantly digested and mentally processed.  \r\n\r\nthe object remained in the night sky.  dealing with his own inner turmoil, my cousin's husband went inside to bed, leaving me outside alone.  i stayed outside looking at the object for another 15 minutes.  i was a guest, it was getting late, i had to go to bed, the next day was an early one.  going inside to bed, leaving the u.F.O. in the sky behind me was really hard.  the next evening the object was not visible.  \r\n\r\n\r\nnote;\r\n\r\nthis experience has stayed with me.  too many questions unanswered.  what made me make this report now is that not only did i see recent footage of the exact same object a few months ago on the show ufo hunters on television captured in ohio near lake erie, but more importantly, last night my relative outside of tucson witnessed another sighting of the same, exact craft in the night sky but this time there were 5 of the spherical, pulsating multi-colored lights in a loose circular formation.  \r\n\r\n ","distance":"Over One

local cams for the out of control brush fire in santa cruz mountains today.  the resolution is very low on this web cam and i cant make certain what i am looking at.  it could be a . itpieace of cloud that just happened to be disc shape.\r\n\r\n\r\non a very clear day...No clouds in the sky a sudden brush fire grows out of control in santa cruz mountains, about 80 miles south of san francisco.  as reported, it started approximately at 5:15 am. in a matter of few hours it engulfed over 2000 acres of the mountain ridges. as an astro-photographer, i often check the weather around for possible observing night.  however, with just a couple days past the full moon phase, i was more carious about my friends living locally in santa cruz mountains this time.  so i monitored the news channels until afternoon when i left home.  later in the afternoon, i started checking local news and online webcams for actually seeing how far the fire had progressed.  in one of the captured frames of one particluar web cam i noticed an unusual looking object in the blue and coudless sky.  it was white as cloud would be so it could very well be just \"cloud\". however, being such a perfect disc shape looking, i thought to publicize it, just in case it wasn't some weird looking clouds. in case, others had seen simliar thing.  i saved the image from the online site and refreshed the frame.  it was not there anymore. unfortunately, i didn't refresh immediately to illuminate the cloud possiblities.  i was distracted before i noticed any thing on that frame and it wasn't until about half an hour later that i finally noticed and refreshed to get a new frame.  i guess, i would not think of it as a big deal, unless there are other similar local reports.\r\nthe resolution is very low so it is not very possible to magnify much to see any structures.  however, when magnefied, there is a carious shade on just one side (top-left half) which could also be the ccd artifactof the web cam.  but, i would expect to see it symetrycally on the opposite side if that was the case. so...It is open for further investigation and possible other sightings...Below is the link to the live cam site.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Heartmath.Com/view.Html\r\n\r\nnote: the first image with time/date stamp of 16:55 was noticed at about 17:30 (5:30pm). the second image was not the immediate image i saw after this one, but some time later.  however, the object was not there after about 30 minutes. i did not save that frame as i didn't think it mattered since it was so much time already passed.
