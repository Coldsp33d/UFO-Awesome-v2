the corner of my left eye i see a very bright light at about 70 deg. coming from behind some trees toward the southwest and heading northeast toward ft. wayne. there were alot of planes earlier that night and i thought that was just what that was. i viewed it as a plane coming straight on with bright forward running lights. as it got closer to my position i realized there were no flashing collision lights at all. it was moving very smooth, very constant in a straight line.\r\n   then when it was at 90 deg., directly over me, it was still a big bright light. i reasoned if it had been an airplane, those lights would have diminished but had not. the brightness was even maintained as it moved away from me heading northeast. i still waited to hear the sound of a jet engine but realized

of dixon road was a glowing light. it was around 9:30 p.M. i was the person on april 17, 2008 who saw the orange orbs over the mall, so i went in pursuit of this object.  i had my three grown-up kids with me, my cousin, a friend and my grandbaby. since the road is closed off at dixon there and i could not go straight, i turned right on us 26.  i took the first road headed south.  i traveled appoximately 6 miles all the while observing this shimmering light in the sky.  we reached 200 north, around 700 west, tipton county.  we watched this object looking south while we were on 200 north. we all got out and my son started video taping while i used my sony cybershot 15x zoom camera.  i had my sony on the \"sport option\" to catch pictures in action.  i took around 50 total pictures. i also had my 15 x 70 celestron skymaster binoculars with me.  the object was barely moving, just above treetop level. to our eyes it appeared like a bright ball of light.  through the binoculars it appeared like a multi-colored object and looked similar to the person's video on youtube of the denver, indiana ufo.  but it would change.  looking at it in person it usually just appeared to be a large bright orb, but sometimes like two orange orbs.  on my sony camera, the pictures turned out like nothing at all we were observing in person. it seemed to have several orbs or organized lights attached to an object, yet we could see no object.  a couple of the pictures that have several lights has a bright light that almost looks like fire and smoke surrounding it. the object seemed to be approximately a mile south hovering near the top of the trees clusters. it would move slowly from one end of the trees and then come back from the opposite direction and then repeat this over and over. at one point the object was headed west and descended slowly behind the trees.  you can see the light of it as it traveled behind the trees. i had to take my son back to his vehicle so he could leave to go back to ohio since he had to go to work the following morning. it is around 11p.M. we went back the way we came.  just as we turned east on us 26 facing dixon road and to the right of us (south) was this big, low flying object.  the kids yelled for me to stop the van.  i pulled over quickly and we all jumped out.  my daughters looked through the binoculars as my son video taped it.  we could see this object traveling low at treetop level coming from the south/southwesterly direction. it headed northeast.  it flew over us 26 and looked to be flying over the apartments there.  my one daughter who was observing it through the binoculars said it had a band of white lights on it and a few red ones on the rear of it as if they were attached to an object, though she could not see the actual structure of it.  she said it was not an airplane.  my other daughter said it looked like several lights contained inside this glowing sphere of lights.  to me it appeared like a big ball of light that didn't change it's brightness no matter what angle you looked at it. there was no sound involved.  it was very close and low and i would have thought we should have heard something.  it was very windy that night though. after taking my son back to his car, my older daughter and i went back to the same road where we first observed this orb. it was around 1 a.M.  i saw it again and taped it a few seconds when my daughter suggested trying to get closer to it or under it.  i don't know the exact roads we traveled but we seemed to be getting closer since the light appeared bigger. we traveled south and west and arrived to a town that had the name of \"watson\" in it. we might have been near goldsmith. i was going to get out and take pictures, which i regret that i didn't now. one of the back country roads had an arrow to the east away from the object and when i got up to a road to bring me back to the west toward it, it was flying northwest at a great speed. the bright orb was quickly turning into a small light in the sky.  i tried to follow toward it and periodically would stop and take pictures toward it.  i ended up in russiaville, indiana and realize i had lost it. it was now appoximately 3:30 a.M. i decided to give up the chase.  i do have video and pictures. i hope it will help to solve or disclose something about this phenomenon.

mothers house for what i remember to be a christmas dinner, i was with my mother as we drove through the dark highway going toward oxford. as we were riding i remember nagging my mother as most eight-year olds do, until we saw what appeared to be a reflection in the sky. the moon, placed at it's particular angle of night, happened to shimmer off what appeared to be a wide, triangular shape pointed by three stars. as i looked to my mother, who had been anxiously chewing a piece of gum in place of her cigarette, i noticed she was looking the same direction in the sky i was at the time. it was at that point, the reflection was clearly that of some sort of craft, which then disappeared in a single glance.\r\n  together, my mother and i stopped what we were doing. i asked, \"what was that mommy?\", and her reply was, \"i dunno son.\" i remember a slight fear, being replied by a boost of adrenaline as to the possibilities of what i saw that night.\r\n  to this day, i remember the craft i saw that night. what it was, i dunno. i was eight-years-old and i know kids have an imagination... but when such a thing causes my mother to stop chewing her gum to keep quiet during my child-hood rants, it was definatly something.\r\n my mother will no longer acknowledge what we did infact see that night... but i know, and i know she knows... if anyone else saw it, i'm not to say. but what happened that night did happen, and i promise you it was not of this world.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

ride on my bicycle as i usually did through the city looking for new places.  i would often do this sometimes with a friend.  this night i was alone and i had chosen the eastern section of the island.  i believe i started out going north and then east then south till i got to notre dame or sherbrooke street to head downtown before heading home.  when i was at approximately the imfamous 1976 olympic stadium i noticed some very bright lights in the west.  they were so bright that i thought that they were closer than where they actually were.  i thought it was some sort of festival or event going on so i rode towards them to observe and possibly participate.  however the light or lighted area seemed to come from the sky and station itself over a particular area that i could not find and i just kept riding towards what would be the center of it.  as i got closer it was clear that it was coming from downtown.  i found this very strange because with all the bright lights that are downtown this light was still brighter and extremely predominant.  finally i arrived on st jacques street and peel. that is approximately 8 miles from where i first noticed the light or lights.  it had seem to be directly over what was then called the \"chateau champlain\" hotel. i was puzzeled because there was no festival going on and the light seem to be coming from the sky. i drove around the area trying to find the source of light but it was in the sky and it stayed there even after i left.  at the time i was so perplexed because i had no answer to what i had witnessed in that last hour.  i remember riding away to go back home and kept looking back to take in what i had just witnessed.  all i remember thinking was \"what was making that light?\"  i knew downtown well as most of my rides would end up there.\r\n\r\nthat was my only encounter with an u.F.O.  i understand how it must be frustating to some people who have closer encounters and they are not believed. the experts can give me an

would go revisit the old countryside to see whats all been done to it and see what has changed if anything. so i went for a drive in my celica and as i started up state route 48, i decided to make a left turn onto butterworth road. as i crested the hillside my car started to lose power and i was thinking that this was great, im out here in the boonies and my car decides to act up. so after saying a few choice words i pulled my car over to see what was wrong with it. as i was pulling over my car completely lost all lights and died on me. i opened my car door and popped open my hood and i heard a commotion in the field behind me. i turned around and yelled to try and frighten off any stray dogs and as i yelled there was a little more russling in the corn field and then i felt a slight breeze which turned into a strong gust of wind. it felt like when you stand in front of a powerful fan but to a much more extreme. there was hardly any noise and all of a sudden a massive dull light appeared. it wasnt blinding, it was more like looking at a lampshade when the light was turned on. then to my amazement this (for lack of a better word) craft raised up out of the corn field and and the lights on the front of this thing reminded me of a football stadium light array but not as bright...Not even close. it hovered for a second or two then slowly passed almost over top of me where i got a good look at the undercarriage of this thing. for some strange reason i wasnt scared, it felt normal almost, like it belonged there. the bottom of this craft had these neon like tubes that glowed softly and started out as white as a sheet. then there was a small humming sound, very faint but detectable in the outdoors where it was as quiet as a church mouse. the tubes started to change colors softly from white to yellow to orange then red. this seemed like it took a few minutes for it to do as it just hovered there. i watched in amazement at this sight thinking this has got to be my imagination but the breeze was constant and the debris from the road was moving around in a swirling pattern it seemed. i could feel my clothes being moved about as the wind rushed from this thing. the humming stopped and then it started upward slowly at first then it shot off like a dart turning completely red in coloration. it stopped and started bouncing a bit...Then it shot due east and came to a complete stop. then it looked like something hit it as it dove straight down. it came to another halt. then it made these zig-zag motions and then came to almost where it was before when it first shot off. it hung there for a few moments then took off east again and made these series of loop-de-loops and then came to a final halt before it darted off in a blink of an eye and became no longer visible. \r\ni cannot tell you how bewildered i am of this. i am open to ideas but i am normally very skeptical when it comes to some things. this has put most of my skeptical ideals out the window. i cannot explain it, i carry a camcorder and a camera around with me now at all times just in case something like this happens again. i am still dumbfounded yet i feel a sense of awe and a serious sense of underachievement as mankind. i was never scared...More like shocked at what i was witnessing. it truely was a spectacular moment in my life and i dont care if people believe me or not...But someone needs to know.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Louvres","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

away.  as i watched it, it was kinda skimming the treetops at a moderate speed, when all of a sudden it just disappeared.  i don't think it sped up and away as much as it just dropped down below the trees.  there are several large forests of tall pines which could easily hide something of that size.  i watched it for perhaps 30 seconds before it disappeared.  i was close enough to not see any

circled around and came up in front of us, it suddenly stopped, hovered for about 15 seconds, then shot straight up and out of sight.  i turned around to question my dad and him and his friend were both wide eyed with mouths open.  then my dad said, that was no aircraft, and his friend agreed.  what did we see?  i don't know, but i know that no airplane, helicopter or weather ballon could do

window to the back field, when i noticed a hovering object about 5 inches across.  it was approzimately seventy five feet away and hovering about 4 feet off the ground, appeared like a spinning silver egg.  at first i didn't pay it to much attention thinking it was an eastern phoebe, a type of flycatcher that is common in the area.  the phoebe's are a joy to watch as they leave there perch on a limb and fly out a few feet and hover to catch insects on the wing. anyway, i soon noticed that the object was not a bird and i watched it spin like an egg, when it started to change shape and color.  slowly it changed from the spinning egg wobble to a disk of the same size and it appeared that it had dark markings or windows around it that created a grey band against the reflective silver, as it was spinning quite fast.  as i watched it for about 4 minutes it began to slowly rise above the 4 foot elevation, ever so slowly but with an acceleration so that as it moved incrementally higher it moved ever faster until it reached about 15 feet above the ground and it dissappeared.  my assumption is that it continued in the straight vertical direction of it's original trajectory and simply moved so fast as to disappear in the blink of an eye.  my first thought after it disappeared was that i should have waved hello.  i didn't tell anyone for a few months, because i have no proof and wondered what people would think of me.  the thing is: i know i saw it, i know it was real and not an apparition.  as i watched it, i  studied it for explanation against all my experience and it remained as it was; a hovering, spinning silver egg/disk about 5 inches across and 3 inches high, 4 feet above a mowed grass field, 15 feet in front of an evergreen cedar tree.  i had a peaceful feeling after it left, a feeling that i was lucky to see such an unusual thing, a thing that really exists, but of which i have no explanation of it's origin.  months later upon telling a close friend of the siting, he said he thought it was \"one of ours\" a \"military drone or probe\".  i don't think anyone can know what it was.\r\nit was unique.  it was real.  i saw it.","distance":"21-100

(there is a prohibition against having your family hear counseling sessions if you are a minister.  it is supposed to be private.)  \r\n\r\nbut i was already in the room and the military guy was saying: \"but i saw them, and the others with me saw them also!\" my father responded with: \"well you just couldn't have because those things don't exist. it's just impossible.\" \r\n\r\n\"no, it's not impossible because we all saw them and we talked about it afterwords. so how can i have faith in the bible when there is no mention of this in the bible? i mean how could god overlook something so important as space people?  this has wrecked my faith.  i really need to have an answer about it. \"  \r\n\r\nto which my father nervously replied again that \"well, i'm sure you thought you saw something, but you just couldn't have seen that\" by this time my father was flagging me out of the room, i was walking slowly to the kitchen and didn't realize what i was hearing, but i could see one thing.  my father was more visibly upset than i had ever seen him.  it was my father's face that caused me to remember the event all these years.  he had a look of shear panic and confusion and desperation, like i had never seen in the fourty years i knew him. \r\n\r\non the way out the door, there, while still on their sidewalk, i asked him what that was all about? and my father just made a sharp guesture with his hand to shut up.  so in the car on the way home i asked again what he had been talking about and he said \"oh nothing,  just some experiences from the airforce.  \r\n\r\nthe problem with this explanation is that it didn't account for the shaking in my father's voice and hands as he tried to drive.  looking back on this event with what we know today. it must have been one of the earlier accounts of not just a ufo, but probably the airforce's detention of actual aliens, as we suspect from roswell.  a ufo sighting alone could not have produced the emotion that i saw in these two men.  i never saw a conversation knock my father out of his orbit like that one did, either before or since that fateful night, and we never spoke of it again.  \r\n\r\ni have told friends and family about this through the years, but i have never gone public due to the lack of facts and names, but it feels good to tell somebody.  maybe it will collaborate something from the tacoma, wa. area someday, who knows. \r\n\r\nsincerely,  loren veltkamp","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10847,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.2545268,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05202008-0022","longitude":-122.4417306,"occurred":48409200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":48409200000,"summary":"I overheard military commander confess to my father, a minister.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Tacoma, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:366583"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"New Smyrna Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on the beach with my date.  it had been dark for half hour or so (after sundown).  we saw 3 or 4 military type helicopters about 1/4 mile off shore shining their lights in the water.  i figured it was a training exercise of some kind.  as we watched for a few minutes, i noticed a black shape that moved off-shore along the beach in front of us, no lights on the object but there was a strange effect with surrounding light.  it was considerably larger than the helicopters.  there was no sound i could detect, although you could hear the helicopters further in the distance.  hard to tell exactly what shape it was.\r\n\r\nwe both saw it and agreed it was strange with no lights or noise. seemed to travel faster than the helicopters, but may have been an illusion as it was closer.  it seemed like light may have passed through it, but can't be sure.  some type of distortion of light.  \r\n\r\nwe had a few beers at dinner, but we were not drunk or under influence of any other substance.\r\n\r\ni felt exhilaration, no fear.  it passed by quickly so there was no time to be afraid.\r\n\r\nno physical evidence.","distance":"501 Feet -

colored object's racing across the sky toward's the west, into a dark thunderhead cloud, just before we reached naple's, fl at approximately  3:00 p.M..  upon arrival in key west, where we were living at the time, we turned on the evening news out of miami, fl. we heard a report on the newscast of object's being detected on radar that came on screen over the naple's, fl area, streaked over toward's miami, fl, and down toward's key west, fl, before going off radar. no explaination was given to what these object's were on the newscast. that evening we went to the atlantic shore's motel that had an outside bar and dock that went out into the atlantic ocean. it was a very hot and humid night, and after purchasing our first drink, we walked out to the end of the dock because there was a breeze over the water. no light's were at the end of the dock, and no other light's were nearby, so it was dark looking out towards the atlantic ocean. suddenly a bright blue light/sphere appeared high in the sky and was not moving. i saw the object first and alerted my two friend's who began looking at the bright blue light/sphere with me. suddenly, the bright blue light/sphere seemed to fall straight down to what we thought would be the horizon and remained motionless for about 30 second's, and then the bright blue light/sphere quickly raced across the water and up into the night sky with incredible speed and out of our eye sight. the next day i told a co-worker i had seen something last night that she would not believe, and before i could tell her what i had seen with my friend's, she blurted out \"oh my god, did you see that blue light last night\"?  she had been sitting outside of her apartment, which was on the atlantic ocean, with her dog, and saw the exact bright blue light/sphere that myself and my 2 friend's saw, and at the exact same time. knowing that there is a large air force base in key west, we immediately dismissed this as any air force craft because it suddenly appeared from out of nowhere, remained motionless for approximately 30 second's, fell rapidly toward's the water and remained motionless for about 30-45 second's, then rapidly raced in a straight line across the water and up into the sky and out of our eye sight in a matter of 10 second's or less.\r\nsince myself and my two friend's had seen the three dark object's racing toward's the dark thunderhead over the everglade's that afternoon, and hearing the report on the miami newscast, and the bright blue light/sphere that evening, we all three thought we had again seen a single bright blue light/sphere that sped as quickly as the dark colored object's we had seen that very afternoon, just north of naples, fl. \r\nespecially the next day, when i went to tell my co-worker about the event that previous evening, and she blurting out what i had seen with my two friend's, was just comfirmation for all four of us, that it could not have been an aircraft because of the way it appeared suddenly, and the speed at which it moved, when it did move.\r\nmyself and my two friend's came to the conclusion that what we had seen just before we reaced naples, fl, heard on the evening newscast, and what we saw at atlantic shore's motel, were related somehow, and it was something that we had never seen before, or since, and we lived in key west for 5 year's.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10843,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":24.5613025,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05202008-0018","longitude":-81.7729014,"occurred":556258500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":556258500000,"summary":"Seen

if a star was moving from one side of the sky to another in different directions.  to this day can not explain what it was an i don't even bother looking into the sky for long periods of time because i know that there is something out there.\r\n\r\n1. i was in a park with a friend, looking up at the sky.\r\n2. i noticed the objects when they started to move back and forth as if the stars where toys and could be placed where ever they wanted to be place\r\n3. i thought i was looking at the stars then noticed that a couple of the bright objects were moving, they were not planes i saw those moving about, they were not even close to this planet they were far away.\r\n4.The objects moved from one place to another usually fast motion, it was not shooting stars, i kept my eye on them and they were moving back and forth.  i believe shooting stars just race across the whole sky these stayed in one area of the sky moving back and forth not dissappearing.  they didn't move every minute it moved with intelligence not as a machine.\r\n5.I was and still am shocked but not so surprised knowing that i can not prove it but knowing what i saw explains more than what ever sightings occured on earth and thought to be a hoax.  know one to my knowledge has traveled as far as these objects so they can not really explain it or give scientific explanation.  i believe that what we do know is that there are other planets, universes, etc. besides earth how could someone be so selfish to believe that we are the only living beings.  these objects were far and looked like stars in the sky when they were still.  they moved back and forth with intelligence.  i do not have any mental illnesses or believe in the tooth fairy.  i believe in reality and the reality is that there is a thing called space and there are other intelligent beings out there wheter it be ants or snails.\r\n6. i stoped watching the sky and the movements became less and less so i stoped.  i tell people i know about it besides there was about ten other people there who saw it. its just something that happened that your like wow, who could ever explain that. i know that whatever it was it was intelligent.  i wish someone had a video camera to catch it on tape.  finally i fell like this true unbelievable to some story in my life can be put to use, thanks.
