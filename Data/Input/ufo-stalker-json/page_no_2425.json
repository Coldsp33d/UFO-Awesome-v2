thinking i should probably set an appointment with my doctor to get a cat-scan. time was kind of disjointed, and i remember waking up in a lawn chair, freezing my tail off at about five in the morning.\r\ni have never told anybody about this until now. yet it remains the most puzzling and vivid event of my life. something happened to me recently that has brought all of this back to the forefront of my life, and so i have decided to \"put it out there\" so to speak. my recent event confirms for me, something huge is going on, or i really need to get that cat-scan.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":10839,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.6445638,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05202008-0014","longitude":-106.3648255,"occurred":897899100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":897899100000,"summary":"Very large star like object in sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Vail, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:367488"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Harrisburg","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The witness showed up at the pa mufon ufo public awareness day in harrisburg, pa on may 17, 2008 and gave this report.  a dark triangular craft was seen in december during the late 90's emitting a beam flying along the highway moving with the anonymous witness' car at the same relative speed.  the car was moving at the rate of 55 mph.  the craft was seen on the highway while the witness was going from halifax, pa to lykens, pa.  the triangular craft was dark with white lights across the back.  after about 1 minute of following the car, the craft turned on its lights on the underbelly (which appeared to be like search lights that beamed down to the ground) and flew away over the trees that lined the highway.

much before this.  we  saw a dark red elongated non aerodynamic shaped space or air craft appearing to be high in the sky.  it flew in an intelligent pattern series of straight lines before going into a straight path that appeared to take it out of the atmosphere by diming down the glow to black it faded from being very visible with the naked eye to disappearing. looked as if it were glowing this deep dark red to orange color very similar in hue to the video over the arizona desert or st. paul that mr. mufon has shown.  this was over palm desert. the local tv news was running a show about a ufo meeting in a nearby desert town and said someone caught something on video so we waited to see if it was what we saw and it was just a story of the ufo convention we called their news desk and they were not interested in our story also called the ufo people at this convention and they never returned our call.\r\n\r\nit was very very strange.  long rectangular with box shaped front section that hat long arms suddenly explode out from it which also had this same deep red hue.  very brightly glowing as we could see it very clearly though it appeared to be very high up in the sky.  we were not able to find and get the video cam set up before it faded to black.  it was quite outstanding and i thought i would contact you guys again because the hue was identical to the hue on your mufon 2007 video.  i felt it looked like it was way up in the cloudless desert sky and superheated from atmospheric friction and it was moving in a straight line thus cooling as it left the outter atmosphere.  but it may have not been nearly as high up in the sky as that and the fading to black may have been caused by something else.  but it did have gradations of this deep dark red to orange in such a way as to be plasma like fire if you will. as if the surface of the vehicle were plasma or super heated.  sorry for the incomplete description but that's about what i have to say. there did not appear to be any aspect of the vehicle that was not glowing this

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The following account is completely true and happened about 4 hours before i wrote this. it may be the most unbelievable thing i've  ever witnessed:\r\n\r\nme and 2 of my friends (we are all from st. paul) drove out to cottage grove to hang out with a few friends of ours. we were playing basketball in the  driveway of their house for about an hour, and people began to leave. we were about to go inside when i noticed an object moving through the sky. it looked like a large satellite, and it was moving at a constant speed. being a pretty big ufo enthusiast myself, i pointed it out and we all started watching it. it soon started to make wobbles and turns that no satellite or aircraft could have made (it was way too high up to be a plane). i was wondering if it was my eyes playing tricks on me when it completely stopped in the middle of the sky. it hovered in one spot for about 40 seconds, and in that time it grew extremely bright. at that point we all knew it was no satellite we were looking at.\r\n\r\nthe object started moving again and flew into the distance. there were 5 of us watching it by now, and we called another person who lived down the block to come outside and see what was going on. we soon saw another object in the sky, and very faint, smaller dots appeared around it. the dots shot off in different directions, some moving extremely fast and some slower. one big dot stayed stationary. as we watched these dots (especially the big one) they began to change colors and it almost looked like they would split into 2 dots and then reassemble. one of the people i was with saw a red object leave the biggest dot and shoot towards the ground. all of us saw very faint shooting star-like objects flying by the area of the biggest dot.  a huge orange object soon flew through a small area of the sky in a very shooting star-like motion, and we all saw it. at this point there were six of us and we decided to get in the car and drive about a half mile away to a place where there was less light and more open space to watch.\r\n\r\nwe relocated to a parking lot with a field next to it, and we watched the objects that were still in the air. we saw some movement but not as much as before. we noticed that in the far corners of the sky there were flashing dots. pretty much every direction you turned you were able to see something in the sky. then, the big one. my friend went around to the other side of the building we were parked by to pee. he saw something in the sky and called all of us over. it was an object hovering in the air with extremely unusual lights. this one was much, much closer than any of the other things we had seen, and was actually only about a hundred feet from the ground from what it looked like. we ran over and watched it as it started moving one way, completely changed directions, and then completely turned around again. it flashed extremely brightly at least 3 times and then began to display very different patterns of lights. it almost could have been mistaken for a plane's lights at one point, but the lights kept changing and the object was moving very strangely. it disappeared over the treeline.\r\n\r\nafter this object we saw 3-4 plane-like objects move overhead, about 5 minutes apart from each other. they all came from the same direction, all were silent, and all of them headed in the same direction towards the first object we saw. they had blinking white and red lights on them but the amount of lights and the speed they were traveling was unusual. me and a friend saw one final object, with blinking red and white lights, fly in the same direction. we thought it could be a plane but i watched it carefully just in case. when it passed where we were standing it began to move up and down as it was flying, making weird movements that planes do not make. overall the entire experience lasted about 2-2 1/2 hours. these were definite ufos, we all saw them. it was like absolutely nothing i have ever seen before, and the same goes for the 5 credible witnesses i was with. i'm sure other people saw these also, as some of these objects were not subtle at all. again, these objects moved in ways planes cannot, in erratic, jerky       movements. however, they were definitely under some kind of intelligent control, as some seemed to interact with each other. each of the 5 people i was with will tell the exact same story if asked, and we all saw what we saw. these were not known aircraft.\r\n\r\nthis was my first actual ufo sighting, however i caught what appears to be an unidentified object in the sky in a cell phone picture a few weeks ago, which i can send in when i get it onto the computer this week.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

baseball-sized orb of light passing through my closed window and entering my bedroom.  it moved slowly across the room toward me and stopped, or hovered, just over the bed.  it seemed to hover over me as if it were watching me.  i was able to see that it was a 3-dimensional orb, and it looked like a ball of glass that had swirling red and orange lights - like swirling, colored liquid, that was self-illuminated.  after about 20 seconds it shot off through the room and exited the opposite window.  i looked over at my sister and was surprised to see that she was also awake.  i said, \"did you see that???\" and she calmly responded, \"yes.\"  i said, \"what was it?\"  she said, \"it was an angel.\"  i didn't understand what she meant, because that did not seem to correspond with what i had just seen.  i said, \"how long have you been awake?\"  she replied, \"about 5 minutes.\" and i said, \"and you saw it the whole time you were awake?\" and she said, \"yes.\"  i didn't know what else to say, and we both went back to sleep.  i didn't think about it or speak about it to anyone else for over 30 years.  then in the last 6 months or so the events of that night have been coming back in my mind and bothering me.  i decided to ask my sister if she remembered that night.  she said she did, so i asked her again what she remembered about it.  she was reluctant to talk about it, and tried to explain it away as just a reflection in our window.  i know that i did not see a reflection of light in the window.  what i saw was 3-dimensional.  it entered our room.  it hovered over my bed, apparantly observing us, and then shot off.  i don't know if this is considered a ufo sighting - but i know i saw what i saw.  i know i was wide awake at the time, and i know my sister saw it too,

from a plane thousands of feet in the air, to see if it would glide to ground or drop like a brick to the ground. i remember the space shuttle because they tested it's flying capabilites in our small town called 'nasa bay' in texas; that year the space shuttle flew over our elementary school and the whole school was let out to watch it glide over.\r\n\r\nit was the summer of that year, elementary school was closed for summer vacation, when my sister and i had our ufo encounter. we were coming back from the grocery store on an old dirt road...A short cut to our apartments. my mother was driving the station wagon and my sister and i were in the back seat. our mother would not let my sister and i sit in the front seat, so we would often fight over who would get to sit with their arms over the front seat. that day it was high noon and the sun was very bright and hot! i managed to sit with my arms over the front seat. there was a really good song on the radio that i was really enjoying, however static made it hard to hear the song...That made me angry but i didn't think it was strange at the time. i remember my sister tugging on me, but i thought she was just trying to get my seat spot...She tugged at me about 3 times, when i finally turned my head and was about to grip her out...Tell her she could not have my spot...When to the left of the car was an object...As big as the car...Following us! following us very close! my sister asked me what the letters \"u.S.A\" spelled...I told her \"united states of america\". my sister knew her a b c's but not how to read. she said that is what was written on the ufo; she also said there were other letters on it she did not understand or reconize.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was lit up like a rainbow...Very bright! however, the sun was shinning in my mother's eyes as she drove home and that is why she did not see the ufo...Like the sun was in my eyes until i turned my head. we pleaded with our mother to turn her head but she said she did not want to have a wreck. the ufo had red, green, yellow, orange lights flashing around in a circle...Some of the lights did not move...It was lite up like a christmas tree! boggles the mind to think anybody could miss it because it was so bright, but that is what happened to my mother and almost happened to me too! it had three levels to it, with the bottom level the widest and the top level the smallest. it was silver and looked to be made of some kind of metal. there were what looked like landing legs tucked underneath, but could have been anything!\r\n\r\nthe ufo followed us all the way home...About a 20 minute drive. when we got out of the car the ufo hovered over our apartments...No sound...It was perfectly still. we tried again to get our mother to look up but she would not, all she could think about was taking the groceries in before the heat melted the ice cream! my mother yelled at my sister and i to take the groceries in, so we did. we got back in time to see the ufo speed away! in the blink of an eye! gone! when it left my sister and i went behind the apartment buildings to see if we could see it...But it was gone:( \r\n\r\nwhen this happened there was nobody to report our story to and my sister and i were very young and didn't think anyone would believe us...Especially since my sister saw the letters \"u.S.A.\" on the ufo. for the longest time i believed it was a government secret vehicle and thought the reason it followed us was because the government was using the ufo story as a cover-story for their secret vehicle and needed witnesses. before i saw the ufo i watched a series everyday on cable tv about ufo's. i figured the government had access to that information and knew my family would be ideal witnesses for their ufo cover-up story. however this past year i have been studying the facts and have found that people have been reporting ufo's for hundreds if not thousands of years...Long before man could fly! the pictures our ancestors drew hundred(s) of years ago look exactly like what my sister and i saw! when my sister and i saw the ufo people would no believe us...Just the mention of ufo's and people would laugh...Let alone you telling them you actually saw one. even though people are a lot more open today...Not everybody is! my sister still can't tell her husband in fear that he would think her crazy! i tried to bring it up once to my sister's husband and got strange looks, so i didn't say anything more about it...And that was just a few years ago!\r\n\r\ni believe that when man puts his mind to something he can do it! the 2 things that man wants to do is conquer space and time. but if man wants to go to the other stars in the heavens/universe he will have to conquer time first. is it possible that the ufo my sister and i saw was from the future? are our descendants from the distant future following us?\r\n\r\nin later years my sister had come to believe that the ufo had written on it \"u.F.O.\" instead of \"u.S.A.\" i believe the reason she believes this is because she saw the letter 'f' also and when you put them together it spells \"u.S.A.F\"...\"united states air force\" but if it was the us why would the air force use other letters that my sister didn't reconize? where they top secret symbols that only specially trained people would understand...Or were the letters or/and symbols some form of future language? in the bible, book of revelations, it says the chosen will speak a language that no one else will understand.\r\n\r\nmy sister agrees to the statement above, however she does not want her named used.\r\n\r\nthank you for interest:)","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

which we riding, in the sky just over an overpass, over the freeway.  it changed into a chevron shape and hovered over a storefront.  it firghtened us and we were confused at what we were seeing.  i

(this is a little more than hour from the time of this writing, so the memory is still fresh and vivid).\r\n\r\ni was on my bicycle riding east on the colonial parkway when i spotted an object over the james river, moving from east to west at a very slow speed. at first i thought it may have been a kite because it was a very windy day (the winds were gusting out of the sw at 20-30mph) and people do come out and fly their kites from the beaches when the winds are good. but when i came to an open spot in the road unobstructed by trees i stopped to get a better look and decided it was much too large to be a kite. it is a about a mile across the channel to the surry station and what i saw appeared to be just over the beach, but near the station���s twin domes.  using them as a reference point it must have been at least as large as they are, and perhaps larger. the object was moving very slowly against the wind, left to right from my vantage point, when its upper surface caught the sunlight it reflected like a sheet of aluminum foil. its underside was dark. i thought that it might be an advertising balloon or dirigible, but the shape did not seem right. this was definitely a flattened disk. and, because it was so windy it did not seem like a day to take a blimp up. (and, with security so high these days it does not seem logical that anyone would be permitted to fly that close to a nuclear power station. i have seen military helicopters on training missions over the river, but even they keep their distance from the power plant.)\r\n\r\ni have eliminated helicopters and small aircraft because, as i say, this object was hovering/drifting and appeared to be making a very leisurely circuit of the power plant. i walked down to water���s edge to see if i could get a better look, but without binoculars i couldn���t make out any other useful details. i watched it for a good 15-20 minutes. in that time it had moved around the station, going against the wind the whole time.\r\n\r\nunable to see anything ales, i decided to hurry home, grab my binoculars and camera to see if i might get a better look. it took me about ten minutes to get home and another fifteen to get back on the parkway by car. but, by the time i returned the object had gone. i drove a few miles down the parkway hoping that it might have drifted elsewhere, but the sky was empty except for a few clouds. now, i wish i had stayed until it left. it would have been interesting to see which way it went.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

6th street. i can't remember the room # but i laid down maybe 6 hours before this happened. i woke up somewhere around 7:30am i was laying on my back and the sun was bright to my eyes. i wanted to sit up on the bed first before opening my eyes. i could here the traffic outside. i tried to sit up but could only get about half way up. so i tried again to sit up and just couldn't get up. next i thought if i would move my legs over the side of the bed onto the floor i might be able to sit up that way. i couldn't move from that point. i knew i wasn't alone in the room, i felt i wasn't alone so i tried to open my eyes to make sure but i couldn't open my eyes. the middle of my eye lids i could move but the bottom part wouldn't budge. then i felt a hand on my right shoulder, then i started lifting up off of the bed.From a horizontal position to an upright position. i kept trying to open my eyes and i'm saying let me see, let me see...But i couldn't open my eyes. on the way upright i was kicking sideways and i knocked my coffee cup off the nite stand beside the bed and chipped the side of the nite stand. i heard the cup shatter when it hit the lenolium floor. i touched the back board of my bed with my feet. i wasn't getting anywhere trying to open my eyes. i decided to stop kicking and go inward and meditate on jesus to come to me and about 30 seconds later i'm horizontal again and my weight comes back to me as i'm back on the bed again. at that point i felt pretty good about that. i thought lets try this one again i tried to sit up this time and was able to sit up and i opened my eyes and there was no one in the room with me as i could see and the door was locked from the inside. \r\n   i don't remember feeling any pain while i was weightless, but when i checked the mirror i could see an indentation on my right temple area of my head. it looked like there was something under the skin, or they had taken something out of that area. the indentation in my right temple area was like a circle but it wasn't even. it was jagged. over the years it changed shape a little from being more round to oblong. now it's barely noticable. but it was quite noticable then and up till about 2001. then it was starting to fill back in. i can still see the area but now i have to pencil it in to see it good. on july 2nd 2001 i moved to indiana from los angeles i've been working at armour eckridge here in peru. while at work at finishning time i went out to start my car and go to turn in my paper work. across the street there is an open field and i saw a couple of lights to start with but then the light moved over so i watched it for a while. when the light got over so far it started to move upward and when it got so far up a bunch of lights lit up and i could see that it was metallic in nature and solid black. then the lights went out and i didn't see it any more. \r\n\r\npaul

lak���telep\").\r\n\r\ni was playing around on the ground with some stones, drawing something on the  sidewalk, when i heard a really loud, continous rumbling from the sky.\r\n\r\ni looked up but at first i couldn't see anything, just the multi-story buildings (with 10 floors). then a huge flying object appeared above and from behind the building which was in front of me. i think, the object was flying maybe 10-20 meters above the house (so about 30-50 meters above the ground... remember, i was very young, so i only knew, it almost touched the roof of the building) and it covered the sky almost completely. it flew very slow and it was very loud. everybody looked up and the street was like paralized. nobody moved, just looked at the flying object. i think it lasted about 10 minutes to disappear behind the other houses.\r\n\r\nas i said, i couldn't remember this until i grew up, but i can remember that i always dreamed about similar scenes since i was very young... almost every night for years. when i grew up, suddenly i remembered the whole event, except the shape and color of the object. when i told the whole story to a friend (who was my class mate since 2nd class), telling them that i remember this since a short time again, he replied: \"i can remember this. i was there. it was green and had a shape of a triangle.\"\r\n\r\nso if, somebody reads this and can
