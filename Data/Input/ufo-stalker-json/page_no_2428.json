free roam of yard for a break.  sky was overcast, ceiling was variable that evening.   noticed what i presumed to be landing lights on an incoming (to dfw) aircraft low on my horizon (top of fenceline) to the north-northeast travelling left to right in my field of view and a separate, unidentified group of lights at a higher inclination (around 40 degrees) off to the east-northeast.\r\n\r\nthis unusual second group of lights consisted of two equivalent sub-groups, one appearing \"ahead of\" (smaller and below) the other.  each subgroup consisted of five (or more) squarish emitters aligned horizontally (a width to height ratio around five) that would cyclically pulse in luminance scanning from left to right (approx. 2hz 50% duty cycle). at any one time the light emitted from any particular emitter appeared predominantly white, color would vary from pulse to pulse and was at times quite monochromatic.  approximately at the center of the horizontal bar described previously, was a slightly \"lower\" red/orange more point-like emitter, the pulses from which appeared unsyncronized with the horizontal pulse trains.\r\n\r\nno structure could be discerned, only these lights (assumed embedded in cloud cover), and the two subgroups remained in tight alignment as they moved right to left in my field of view in a northerly direction.  within a minute or two, the quite bright (when flashing) (relative to the ambient light reflected from the cloud ceiling) ensemble had diminished in scale and brightness and became visible only by moving my eyes about to catch a flash in my peripheral vision.\r\n\r\nunable to see any structure, i presumed i was looking at two objects flying in exacting formation away from my position on a constant northerly heading at a constant altitude just west of dfw airport.  individually or together, the lighting schemes made no sense in that they did not conform to faa guidelines for navigation lights or emergency beacons.  the rigid alignment between the two subgroups gave me the eerie impression that these strips of lights were at opposing ends and perhaps on the underside of a rather large rectilinear object (longer than wide in the direction of travel).  rather large would be an understatement if the metar reported cloud ceiling (4600' - 5000') for that evening is

south to east to north to enter my apartment building. however, a bright light in the eastern sky caught my attention. at first, i suspected it to be an airplane that was approaching the purdue airport, traveling from east to west. the light was amber or light orange. it was bright enough that i thought this \"airplane\" was close enough and traveling at such a speed, that it would fly over me in under a minute's time. i judged the distance to be about 15 city blocks out. i waited for the \"airplane\" to fly over me but the light remained still and fixed in the same position of the sky.\r\n\r\nthen, the light disappeared for a fraction of a second. a fraction of a second later, 5-7 similar lights formed a circle in the same position of the sky as the first light. i wondered if it could be a flare or a firework but the circle of lights was stationary and did not move. it twinkled a small amount. then, the circle of lights either disappeared again for a fraction of a second or they repositioned themselves very quickly into a straight line horizontally.\r\n\r\nthis horizontal array of lights then appeared to move very slowly toward the north from my point of view. at this point, about 5 seconds has passed. then, from this horizontal line of 5-7 amber colored lights, another separate array of lights, also in a line, about 5-7 in number, projected from the horizontal line, upward toward a vertical position. the way this second line projected itself was similar to the way a \"movie click board\" opens up. the angle the lines formed was open to the north. \r\n\r\nat this point, about 10-12 seconds has passed. there are two \"lines\" of amber lights forming an angle opening to the north, with each line consisting of 5-7 lights. this entire formation of lights then seemed to disassemble. the lines seemed to detach and then each light seemed to move independently. the way the lights then moved was such that they revolved around each other in various paths. subjectively, it appeared that these lights were putting on a \"display\" or a \"light show\".\r\n\r\nfinally, at about 15-20 seconds from initially spotting the first light to this moment, i ran inside of my apartment to get my roommate to witness this event. however, when we returned, the lights were gone.\r\n\r\ni now believe the distance of the lights i witnessed to be much farther than 15 city blocks. the reason i believe this is because many witnesses from kokomo, indiana witnessed the same thing, but closer and to the west from their pov. kokomo is approximately due east of lafayette, so i deduce that this event took place somewhere in between lafayette and kokomo.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

indeed it was odd, it was in the distance moving back and forth slowly but the way it would sorta stop and turn back was just... odd, weird. there was a couple trees there across the street and it moved behind them from right to left.  i told him to take a picture and asked what time it was, about 12 46 or so we remarked about  it for a little bit and i said \"seriously what is that\" and todd said \" well we're going to find out cause its coming towards us\" and it did, it just looked like a white light with rainbow pattern light refraction? like starburst light coming out all around it? anyway when it got closer i could see some sort of shape within the light like it was a primitive cloaking device or something it looked like the circular part of this pic that i will include in this report.  it had what looked at first to me to be flashing red and blue lights but when i looked closer the lights moved from the rear to the front in sequence and it was more colors than just red and blue like green yellow and so on. the object was more north than west of us and moved over the neighbors houses maybe 100yds away in a south direction it was close maybe the size of a psp umd or so or

intuitively, i knew it was like nothing i'd ever witnessed.  \r\n\r\nit appeared above the treeline approximately 50 miles away from my position at eleven o'clock and stayed moving slowly, almost gliding towards a ten o'clock position. as i continued to drive, my passenger also saw the same object and as we watched it linger it seemed to turn away from us, towards the darker cloud and took on a disc like shape at that moment. it then tucked into the cloud and for approximately a minute or so we continued to watch expecting it to resurface, but it never came from outside the cloud.

corner of my eye and made me look up. i saw four very bright, large, round, white strobe lights blinking very rapidly forward. then they would reverse and go backward. the strobe effect was very rapid.  to my amazement, a huge black ���triangle��� floated just over the tops of my trees. then it stopped and began to hover near me and above me at about my 10:00 position. i estimate it���s altitude to be very low, between 100 and 200 ft. \r\n\r\nto me it seemed like once it had my attention that it turned off the strobe lights and hovered there. \r\n \r\ni suddenly realized that the object was not making any sound, not a peep. aircraft fly over all the time, i can always hear the engine clearly, the private planes above the clouds let alone the jets. and this was absolutely silent.  \r\n\r\nthen smaller white lights on the top, bottom, front, back and sides started to do a little \"dance.\" all of the smaller lights began to play a pattern. first the two top lights would blink twice, and then the two lights at the front of the craft would blink twice,  then the two top ones again, and then the two back ones, etc.  it went through the pattern until it had blinked every sequence it could with the number of lights that i could see. \r\n \r\nthe object appeared to be very dark except the lights, black in color.  it was darker black than the night sky.  the object was very large and solid, i couldn���t see stars through the object. i estimate the length to be between 60ft to 100ft long judging by the trees and houses and other landmarks in the area.  i couldn���t tell how wide the object was because i was looking at it from the side and slightly below. it was close enough that i could almost hit it with a baseball, had i been dumb enough to do anything to antagonize this vessel. \r\n \r\nsuddenly, four much larger diamond shaped red lights appeared at the rear of the object, themselves arranged in a diamond pattern. i could see them because the object slowly started to pivot towards me.\r\n \r\nthe diamonds had a ���grid��� inside them that reminded me of a honeycomb. i suddenly knew i was seeing something totally unknown. they just stayed on for a moment, and then went out. they were so bright that you could see that the object had a kind of triangular or diamond shaped tail end. or maybe like two inverted pyramids with a notch on the top and the bottom. and this ���tail section��� was large enough to house these large red lights.\r\n\r\nthen the red lights would come back on, do a little pattern, the top and bottom one in the diamond would blink then the two sides..And then the red ones would go out again and the white ones would play another little pattern. finally the object flashed the lights in a kind of ���grand finale��� with the small white and big red diamond lights flashing a pattern together using all the lights.  i just stared motionless, even my dogs were standing perfectly still in the snow. \r\n \r\nthen the object started to move away, flying very slowly. just gliding along, in no hurry at all.  it didn���t look like it was worried about radar, fighter interceptors or anything else. although it was probably flying too low to register on radar.  it started to turn in a slow bank at about 45 degrees towards a nearby cellular phone tower. \r\n\r\nright then as it flew near the neighbor���s house across the street, his truck alarm went off. it continued to honk until he finally had to come outside to stop it.   i wanted to shout to him to come look at this thing, but it was already getting further away.  my neighbors don���t live close by and he couldn���t see it from his point of view.  \r\n\r\ni also thought about running inside and trying to get my camera, but i just couldn't take my eyes off of it.  as it moved further from me, the patterns got simpler and the red diamond lights came on less often.   i was very relieved that it was moving off, away from where i was standing. while it was right above me the lights were flashing nonstop.  \r\n \r\nit moved close to the cellular tower which also has lights on it, to let aircraft know it is there. but it only has two beacons, slowly blinking white lights like you see on any tower.  the object blinked its white lights at the tower and the lights on the tower began to blink rapidly as well.  it seemed to linger in the area of the tower for a short time and then starting moving steadily away.\r\n\r\ni stared at it as it moved slowly further away. finally, after about 5-10 minutes and it getting cold i wanted to go inside. when i turned my back around again the object was gone. i thought that was strange too, because i thought i should have been able to at least see a little dot but nothing.  \r\n \r\ni have no idea what it was. but i do know that i know a lot about airplanes and have seen them fly over at night many times.   their collision beacons blink very slowly and they have a small red light on the tail that stays on at night. this was *nothing* like that. it was as if these lights had a program written, to get them to create a little light show. i don't know why any aircraft would have something like that.  \r\n \r\ni wouldn't have believed if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  it sure was unusual; i've never seen anything like it in my life. i'm not too sure if i want to again either.  later that evening, i got very frightened about what i had seen, and my eyes burned for about 24 hours, then they were fine. reported originally to peter davenport���s nuforc. \r\n

left-most lane with no obstructions in my view of this object. i had no abnormal feelings or emotions about this. i do not wear glasses or contacts. i have 20-20, 20-15 vision.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I saw this disc and felt the object had living beings flying it as it slowly swept low hovering sort of slow moving zigzag like but not airplane like movements. i said as i looked upward not far from my house as i looked out my window-\"i see you and i know you are there looking at the earth near me\". i felt their pressence and i said something like this \"it's too bad you don't know us i think you would like our people-we have a lot of nice people hereon my planet-i think you would like us\". the next thing i know is i woke softly not suddenly and found two beings by my bed they were brown smallish about 3 or 4 feet tall. i was being escourted by my arms out of my home and as we got to the back steps out of my house i said :oh-be carefull you might fall here and get hurt\" and as i looked down i saw we were all floating above the ground and out the door and they looked shocked that i was that awake (that was the feeling i got ) suddenly they did something and i heard this hum and it felt like electricity went through my spine from the top of my neck down my back and i went drowsy weakish but not kocked out just numbish. i was led up this plank that came from within the disk and it fogged a bit and i went inside and i was taken to a grate and they lifted off my gown and i was put into a large white gown--i asked why am i standing on this grate and what is the purplish light and i saw a man across the room who looked like us only larger and he answered the grate is to catch germs and the purple light is to sterilize me. i was alarmed and said but i want to have children someday and the white male said you will this only kills germs. i had heard they sterilized young retarded girls in institutions and the word sterilize frightened me.I had looked around and seeing the man i asked him \"do you look like them and are you making me think you look like us or do you really look like us?\" he seemed very pleased that i had had that thought. he said \"i really look like you\". i looked at the creatures and said sort of alarmed \"they don't have a mouth how do they talk?\" he said \"you and i are talking yet we are not moving our mouths.\" i said \"how do they eat?\" he said \"differently from us -don't worry about it\" i stoped thinking about it and stoped questionling but i noticed no mouth and tiny bump for nose no ears and huge eyes.I had noticed the many computer screnes above the panel of lights which they had turned to to start the ship up to take off after they had changed my gown and it took about 5 to 6 creatures to concentrate on the screnes as the waves met up with each other so it could go--then i heard him say would you like to lay down i said no sort of alarned because my mother had just had a talk with me about 2 days before about never lying on a bed in a room with a man and the man asked me \"why not?\" i said \"my mother said never-ever lay on a bed in a room with a man i did not know\" the thought i could have a child ran through my mind but he said okay i said \"where are you from\" he was looking out at the stars through a small window and he turned and asked \"do you know where you are?\" we were looking out the window and i said \"no but i still want you to show me where you are from\" --thinking i might be able to remember if someone asked me. i then asked where are we going? he said \"we are going to oriana\" i said is that where you are from he said something like close enough so i asumed it was a place but it was a woman he had wanted me to meet. i was standing there by him and i heard something and looked over at what looked like tiny little baby layete things on rollers about 5 of them. i asked \"what are the babies doing here and he said don't worry about that\" the same as before it went through my mind not to think about them but i was concerned about them a little bit as i did not understand just as i did not understand the no mouth thing on the brown little creatures. i looked down and i said what are they doing one brown had my arm and was about to inject something above my left wrist and i was about to be afraid and he said do you mind ? i siad why are you doing this and he said so you won't make them(the browns)sick--you could make them sick if you don't take this injection i said will it hurt me? he said no---i said okay but they were working fast and it was quickly over and he said won't you sit down i said okay----i sat down and did not notice at first that the chair started to lean backward---i noticed the  thing going over my head (like head gear of somesort) i asked what is that? he said they just want to look at your brain waves it does not hurt so i said okay---i went to sleep and then i woke up standing beside him getting ready to go out the other door---i had seen l. my next door \r\nneighbor (oh before i forget it my neighbors father was the only one who believed me about what had happened that night and he saw places in his yard and he believed me as well as grass never grew in thier yard ever again even untill this day in 2008.) \r\nthis next part is hard even for me to believe but it happened--any way i saw a whole lot of creatures in a sort of outdoor open auditorium with a walk way upon which this gorgeous dark skinned woman walked and carried a basket of fruits i recognized grapes but not all the fruits and she went behined some sheer curtain like things and she began to i think eat the fruits and as i looked out i saw all these brown little creatures looking at her and it dawned on me that they thought she was god! i was so stunned i headed to the ship thingy and i looked up at thebig man and i said sort of surprised they think she is god! i blurted out we think god is a man! he said yes-we know that. not judgemental or scolding but non emotionally he said it--almost however like we have it wrong so to speak yet not quite it was alarming to me as a young girl--i think i had seen too much---i had a strange event after that or before that and it is scrambled just a bit as to the timeing on this but after i was out of the ship there was a table of many longer tables outside as if a type of gathering was taking place and they had big men like mine on my ship and they were behined the tables and i was one of a few other normal height people and we walked in front of the tables and the man behined the table said tell me what you know about these quetions (it was a math like algebra 3 and i had not had algebra 3 yet-i never caught on that well after i had it later in life either) but i said well,i am sorry but i really do not know this but we have people ion our planet who do know these kinds of things and they are very smart! he grumbled a bit in demeanor and said \"thats what they all say!\" i was shocked because up untill now i thought everyone had been real nice but i could tell i had come across some beings who were not as kindly mild mannered as the fellow on the ship which brought me here.One of the things i noticed first off the ship was and i was barefooted that the ground i was walking upon felt like phillough dough like puff pastry--like a form of ashes for better explaination. there was a man behined me at the tables and when i saw a bible i said i know about that book and the same \"ogar\" said \"yeah-they all do\" i felt uncomfortable once again and the next thing i remembered was waking up in my bed with a man with a stern face saying don't tell anyone about what happened to you --no one will believe you\" his face was above my bed on the wall the size of a large t.V. screen now-a-days yet see through and poof he was gone. that is all i remember basically about things that happened to me at the age of 15 in ---i thought it was june but it was right before school was out as i remembered telling l. in gym class i think the next day---it was too good to keep but my mother got mad and said i had a dream and i was crazy if i thought anyone would believe it---i was young and i just knew my mother or daddy would believe me and it was the shocker of my life to realize they did not believe me.Many years later my mother and daddy said they believed me -now-as i turned out to be the \"sort of person\" to believe about things but that hurt me so much not to be believed in the era it happened in. i have friends who believe me now but i have been very careful not to tell things to folks throughout these years--the only thing is this---i am worried about this earth my grandkids and the next generations to come -as we know so little in this day and age about these people and these creatures and the creatures are fightening because they don't seem to have any warmth vibes as do people--it is hard to explain but --they are not human and they are very very smart---but seemingly unfeeling.I think that could be a dangerous mix. i have requested that this be kept secret and not use my name--if it is not kept secret i guess i will just have to say i made this whole entire thing up. it will be judged true or false by those who read it anyway. i hope someone who can use this information will read it and perhaps they will gain from it. i have learned this-i will not openly go up to a space ship and i will ask god to protect me from abductions.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"09:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10767,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.434715,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05162008-0002","longitude":-94.0444782,"occurred":-239389200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-239389200000,"summary":"Shiny

i neared the bridge over the white bear lake exit i saw what at first was a bright light off in the distance. my first impression was that it was a star, but as i neared i was aware that the object was below the upper atmosphere. my next impression was that it must be a plane, but i did not see any blinking lights. the object remained stationary so i then assumed it must be a helicopter (again with no blinking lights, however), as soon as i thought this, as if on cue, the craft glided across the sky in a manner unlike any terrestrial craft.\r\n\r\nthe craft first appeared over the 3m build (approx.) and now it was hovering just over the freeway. as i neared (there was no fear what-so-ever) i noticed that it was certainly a boomerang shaped craft with the light stemming from the rear apex of the v shape. i could see the craft below, and part of it above the light, so the light was certainly coming from the rear of the craft. being an artist, i had to admit that the design was incredibly seamless, as though it was one large solid object. the design was simple yet elegant, smooth -- something michelangelo or davinci would have found awe inspiring (as well as the former head of lockheed martin).\r\n\r\ni ran home to tell my mother. she was excited, because as i already was aware, she had seen an ufo in the exact same area over the freeway many years ago when i was just a child. she had to get cigarettes, so we hopped in her car, hoping to see the craft again. as we drove back over the freeway i was surprised to see that the craft was still there, only now it had moved south and was hovering over a local park where i go jogging every day.\r\n\r\nmy mom, acting unusually calm, stopped to get cigarettes and gas. i wanted to hurry over to the park, but she reassured me that she knew they would still be there. about 10-15mins later we pulled into the parking lot adjacent to the park where i last saw the craft.\r\n\r\nat this point we saw nothing. just as we were about to give up and just go home, my mother noticed a light in the upper atmosphere brighter than the other stars. as soon as i saw it too it started moving. my first impression was that it was a satellite, but it began to move back and forth making patterns in the sky, then it started traveling in a circle, making it wider with each pass. then it traveled downwards, only slightly, then went back up into the atmosphere. a large flash came from the ground, like a camera flash but was more a pillar of light -- this, i understood, was why the craft had to leave and remain in the upper atmosphere (you may come to your own conclusions as to what this means).\r\n\r\nthe craft continued to make patterns for several minutes, all the time sending an incredible feeling through my body (like a warm/cool breeze flowing through my solar plexus; odd that it is warm and cool at the same time, yet it is pure joy). we watched them for several minutes. at one point -- just to test our communication -- i pointed up at the craft and asked if it could move to the point in the sky as i move my finger a few inches over, and incredibly it did! my mother and i were very excited after this because this was now a greeting, not just a sighting. the light continued to make patterns and dance until our necks were just too sore to look up anymore.\r\n\r\nreturning home (less than a mile away), i had to wake up my wife to tell her. incredibly enough, the light was still there. i had my wife come out and the craft moved around a bit for her so that she could witness the event as well. this was directly over my house! next thing we did was to call my brother.\r\n\r\nmy brother drove over to take my mother and i out for a late dinner (we are all night-owls). as we left the house (as my brother's car pulled up) the light was no longer in that area of the sky, confirming that it most certainly was not a star. at the nearby denny's i told my brother what we experienced, quietly of course. admittedly, both my mother and i were in a state of bliss, almost drunk with joy, if you will. after about an hour long meal, i figured \"what the heck\" lets go back to the park and see if they will say hello for my brother.\r\n\r\nwe returned to the parking lot. at first we saw nothing, but sure enough, after a few minutes we saw a bright light. it moved around. i pointed my finger again to show my brother and it did move again to the spot i pointed to! then we saw a second light, and then a third. each one of them moved around for a bit until we confirmed the sighting, then the 3 craft stopped in position, making a large triangle shape in the sky.\r\n\r\nstrangely enough, we saw the craft shoot a beam of light (a small straight line of light) back and forth between the craft, the best way to describe it was like the two craft were playing catch with each other. the feeling i got from these beings is that they are extremely enlightened, benign beings, very playful...Almost like children with an adult-like sense of responsibility. we also saw the emp flashes coming from the ground up, like lightning only it was a pillar of light flashing upwards.\r\n\r\nwe all know that there will be major changes across the globe due to global warming, this is no secret. the impression i get from this contact is that they want to help us, but we must reject war first! we must, these technologies are too incredible to be put in the wrong hands! we don't have much time, we cannot afford to go into the next century and still maintain a paradigm of war, which amounts to mass murder and even annihilation. we have an incredible future ahead, we as a society must be willing to embrace it. this message is more important that the sighting, for it is the reason behind the contact.\r\n\r\nthis was a contact witnessed by myself and 3 other witnesses throughout the night.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

was in the living room working on a crossword puzzle.   i have a sliding glass door which leads to a deck off of the kitchen, \"eve\" and i just got home so the curtain was not drawn yet.  out of the corner of my right eye i saw a huge ball of brilliant white light coming towards the house from the west, it was above treetop level but not by much.  in my mind i compared the size to be like looking at a full moon on a clear night maybe bigger and as it neared it got bigger and bigger.  i called to \"eve\" to take a look, she was as surprised as i was.  we went out onto the deck to get a better look because of the glare from internal lights on the glass door.  it stopped above the house and was absolutely huge, 2 maybe 3 football fields.  the white light engulfed everything.  one thing i noticed was that the light did not hurt our eyes.  it hovered a few minutes with absolutely no noise, then all of a sudden a pale light came out of the bottom of this thing.\r\n\r\n\tthe size was big enough to fully engulf \"eve\".  all of a sudden \"eve\" started to lift up off the deck, i immediately opened the sliding door with my left hand, jumped up and wrapped my right around eve���s waist, with a hooking motion i threw \"eve\" into the kitchen then ran in and shut the door, when i looked back the light was gone.  \"eve\" was out cold for about a minute, when she came too she said all she remembered was seeing the light, that���s when she must of blacked out.  shortly after \"eve\" awoke the phone rang, i was so shook up i couldn���t answer it so \"eve\" did.  the call was from my sister she was in her car with her husband about 4 to 5 miles south east of us.  she told \"eve\" she saw a ball of white light with a trailing tail.  at first she thought it was a meteorite but ruled that out because it was so low and moving parallel with the ground.  soon after the call (which by the way according to my caller id the time was 7:21) i noticed my right hand was burning and there were a couple of blisters below my middle finger (pictures attached). for some reason that i can't explain i knew the blisters would be gone in the morning, which thay were, so i had \"eve\" take a picture of my hand with my digital camera.  i wish i had the camera with me on the deck but everything happened too fast.  \"eve\" and i are still shook up about all this but are willing to meet and answer any questions you may have.

my fathers parents 50th wedding anniversary,they lived 1/4 mile east of our home.It was 9 p.M.On a cold starry night we lived down a road off of route 44 in east canaan ct.As we were coming to the top of the driveway onto route 44 we all noticed directly in front of us about 1/4 mile away hovering about 500 feet from the ground a big at least 60'wide x 20 ' tall saucer shaped object with revolving circular lights situated around the outside circular perimeter of the craft red, white, and green,they were i think revolving in a clockwise motion and blinking very fast.Across from our driveway and route 44 is a cemetary and behind that is a working gravel bed.This object was hovering over the gravel bed.In distance it was about 1/4 mile away or less.All of us in the car were looking at each other not saying a word.It was a moonlit night and you could see the shape of the object.You could even see that it had a dome shaped top.The whole time this event took place not one car went by.It was very eerie watching this thing because we clearly knew it was not something human.You could just feel it.We were all raised in farm country and pretty much lived off the land so to speak.You get a feeling about things,whats supposed to be and whats not,nature, one with the land ,signs etc.The feeling i had coming from this thing was all bad!!!!What was even weirder was we all had our windows down and you could hav eheard a pin drop!! no noise coming from this thing. the time frame was about 10 minutes.Then suddenly the object slowly sank behind the tree line that seperated the pit from the graveyard in front of the gravel pit and out of sight,there was a very bright white flash after it went out of sight.My father immediately looked at us and said we were to say nothing to no one at school about this at all and we never did.I have not told many people about this at all.About 1 week after this happened i started having really horrible nightmares.I would dream this horrible monster was coming to slowly get me and just when he was reaching to get me i would wake screaming in a pool of sweat sometimes even wetting my bed.This went on for about 4 years !!Then one day the dreams just stopped.There is another story involving the same type of craft we saw that was told to me by a guy who never heard my story and he described the same exact craft that we saw that night.But his story involves cattle mutilation and actually seeing the beings!! pretty hairy stuff.His sighting was not 1/2 mile from where my family saw the craft.His event was in 1989.That's it it's real and it happened! my whole family saw this thing.I have carried it with me all these years and now you know it too.They are out there and after seeing what i saw that night i cannot believe otherwise!!\r\n\r\n\r\n                    all the best:mario gandolfo ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering

are not interested in this \"event\" that took place in my life many years ago. i know it would have been helpful in \"the day and times\" it happened but now it is probably too late to be able to add anything helpful. like in 1964 the \"ship\" had several computers it used to run off of. that would have been news back then but now it is just tipical. there were approx. 6 or 7 larger than regular sized computers which were side by side across the top of a panel of switches and lights. it was a compact smallish \"ship\" which made a flight to another destination and joined some other creatures and men who look like us. there were  3 beautiful women of darker color and it was said that the main woman was named \"oriana\".I had never heard of that name until that night all this happened. recently i looked up the name by google in the computer and it said \"oriana\" was some \"love goddess of the night\" from the 12th century. i can see how this may all tie in now but back then i had no idea how her name tied into the evenings event--it is said acording to wikipedia dictionary that she is also known to be the reason males blame their night time emissions on her.It makes sense now but at 15 and being such an innocent young girl i would never have put all this together then.\r\n\r\nthe things i know that no one else does right now are pretty special but i do not wish to be in

right now than anything i remember from that time by now.\r\n\r\nwhenever i finally do tell what happened it must be private as it is a personal event.I would prefer to talk to a dr. even a woman

commercial aircraft flying in a se direction in the night sky over lenawee county, mi.   we were both passengers in a vehicle driving on pawson rd...Myself in the front passenger seat and my friend directly behind me.   there was light cloud cover and the stars and moon were visible.    the jet aircraft visibly flew beneath the cloud cover, or, rather, the clouds did not obscure the visible anti-collision and wingtip lights.\r\n\r\nanother lit object, with no anti-collision lights nor wingtip lights, shadowed the aircraft as it flew to the se.   it kept pace, approximately 15-20 lengths behind, and apparently at a slightly higher elevation.   both myself and my friend watched the light clouds obscure the lights of the trailing aircraft as if it were passing through them or above.\r\n\r\nmy friend had a set of binoculars and thought he could make out a double row of rectangular lights, i.E. a row on top of another, on this second object.\r\n\r\nwe watched both aircraft fade into the distance and the glow of adrian, mi's lights on the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nthe sighting lasted for approximately 3 minutes.    at no time did the second aircraft deviate from it's flight path...It kept completely static in relation to the first aircraft, as if it was trailing it very closely.\r\n\r\nif i were a ufo investigator, i would definitely contact the faa about this one.
