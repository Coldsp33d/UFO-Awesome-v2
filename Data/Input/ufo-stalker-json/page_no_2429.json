we knew this was not an airplane, they can't stop like that or zig-zag. helicopters are certainly not that fast, but neither are planes and satelites can't stop either. we knew at that instant we had seen something, as far as we knew, not of this earth. of course, no one believed us. this was almost 40 years ago and as far i know, there is still no aircraft of any type that can to what this thing did. my second sighting i'll file on another report, it was about 10 years later, near seymour johnson a.F.B. in north carolina. *note: i agreed to answer additional questions about this sighting, in regards to the second sighting i had, one of the questions below, telepathy. my second sighting, once i had stopped my car to observe a craft, i experienced sudden feeling of extreme dread during, as if what i were looking at something evil, something not to be seen, as if i was not suppose to see this and i became terrified, scared beyond belief, almost panicking.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of december 25th, 1996, with my cousin and a friend, we saw a flying saucer. i do not recall the exact time, but it would have been between 8 and 9.30pm. we were located at mackerel beach, which is west (across the bay) from palm beach and barrenjoey head (north of sydney). we decided to go for a walk after christmas dinner.\r\n\r\nit was a warm summer night, with a very bright full moon, and you could see clearly without the aid of a torch. there is a path that leads south from the beach, to a lookout on the headland, and it was our intention to walk up to this lookout, to see the bay under the light of the full moon. the first thing we noticed as we arrived at the beach, was the king tide that left us a very narrow path of sand to walk along, with mini tube waves crashing at the shore. these shore breakers where so strong, that they had dug a trench along the beach, and they were much stronger than the waves normally are at mackerel beach.\r\n\r\nas we were walking, i looked up, and saw on the horizon (above palm beach), a massive dome shaped ���mother ship���, flanked by two enormous cigar shaped objects. even to this day i find it hard to believe what i saw, given the epic size of these objects. they where a dull grey color in the moon light, without any markings, seems or windows, and they remained completely motionless. it was the sense of depth, the ���3d��� effect, and the perfect symmetry of these objects, that rules out any possibility of them being clouds.\r\n\r\nmy cousin was awe struck, as i recall, and she kept saying ���it���s the mother ship, it���s the mother ship!���. as is often the case, there was no noise associated with the objects, and as if they where some strange apparition, the objects promptly disappeared! we resumed our walk down the beach, with the bright silver moon overhead.\r\n\r\nwe completed the short hike up the hill without incident, and from the top of the headland, the view of the bay and barrenjoey head was spectacular. in the bright moonlight, the water below was a sparkling silvery colour, as if it had magical properties. my cousin was the first person to see the flying saucer; i think i was talking our friend at the time. she remained silent, we didn���t notice it at first, but she was dumb struck as she stared at the horizon to the se. she said something to get our attention, and when we looked in the direction she had been staring, we could see in the distance a flying saucer that was flashing randomly in different colours. my cousin told us that she had just seen it perform a maneuver where it was flying randomly in different directions, at an extremely high velocity.\r\n\r\nthe object kept changing colour, and it had two round orange lights in the centre (reminiscent of eyes). the illustration shows the shape of the object, if you can imagine it changing through all different colors like a strobe light, and the outlines are like neon tubes, that is what it looked like. when i first saw it, it was in the distance, and moving towards us, occasionally changing direction. it was soon flying over the bay, where we could see it in more detail, as it was now much closer. i couldn���t really make out the object directly; it was the coloured lights that outlined its shape. as it flew right in front of and past us, it���s hard to describe the feelings of excitement and amasement that where going through me at the time.\r\n\r\nit was flying on an upward angle, and its path was pointed directly towards the moon (the moon at this time was about half way towards its midheaven). as it flew passed us, it continued gaining altitude, and it was getting smaller and smaller as it climbed, it looked as if it would fly to moon! when it had reached a point where it appeared, from our point of view, to be right in front of the moon (and smaller in comparison), it then dropped to a position below the moon, and quickly darted down and westward, until it was out of view behind the next headland to the north. at no time did the saucer make any noise.\r\n\r\nwe waited for a short while on the rocky outcrop, hoping to see more ufos, and excitedly discussing what we had just witnessed. at this point the water police arrived, i suspect that someone else had seen the object, and had called them to report ���strange coloured lights above the bay���, or something of the sort. as they cruised past, they had a bright flood light that where using in an attempt to search for the object. it���s interesting to note, that rather than having the searchlight pointed at the water���s surface, as if to look for a boat, they were moving the beam of light in upward arcs and all over the place, to examine the headlands and sky above them.\r\n\r\nrealising that we weren���t going to see any more ufos that night, we started heading back to the house. i remember talking to my friend as we walked, who was quite excited, and he kept saying that he wasn���t sure if he believed in ufos previously, but now, he was convinced beyond a doubt, that they do in fact exist.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

massachusetts. she is 56 years old and works as an artist and designer.  she is very good at creating animation using her mac computer.  i asked her to write down the experience she had so that i could report the incident as a possible ufo. she did that for me and she also supplied me with the picture and the animation that i have attached.  the picture (lightshape2.Jpg) is a representation of the object on a photograph of the tops of the two trees where the object appeared to hover.  the animation (lightshapelayers2.Mp4) is her attempt to represent the shifting nature of the object���at times amorphous and without apparent boundaries of edges, at times with edges more distinct.  she says it is a pretty good representation of what she saw. we both use macs so i hope it translates well to pc computers. \r\n\r\nhere is what she wrote about the experience: \r\n\r\nwe were being lashed by the remnants of hurricane noel (nov 2 or 3, 2007-i can���t remember the exact date but i think it was the 2nd). there was gale force wind, thunder, lightning, heavy rain.\r\n\r\ni was sitting in my computer room near the window in my second-floor studio when i noticed that there was something strange about the lightning. there was too much of it, it was like watching a strobe light, and the thunder didn���t seem to correspond. it was like the lightning was spelling out something in morse code. dit dit dit dit, etc. and it was too near, too bright and very unusual. i started to feel a little uneasy.\r\n\r\nbut it was just a storm so i waited. i decided that i should turn off the computer because it was the type of weather that causes power outages. just after doing so i sat quietly in the darkness of the room for a while. then there was a bright flash and a brilliant light illuminated the entire yard, driveway and all the nearby area about 30 feet in every direction (an estimate). but it still didn���t seem like lightning, and i did not want to look out for fear of what i might see. it felt strange and scary because the illumination lasted for several minutes without flickering or changing although it was clearly undulating. it was brighter than broad daylight-maybe10 times brighter than a cloudless summer day at noon. i wanted to believe that this was ordinary lightning but something scared me and something in me really did not want to know what it was out there, even though i was compelled to look. i had a sense of fear that made me want to crawl under the table. but i sat still and looked out of the north window at the yard and rooftop of the cottage next door. i could see everything clearly bathed in this brilliant white light. it was like there was a giant magnifying lamp, and it stayed unmoving and illuminated, undulating for a long stretch of time, possibly 5-10 minutes. all this time i was sitting rooted to my chair with a window in front (north-facing) and another window to my right (east facing window), both with wide-open views of the weather phenomena outdoors.  at this point in time, i was just witnessing what i thought to be a very unusual lightning storm.\r\n\r\nsuddenly the light just went out, or rather seemed to have rolled away. it was dark, save for the intermittent ���dits��� of light that i described as being regular and code-like. i felt a sense of relief-i noticed after the fact that i was very tense. during the episode i was transfixed, i could have moved but i was trying to focus with all of my senses because of the unusual nature of the lightning so i stayed seated in my chair. when the lights suddenly went out, i moved closer to the window on my right (east)- which has a parallel view of the cottage and property behind my house. i was glad whatever it was, was gone. i knew whatever it was, was strange.\r\n\r\nthen the light suddenly appeared again, brilliant as ever, illuminating everything, making everything seem like bright and flat white light, filling the sky and everything reflecting it in a bright white glow. i got a really creepy feeling and then i looked out and up over the back of the cottage, in a space like a little valley between two treetops, there seemed to be a consolidated light-ball of some sort: large, like the size of a bus maybe, round and with a concentrated brilliance that was outlined by a thin gradated line - which made the shape seem to blend with the surrounding brilliance. immediately i thought i was seeing a ufo, then i ducked under the table, the surface of which is about a foot above the window���s lower ledge. it���s an old drawing board and i had it backed up to the window. under the table i could look out at it.  i looked at it, stared at it, frozen with fear but compelled by curiosity. i was watching it and almost couldn���t breathe. i saw it seem to change shape, as if the thin gradated line modulated, it reminded me of pixilation overlap used in film special effects to depict morphing, it changed from a round circle to a diamond shape, with what seemed like symmetrical filigree-like ���steps��� making the edges seem dimensional and not flat. it was like a ragged-edged diamond and the edges again were softly outlined by a thin gradated line. it reminded me of the russian painter kasimir malevich���s painting ���white on white���, a painting consisting of a tilted white square on a white backgound. only a slight variation of brushstroke allows the viewer to see the shape emerge. as difficult as it was to stare for long at the object because of its brightness, the edges of the object were very unusual and detailed, with various tiers along the edges coming forward and receding.\r\n\r\nafter watching it for a minute or two i got really scared and ducked down under the table. i felt like it was a ufo type of thing, even though i kept trying to frame it within my usual knowledge and expectations, all the while ���knowing��� that it didn���t fit into any frame of reference in my experience, and that there had to be an intelligence involved so i started to ���talk��� to it, saying ���please go away, you���re scaring me��� and ���i don���t want to get abducted��� and stuff like that. i remember saying, ���whatever you do, don���t hurt my cats���.\r\n\r\nbut i felt a sense of fear and panic that was undeniable. there was no thunder.  i crawled out of the studio on my hands and knees because i didn���t want to be ���seen��� even though i already felt like i had been seen and there was no escaping it. i entered the living room where there is a large picture window facing the same direction (east) as the window in the studio with the table. i stayed on the floor. the illumination in the general area remained for some time but fright kept me from looking anymore so i don���t know what might have happened. however, after a few more minutes the illumination dissipated, there was darkness and a few ���dits��� of light again, but then it was as if the storm had just quieted down a little, everything seemed again like a normal storm - there was regular lightning, but it was farther away and had the accompanying distant thunder, it continued to rain and the winds continued through the night. i had a feeling like i didn���t know if i had seen what i had seen.\r\n\r\nso i constructed a still image showing the relative positioning above the trees, just to serve my memory and help me to realize that whatever it was that i saw, it was something unusual. i followed that with making a short animation as well to show what it looked like, which i think i have captured reasonably well although it is very difficult to ���say��� in film with so much whiteness. i have been experimenting with animation techniques for the last 8 years so i knew what i had to do to make the movie look like what i saw. i am self-taught and there is a certain roughness to it because of gaps in my technical knowledge.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10703,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6356667,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05082008-0013","longitude":-70.2994661,"occurred":1194069600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,

june of 1979. i had some new glasses and was seeing the world around me with renewed sharpness as i was also a photographer for the school paper. the sky had a lot of cumulo nimbus clouds and i was watching for airplanes coming in to land since we were parallel to to main runway when i noticed a bright light in the clouds in front of us. since i wasn't driving i watched it for probably 30 seconds before i decided it wasn't a fixed wing and so then thought it was a helicopter. there were no flashing lights just the steady white light. i noticed that the light did not diffuse but had extremely defined edges. ordinarily i would have grown bored with it at this point knowing i wouldn't be able to see the approach but then it disappeared into the cloud so i watched for it to reappear. when i saw it again it was the same shape but now it was black... no reflection, no diffusion, still very sharp edges. we were close enough now that i should be able to see the rotors and tail boom but there weren't any. this really picqued my interest because i had grown up around planes and this wasn't one. okay so it must be a balloon. that would be a no-no this close to the airport. then i saw it start to move. mind you up til this point the object had been stationary relative to me so had it been a fixed wing plane it would have had to be coming directly at me to appear that way. it didn't \"start\" to move it just went from being stationary to moving with out any acceleration observed. not a helicopter and definitly not a balloon. now that it's moving i notice that it's following the conture of the franklin mountains as it moves off to my right ( north ). i watch it move into a cloud and although slightly obscured i watched it change from black back to white. i watched it til i lost it on the horizon. all this took about 10-15 minutes. i've thought about this incident many times over the years and, though i can't rule out the fact that it may be man made i have never seen anything that didn't diffuse light. the further you are from it the more diffusion you get. simply a matter of our atmosphere. that's my story... no close encounters and no mutilated animals but i'm sure that what ever it was it is still unidentified by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

p.M. only a small segment of the sky was visible where we were sitting. suddenly, a small black object appeared above the trees from the northeast.  it was, to the naked eye, about the size of a dime or nickel and couldn't have been more than 150' to 250' feet about the ground.  the object had sharply defined edges and there was a faintly visible slender protrusion of some sort coming out the bottom. it was travelling in a direct line from ne to sw at approximately 35-50 mph. from my pefspective, i would guess the object was perhaps the size of a basketball (or maybe slightly large) up close.  the protrusion at the bottom was around 3' in length, i imagine. there was no sound whatsoever.\r\n\r\ni thought it had the appearance of a toy balloon with a string coming out the bottom but what little wind there was cfame from the sw--the opposite direction in which the object was flying.  the trajectory was level and the object didn't deviate in the slightest from its sw course.  this was no toy. it disappeared from view when it passed over the trees behind us to the sw.\r\n\r\nwhile i assumed it was a remote controlled device of some sort, it didn't appear capable of aeordynamic

Delhi","country":"India","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was 13 years of age at the time of this sighting and we were residing in a 2nd storey flat in dilshad garden, new delhi, india. we are a family of five, and as a teenager i was almost crazy about ufos and other strange phenomena. at times, i would spend hours observing the night sky from our terrace with my brother or all alone but unfortunately without any optical aid. but this sighting occurred when i was not doing so.\r\n\r\nin the early hours of 20.7.1993, my brother jerked me awake from deep sleep and told about something unusual in the skies. apparently, i realized there was a power cut which had woken up everyone in the household so early. it was exactly 3:45 a.M. i got up and saw that my parents were looking skywards from the balcony in the front of our main entrance. i got there and saw a strange light in the east north east part of the sky. it was a small round and glowing object which was golden yellow in colour and kept growing in size gradually. it was emitting a very faint green light as well. at first, it seemed to me like a plane moving in our direction and perhaps that was the reason for its continually increasing size but after observing the object for a few minutes i became quite sure that it was not the case. on careful observation, the object looked like rotating on its own axis at the same place in the sky because its glow would become slightly dull then again increase a little like a slightly unequally illuminated rotating round object would do. but i was never sure if the object was really rotating at all or just gave the appearance of such a movement.\r\n\r\none thing i am quite sure of is that it was continually increasing in size until it was about as big as the moon and glowed brighter than the moon in its yellowish light. in the meantime, i also got to the terrace to have an unobstructed view of the object and to see if there were more such objects in the sky at the time. when i got to the terrace there was not much change in the view of the object. it was the same golden yellow glowing round object slowly increasing in its size. disappointingly enough for me, no other similar objects could be observed at the time and the sky was quite clear with no clouds visible at the time. some high-altitude aircraft also passed through the sky visible only like a faint star which we were quite accustomed to, thanks to our past night sky observation. but the object was neither affected nor moved apparently from its place. after reaching its maximum size, it started decreasing in size and finally faded away as a star in the morning sky at about 6 a.M. another thing to be noted is that it did not move apparently but in the course of 2 hours and 15 minutes when it was visible it seemed to move along with the stars and finally faded in the eastern sky. my brothers and parents were also witness to the phenomena along with me. in the first instance, it appeared only as the brightest star in the sky and then increased in size and then decreased and eventually disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe next day again i woke up at 3:45 a.M. and my parents, brothers and myself again observed the object near the same spot where it had appeared on the last night in the east north east direction and kept increasing in size and then again decreased before finally disappearing in exactly the same manner in the eastern sky at about 6 a.M. in the morning. the sky was clear on this night also. on 22nd, 23rd and 24th of july as well, we observed the same object behaving in exactly the same manner as described above in the same part of the sky. the only differece is that the object did not always reach an equal of maximum size on different days. on 24th of july, as per my notes, it did not reach as big a size as on the first night and disappeared much in the same manner.\r\n\r\nthe strangest thing that took place is that slowly i lost all interest in the phenomena which might have been due to my fantastic expectations of what a ufo should do. when i look back, i still wonder how did it happen that i just returned to my normal routine completely forgetting about the phenomena. maybe it was sheer regularity of the phenomena which made me lose all interest at the time. after 24th of july, i did not care to observe if the phenomena continued or not, and that was the end of it. but i wonder what could be the explanation of the phenomena. at that point of time, the regular appearance of the phenomena almost assured me and my family that it is just some usual phenomena, maybe a satellite, as some ill-informed people confirmed with us, but i was never really satisfied with the explanation. after going through more literature on the subject, i have never been able to identify the object as some usual astronomical, environmental or man-made object or phenomena. in \"the hynek ufo report\" by j. allen hynek, i came across his categorical statement that no astronomical or environmental phenomena is supposed to appear as an object equal the size of the moon and it again raised my doubts about the nature of the phenomena but without any satisfactory explanation so far.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":10697,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.642938,"location":null,"logNumber":"IN-05082008-0007","longitude":77.23299,"occurred":743165100000,"potentialRelations":[78267],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Delhi","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

night.\r\n\r\na car full of girls were driving home to marfa from alpine.  it is a desolate area there with nothing between the two small towns.  in between alpine and marfa on the highway as we were happily driving along, a huge triangluar-shaped object with white circular lights along the underneath side along the perimeter of the triangle shape hovered so incredibly close to the top of our car.  \r\n\r\nit was approximately as large as a football field in general size and was absolutely without sound.  that's what i can't make sense of, for the massive object to be so close over our car, hovering there, with no sound.  this went on for several seconds and then shot off in a northwesterly direction in the blink of an eye, again, with no sound.  it flew away so incredibly fast i don't have words to describe it.\r\n\r\ni don't know why, but we never discussed this amongst ourselves.  i moved away from marfa after that and have not been in touch with any of those girls since then.  i do wonder, though, as an adult what their impressions and thoughts are of the event.\r\n\r\nwe weren't terrified and there was no screaming or crying.  we were just silent as it was happening.  we

landing lights of an aircraft.  but, as we drove closer the lights just hung there.  everyone was driving about 70mph and as we all got closer to the lights everone slowed down to about 45 - 50 mph.  the lights were on my side, i had my wife steer while i stuck my head out the window to see.  the lights just hung there at about 1000ft.  we didn't see any blinking nav lights (red and green)of a typical aircraft.  i didn't hear any sound while sticking my head out the window, the best thing would of been to pull off the highway to listen for a sound.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

enthusiast for a long time... but i swear i'm not making this up and i am in no way mistaken for what i've seen.  in the past couple of months i have seen approximately 3 different ufo's in the sky.  two during the day and this latest one at night.  i usually stargaze at around 9 or 10 o'clock at night, contemplating the night sky and its constellations.  in the east, there is a \"bright star like object\" which i believe to be the planet mars and i enjoy looking at it on a nightly basis.  so, the other night, i went out to look at the planet and turned my gaze to the east.  i believed that i had found it!  it was a very bright star-like object in the night sky in the eastern direction, however, this object appeared to move just as i turned my eyes to it.  i rubbed my eyes thinking that my mind was playing tricks on me.  but to my utter amazement, the star-like object began traveling, mostly in a straight line fashion but with some movement to the right and left, slowly (well, really at a very medium pace) moving through the night sky from the east traveling over the sky heading west.  there were absolutely no blinking lights, this was not a plane! i live close to several airports and see planes in the skies often.  in fact, the day before this incident, a black military helicopter was traversing the neighborhood skies.  like i said, this object looked just like a very bright star in the sky, only it moved and flew through the sky heading west from the eastern direction.  i was utterly amazed by what i witnessed and this was the 3rd ufo sighting that i've had in the past 2 months.  the other two happened during the day.  the first was around 4pm and resembled a sailors hat... it was like a white football that just sort of floated thru the sky, again, heading in the eastern/north eastern direction.  i ran inside to get a camera but there was no film inside.  about a week later, i noticed that the birds were acting strangely and flying out of formation.  that's when i noticed a black, round \"ball\" flying level through the sky.  at first i believed it to be a bird that was just flying at a weird angle, giving the impression of a sphere or a \"ball\", however, it did not fly like a bird at all!  never once did it \"swoop\" up or down, but remained level going across and through the sky, always remaining this black spheroid shaped object!  that's when the strangest thing happened... when it passed in front of the sun, you could easily detect that the object was metal!!  so i yelled for my brother and by the time he got outside, the object was much farther off in the distance, but i pointed it out to him and told him what i'd seen, but since he couldn't see the object for what it was, he simply brushed it off as my \"overactive imagination\".  granted i suppose it may have been something other than an alien craft, but it was no bird and it was no plane!!  i've no idea why all of a sudden i've seen 3 ufo's in the past 2 months or so, whereas before i hadn't ever truly seen one... but i assure you of what i saw.  if the other two were something else, a case of mistaken identity, i am 100% positive of the star like object that i saw go across the sky the other night.

read about the two shooting stars sighted after the two ufos,,and something struck me about the trail  the shooting star left behind ...I lived in colorado in 1998-1999 and me and a few friends were walking east on walnut st in boulder colorado approx date ??? but any way five of us just started walking to go have a few cocktails at a local establishment,and when i looked up in the sky almost overhead as i normally do when i go outside at night,i saw a trail of sorts in the sky with little lights in a strait line with one light in the rear of formation moving in a half moon shape behind the trail of 6 lights kind of like this  - - - - - - ) and the whole formation moving together from the right to the left of the sky at speeds similar to a shooting star.. the first thing that came out of my mouth was oh my god a ufo and when my friends looked they too saw it still moving it moved out of our view because of a tree in the way and me and one of the group moved to the other side of the tree to follow it across the sky and it immediately broke formation in all directions all seven lights spread out across the sky at very very high speeds ,im an armature astronomer and know how to identify satellites,stars,meteors,fireballs,iridium flares,space shuttle,aircraft of human origin ... what we saw that night was none of those as i have witnessed them all..But i wanted to share the story because what i saw seems very similar to what the gentleman saw in atlanta in fact when i read it i got goose bumps and had to write...The next day i called the astronomy club at the colorado u and told them what i saw the night before and they said other reports were also made about the sighting and that they didnt know what it was...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

21st april.  we first noticed the object as soon as we turned on to lone mountain from scottsdale rd. we could see a single bright white light and red lights, and the object was descending slowly south and east.  we kept thinking it was a helicopter but as we got closer and pulled over to stop and watch, we could clearly see the outline of the object which was a trapezoid, with red lights on each corner, and as it moved at an angle it appeared to be a triangle.  it was either floating and silent or moving very slowly making very muffled whooshing vaccuum type sounds.  we watched until it literally vanished before us.  my son took a photo with his cell phone and the time stamp is 7:31pm, we had been watching it several minutes prior.  it was as close to the ground as the distance of flying a kite really high.  we were fascinated and in awe, felt no fear.  when we arrived home we called family members to talk about what we just witnessed and were excited to see it on the news that evening.  we have been in this area for some time and are intimately familiar with air traffic patterns from the local airports deer valley, carefree, and scottsdale.  this was not a plane and it was not a helicopter.  we are amused by the claims of balloons and flares and while we don't know what it was, we know what is was not and it was not balloons and flares. no way!  how would those items create the distinct shape of a trapezoid and where's the explanation about how it traveled from the deer valley area east through the thousands of acres of state land peppered with gigantic above ground electrical towers.  we are also a military family and have been around military bases and military aircraft for years, this is unlike anything we've ever seen.  we will be watching the skies
