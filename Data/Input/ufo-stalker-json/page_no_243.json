small telescope but, towards the end of the night, we decided to just sit in lawn chairs, look up, and enjoy the warm evening. at about eleven in the evening, my godmother and mom decided to go inside and get ready for bed; i, having nothing to do the following day, decided i would stay outside for a bit longer. \r\n\r\nafter something like ten minutes had passed, i leaned back in my chair and focused on this group of stars that were not directly overhead, but close to it. one star in particular stood out to me, but it did so for no particular reason (i can't tell you exactly why i chose to look at this star; it was no different from any other star, it was simply white, didn't seem to change in color, and wasn't particularly big). \r\n\r\nafter maybe a minute or two of watching this star, it suddenly moved, faster than anything i've ever seen, all the way down to the horizon. it didn't streak, it didn't glow more than any other star, there was no noise, it didn't light up the sky, and it didn't change colors. \r\n\r\nit was, one moment, just sitting there like all stars do in the sky, and then it shot away.\r\n\r\n\r\nliterally seconds after it disappeared behind the horizon, i heard a very loud metallic noise behind me; when i turned around i saw that the antenna on my mom's car was swaying violently back and forth, as if someone had pulled it back as far as possible and let go.\r\n\r\n\r\ni, as one would be in situations like this, ran inside, fairly shaken up and immediately told my mom and godmother what had just happened. they came back outside with me, but nothing similar was seen or heard for the rest of the night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

lucas road on the outskirts of woodbridge ca.This was a spot that we would go to drink or take girls to have some fun. on this particular night we had a 12-pack of coors for the three of us.It had been raining for several days, but this night the sky was clear and the stars were really bright.We were talking and laughing and listening to the chambers brothers song \"time has come today\" on the radio when we observed what we thought was a helicopter shining a search light down.I had just cracked open my second beer and  my buddy was saying \"i bet its the cops looking for somebody and that is the last thing i remember.My next recollection is i was waking up or coming to or whatever you want to call it. i was on my feet walking and i had no idea where i was or how i got there.My first thought was \"what the hell is going on!\".I stopped to look around and see if i could figure out where i was.That is when i realized that i was still in the vineyard,but i was no longer on the road that we drove in on.I then looked down and saw that my shoes were no longer on my feet.That is when i thought that the cold mud squishing between my toes is maybe what woke me up.I looked in all directions to see if i could find the car,but i did not see it.I was immediately overcome with fear and just took off running.I was splashing through the mud until i came to a paved road.I recognized the houses and i knew that i was on lucas road and i kept on running all the way back to my buddys house(approximately a mile and a half).His car was unlocked so i got in the back seat and went to sleep.The next morning as i was getting out of his car, he saw me through his kitchen window and shouted \"hey,what the hell happened to you last night.I said \"i dont know\".I asked him what happened and he said \"when we woke up you were gone.I said what do you mean when you woke up,and he said\"i dont know but we woke up and you were gone.I discovered something just under the skin on my forehead above my left eye some time afterwards.I have never had it checked out and its still there all these years later.Although, back in 2013 i had to have an mri done on my hand and the technician asked me if i had any metal in my body.I told him that i thought i had a \"bb\" in my forehead.He felt around it and took x-rays and said that it was definitely not a \"bb\".I still dont know what it is.Anyway,the three of us have never sat down and talked about that night.I have begun to tell a few people about it and they have always given me that same stupid looking grin, so i just keep it to myself.

above the float. i had my camera at the ready so i quickly took a photograph. after a short time the two objects moved away from the float and then flew over a nearby house at which point i lost sight of them. i then carried on watching the carnival procession. later on when i got back home and looked at the photograph i could see that there were in fact four strange objects in the photograph. the first object appears to be a sphere and the second object appears to be large ebani that is far away. the other two objects that were above the float appeared to be smaller ebanis. the ebanis must of been drawn to the lights and the heat coming from the carnival float. there was loud music coming from the float. these type of entities are usually scared off by loud noise so to see them get this close is very strange. i have taken many photographs of ebanis that have appeared in the skies of devon england. ebanis appear to be biological in nature. some ebanis are like worms while others can change into multiple shapes and sizes. ebanis can also appear to have an internal motion and can be multiple colours. it really is fascinating. what ever they are ebanis are always accompanied by a sphere. the sphere seem to be guarding the ebanis and could also be controlling them. ebanis are just bizarre. the photograph was taken &#8206;the 7th of &#8206;november &#8206;2015 about 9:15 pm gmt

female work colleague when a strange woman walked by and rudely interrupted our conversation. i had never seen this woman before but she somehow looked familiar. the woman loudly said \"still seeing flying saucers my friend\", with that i immediately awoke from my deep sleep and to my shock there was a man dressed in black standing over me. the words were in fact coming from his mouth and he said it again... \"still seeing flying saucers my friend\" it was so shocked i tried to get up but i was paralysed. i was only able to move my head and it took all my strength to look at him. he was smartly dressed and  had on a perfectly fitted black suit and was wearing a black hat. in his left hand he was holding a big menacing metallic needle that looked like it was made from stainless steel. i could not believe what i was seeing. i could feel cold air hitting my stomach and when i looked down i  could see that the bed covers had been pulled down to my waist and my top had been pulled up to my chest level leaving my stomach completely  exposed. the man in black then stuck the needle in to my belly button and the pain was intense as the needle pieced me and went through my belly button. i tried to shout out but i was unable to. i then tried to talk to him telepathically and in my mind i said who are you and what the hell do you think you are doing, with that the man in black quickly pulled out the needle from my stomach and there was a flash of brilliant white light that came though the window and then i passed out. when i woke up i found out that the bed covers were still pulled down to my wast and my top had been pulled up to my chest level and my stomach was still completely exposed. i got up and noticed on the carpet there were slight mark like some one had been standing there i also noticed that the chair i keep next to the bed has clearly been moved. now how strange is that. wtf? this incident occurred today on sunday the 18th december

sometime between mid december 2013- mid january 2014. i had gone on my break to wendy's in carmel around 2am. on my way back, i made a left onto route 22 by mcdonalds, i had to make a right at the next light, not even a half mile away. there was one other car, like an outback stationwagon type deal, on the road coming in my direction. i had just passed mcdonalds, & the other vehicle was headed in my direction right around the light where i had to turn right. suddenly, directly to my left, a black triangular shape, which i hadn't previously noticed \"charged\" in the air. the entire event lasted a split second, but there was an almost inaudible small hum or snap like when you'd take a picture with one of those old school metal cameras with the big flash blubs. each end of the triangle had a small circle on the bottom which charged, & the center was a larger circle which also charged, all of them a really orange color which got brighter until almost white. they began to glow in such a matter that they seemed to merge together, then the craft took off in the direction i was driving down route 22 leaving a light trail behind it only momentarily. the craft felt like it was closer to me than the light at which i had to turn, & the craft was probably around 30-45feet from base/bottom of the triangle  to the tip. over the light which it emited, it only seemed to be a dark, flat triangular structure, tho my angle didn't give me a good view of the top of the craft, & the event was so short i likely would not have been able to obtain much information anyway. i initially thought i was just imagining things, but when i returned my attention to the road, i noticed the car which had been approaching me had also slammed on the brakes/stopped in response to the random speciticle we both, apparently, observed.

direction, leaving a thick contrail, which persisted. then it began to dissipate. i looked through my binoculars to see how quickly it was evaporating and noticed a white orb hovering next to it. then it began moving erratically before hovering again. i put my binoculars down and discovered i could not see it with my unaided eye. i raised my binoculars again and located it and saw that it was still hovering. seconds later, it accelerated at a very high rate of speed in a westerly direction and disappeared. i then spent fifteen minutes looking searching for it but could not locate it again. i

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Formation or cluster of five lights catapulting and zooming dramatically near the i-5 freeway at night\r\n\r\ni was driving rapidly north on us interstate 5 (i-5) shortly after dark, about 15 miles west of firebaugh, california.\r\n\r\nahead of me (a hundred meters perhaps) i saw a cluster of five lights in several indeterminate/shifting colors moving rapidly from east to west about 10 meters above the freeway, in a downward trajectory.\r\n\r\nthen as my car reached the place where the lights were coming down, i slowed down, and observed through the driver's side window as the lights seemed to fold into themselves and lift up again abruptly into the air.\r\n\r\ni looked back at the car's outside side-mirror and saw the lights continue to ascend behind me in the far distance. then suddenly (within one second) again i saw them directly through the side window, parallel to my car, only about 10 meters above the ground; and then they zoomed across the freeway at a sharp angle in front of me (perhaps 50 meters in front of me), going from west to east, ascending rapidly and vanishing from my sight.\r\n\r\nas i say, the lights \"folded into themselves.\" what i mean is that i didn't perceive this as a solid object or \"craft\" with a particular shape, with lights mounted on certain features of it, etc., as one would see on an airplane. the lights were just lights, flying in a formation that remained generally triangular; but with additional dimensions.\r\n\r\nthey continued this \"folding\" and \"unfolding\" the whole time i observed, though at first i didn't perceive it that way.\r\n\r\ni didn't perceive there to be any \"mass\" to it, apart from the lights. the lights sort of catapulted and cartwheeled within themselves, inside a certain defined space that itself was in motion.\r\n\r\nover the course of a few seconds, my thoughts evolved as follows:\r\n\r\n1. is that an overpass up ahead with a big truck crossing it? i think it's crashing!\r\n\r\n2. oh wait, it's some kind of airplane, coming in to land, is there an airport right there on the left? i don't think so... i think it's crashing!\r\n\r\n3. oh, it didn't crash, it's flying very acrobatically; maybe it's a crop-duster? but at night?! impossible!\r\n\r\n4. ha!!! this is definitely a ufo! those lights are moving very strangely! where's my camera... ok found it... too late, damn it, it's way back there now... i bet i see it again though... ha! here it is again!!!\r\n\r\nif i were to compare the motion of the lights (& their folding/unfolding) to something i've seen before: i would say it resembled the motion of \"nunchakus\" (the chinese martial arts weapon) when being used by an expert.\r\n\r\nas you may have seen in old bruce lee films, nunchakus are essentially two sticks connected at one end by a short chain. imagine that there was a light on each end of both sticks, and one on the middle of the chain; imagine that an expert was using them, but in somewhat slower motion than usual. that's roughly how it looked as they wheeled about through the air.\r\n\r\nanother weapon that the lights and their motion resembled is the \"primitive\" hunting tool, the bolo. two or three rocks are tied together in a certain way, and hunters skillfully throw this cluster at the target. it is sort of like a boomerang, but with less form.\r\n\r\ni could also suggest that its motion was like something you might see in a very simple kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\ni did not notice any particular sound associated with what i saw.\r\n\r\nif i were to estimate the size of this cluster of lights: perhaps 5-10 meters in diameter at any particular moment? as i say, it didn't seem to be a solid object.\r\n\r\nby the time the lights came \"back\" to me i had found my camera on the seat beside me. i took one picture through the side window and one through the front windshield. both pictures came out poorly; it was dark inside the car, the lights were moving and i was holding the camera rather unsteadily as i drove. in the picture through the side window, one sees two parallel streaks of light, moving horizontally but beginning to ascend. they look like two snakes, racing. in the picture through the front, which also shows lights from the car's dashboard, the lights look like bright parallel streaks, sort of curved, ascending sharply. at the time, i didn't perceive them this way. i think the streak-effect is from the motion of the lights, the motion of my car, and my camera's slow \"automatic\" shutter speed in the dark.\r\n\r\nreported this to nuforc one day after the event, but reporting it to mufon today.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
