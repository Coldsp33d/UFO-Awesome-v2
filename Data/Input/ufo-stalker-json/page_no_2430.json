direction of a neighboring county, cobb, specifically \r\nat an area where dobbins airforce base is located.\r\ni had been star gazing for a couple of hours with a friend of mine named chris.\r\naround 4:00 a.M. or so, i turned to my right to move the telescope to a different area of\r\nmy terrace. upon  turning to my right, i immediately noticed a very bright roundish object that seemed to be emitting different colors almost in a sort of loop pattern. the position of this object in relation to the horizon and area of the sky was nothing but an anomaly. i quickly grabbed my binoculars to view this object. this object was not very far above the horizon which led me to believe it was not very high in the sky. as i began to look at this thing, it began to move to the right. the object then stopped again for a second and then moved upwards at an unusual rate of speed and then became still and then moving very swiftly to the right. these movement clearly were not those of anything that i am aware of and confirmed my suspicion that i might be viewing a u.F.O. at this point, i called for my buddy rob to come check this out. he was a few yards behind me. i asked him again to hurry up and look at this thing. at the moment chris turned around and made visual contact with this object, it instantly vanished. the lights went out and i want to say it seemed to have vanished in an upwardly fashion but i honestly can't confirm this because of how fast it disappeared. i asked him if he saw anything and replied yes and what the hell was that.\r\nhe says he saw a bright ball for a half second disappear into thin air.\r\nmy next statement is probably unrelated but i feel it should be mentioned. around an hour after this incident while standing on a different terrace, my friend and i witnessed two separate shooting stars both strangely either with the same trajectory or very close. the second \"shooting star\" appeared to have left a cloud trail where the end looked like a half circle shape. we both agreed that these meteors were unusual in how quick and bright they were. the location of this shooting stars were not near the u.F.O. sighting.\r\nalso, a few days prior to this incident, i spotted a bright round object in the sky that was emitting multi colors similar to this one. however, i presumed it was a bright star or planet but was compelled to run inside to grab a camera to take a picture. upon returning from inside, the object was gone. i was absolutely stumped on how this planet or star could have just vanished. it was on my mind even the next day. i mention this prior sighting because i'm wondering if this object was the same or similar to the recent sighting. the position however in the sky was almost opposite from each other. basically, a difference of around 180 degrees of difference now that i think of it.\r\n this sighting made me feel very exited and i remember while watching the craft or object an internal sense of something. i can't explain this feeling really. it was not a bad feeling however.\r\nplease let me know if you need any other information or a picture of the area where i saw this event. also, i forgot to mention that i live on the 20th floor (very top) of a condo building and have a very large terrace which is where i was on this night. the terrace and another balcony i have are on three parts of the building giving me a very wide view of almost the entire skyline.\r\ni view the night sky looking at stars and planets about once or twice a week for the last year and this is the first sighting of a u.F.O. that i've ever seen.\r\nplease let me know if you need anything else.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nscott l.\r\n\r\np.S. - i'm 32 years of age, male, and work as a network technician mainly doing contract work.\r\n           i'm not on medication and have never had any mental problems. i was very clear headed\r\n           during this matter.","distance":"Over One

who was also on duty with me stepped outside for a smoke break and noticed what at first appeared to helicopters doing gun runs in the distance.  he alerted me to this and i came outside to watch as doing so is rather interesting.  it was about 1 minute into it when we noticed that these supposed helicopters were flying way too fast and actually seemed to be \"zooming\" from left to right at incredibly fast speeds.  they were lit up with what looked to be like red and white lights but at a constant glow, however dimming from time to time.  the thing that freaked me out though was the fact that they were mimicking ah-64 apache attack gun runs!  how a gun run works is they start from the left or the right and swoop down and launch their rockets and what not at a target on the ground.  these objects were doing these same motions from right to left, at what looked to us speeds that definitely cannot be achieved by our aircraft.  they would do these motions one right after the other and sometimes looked as though they were racing!  once one had swooped from the right to left it would fly back from left to right at a vertical zig zag motion, which our aircraft definitely cannot do at the speeds these things were flying.  they continued to do these \"gun runs\" for about 5-10 minutes and the glow of the ships seemed to pulsate.  our best guess for the distance from us would be about 1-2 miles.  it was a partly cloud night but the craft were well below any clouds.  we both watched this event and were freaked out afterwards because we debunked all possibilities of it being any type of military aircraft.  after about 10 minutes of watching these lights they simply just vanished, almost as if they were never there.  my buddy and i felt uneasy at the fact that we might have just seen ufo's.  i have been in the army for 4 years and have a vast knowledge of our weapons and technology and can honestly say that these lights/ships were not anything human.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

people.  i was principal of our county-wide middle-school and the superintendent of schools was my neighbor across the street.  an oilfield worker lived next door to him and the three of us would sometime sit out in our lawn chairs on the superintendent���s driveway chatting and enjoying the cool of the evening.  none of us were drinking. it was a moonless night with no streetlights and the sky was crystal clear. looking into the starry milky way was a beautiful sight.  occasionally we���d spot a satellite inching across the night sky.\r\nthe superintendent���s garage was attached to the house by an opened covered walkway about 18 or so feet long. i was sitting facing southwest and had a good view of the sky under and above the walkway.  my neighbors were facing one north and one southeast.\r\na bright object arose either out of the southern sky or it may have risen from the ground like ball lighting and it arced up and toward the north.  it was shooting out  sparks all around and making a sizzling, rapidly ���shushing��� noise  it appeared to be round and spinning, but i couldn���t be sure of this or of its size and altitude.\r\n\r\nit continued rising and arcing north and i lost sight of it momentarily as it passed behind the roof of the covered walkway. i looked straight up to see where it was going but it seemed to have disappeared.  then as i gazed up i realized that there was a long, dark shape visible only because it was silhouetted by the bright starry sky. it was black and as i stared up i became aware of one, then a second large round port very, very dimly lighted.  the sound was the most amazing part in that the dark shape was thrumming so low that i could only feel its vibration in my chest like the lowest notes of a pipe organ or far off thunder.  the vibration was like an idling motor being revved slowly again and again.\r\ni don���t know how long it stayed there but it began to drift slowly toward the west. the impression i got was that it just slid sideways until it dwindled to a dot and was gone. could be that the object remained stationary and the earth rolled away to the east?\r\n\r\nthe three of us just sat there silently. then i spoke up and said, ���what do you think that was?���  the superintendent replied guardedly, ���i don���t know.���  it was never mentioned again by any of us.  anyone seeing a ufo then or now is

may 5th.  my patio faces south, and i was looking around the night sky with binoculars (for earlier tonight i had a strange sighting that continued until i arrived home at approx 11 pm, and only ended an hour or so ago *12 am*) and just took notice of all the stars i couldn't see with my naked eye.  venus was at about 10 o clock in my line of sight where i began standing, and i moved to the side of the patio-putting venus at about 1 o clock in my sight.  i had just put the binoculars down when a flash of light, up and to my right, caught my eye.  i quickly looked up and saw a golden/yellow ball of light shot through the night sky-it seemed to maintain direction for a good half second (leaving a trail of light behind it) before quickly slowing down, making a quick 45 degree backwards movement, and shooting back forward and disappearing.  this whole sequence lasted only a few seconds, but the trailing/illuminated light left by this movement formed a slightly angled z shape (if the top and bottom lines were longer and the / was minimally sized at best).  best i can describe it is that it shot through the sky-appearing out of nowhere-and seemed to abruptly slow down before kicking back and shooting away as quickly as it appeared.  i thought initially it to be a meteor-until it made the z kick and shot off into nothingness.\r\n\r\ni've seen a few things very recently that have deeply intruiged me, but this was unbelievable.  i also saw something similar (a huge streak of light) that was enormous in comparison-but i can't form the description to make it even remotely believable.  it also occured during a strange night.  over the last 3 weeks or so, there have been a handful of things i planned to report but never felt urged to.  tonight i got on here and immediately reported it (my first one ever!)-thats how incredible this was.  thanks for your

miles north of las vegas. sky was clear at the time and sunlight was starting to recede, so timeline may not be exact. we were traveling from los angeles in route to aspen, colorado. i was a driving a 28 foot u-haul truck, loaded with luggage and christmas decorations for employer's winter home in aspen. we pulled off on the north bound shoulder of interstate 15 to change driving positions as i wanted to drink a cup of coffee. we both moved to the rear of the truck, and at the rear of the vehicle i caught a flashing red light in my view. the light was a single light, approximately 5000' in altitude, appeared stationary, distance 2 miles, southeast of our position. within 15-20 seconds a second light appeared, spaced north of first light at same altitude. the second light did not flash, and was close in distance to first light. the first light stopped flashing and remained constant, as the second. when the first light stopped flasing, a third light appeared, and than a fourth, each lighting several seconds after the previous, and all remaining lit, no flashing. within a minute or so a total of 12 lights were visible, all evenly spaced, and all red in color. the distance from the first light to the last, appeared to be a mile or so in length. the lights remained at altitude and did not appear to be moving laterally. in short order we heard the sound of a jet aircraft, but i could not get a vector on the noise. as i turned back to the lights, the first light that appeared flashed several times, and disappeared. the remaining lights than moved from a linear formation south to north, and rotated to north/east - south/west direction. as they moved it appeared that the formation was in a v pattern, with the point facing south/east. the lights appeared to now be moving south/east towards the colorado river area. the jet noise became increasingly louder, and we observed two f-15 fighter aircraft moving at a very high rate of speed. the aircraft crossed in front of our vehicle, traveling south/east and vectored directly toward the lights. i am very familiar with aircraft types, and these aircraft had twin vertical tail sections as found on usaf f-15 fighters. the aircraft closed quickly on the lights and than the red lights moved in unison at an extremely high rate of speed away from f-15's in a south/easterly direction, and disappeared in short order. the fighters' lights could be visble for a short period there after, however it was quite evident that the f-15's were considerably slower than the v-shapped light formaton. shortly after fighters' lights disappeared we heard several loud booms, which we assumed were sonic booms. the experience was quite stunning, and later that evening we made a call from our motel room in st. george, utah to nellis afb. my partner made the call and transferred to base operations. they seemed disinterested, and stated that they could not comment on military flight operations, but suggested that we contact the faa in regards to the red lights.

20feet from the trail in the woods.  it was camoflaged, 10 feet in radius and i stilts about 6 feet tall.  this i did not investigate i was alone but i rode through the trail and seem to remember that it took alot longer then normal.  to this day i dont understand why i didnt go back to the rode because it was a shorter distance i know i was very frightened.  the next day my father came with be to the area of the place i saw the ship.  he said thay was something there cause all the brush was packed down.","distance":"20 Feet or

him that there was nothing in the sky where we had viewed the objects, out of the corner of my eye, i saw a red to green flashing star-like object. the object was far to the right from where we had seen them before.  we called our son, out to see this.  this time we could only find one of the starlike objects. tyler was scarred and excited. we watched this object move around, moving suddenly from left to right, right to left, moving what seemed closer to us(the colors would get brighter)and then farther away. we watched this happen until 11:00pm. and then it got really dim and dissappeared. i went in to see what time this was. i went back outside and as quick as it dissappeared it reappeared. it did this quite a few times. scott went inside and went to bed about 11:30 and tyler and i came back inside at 11:45, and went to bed. i tried to take photos, but when i downloaded the 3 pics, it showed nothing but blackness.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

to retrieve my coffee mug.  i looked up at the sky to see if was clear with stars. it was about 05:25 a.M.? just before sunrise. just before i looked down a light appeared in the west.  the light was at a very high altitude maybe 30,000 feet, and at first looked like normal aircraft.  i then realized its light looked alot bigger and brighter for such a high object.  the light was circular to oval in shape and was traveling from west to east across the sky. i would estimate speed 700-900 mph. i have lived or worked off and on all my life in the flight landing paths of major airports and currently work next to one. this light had no green or red running lights.  the light source was not multiple bright landing lights seen on many large aircraft. i live in a very quiet redwood forest and this object made no noise.  thought possible satellite catching sunrise but light didnt look like a reflection and it didn't dissapate. maybe military flight? don't know, thought worth sharing in case tied in with any other reports.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10653,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.3439857,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05042008-0006","longitude":-121.8892355,"occurred":1209731100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

(ironically) when i was watching the stars and explaining to someone what i had seen the first time i saw ufo's.\r\n\r\nthe first time: i was sitting on a car and looking up in the sky for about ten minutes. i became fixated on one star that had seemed to move but i was not sure. i told my friend to watch it with me. as we looked at it. it split into 4 seperate stars and shot into 4 differnet directions. keeping an eye on one of them and some times each of them..They each moved in crazy directions like they were bouncing around the sky..Then they each came back together and hovered around each other for a few seconds as to communicate with one another.. then they again shot into 4 different directions and each one disapearing. ther was no beam of light coming from them..It was not like a beam at all.. it was crazy. i was not surprised and neither was my friend just truly amazed.\r\nthe second time i saw this a few years later in 1996in west chester , pa. ironically when i was trying to explain to someone who was a skeptic what had happened the first time..We looked up in the heavens and i saw another strange looking star...I told my friend that it looked like the one i saw before...He was a total disbeliever..Then strangely enough the same exact sequence of events happened again...My friend to this day is in shock about it.....I was just lucky to have experienced the same thing twice..But since then i have been looking with no luck!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10652,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.959615,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05042008-0005","longitude":-75.157799,"occurred":822470400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":822470400000,"summary":"One
