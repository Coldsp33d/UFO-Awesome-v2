before i was about to retire.  i live near east of martinez and west of concord, ca about 1 to 3 miles west and about 2 to three hundred feet above buchanan airfield with a good view of mt. diablo to the east.  so i'm out front gazing into the clear dark sky as i do every night when smoking or not.  i clearly identify the big dipper to the north as \r\nit's reaching it's zenith and various stars moving across the sky as always.  \r\nnow i'm thirty one years of age and i know how stars and constellations track \r\nacross our night sky.  i spend no less than 10 minutes each night in poor to excellent conditions identifying stars and planets.  i know that most stars visible to the naked eye tend to twinkle due to dust and various pollutants in our atmosphere.  i know planets tend not to twinkle such as mars when a few months ago was very clear and consistent nightly.  i read and update myself on the latest astronomy and science as much as possible. ok so as im smoking and gazing across the sky, i look to the east above and to the right of mt. diablo where i see a bright orange and white star-like object at about\r\n40 degrees.  first i think it's venus but this object was much closer and it did not move.  about three minutes of observing this object i begin to see it moving and zigzaging from east to west north to south and up and down in elevation.  now i'm a very rational thinker so i begin to eliminate  all the possible reasons that this object could be behaving.  after about 8 minutes now i decide to wake my sister to look.  she first as i did thought it was a star or venus but after several more minutes she too notices that the object is moving around hovering for aprox. 15-45 seconds then moving almost dancing \r\nin all directions then returning to hover and so on and so on.  now this is just the beginning as i notice more objects one of which was directly above behaving in the exact way. in all i observed 6 to 12 objects that were moving\r\nbut most importantly they remained fixed in the sky compared to stars in the background that were tracking as i usually see.  i witnessed two objects appear and travel due east at incredible speeds.  like i said i live very close to buchanan  airfield. i see many types of planes, helicopters, and jets.  these objects had no blinking lights, some especially the first one i saw seemed to change size.  i compare it to smoke ring when blown from the mouth as it bends and changes in size.  ok so i first called 911, the dispatcher said that she would tell an on duty officer and verified my number in case they wanted to return for more info.\r\ni then called buchanan airfield and talked to an on duty personnel who said \r\nhe would take a look.  no response from either.  these objects were in formation, moving in directions i have never seen. in total including myself there were 4 witnesses all family and one contacted by phone who lives in walnut creek who also identified the first witnessed object. i took pictures and viewed through my galileo f600x50 telescope.  i have yet to look at the pics.  my camera is a digital nikon 8800 vr.  i would very much like to know if anyone else saw this most incredible sighting.  i'm am willing to make drawings, provide more info and anything else i can to document this sighting.  this is my second ufo report and i'm quite certain\r\nthat it won't be my last.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\nted heffel\r\n\r\n(925)849-4968\r\n(925)812-2164\r\n","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmy name is william harris, a desert storm veteran and a 12 yr usaf veteran.  i want to make this report just to do my part so we can someday find out the truth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmy incident happened on thanksgiving in 88 or 89.  i���m not really sure of the actual year, however, i am 100% certain of the day and of what i experienced.  i would like to add that at that time i was assigned to a special ops unit in the usaf out of frankfurt germany and i was just visiting my in-laws for the thanksgiving holiday.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmy father in law (howard lee, retired msgt, usaf and drug counselor) and i went fishing up in the mountains of alamogordo, nm on thanksgiving.  we fished silver lake all day and were suppose to come home early for dinner, but decided to stay late since the trout were biting pretty good that day.  by time we were on our way back home to alamogordo, it was dark, however, it was a very clear night with no clouds or overcast.  we���re driving up and down hills coming from the mountains.  alamorgodo, nm is home to holliman afb and next to the white sands missile range.  also, this little city is based at the bottom of the mountain range and it is pretty flat down in the basin where the city sits.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nanyway, as we are going up and down hills, we finally get the part of the trip, where you can actually see the entire basin, the city and a little past the city, there are two large mountains or very large hills (they are the only two large landmarks on the other side), which are located behind the city from where we were coming from.  as we are driving i started looking at the two mountains ahead of us and i noticed some lights by them. as i started watching them fascinated by the brightness of them, i noticed that there were three lights and they were moving in odd ways.  one would go up vertically, then speed off at a 45 degree angle behind the mountain, then it would speed back in front of the mountain.  then soon, 2 more lights joined them.  i would describe them as bright white spheres.  anyway, these 5 spheres or lights, were just doing the most unimaginable maneuvers in front of these two mountains.  i watched them for about 3 minutes to make sure i was not seeing things and finally told my father in law about them.  he started watching them as well and after a couple of minutes, he stated what the hell is that? we watched them for over 15 minutes and the entire time they were flying, hovering, speeding from point to point and even at times disappearing and reappearing on the other side of the mountains.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ni must state that i worked on the flight-line a lot, during the day and night and am very familiar with aircraft lights, at night, during the day and have a lot of experience working at night on the flight line. i can tell an aircraft or a helicopter with no problem.  i must also state that during my assignment in special ops, our unit worked closely with navy seabees, 82nd airborne, usaf special forces (combat control teams) and even had the opportunity to support delta force.  our unit covered all of africa, europe and the middle east, so any missions, wars, conflicts or humanitarian efforts in those theaters, we covered and supported via the flight-line, during day, night, snow, sun etc..\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ngetting back to my incident.  i guess it���s hard for me to describe exactly what the 5 spheres were doing except by saying they were kinda of doing a star shaped pattern next to the mountains.  also, i could not make out the details of the mountains, but i could see two huge dark silhouettes of the mountains.  these spheres were disappearing behind it then reappearing when they got to the other side.  it would take them maybe 1 or 2 seconds to go from the 1 o���clock of the mountains to the 7 o���clock position, then streak across the mountains again to the 3 o���clock position. etc. if you draw a star with your pencil, that is exactly what they were doing.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ni tried to draw a diagram below, with the mountains being the black and the patterns of these orbs in red.  please understand, that these crafts or lights, were disappearing behind the mountains and sometimes flying in front of the mountains, so i could see very well that they were in close proximity of those hills, where they could fly behind them and in front of them. these things were extremely fast and their maneuvers were unbelievable.  i have flown on a lot of military planes and  helicopters, i have been to many air shows, and as stated earlier have worked on the flight-line extensively.  so i have seen most usaf aircraft, f15, f16, a10, f18, b1 bomber, b2 bomber, etc t38, kc 135, c130, c5, c141, etc, etc,  i am very familiar with those aircrafts and what they look like and what they can do.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nin conclusion, either i witnessed a new secret aircraft being tested that we have no knowledge about or i saw a ufo (i���m not saying flying saucer), just unidentified.  this incident has stayed with me for a long time and to this day, i cannot imagine any aircraft doing those maneuvers. these things were super super fast, agile and could stop on a dime.  as stated they would fly in front and the back of the two mountains so i could see them moving, speeding, disappearing, reappearing and hovering.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ni guess we could have been maybe 5-10 miles away.  i could clearly see the silhouttes of the mountains and could see these things fly in front and in back of the mountains.  we were close to whitesands testing facilities, so either new technology or the dreaded word ufo.  i also am very aware of the sr71 and the fact that it was activated n 1964 or 68 and as an active duty member, we really didn���t start seeing pictures of it till about 84 so they kept that out of the public eye for a long time.  these things were not conventional aircrafts.  i currently work for the dod as a logistician.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthank you for your time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwilliam l.

the police could not meet him there because they were swamped with alarm calls.  i guess the whole south side of pueblo was going off. my husband left and i got out of bed and went down stairs to wait for him (i was worried about him going into the restaurant without the police).  i was sitting at the kitchen table in the dark with the front door open and just the screen door between me and the outside porch.\r\nthree different times during (i would say about 15 minutes) i heard what sounded like bacon sissling and then a loud click (almost like the click you hear when you turn on and off a light switch) when i heard the click a bright green light would shine into the house from all the windows and doors (it reminded me of a sort of spot light affect) i got up and walked to the front door to look out and could not see anything in front of me, but i wanted to step out onto the porch and look up... ( i also felt a strong feeling of \"you really don't want to see this\") my husband at the time was coming home and was witnessing the light from the corner of our street.  when he saw me opening the front screen door, he drove up the street and jumped out of the car and pushed me into the house.  we don't know what it was, but i was 3 months pregnant at the time and i worried about it my whole

when i saw a huge \"craft\" with red and green flashing lights floating/hovering over the high school athletic field next to my house.  it appeared as an elongated disc-shaped object and seemed to be floating mid-air, a few hundred ft. off the ground. i watched it for several minutes, awestruck at what i was seeing.  i took the dog inside, and called the police non-emergency #, to see if anyone had also reported seeing it.  they said, \"yes\", and that it had also been seen over another school in a different part of town.  i described what i was seeing, hung up and went back outside to view it again.  i watched it for another few minutes.  it would sit still for a time, with only the lights flashing, then it would move up and down slightly, and turn from side to side.  i came back into the house and called a neighbor, who went out and called me back to say both of them saw it.  i went back outside, it was still hovering, then turning slowly, and then it looked like it was descending, which made me feel a bit fearful, so i went back in to call the police again, and when i came back out, it was gone.  that was the last i saw of it.  i watched it for a total of about 20 minutes. unfortunately, i don't own a video camera, but it would surprise me if no one else caught it on film.  i called the police this morning to see if they had figured out what it was, and they said no, but they filed their own eyewitness official police report about it.  evidently, they had seen it, as well.

just south of san franciso and we could see a very strange light that appeared only a few feet in depth but extended north and south across the ocean as far as we could see. it appeared to be moving slowly toward the east and appeared like a blue light that was reading a bar code. we made a turn from the coast highway which runs north and south toward the east (toward our home). we drove slowly and watched the light coming closer and closer. when we started driving up our street which rises to the east we could see the light was still coming toward us. finally it caught up with us and went right over our car at about what appeared to be 5 miles an hour. the light was very blue. it seemed unusual in that it was a heavy blue that looked intensly deep in color. we then sat and watched as it continued to move eastward until it passed over the mountain in front of us, to the east, and out of our sight. my brother went in and called the pacifica police and asked if they had any reports of the blue light and they said yes, many. the interesting thing was that we could not see any source for the light and it extending for at least 20-25 miles north to south and was only a couple feet wide. we thought at the time that it might have been a satellite or something similar and we stood looking for some time but could never find any indication of where it came from. as a note, i think that it must have passed over the san francisco airport as that was the direction it was moving. they might have a record of the event or even an eplanation. the date, including the year may not be exact but i could confirm more with my family if necessary. also, i am a licensed aircraft mechanic (a & p mechanic license wth an r & e license) and i worked for many years as an engineer for united airlines before retiring two years ago. i also worked with many aircraft while in the us navy but have never seen anything like this before or since.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10622,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.6138253,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05012008-0001","longitude":-122.4869194,"occurred":360295200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":360295200000,"summary":"Blue

from behind the cloud, it seemed to light up the whole sky.\r\n\r\nthen the tip of the \"comet\" broke up into 4 or 5 lights with smaller tails, they danced around the small area around the original ball area of the comet and converged again before the whole thing disappeared. \r\n\r\ni could no longer rationalize what i had seen. i completed the delivery in shock, unable to stop myself from
