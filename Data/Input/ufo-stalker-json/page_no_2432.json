ignored the experience.  people wouldn't believe me if i told them anyway.\r\n  i swear this experience is true.  my kids and i have never discussed this since it happened.\r\njulie

about 1 hour drive. i was heading south on wadsworth and as soon as i passed 44th and wads cross street, a green orb flew se over wadsworth, about 100-200 ft above my car; at first i thought it was a green fire work,because i saw lights behind it,looked as if firework exploded.But the green orb was moving too fast east to be firework in wind.The lights behind it remided me of jet or helicopter;the lights following orb were white in close v shape with a green light on one side and red on the other, i concluded a human vehicle.The light was moving faster than any jet ive ever seen fly in a suburban area, and the jet or heli was trying to keep up with it; it was moving so fast i couldnt keep up with them going 40mph in my vehicle, i tried to follow them with my eyes but lost them behind some buildings, by the time i got to a street that followed their direction both were gone from my view. i started calling my friends letting them know hwat i saw, i was freaking out,i didnt know if i should call 911 or police or what.I have never seen anything fly that low and quick in the city, everyone i called wouldnt believe what i just saw. the next morning on the way to work i was heading east on colfax toward denver and i saw two sets of 2 black goverment helicpoters flying close together over denver and more north toward lakewood. after seeing those the next morning i new something wasn't write and comfirmed that something happened the night before, so idecided to report this to mufon, ive seen this company on history channel.","distance":"101-500

driving a 2006 ford econoline passenger van (pulling a trailer). my 20 year old son and two other adult friends all witnessed the event.\r\n\r\n2. what made me notice? the craft was flying low and at first i thought a jet airliner was approaching an airport. as we got closer the lights and shape were not not like any aircraft i had ever seen. there was no sound.\r\n\r\n3. what did i first think? the craft was flying low and at first i thought a jet airliner was approaching an airport for a night landing.\r\n\r\n4. describe the ufo. the \"larger than a commercial airliner\" sized ufo crossed the highway moving southward. the angle that was first observed as it crossed the highway was from its side as it banked. my vehicle was within a few hundred yards of the craft as it passed slowly over the highway. there were 4,5 or 6 large white circle shaped lights within a criss-crossing lattice work. it looked like \"xoxoxoxox\". smaller red, yellow & greenish lights were set within the \"x's\". the side profile was pistol shaped on the north side (somewhat like an upside down plane in shape). the lower section also had an x weave with red, yellow and greenish lights within a lattice work. the ufo slowly banked showing a huge triangular shape. it was big. the lighting pattern became a v pattern exposing rows of 5 or 6 white lights on both exposed sides. the ufo was now on the south side of the highway banking . it moved with the hypotenuse side leading. we continued to drive. i never heard a jet sound or any loudness. it was large, spanning the highway as it passed over the highway.\r\n\r\n5. reactions. i asked my son \"what is that?\" he said \"ufo?\". it was amazing. after the event i felt like it was a government owned ufo. i was not frightened. none of us were frightened.\r\n\r\n6. how did we lose sight? the object moved over a tree line as we continued to drive west.\r\n\r\ni have seen a photo on-line today from an indiana 1/31/2008 sighting. i am confident it is the same type of ufo as we witnessed. i have attached that photo.

high in the sky, at around 9:08 pm this evening april 29th  two objects were orange in color, the third was a bright white color. the white colored object was almost in center of the formation, but was lower than one of the two orange objects. pulled my vehicle over, shut it off. grabbed a digital camera, took two pictures within a minute, saw a vehicle approaching from opposite way, flashed my headlights several times to flag the vehicle down, they didnt stop. then i was going to take another picture, and noticed one of the orange objects looked larger now, and appeared to be moving  a bit closer to me. i took another picture, and tried to take more, i realized my camera must be full,i believe there are 4 pictures total i took.I never thought to delete other pictures to make room until it wa too late, already home. i stayed at the same spot to watch these objects, one of the orange objects, the one not getting larger moved up, then down rapidly, and then moved and stayed near the white object, the larger orange object didnt seem to get any larger now, and i got very scared, and felt it was time to get out of the area altogether. i sarted my van and left. while on the way i felt sleepy, and a bit confused, i had some trouble driving, not alot, but disoriented and felt as though i couldnt pop my ears, like some kind of pressure, even as i write this now, i still feel some kind of pressure. i decided to not report this to local sherrifs dept, as i had done once with another experience. i believe they dont take things serious like this, and i dont want to come across as mentally unstable in any way. even to fill this out again is uncomfortable, the last thing i need is to look like an attention seeking type, that iam not.I want to note the objects were easy to see with my eyes, but they didnt show on my camera view even though i could still see them. iam not sure if these objects would be viewable in daylight,or not. the objects were still in the sky when i left for my home.This is the second time i have seen strange objects, and in the same area as once before. i never expected to see anything like this. i immediately contacted a mufon investigator as soon as i got home, because i had a number i kept. i think it would be vital for someone to look into the area where this happened,and spend time videotaping as many hours as possible, days, or night. i just feel that it is strange. iam 41 yrs. old and ive never experienced things like this my whole life until recent.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the light and noticed that not only was it moving, but it was changing colors as well.  my friend was trying to watch the light (which appeared to have changed to a green color) and drive at the same

light.  the coler became so bright it was difficult to look at, and then it disappeared completely.  the sky was absolutely beautiful and clear without a cloud in sight.  whatever we had been looking at completely vanished in less than a second while we were watching it.  as this was our second encounter with an unknown \"something\" in the sky on i-10 in between el paso and san antonio (the other

just a few reports of booms and lights in the sky of many across the world.\r\nwell people i have been doing some research on this subject and it seems most of the booms\r\n are being caused my ufo craft.\r\nthere are many witnesses that claim they saw a craft flying low and slow and all of a sudden\r\n took off at incredable speed with a flash and tremendious boom noise behind.\r\n\r\nthere has also been reports from argentina of a police officer who was sent out to a rural area\r\n to check out some lights in the area and came across a ufo ship in the road with three beings standing next to the ship\r\nthey took him for a short past a corn field where a very strange creature was eating corn and showed him a few things then brought him back to his motorcycle and when the craft departed he said it flashed or clapped like thunder with a huge boom as it left in the blink of an eye.\r\nthere many other simular reports so i think most of these mysterious reports of booms maybe those same ships are visiting those areas.\r\nwhat we now need is for someone to setup a video camara to capture one of the ships taking off with the flash and boom on it. then we can show everyone what the cause of this is. \r\nhope this helps answer some questions.\r\n\r\nif you do a google search for booms heard or mysteries lights with booms you will see so many reports that i did not list here. i'll let you know if i came up with any videos.\r\n\r\ndo your own research and see what comes up.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10605,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6828226,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04292008-0011","longitude":-85.4271952,"occurred":1208934000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1208934000000,"summary":"Booms

weekend of golfing. this year, i decided to bring along my camera and take some shots of the houses along a golf course for my fianc��� while we were playing golf on friday, april 18th, 2008.\r\n\r\nthe timestamp on the two pictures is 3:47:22 pm est and 3:47:26 pm est, so 4 seconds apart. as you can see in the pictures, a black object is in the distance in both. i don't know what it is but i recall seeing pictures from other people that look similar to these pictures i've taken. this made me submit this for examination.\r\n\r\ni first noticed the object not when i was taking the picture, but after i put them on my computer a couple days ago which came as a surprise to me.\r\n\r\ni also have 2 other pictures with this same object in them. i will gladly forward them if they are wanted for review.\r\n\r\nthe images are authentic, no cropping, photoshopping or image clarifying were done to them. they were shot with a canon powershot 8.0 mp digital camera. \r\n\r\nalso, i took around 45 other photos on that day and days prior to and the object was not seen in any of these besides the 2 other pictures i referred to earlier.\r\n\r\ntake a look and i hope someone can give me

on the lake.\r\n\r\nas we were going over the small wooden bridge, back to the parking lot to return to our car, i saw a white orb, descend from the sky, in mostly a perpendicular position to the horizon.  it was moving at about the speed of a shooting star, at least at first, which i have seen many other times.  it was a very dark night, and clear, so i was looking up at the stars, and noticed movement, directly above and in front of us.  i would not be able to calculate a distance for the object.  however, at first we all thought it was a shooting star.  however, i never saw any type of tail from the orb, and thought that that was very peculiar.  when i have seen shooting stars in the past, they all had some sort of a tail behind them that glowed with some other colors.\r\nthis orb had no tail, and it seemed to slow down as it got closer to the horizon line.  the orb seemed to shift its path slightly to the east/right very slightly as it slowed down above the horizon.  the orb disappeared into the dark horizon line in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10601,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6740274,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04292008-0007","longitude":-81.5134935,"occurred":1207886700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1207886700000,"summary":"Saw

recall the exact shape. after a view seconds or a minute (plain was already gone) a second object (same look) aproached from the right side, it apears to be smaller and was faster and it somehow flew around the first object like it interacts with the other. i called my girlfrind to look into the teleskope so she can see it aswell she confirmes the objects to be strange. i was not visible without the teleskope and so i had no way taking pictures. as the objects where unspectaculare and due to the fact it is taff to look through the teleskope for a long time (bend down) i lost interest. after investigating online much later i found the objects to be matching the pictures a nasa astronaut took in the orbit. \r\n\r\ni'm sorry for my english (i'm german)\r\n\r\npersonly i think all evidance

felt it was really happening and was able to do a reality check and determined i was indeed \"really there\" but in a semi-trance state, unable to really react or speak.  \r\n\r\ni found myself inside a \"craft\" of sorts.  it was dimly lit, i was standing in front of a series of screens or projectors, like a 360 degree oval room covered in these screens.  the entire \"world / universal history\" was playing out over these screens.  i saw the beginning of the universe, the cultivation and population of many planets, and the subsequent fall of many unfamiliar civilizations.  it was though i was being \"caught up\" on where we are in the universe today.  after i saw all this, then i was shown our own earth.  it was beautiful, so real i could almost touch it.  seeing animals, people, flowers, natural wonders, all so beautiful it almost brought tears to my eyes.  and then seeing decay, destruction, a sense of \"impending doom\" was there, it made me very afraid, i realized that i was being shown, humans are making a big mistake, we are messing things up.  i was not one to be environmentally conscious prior to this event.  but seeing the world crying out in pain and agony.  and having a \"guide\" or character dimly identifying \"her\"self to me through thought alone (no words were spoken, but i understood \"her\" name was \"mother eve\" and she had something important to do with the orignial population of the earth as we know it, she cared about the earth and wanted me to see this, because \"i was ready and of an open mind to accept this message\").  she was probably the same height as me (5'3\") and though the room was darkened i made out she had blue/green/gray skin and very large black/brown eyes which she fixed upon me very solemnly and seriously, i felt a gravity of emotion and communication being transmitted between those eyes and my entire entity.  there was saddness and fear and hope and love but no ill will or any kind of malevolent (sp) or bad vibes.  anyways i was shown how all will eventually cease to exist as we know it, but some will survive, there is a \"cleansing\" going on and things are being done by our very gov't, but i don't remember that part now.  the gov't was something to be looked at with suspicion, is all i can gather, not to be trusted wholeheartedly but to be questioned and viewed with skepticism.  i was told to prepare myself and my family, to learn about self-sufficiency and radical survival methods, to be prepared for a cataclysmic \"shift\" of types, and to be open minded and expecting of further contacts.  then i feel like i was molecularly swirled in a blender as it were, into blackness, and when i \"awoke\" it was like \"we now return you to your scheduled show\" and i was in the middle of a normal dream, which i awoke from and realized i was indeed still in the house and where i had laid down, but i was on my back (not a position i ever consciously choose to sleep in).  there was a red light outside

as such it is the ���only��� hawaiian island that does not allow water skiing, jet skis or even parasailing in most areas. we just happened to be in a very secluded area where there wasn���t anything behind her when i took the shot. the shots you see here are the three consecutive frames i took. in them you can see the wave cresting behind her as they were all taken within a second all at once. the anomaly appears in only the middle frame, and then it���s just gone. \r\n\r\nnow while i don���t want to claim it is anything because i didn���t see it with my own eyes, i don���t know what it could be. i would invite anyone to look at the photo, untouched and yet still bewildering to me and see if you can make sense of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nlocation: kauai, hi tunnels beach\r\n\r\n\r\njames chavez (photographer)\r\njulia slusar (pictured)\r\n\r\ncamera, jvc everio full hd camera\r\nresolution is 1980 x 1080i\r\nsport setting on the shutter \r\nauto mode\r\nstored internally on a 60 gig hdd\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":10592,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":22.2091729,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04282008-0017","longitude":-159.445497,"occurred":1208685600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hawaii","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1208685600000,"summary":"Mysterious photograph","tags":["photo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10592_submitter_file1__PIC_0293.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10592_submitter_file2__PIC_0294.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10592_submitter_file3__PIC_0295.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Princeville, Hawaii","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:376649"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Iowa City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am reporting this for my nervous friend. he is a uniformed officer of the law in iowa city, iowa. if someone needs to contact him they need to contact me first. the event took place at 117am on april 25th 2008. he was on his usual night patrol in an area he and i and many other patrol often. the spot was at the corner of scotts blvd and muscatine in iowa city. he was stationary in his car near goodwill warehouse 3825 and looked up in the sky to see a silent yet inteligent light in the sky moving in unidentified motions. he was able to take pictures which strangely resemle others online. at first i thought he was pranking me until i happened to see the goodwill warehouse in one of the pictures. i have three pictures attached, and he took 14 total.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10591,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6611277,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04282008-0016","longitude":-91.5301683,"occurred":1209111420000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1209111420000,"summary":"Intelligent light formations","tags":["contact"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10591_submitter_file1__HPIM0262.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10591_submitter_file2__HPIM0266.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10591_submitter_file3__HPIM0268.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Iowa City, Iowa","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:376650"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Dublin","country":"Ireland","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"         distance to object unknown;height unknown. silent,slow,straight-line motion in approx. nnw direction-away from me. it did not seem to be an aircraft,fixed-wing or rotor. while its` speed may approximate that of a satellite, it was still daylight,and, i think,too low to be one, so satellite unlikely;hot-air balloon also unlikely(no basket visible through binoculars;

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My sister and i, one other high school girl, and our pastor were traveling home from a church youth meeting in valley city, n.D., and headed toward litchville, n.D. it was a clear, crisp night. it was either late fall or early spring because my mother, who was waiting for us by the church when we arrived in litchville, had the heater on in her car and complained about having to run her heater while she waited for us. i also remember that there were no leaves on the trees. based on my memory of the weather, i believe it was fall. it was a crisp, crystal clear night. i remember the blackness of the sky and the stars shining in the sky. my sister and i were seated in the back seat, she on the left, i on the right. the other girl was in the passenger seat in the front. the pastor was driving. we were near hastings, n.D., on highway 1 when i glanced out the left passenger window and saw a silver metallic disk rise noiselessly from behind a small grove of deciduous trees. i could see lights through the trees, and suddenly the lights began to rise. then, there it was, a ufo hovering just above the trees, which were not very tall, as many north dakota trees are. the disc hung there, not moving, silent. i exclaimed, \"there's a ufo!\" my sister and i observed it with great excitement. the other girl refused to look or to acknowledge in any way what was happening. she continued to stare straight ahead through the windshield. as we watched, the disc moved laterally, stopping over the car, no more than 30 feet above us, to our left and a little ahead of us. it was shiny and metallic, but more of a dull shine, not like silver. the bottom half looked like a shallow bowl. the top half looked like an inverted shallow bowl, but there was a higher dome in the middle. there were red and green flashing lights alternating around the edge of the rim, where the \"bowls\" met. my recollection is that there also were white flashing lights, but at this date, 40 years later, i cannot recall the exact configuration of these. there also were windows visible in the higher raised dome, and there was a glow of light from inside the ufo's interior. as we traveled along the highway, it kept perfect pace with us, and my sister and i crowded together in her window and craned our necks to watch it. i could see the clear silhouettes of figures backlit in some windows. in one window, it appeared like several figures were standing together, as though they were trying to get a good look at us. \"they're watching us,\" i said. i also remember saying to my sister that the figures were shorter than us (i am 5'4\") because the dome was low. the figures looked grayish, and their their heads looked big compared to their bodies and arms. the windows were tall enough that i could see their heads, their torsos, and part of their legs. i remember saying, \"look at how short they are!\" at that time, i had read the book, \"the interrupted journey,\" and i was very interested in ufos. i could not believe that i was actually seeing one so close. i remember saying, \"maybe they want to make contact with us.\" this was a very exciting thought to me. i remember saying that i wanted to open the window and acknowledge them in some way. the pastor, who had not commented at all while my sister and i were watching the ufo and exclaiming over it, sharply ordered, \"don't you dare!\" he said he was just going to keep going the same speed, that we should ignore it, and we were to do nothing to attract attention. despite his warning, my sister and i continued to huddle at her window, staring up at the ufo and the figures in the windows. it followed us for several miles, with the pastor driving at a steady speed and staring straight ahead. as we neared the tiny town of hastings, n.D., the ufo suddenly rose up and sped off at an angle to our right and accelerated at an astonishingly high rate of speed, disappearing to a small distant light in the sky in mere seconds. i remember exclaiming over how amazingly quickly it flew away. i was very excited about the experience and kept talking about how i couldn't believe we had just seen what we did. i pointedly asked the girl in the front, \"_________, can you believe we saw that?!\" she replied, without turning around, \"i didn't see anything.\" my sister and i just looked at each other and rolled our eyes. when we arrived in litchville and stopped at the church, my sister and i could hardly wait to get out of the car and talk to our mother, who was waiting for us. the pastor sharply ordered us not to get out until he talked to us. he ordered us not to speak one word of what had just happened. he specifically told us we were not to tell our parents about it. i argued with him a little, and said we should be able to tell the truth. he said that people would think he was crazy if anyone heard about this and that if we told anyone what we had seen and that he was with us, \"i will deny it.\" even though this happened 40 years ago, it is still vivid in my memory. at that time, in the late 1960s, few people talked about seeing ufos. of course, my sister and i immediately told our mother the whole story. she believed us and told us she had often wondered about lights she had seen in the sky near a farm about 1/4 mile away from ours. as for the other girl, i do not think i ever talked to her about it again, and i certainly did not talk to the pastor about it. i will never forget being that close to a ufo and seeing it so clearly. it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,
