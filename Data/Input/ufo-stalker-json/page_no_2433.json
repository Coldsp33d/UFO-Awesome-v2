stars as usual on a beautiful night and was shocked to see 4 star-like objects in a beautiful red-orange color just hanging there in the sky in front and above me - i could not figure out what they were - i thought they might be some strange balloons that were lit up or something - i couldn not see the outline of the abjects because it was night and they were very bright - they were just hovering for about a minute.  they were spaced an exact distance apart from each other - they maintained that same spatial relationship as they started to glide across the sky coming from the northeast and going southwest in a sort of arc pattern-- one more set followed and then a single one came along - they disappeared into the sky as if someone had turned out the lights - there was no sound whatsoever and they glided rather than flew and always maintained the same space betwen them as they traveled - i ran inside and got a family member to see them because i could not believe my eyes and wanted proof that what i was seeing was real - i was very nervous viewing this because it was like nothing else i could imagine and i was almost afraid to continue looking - it felt like i was being viewed! it was mesmerizing - i did not have a camera and did not want to quit watching and go in the house to get one in case they disappeared before i got back.  it is an experience i will never forget!  i have not been able to find out if anyone else beside us saw the event.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10586,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4031612,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04282008-0011","longitude":-105.0681801,"occurred":1209356100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1209356100000,"summary":"Total

the side of the house/windows on the second story, which made me look back and up at the sky.  there was no noise, they were low enough to be under the cloud cover that night, and they moved really fast, (saw them for maybe 4 seconds before they were here and gone).  there was no light trail behind the lights, and they all the sudden went out as opposed to disappearing on the

saw a ufo over antioch california it was a row of lights in a ���v��� formation. it flew vary slowly and was between 15 to 10 thousand feet hi but was defiantly on the horizon. since then i���ve tracked several unexplained things in the night sky. two bright light traveling east, glowing objects in orbit. but all were possible experimental aircraft, and being a sentence nerd/ good american, i would never report it. \r\n \r\nhowever, i could no longer hold it in any longer. it���s been seen allover the u.S. lately, and i am tired of it. this year on 01/01/2008 at 12:00am i was outside with my household,in antioch, friends and nabobs. where we saw the red/organ lights in the sky, at first i thought they were signal flairs because it was new years eve and it sounded like a war zone outside. they started in a start line and then moved there was about six of them they formed a fimular shape the big dipper. they started then to move in a vertical line one above the other. one went left and then came back now the row was not horizontal it was vertical. now the strange part they merged with each other yes six lights became one and then simply disappeared. while this was going on a privet plane was in the sky i wonder if they saw it to. thank god iam ont the only one who saw

caught my eyes. it's really hard to say what made me notice.( because the lights weren't that bright( sometimes when cars turn the corner they might have their high beams on and it reflects on my living room and i automatically turn to see.  within 3 to 5 seconds the object caught my attention again and this time it was closer. i wouldn't swear to it but i kinda think it took a slight but deliberate turn towards my house (maybe because i had gotten up to look out the window). three to four seconds later it was coming towards my house.  now i could see the shape as it came closer. i was able to (only able ) to see the bottom and the outline (shape) . here goes!  for some reason it reminded me of a manta ray but rounded . this is why i am filing this report.   on the bottom of the object as it flew over , there were a total of five lighted bars in three rows. the first row = 1 horizontal white illuminated bar  -   the second row  = 3 vertical blue illuminated bars  -   the third row = 1 horizontal red illuminated bar.  as i am seeing this , i thought if i ever have to remember or want to remember this , i will never remember the proper sequence of colors  but i will remembers that there were 3 rows and their breakdown.   the only other thing i have to say is .  i am very familiar with planes (all kinds) helicopters etc.   oh and when if came over my house , if i had been on the roof  i would have been able to touch it or come really close to touching.  i scanned your data base hopeing i would discover what it was.   my feelings then and now  / were/are   nothing to be afraid of and those rows (i just remembered that the rows might have changed colors because i reread what i wrote above and i didn't include green) i hope this object is common and that

hard pressed to put into i words what my son and i saw without being able to draw it but about six to eight weeks ago we saw two lights that described a repeated pattern and then vanished.  initially i didn't even see the lights, i'm 53 and my son is 16, they were so dim or distant. but as i looked at the part of the sky that my son directed me to it became very clear but still very dim as if you were looking at a distant star. as close as i can describe the incident it was as if one very dim light very high up and or far away would move in a semi-circular manner ahead of the other light and then the second one would catch up to it and then the first light would repeat the semi circular motion. if you were to hold your hand at arms length the circle described would have been no larger than the tip of your little finger or slightly smaller. they repeated this pattern at least a half dozen times in a very regular and exact manner.  i thought how extraordinary that we were witnessing this strange event and yet it didn't seem unreasonable in the sense that there are any number of satellites and i'm sure experimental vehicles that have a terrestrial origin.  and then something that really defied the norm ocurred.  the first light described the semi circle that it had been making but the second light did not come up to meet it.  both lights just paused in place and then after a few seconds, maybe 5 or 6, the first light went back to the second light and joined with it and they just sort of dimmed out and vanished.  i turned to my son and asked if he had seen the whole thing and he said he had and we agreed that we had witnessed something beyond our ability to explain.  i've lived on the northshore of kauai for over 25 years and i've seen and heard some very strange things but noting to match this.\r\ni'd be interested in hearing if anybody has ever reported to have seen anything like what we saw.\r\n","distance":"Over One

colorado springs. \r\n\r\nit was a beautiful day and i was out collecting pop bottles when for no reason i looked up. and about 1/2 mile up, i noticed there were (3) of them and looked like two nickels stacked on top of one another spinning with a red static glow around it., two were stationary and the other was moving around, like it was trying to position itself as if it was looking at something. \r\n\r\nmoments later, all three objects shot straight up higher from my view - about another mile and hovered there for about 20-30 minutes. i just stood there mesmerized by it. then i started having this sinking fear feeling. then a man came up to me and asked me what i was looking at - i looked at him for just a moment and when i looked back up, the objects were even further up, then they suddenly vanished - like as if you turned off a light...Blink, they were gone. i never saw them again until i saw a show about the ufos that appeared over mexico city during an eclipse - i believe it was in 1993. they looked just like what i saw in '77 -- 16 years earlier.  it just blew me away! it was really cool seeing them again -- and caught on film.\r\n\r\nthat same summer, my class had an encounter with something while we were all at camp at camp shady brook. (i dont remember where that place is - somewhere west of the springs in the mountains) one night (around 11pm) there was a scientist there with a telescope and we were all looking at the rings of saturn, and it was my understanding from mrs, hall (my teacher) that this guy was from norad - and he was there to teach us some astronomy. when it was my turn to look at saturn, i noticed a light (fuzzy glow) off in the distance that was coming towards us and seemed very low -- no more than 50ft above the tops of the trees. it was moving very slow, and had no sound. i asked mrs, hall - \"what is that?\" she said it was a plane. i thought to myself that it was flying way too low to be a plane. as it got right on us (about 100 yards away) it stopped, and so did we -- it got very quite, even the crickets stopped chirping.\r\n\r\nthen the object suddenly made a 90������ turn and started going east. it was moving very slow (no sound) it looked like a fuzzy tennis ball - with a soft white glow with no details to it. moments later it started to move upwards at a 45������ angle. the it started speeding up, and then it took off like 300 miles an hour, then even faster like a shooting star at that same 45������ angle -- straight back up into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\ni turned around to asked that guy (from norad) -- what just happened, what was that???  he was gone! he had raced down the hill back to his car and drove off -- leaving his telescope behind.\r\n\r\nthe weird part about all of this -- no one thought that anything unusual had just happened - of course, we were all only 6th graders.... what do we know. but i was very observant of the event. when we got back to the city - i couldn't understand why no one wanted to talk about it. i was bugging mrs, hall about it - so being the artist that i am, she told me to draw a picture of it -- so i did... i made a very detailed storyboard. the next day, some man showed up and asked me if he could have the drawing.... so i gave it to him. he explained to me that it was a helicopter, and that was the end of that.  mmmmm -- that was a very quite helicopter! the man took my drawing and left. mrs. hall told me to never talk about it again or i would be disciplined. so, i never gave it much thought after that - plus, as a 6th grader, i got distracted and moved on to something else anyway. but i never forgot about it, and its something i still think about to this day. \r\n\r\ni dont know why i feel compelled to talk about this now -- maybe because i think about it so much, i just have to share it and maybe someone else out there can relate.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10579,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8389816,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04282008-0004","longitude":-104.8120134,"occurred":240476400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":240476400000,"summary":"There were (3) and looked two nickels stacked on top of one another spinning with a red static glow around it.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Colorado Springs, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:377567"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Colorado Springs","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I've had two sightings -- \r\n\r\nit was the summer 1977 - i was in the 6th grade at the time and living in colorado springs. \r\n\r\nit was a beautiful day and i was out collecting pop bottles when for no reason i looked up. and about 1/2 mile up, i noticed there were (3) of them and looked like two nickels stacked on top of one another spinning with a red static glow around it., two were stationary and the other was moving around, like it was trying to position itself as if it was looking at something. \r\n\r\nmoments later, all three objects shot straight up higher from my view - about another mile and hovered there for about 20-30 minutes. i just stood there mesmerized by it. then i started having this sinking fear feeling. then a man came up to me and asked me what i was looking at - i looked at him for just a moment and when i looked back up, the objects were even further up, then they suddenly vanished - like as if you turned off a light...Blink, they were gone. i never saw them again until i saw a show about the ufos that appeared over mexico city during an eclipse - i believe it was in 1993. they looked just like what i saw in '77 -- 16 years earlier.  it just blew me away! it was really cool seeing them again -- and caught on film.\r\n\r\nthat same summer, my class had an encounter with something while we were all at camp at camp shady brook.

turns into the sprain parkway at one point and i was right in the area of the switch over so i'm not totally sure if i was still on the taconic or if it turned into the sprain at this point.  to confirm a more exact location i lost site of the object right where the bronx river parkway connects to the taconic/sprain south.  anyway, as i was driving down the parkway i saw a bright white light come up over the tree line along side of the parkway.  at first i thought it was a plane but after a minute or two it seemed as if it was hovering in one spot.  the ufo proceeded to come towards the highway at a fairly slow speed until it came to a point of being directly over my car.  as i slowed down and began to look up at the ufo as it was above me, i still only saw a bright white light and no details of any kind of craft.  the craft continued to fly across the parkway (i believe coming from the southeast and heading northwest) and went out of site over the adjacent tree line.  what i can't recall exactly is how big the object was but it was certainly bigger than a car.  it was also high enough that it was above the trees but it was not much higher than the trees. i also noted at the time that there was no sound coming from the ufo like you would hear from a plane flying so closely overhead.  to add a twist to my experience, as the ufo began to leave my site my cell phone began to ring and it was my now ex - girlfriend.  the first thing i said to her was \"i think i just saw a ufo\" and she answered right back to me \"was it a big bright white light?\"  i replied to her \"yes how did you know that?\" and she proceeded to tell me how she just saw the same thing fly over the bronx river parkway.  unfortunately i was unable to pull over to take a better look because there were enough cars coming off of the bronx river ramp and it's a fairly dangerous intersection.  i could also kick myself because i had my digital camera in the car with me but was so amazed by what i was seeing that it didn't occur to me.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

state collete, pa.  it was still raining some and i was looking at the cool cloud formations.  i was looking towards the south (towards down town state college) when i saw a set of shapes, at first looked like a triangular formation of geese flying inside the clouds.  i watched them fly towards the down town area and did not think too much of it since we do see geese flying around here.  i did think it was strange that they were flying in the rain so i kept watching them.  again, nothing strange, maybe they do fly in the rain.  they were moving pretty slow inside the clouds and in a very straight triangle shape with one of the points leading the rest of the shapes.  there were about 15 shapes in the triangle, all whiter than the surrounding clouds and all moving perfectly in sync.  i did not see moving wings or irregular flying as is ussually the case with birds commonly seen in this area.  after about 5 minutes of watching them move closer to town, i saw something not common with birds flying in formation.  \r\n\r\nthe triangle stopped in mid air and spun 180 degrees and started flying exactly the same route in the opposite direction heading north.  the same point of the triangle was again in the front of the formation. that's when i thought there was something very uncommon with that experience.  i've never seen any birds do that, stop in mid air and rotate their formation in its center axis to head back in the opposite direction.  i'm no bird expert, but that looked strange.  i kept watching the objects heading north and when overhead, i did not see any wing movement or irregular flying, but the objects now looked more like part of a larger object which was of the same color as the clouds, with these whiter spheres (which is what i thought were birds) underneath.  i heard no sounds of birds like is ussually the case with geese, and no airplane sounds either.  i lost sight of the object(s) after several minutes of them heading north, north west

\"hey t. look, it looks like a flying saucer over there...\" over the treetops. he agreed. we stopped at convenience store and he went in. while he was there, i looked acroos the tree through a samll grove a trees and saw several fireball like lights apparently blinking, growing large and smaller, coming closer and getting smalloer as the moved backwards, apparently floating around like fish in an aquarium, pulsating blue, purple, pink, red. not much yellow or gree colors. then t. came back to the car and i pointed them out. he agreed that they certainly did look strange. then we drove up around the corned and went through the drive through atm at the credit union so i could get some cash. then we drove south a few blocks, mad a short series turns, right, left, right--and drove a few more blocks. \r\n\r\njust when we were to turn left to go to my apartment off of culebra road, i looked up in the sky where i had seen the craft before. i said \"look t. is the flying saucer again...Turn right!\" no...I gotta get back\" i argued, \"t...Turn this gd car right right now!!!\" (usually we drove my car, but this time we were in my friend ts car, a small white chevy,  so it was strange that i was demanding where we should go)we drove about 1 block north toward a large radio antennae....Look! we saw several elliptical disc-shaped apparent crafts, just the lights but no actual metal bodies. the lights pulsated left-right-left-right..., colored pink, red, purple, blue, pink (i saw no bright  orange or yellowish colors and no bright lime greens) i have an art degree, and good at drawing and painting, so i noticed this...The \"ships\" floated around, first i saw 2-3, then number increased to 6-7.....They changed forms from ether /fireballs to the long elliptical/disc shaped crafts....And then back again.... they soundlessly moved precisely like fish in an aquarium- up and down, left to right and back again, backwards-forwards and back again. their altitude was about as high as a 8-10 story building and fluctuating higheer and lower. at one point, one did descend to the groand and then back up again to the original height of an 8 story building.  the length of all the crafts together was 1/2 mile or so. fluctuated between the craft-like shape and the bright, glowing, ehter balls pulsating those red-blue-pink-purple colors.\r\n\r\n after about 90 seconds or two minutes or so of this, they all reverted to one large fireball---it lifted in the sky to the northwest---over the ingram mall. it moved very quickly and moved with no sound at anytime. t. and i were speechless and dumbfounded, he said he had to get back to my apartment as he was expecting a call. i was afraid to report the sightings...But then i read about the sightings in stephensville in january or february 2007. my sighting seems related. the things i saw moved in the direction of the texas hill country, where stephensivlle is located. \r\n\r\nwhat me and t saw, was over a large vacant area of land, near the radio tower, just about 1 mile south of ingram mall. i wondered why nobody else in the area seemed to report this or see it. i heard about nothing like it until stephensville report.  the objects i saw were nothing like the many different types of aircraft i see flying around s. san antonio regularly.\r\n  we had a friend in the back seat of the car. i yelled at him repeatedly to look but he refused because he was sleeping. i was sitting in the passenger side of the front seat throught these incidents. there was a ceiling of gray clouds that evening, but

related.\r\n\r\ni can't say the objects i've seen were \"other-worldly\" in nature, but they were certainly strange.  i've witnessed both flying in the same area from my backyard over the last couple of months.  details below...\r\n\r\na couple of months back i was sitting in my backyard late at night.  something bright and fast (i mean, really fast) moving at a high altitude caught my eye.  it was a bright dot that moved across the sky.  way too fast for a satellite.  could have been a meteor, but i've never seen one last so long, and with no trail whatsoever.  plus, i'd swear it's movement was somehow erratic.  a perfectly straight line yes, but not one hundred percent smooth in its \"motion\".  i'm not a trained observer, but i've seen my share of meteors.  i really don't think this was one of them.  it went from one end of the sky all the way to the other before disappearing over the horizon.  a very long distance.  it accomplished this in about two, maybe two and a half seconds.  although i found the sight fascinating, i didn't put too much stock into it.  then a week or so ago, again sitting in my backyard late at night, i saw a similar object flying in the same area, and in the same direction.  this time, however, it was much lower.  it moved about the speed of a plane.  in fact, i figured it was just that as we live close to the burbank airport, but it's path did not match what usually flies in/out of the area.  too high and going the wrong way.  what was most curious about the object was that it had no blinking lights or headlights and it made no sound whatsoever.  we've become very familiar with planes in our six months living in this house, and they all have had the usual lights/sounds.  we see a lot of helicopters too.  definetely wasn't that.  i kept an eye on the object for about 30-45 seconds and then, very suddenly, it was gone.  just gone.  it didn't blink out.  it simply stopped \"being there\".  not sure i can completely describe it, but if it were a plane, i've never heard one that silent, or seen one with no federally required hazard lights/headlights, nor have i seen one turn all its lights out in the dark in a heavilly frequented air traffic zone.  it was there, and then it wasn't.  \r\n\r\ncould be nothing, but i don't often seen strange things in the sky.  now, in the span of about a month or two, i've seen two.  both in the same spot in the sky (though at different altitudes), and both heading the same way.  east, over the mountains above old town burbank.  i've never reported anything like this before, and i don't know how credible you might find it, but i figured i would just suggest you guys keep an eye out for other reported sightings in the burbank/san fernando valley area.  weird stuff.\r\n\r\nthank you.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

saw it back in march. earlier this evening at 8:00pm 10:23pm i was out side on the porch with my daughter and periodically i would go and check if it was there or not it wasn't so after the mosquitos came out we went inside and i put my daughter to bed. well at 11:35ish my neibors daughter and her friend was back out side being really loud so i went back out side to tell them to keep it down and i went to the end of the porch to check and it was back. i stayed out there watching it till 12:20 pm the mosquitos were eating my feet up so i came inside to report it this time it is approximately in the same place but i would say if i put a measuring tape up towards the sky it would measure about an inch and a half(1.5\") over to the right. from were it was the last time i saw it. but this time it is triple the size it was last time so i am assuming that means it is closer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

seen.  a silver (keg shaped) object hovering motionless 3/4 up from the horizon. we all scrambled away from the table and out onto the deck.  lots of confusion and questions from the kids saying, \"uncle,xxx what is that?\". we watched the object for about two minutes. i went in to grab my 12x optical zoom cam-corder and when i came out and got it ready to shoot the object just disappeared.  it literaly just vanished. this object was seen by 5 people and all recollect the account and visual the same. we were all confused by what we had seen and i was in complete astonishment. i've watched the ufo type shows and always felt it possible, but after witnessing a ufo first hand, i'm no longer a skeptic. it boggles my mind to understand this and image has been burned into my mind forever.
