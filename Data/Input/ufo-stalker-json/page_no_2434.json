was at a friends house last night (26, april, 2008), at about roughly 4:00am i decided to go outside in his backyard for a cigarette, my friend came out with me also. as we were having a chat we noticed a bright green flash like thunder without the noise just above some clouds (very thin cloud cover) to the north of us.\r\n\r\nwe thought that was strange but quickly got over it and went back inside.\r\n\r\nabout a half an hour later (4:30am) i went outside to his backyard alone for a cigarette, as im standing there just looking around i noticed what looked like a plane flying low to the ground (a bit above the tree tops) it had strangely bright white and red flashing lights which were constantly blinking at a fast rate and did not make a single sound, i didn't really get to see a shape or anything as it was dark. but it was a rather large aircraft.\r\n\r\nit came from the west (dandenong) and travelled towards the east (doveton-narre warren area) it was moving at a rather slow pace, 10 minutes must have gone past before i called my friend out to have a look, he came out then quickly ran inside to get the binoculars.\r\n\r\nhe had a look and told me to quickly look as it started to pick up abit of a pace. when i looked through the binoculars i saw what appeared to be two sets of lights arranged in a triangular pattern at a bit of a distance from one another, the lights were coloured orange/red and were flickering.\r\n\r\ni also saw a faint dark outline of the craft while looking through the binoculars, it was long and somewhat narrow with a thicker middle area.\r\n\r\nit picked up abit of speed then i lost sight of it as it moved behind some trees.\r\n\r\ni was curious of this object after seeing the intense bright flashing colours, then i was stunned and somewhat shocked after seeing it through the binoculars.\r\n\r\nmy impression is that this thing was not a manmade craft, the way it moved and looked just had this otherworldly vibe to it.\r\n\r\nthis happened in victoria, australia over the suburb of dandenong.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

arrive at work a little before 11pm every night tues-sat. this was the night of friday april 18th 2008 between the time frame of 10:30pm and 11:00pm. i was on us-10 past aurburn, mi but before the m-84 exit to go to my place of work in bay city, mi. i saw out of the driver side window over an open field what i thought was a plane with is landing lights on. there is an airport close to the area. mbs international airport (midland, bay city, saginaw international airport). i saw the craft which never got more than (best i can tell) 100-150ft off from the ground. when i first saw the craft it was turning right toward the highway with 3 very bright lights lighting the air in front of the craft it was so bright i could see the beams distinctly for a good distant in front of it. as it turned the lights became not as bright and the craft actually flew right over my car or as i was on the high was going 70 mph it would be fair to say i drove under it. the craft was not moving very fast and i was able to watch it for some time as i drove away. when i got behind it i could only see the two back lights of the craft and i could see it was very thin. i was looking for every sign i could to prove it was a plane. i am no expert but, i was looking to make out wings and a tail on the craft. i know for certain there was no tail and it was to the best of my eye sight (which i do not where any prescription contacts or glasses) a solid triangular object. i was in awe and i foolishly did not turn off my radio nor roll my window down to listen for any sound that may or may not have been coming from this craft. i was very excited just to see something like this. i was not completely convinced at what i had saw and i did not tell anyone because most would think since i have been doing so much research into the subject i just saw what i wanted too. that all changed the next night at work when a friend of mine came to see me. we were just catching up a bit when he started to tell me a story of what he tried to take a picture of with his cell phone before he could describe it i interrupted him and described what he saw for him. to his amazement i was dead on to what he was going to say. he saw what i think to be the same craft as i did the night but after. his sighting happened closer to midland, mi. he was coming over the over pass on us 10 which over laps eastman rd in midland, mi. the best time he could give me was between 10pm and 11pm. there is also an airport in the midland, mi. it is very small and it is not for commercial aircraft. the picture he took unfortunately showed nothing.

apartment. 3 minutes later she calls me and tells me to look at the sky. the sky was pink and green in away that i had never seen before or after. there was a huge central cloud that was totally dark in the center which looked to me like some huge mothership was behind it. while on the phone with my mom i noticed that there was this stuff in front off my face everywhere. it is almost impossible to describe. i describe it as some sort of enery waves of electrical charges that looked like half a dime sized bubbles. they were everywhere and when i waved my hand in front off my face the stuff remained and to me it seemed that it blended with the air like atoms or something. at that time i asked my mom if she saw the stuff in front of her face and she said yes and that it was an irradescent color. the color of the bubbles/sparks to me seemed light blue. my dad was at work and i gave him a call. he too saw the stuff in front of his face though he says it was a greenish color. my mom was about a mile away from me and my dad about 10 miles yet we all saw the bubbles. during this time i had noticed that planes were fyling over my apartment complex way closer than i had ever seen. throughout the time i was standing outside i also noticed that close to 200 birds were flying the opposite way of they clouds. at his work,my dad also saw all the birds flying away from the clouds. then the strangest thing occured. coming out from the central cloud was a fireball/amber light/golden sequin moving at an incredibly impoosible rate just zig zagging throughout the sky with such speed and such ease and moving in a way that i had never seen. to me it almost seemed like it was a scouting. after about a minute of the strange fireball darting around the sky in then dissapeared behind the cloud in the exact same place it had first appeared out of. i know it was extraterrestrial because of the speed and angles of which this ship demonstrated. but the thing that got me the most was the stuff in front of my face. i've watched alot of ufo shows since this event but have never heard anyone say anything about the bubbles i saw. for this reason i wanted to put my story out there and if anyone has seen that stuff in front there face or has any ideas of what it was please let me know.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

launch spot on sam rayburn reservoir in east texas near a small town named zavalla. he was driving and i was in the passenger seat of his el camino. the road was long and straight and i was remarking about the incredible brightness of the star on the low horizon ahead. soon i realized that what we were seeing was certainly not a star, but was an incredibly fast approachiong object. i immediately told my friend to stop the car. we both got out and stood beside the car as the objects passed over us at an incredible rate of speed at an estimated altitude of 1000 to 3000 feet. certainly low enough to get a totally unobstructed view.  what we saw was one large spherical glowing object with a pronounced fiery tail, plus three smaller spherical glowing objects, sans tails, that were flying in a triangular formation beside the larger spherical object. they were flying totally silent. my friend looked at me with this shocked look on his face and asked, \"what in the hell was that?\"  i responded truthfully that i was as shocked as he was.  we both agreed that due to the incredible unearthly experience that we just had, that we would not tell any of our coworkers, lest they would think perhaps we were fabricating stories.  we continued to our launch sight just a mile or so down the road and encountered several other fishermen who were just as perplexed as we were with what had just transpired.\r\n\r\n   the next morning as i was reading the local newspaper, the beaumont enterprise, lo and behold on the front page of the paper was a report of the same ufo sighting by thousands of people across the southern us. at least i hadn't been dreaming.

truck, inside of a tent we made out of a sheet and a broom stick. we would come out every now and then when it would get too hot inside the tent. i was the first one to come out, and i turned around facing my house, and the field that was behind my house. i saw this big v-shaped object with 15 lights on it, and it was low. i was startled by it, so i couldnt yell for brittney...I couldnt get my voice above a whisper...And i told her \"come out quick...Hurry hurry...Come look\" and she crawled out of the tent and saw it. we stood on the back of my dads truck watching this thing. it didnt really make much of a sound, but we could feel our chest vibrating, and barely hear a low humming. it was way to quiet to be a helicopter, and it was just hovering there. then to top it all off, it made this weird noise...Kind of a mechanical sound i guess...I dont know how to compare it. it separated, and a piece of this thing shot off in every direction...Like north, south, east, west, and one went straight up. it happened so fast. one of the pieces went right over our heads, and we could hear the air rushing around it, but the object itself made absolutely no sound. when we turned around nothing was there....If we had blinked when all this was happening we would have missed the whole thing. we turned as fast as we could to see where this thing went, but it was too quick. the pieces that shot off had 3 lights a piece. \r\n i have never been able to explain this, and havent really talked about it to anyone other than family. right after it happened, brittany and i ran inside, and started yelling to my mom and dad about what we had seen. i was shaking like a leaf...We knew we had just seen a ufo, and that it couldnt have been anything man made. my mom called the airport, and they said they had nothing on their radar, and no other reports of this thing. they suggested that it might have been helicopters, but had no reports of any air craft is the area at the time we reported this.\r\n i've been searching websites, ufo shows, eye witness accounts, everything i can, but so far nothing. i have so many questions, and thoughts, and it would be so refreshing to know that someone somewhere saw what it was that we saw. i've been searching for 10 years now.","distance":"101-500

sound, but i felt it more than i could actually hear it.  i only had an older sony digital camera with me, the batteries were almost dead, i snapped 4 pictures before the camera shut off, only one came out when i read the disk. i observed the aircraft until it vanished. it flew straight and level, i was unable to guage its size since i had no reference. but a best guess, since i have seen airliners fly over a couple of times early in the morning, i would say it was as big as a medium sized airliner, probably the size of the space shuttle. i know aircraft well, this did not look like anything i have seen out at nellis. it was very quiet, when an airliner flies over this lake, i hear it long before i can see it. this thing was already overhead when i heard it. it was flying southeast, as if it was on course to las vegas. one thing that was strange, just before i heard it, or felt it, i had a funny feeling that something was watching me, so i scanned the shorline thinking there was something watching me, then my exposed skin warmed up fast and only for 15 seconds as if i was hit with a microwave beam. almost enough to make me want to jump in the water. then i felt it and saw the exhaust trail and grabbed the camera cause it was a single contrail, larger than any airliner. the one shot that came out was at the cameras highest zoom, it is a 10x optical zoom. i was really reluctant of reporting this, the course it was on, well it flew over the most heaviest forested, least populated part of northern california. this thing left me with such a strange feeling that i packed up and sped home asap. i was scheduled to be on the lake through the weekend. now i don't think this thing is alien, but it is a ufo because i don't know what the hell it is.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10539,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9832011,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04252008-0010","longitude":-122.6997441,"occurred":1209020400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1209020400000,"summary":"Black

reason for being on the hill...I thought it would be fun to  take  photos of the lights of town at night. my camera is a 6.3 mpeg canon eos 10d. i took a few test photos, looked at them in the camera's monitor. everything seemed to be just great. i had the camera mounted on a tripod and i was using a shutter release. the sun had gone down but the clouds in the east still had some residual light on them, just perfect for great photos. my location was 385 miles due west of stephenvill, texas.\r\n   i took about 6 photos and started getting the feeling that i was being watched. i ignored the feeling and kept taking photos. i took 29 pixs in all then the feeling of danger, or something i can't explain was so great that i packed everything up, put it in the back of the pick up sat down in the drivers seat and locked the doors. i was going to tell my wife about my weird feeling, but there was no need. i could tell by the look on her face that she had had the same experience. the only thing different was...She never got out of the pick-up.\r\n   when i looked at the pix on the computer they were all under exposed and nearly totally black. this photo has been lightened in adobe ps and enhanced for clarity only. the bullet- missile object on the left of the photo has been considerably enlarged (see photo 2). this is only one photo of several that i took on oct. 06, 2007. i have returned to take more photos, i have not taken anything like this or the other photos. and everything that i have taken since has been correctly exposed. \r\n   photo 3(the orange object) has been

only visable for a few seconds and left its impression in my mind. it was 2am, i was straight, no drinking, no drugs.I thought about what i saw all the way home. when i got home i drew a picture of what i saw. i thought about it for awhile, and realized what i saw was only the left side of the craft, illuminated by the full moon. when i added the other half to the picture, it looked like a pile of donuts on top of each other, may be 3. the bottom one was large, the next one on top of it was a little smaller, and the third one on top a little smaller, looked like a saucer silver grey no lights, stationary.I called nasa to tell them what i had observed, they tried to tell me it was lightning, i told them i am 60 years old and no what lightning looks like. they told me i should be one
