terms)shaking up a crowd at a football game even. finally hit in upprt new york, i believe.Since the rain had stopped; i descided to roll(wheelchair traveler)down the street, a short two blocks, to the 7-11. to get a couple things i needed for breakfast, and maybe scratch a couple tickets for quick cash?(wishful thinking). as i turned to backup their steap ramp, to their doorlevel sidewalk, i noticed something strange, up in the sky in a gap between the clouds to the east. a nice lasy had pulled in,and parked. she walked around her car and asked if there was anything wrong?,i said i hope not, pointing to thegiant roll of \"lifesavers\",hhanging about a thousand feet,or so, over the potomac river to the east!.Several more people had gathered around; wondering what we were staring at, in the partlycloudy earlymorning sky, none had any idea what it was either. one man suggested that maybe \"marshal hall amusement park\", on the maryland side of the potomac,might be using a balloon to their finsl \"fallfest activities\", before they closed for the winter. when i pointed out that it would be in the \"landing approach area for national airport\", the idea of a \"tethered ad ballon\" was eliminated quickly. later,absolutely, as a 727 heading into national,to land,flew under this stack(the plane's tailfin reflecting the morningsun. showed the multicolor stack was about 70 feet tall,with 4-5 layers of colored bands). no blinking lights etc. not even metallic glare, only slightly rounded at the top and bottom, maybe 30-40 feet wide,side to side. this may be the answer to where the ufo's that hastled the capital etc., in 1952, vanished to as the jets,from dover afb, came on the scene!. they zoomed up and away then came back under the radar, stacked up quietly and hid in the woods till the jets left, then seperated and went back to their harrassing the capital fun!. what really bugged me, was the fact that my \"vhs camcorder\" would not work(even with the fullycharged batterypak, i had put in after dinner the nite before!)and opps!!, my lil'35 mm quicky still camera needed the one item seven-eleven did not sell, film!!. asking around the group(now 7-9 watchers!!) i found not one camera, of anykind, was available!. someone said\"oh it's going into the clouds\", not really however, the wind was blowing the clouds north to south. this giant\"lifesaver roll\" had not budged, for almost an hour and ahalf!. but, i had to leave at about 7:20 or so, i left for home,to fix  and eat breakfast, at last!. as i left, i noticeed the three \"watchers\" had grown to a crowd of 8 or 10; and the store manager said \"i don't know what it is?,but it's great for business\". his coffee and donuts were selling, like crazy, no one wanted to leave(and miss a plane knocking it out of the sky??). real disappointment was no reports in the news etc. just dozens of interviews, about the meteor,of the night before,after all it had upset a football game crowd!. several pilots, flying from europe to eastcoast cities, had seen it streak across the sky and gave \"noah\" an approximate location to where it  hit in new york. there had been no reports,or complaints,by pilots about an object being in the way as they approched \"washington national airport\"!!.. a majer question is why?!!, those congressional boobs on the hill seem to think the general public is satisfied with their dumb explinations of what we know, we are seeing more and more everyday/or night too. i know there must have been dozens more witness's, up and down the potomac river, from dc to mt.Vernon, many much closer than we were. maybe you can persuade them to come forward with their story and videos and/or pics. this is one occurence i, and many more, would like a good solid answer for... thankyou for any help, c.E.

the back yard. after we rang in the new year, i noticed some people at the party (kids and adults) looking up in the sky very puzzled. i decided to take a look for myself at what was catching everyones attention. my first thought was, how cool fire crackers. that thought only lasted for about five seconds and i watched the 5 bright redish-orange stars float from very low maybe 100 feet from the ground to the sky a few hundred feet higher never burning out like a fire cracker would. the star like objects seemed to change color from a bright redish to greenish to blue and back to red again. they also seemed to be flying in formation as they rotated around each other and occasionally seemed to blink off and on. i know for certain what we saw in the sky on new years was not a fire cracker, because i have watched many fire cracker shows and no fire cracker can stay in the air for over 10 minutes with out burning out. as we all cheered the ufo's in the sky i couldn't help but feel very excited and frightened at the same time. i realized that what ever was in the sky could cause great harm if it wanted to. but it seemed as though it was trying to give us a sign more than anything else by the way it was rotating and forming different circular and triangular formations. the objects eventually seemed to disappear from the sky one by one until they were all gone. it was not clear if it was one  single craft or individual crafts flying side by side. the only video we were able to catch was of one of the objects on my friends cell phone. it is not very clear, just looks like a star in the sky.

thirty p.M. and eleven thirty p.M. it might have been a little later. i enjoy watching the night sky. looking at stars and watching planes go by. i heard a plane and looked up. that is when i noticed the lights. it was to the south of me. moving from west to east. i think there were maybe seven lights. it was sort of boomerang shaped and there were more lights on one side than the other. the two end lights were alternately flashing as it moved. i thought it was a plane but it was bigger or closer than it appeared to be. after the plane that had made me look up in the first place flew by,the red lights were the only thing in that area, and i didn't hear any engine sound. there were no other colored lights as you would expect on a plane. no white or blue. i called my son to come out and look. it took him about two minutes to come out. i had called him several times in that time. it seemed to be moving diagonally, not straight from the center bend of the lights. it was going in a southeast direction. after the end lights flashed back and forth, all of the lights rotated from one end to the other and started back from the beginning. then all of the lights stayed solid. it then just disappeared. just faded and was gone. there were some clouds in the sky that night so i waited to see if maybe it had flown into them and would re-appear, but it never showed up again. unfortunately i didn't take pictures, as i don't keep my camera charged and didn't want to stop watching what i was seeing. i was very excited but nervous at the same time. i doubted myself, and thought i had to be mistaken by what i was seeing, until i saw a news report about lights over arizona, so i decided to write in. i am wondering if anyone else in my area saw something around that time. or if anyone can tell me what it was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

university going back to finish a b.S. degree in my late 20's. i would never believe in anything as statistically unlikely as a ufo of alien origins happening upon our little planet, and while i witnessed something that is seemingly unexplainable, i can only assume there is a rational non-alien related explanation. but this experience happened over ten years ago, and i hardly talk about or remember it, recent media coverage of sightings have brought back memories that send chills up and down my body like nothing else can.\r\ni was 17 years old and on summer break from high school. this was 1996 and could have happened anytime in the summer between june and august, not exactly sure as i never really documented the details. \r\nmy highschool sweetheart and i went camping in the higher of the two public campground, i belive paso picacho campground. i have been to this campground many times in the past but never returned, oddly i am thinking about going there in mid may after finals because my interest in camping was jump started by a visit to yosemite last week.\r\nanyway it happened sometime between midnight and 2am i assume. my girlfriend and i had to go to the bathroom and got out of the tent and walked over to a tree not too far from the tent. we went on either side of the tree to relieve ourselves and while going to the bathroom i was looking up in the stary sky and noticed a bright white light like the same color but more intense than the color of a star or venus when brightly lit. something seemed out of place.\r\nwhen i finished up i noticed my girlfriend was looking up at the same light as she was finishing up... i asked her if she saw what i was looking at and she said yes. she quickly finished and we stood next to eachother and watched this odd star/planet like light move through the sky in a slow and un-aircraft like way and grow in size dramatically, i was thinking is this a satelite or a strange experimental aircraft??? \r\nthen after a short time the slow moving light began to zoom in at us, it seemed like it was coming right for us (right now, writing this, the skin on my whole body is crawling with chills) it became frightening and my girlfriend started to panic because it moved at us from such a seemingly distant location to so very close and just overhead. there was no sound, no logical explanation for the way this light grew and moved to us, but her panic probably jump started panic in myself and we moved quickly to the car, got in and started driving down the campground road to escape whatever was coming at us. we could see out the window that whatever it was was indeed following us (odd thing is i cannot say how large it was or how close it really got, but the perception of closeness and impending danger was extremely real) ... we drove a couple hundered yards before i decided that runing from a light in the sky was crazy and pulled over infront of an inhabited campsite. we got out and immeditely noticed the light had backed off but was somehow still present in the sky... (my memory is a little fuzzy about how the light went from chasing us to backing off)... but nonetheless we sat on a log within 40 feet of some stranger's tents, for safety, and saw the light disapear into the star filled night sky. venus was particularly bright that night and i tried my hardest to rationalize some atmospheric interaction that caused venus to perform such extremely unusual and unnatural movements, but cannot rationally be satisfied with any such explanation. \r\ni do not remember if we got any sleep that night but the event was real and had a profound impact on me and my girlfriend at the time. we were both completely sober and witnessed the same thing that caused us to drive for our lives and still gives me chills today anytime i recall the vivid details.... odd thing is that now i reflect on the event some of the temporal aspects of the event seem unclear.. i believe it all happened in 20 minutes or less but upon deeper thought we may have been over an hour. \r\ni would really like to know what i saw that night and find relief in the rational explanation even if it is something as far fetched as an alien drone craft sent to remotely sense our natural resources.... the frustrating thing is that i know i will never know the truth.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10507,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0786552,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04242008-0004","longitude":-116.6019637,"occurred":834865200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":834865200000,"summary":"Camping in rancho cuyamaca state park, went to bathroom with gfriend and saw the oddest thing","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Julian, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:377697"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Dallas","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live in a well known historical building on the southside of downtown dallas on the 7th floor.  my girlfriend and i were watching tv, i was laid out on a couch by the wall with all the windows on it facing south.  i stood up from the couch and randomly looked out the window, as i did i saw something moving and glowing faintly in the sky a couple hundred feet above a 10-story building to the left of my vision.  within, the initial split second that i saw \"something\" in my mind i thought and tried to figure out if i was seeing some sort of light reflection from the room back in the window, as it had just rained and there were raindrops on the windows and i wasn't sure if when i stood up and was moving i was seeing some sort of diffuse interior light refracted in the window, so i steadied myself.  as i steadied myself to make sure i was indeed seeing something it passed through my head that these might be the beam of a spotlight / marquis light in the sky (the kind they use for sales events), and by this time i realized it was 3 diffused, cloudlike glows moving through the sky, from left to right.  now in the time i stood up and the spotted this and reasoned all this it was only about 3-4 seconds and i was concurrently saying out loud to my girlfriend \"what the heck is that, do you see that [around the point that i was steadying myself for a good look]\".  as i stood there still i realized that it was definitely 3 objects, diffused behind the clouds (it was a rainy night with low clouds).  the objects looked like diffuse oval glows (almost like clouds themselves, just slightly brighter), approximately only about 800-1000 feet in the sky, headed in a slight slant upwards into the southern sky.  they moved at a very steady, uniform speed and trajectory and acceleration, nothing too wavy or unexpected.  and just gradually, smoothly increased speed until they gradually moved up into the sky, the darkness and could no longer be discerned.  my girlfriend had stood up with me to watch them, and the whole time i was asking \"do you see it, do you see them\", and she kept saying \"where? i'm trying\".  finally, she said \"i think i saw them\".  the objects weren't anything spectacular, like obviously defined crafts, but just like glowing clouds.  the way they moved, with this steady smooth acceleration and at such low altitude i reasoned just could not be military or civilian aircrafts.  i've never see any man made object fly through the sky like that, it was very smooth, and in fact very quick, but a very gradual quickness.  after they were gone, had just gradually faded, my girlfriend stood there with me, intent upon seeing them, she suggested they might come back, i was like \"no, they're definitely not coming back around\", they appeared as if they were setting out, taking off, if you will, off into the sky, not like they were hovering or floating around.  we looked around in the window to see if anything came back around, or if anything else was out in the sky and indeed never saw anything.

experience, it was shocking.\r\n\r\nmy nephew (four years younger than myself) and i were up late at his house in downey, ca, playing super nes games in a back bedroom, drinking snapple, eating chips. late night. no drugs or alcohol involved whatsoever. we had a back door open, with a screen door in place since the temperature was warm.\r\n\r\nmy nephew had his back to a window in the room. i was sitting on the floor, facing the television with my body angled 3/4 to this window.\r\n\r\nwe played videogames for about a half hour or so and at one point, through the window, i saw a huge, cigar-shaped object slowly veer at an angle slightly downward in the sky, off in the distance. the object was luminous, mostly blue, with white at the center. i could get a sense of scale since i could see it behind the treeline across the street. seeing this, i went into a state or absolute horror, practically numb.  i had trouble speaking, i was shocked and quite honestly afraid and in disbelief.  my nephew was scared to turn around to see what i was looking at. i was finally able to yell \"look!\" and he turned around. he yelled \"holy shit! what the f***?!\" and slid off of the bed he was sitting on. thank god he saw it too because no one would believe just me.\r\n\r\nthe object made no sound as it moved for several seconds. then it suddenly made a sharp angled turn upward and took off at a high rate of speed. gone.\r\n\r\nwe were in disbelief, maybe even in shock, i don't know.  we sat there and all we could say was \"what the f***?!\" over and over.  we tried rationalizing it - traded theories.  a blimp?  no... no way it would move like that.  a helicopter with searchlights?  no, it was too big, too fast, and made no noise.  we then heard something outside - and i swear to god i am not lying - we heard something outside the screen door that i can only describe as a garbled voice.  we almost died.  we looked at each other. neither one of us would say what we heard because i'm pretty sure we thought we were losing our minds.  \"what did you hear just now?\" i said. he repiled \"no, what did you hear?\"  we were scared shitless.  this went on for what seemed like half a minute.  we both imitated the sound and agreed on what we heard.  after that i remember getting up the nerve to go outside in the dark to see what the noise was.  we made some jokes to ease the tension. i didn't see anything but i will tell you this: we were so stunned by the experience we didn't know what to do for days.  i'm an artist so immediately i went to sketch and color what we saw. i wanted to tell everyone.  i think i even called the downey police department the next day.\r\n\r\none item to note.  when i first saw the object, my face went into such a look of horror that afterward my nephew told me he thought there was someone in the window with a gun!\r\n\r\nthe date is sketchy, it was so long ago.  i could preobably narrow the date down better if i had to.\r\n\r\nif you have read this far, i hope it means something.  thank you for reading and doing what you do.\r\n\r\ni

the stars. we both believe in ufos, extra-terrestial or military related, due to a previous sighting in my childhood, which i will not post in this report, but perhaps in another. it was at night, between 10 pm and 12 am. we were sitting on our porch. our house is built facing direct north on a hill overlooking a depression in elevation that continues roughly 100 yrds until our land meets the road, the other side of which has trees whose tops would likely meet the elevation of our hill. this allows us a clear sight between direct north west to roughly north north east, as a tree relatively close to the house blocks further sight. as we watched the stars, we noticed several that flashed or shimmered. this is natural, and can occur for many reasons, but we took note anyways. however, we noticed a single star just above the treeline across the road. there was nothing of significance, onlt that it flashed different colors, and may shimmer in and out of sight, most likely due to the trees. the sky, of course, moves across the night, and the locations of the stars in the sky moves from sun down to sun up. as time passed, this star, however, did not move. we paid close attention to the relative positions of stars to objects we can easily associate. the sky was indeed moving as it should, yet this star, which flashed red, blue, and, as memory serves, kept an orange-ish hue, did not move in the night sky. my father and i retired early, ending our nightwatch between 1 am and 2 am. the star had still not moved by that time.\r\n\r\nthe second sighting of this immobile star makes it not entirely immobile. i was with a friend, at the same location, a few weeks later, starting the nightwatch some time between 10 pm and 12 am with full intention to remain awake until dawn. we talk about the possibility of life on other planets. i notice the same flashing star in the same place, and point it out to him. we watch the night sky, but i found myself disappointed, this star did move during the course of the night. however, we both noticed it stopped near the tree that, as i previously mentioned, blocks line of sight past north north east. we used the branches to set it's rate of movement. the sky moves from north north west to north north east from downwards to upwards over the course of the night. this star followed that, but remained immobile. we watched the sky and talked for hours, paying special attention to this star. it did not move any more. we noticed as the sky lightened, from it's darkish hue to a lighter shade at a relatively fast rate. then, as the light illuminated the sky, we could see clouds above the trees that we could not without this new daylight. the star remained in the beginning stages of the light, but then, the true reason for a 'sighting'. the star, at a rate...  i'm not sure, but i would estimate sextuple the rate of movement for the lingering night sky, and it moved nearly violently upwards on the night sky's trajectory. i will not say that it disappeared into the clouds, as in it was below and went through them to conceal itself, or if it disappeared behind the clouds. all i know is it was concealed due to it's upward motion towards the now illuminated clouds. i cannot remember clearly, and i will not deplete the integrity of this report by falsifying the details. it truly scared myself and my friend that this immobile star suddenly moved much quicker than any star should in the first place, but that it remained immobile for some time.\r\n\r\ni have stayed up several times until dawn with another friend since then, yet i have not been able to find this star again.\r\n\r\nthe first time i noticed it, with my father, it puzzled me, but nothing else. the second time, i was afraid that something would defy nature as such as this star did.\r\n\r\nif it would serve as any help, i frequently see military aircraft moving to and fro between air bases, as my house is relatively close to the flight path.\r\n\r\ni have not recorded a picture or a video as i did not own a working camera/video recorder at the time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line
