moving slowly, no noise, it was either grey or black...I thought, what is that...That can't be...And watched it traveling from the south east direction, very high over the treetops, heading toward the wyeth lederle lab facility...I tried to find a spot to get off the road so i wouldn't cause an accident and could watch this object...I turned off middletown road, made a u-turn to come back to the same spot, and upon my return all i saw were wide streaks of exhaust, heavy...Very heavy.. all over the sky...And no object in site. \r\n\r\nwhen i got home i looked on u-tube and the closest thing to what i had experienced was the video of the woman seeing a ufo at the world trade center in nyc...It even shows the exhaust streaks left in the sky in its path...So, to me, that confimed what i had just experienced was indeed a ufo.  this was my second sighting in rockland county, the first was in october of 1986...As i arrived home from graduate school one thursday nite about 10 pm..That object was also completely silent, but it was enormous...The size of a football field...And very low...Just over the treetops...I remember getting out of my car, looking up, and there it was...I remember freezing and watching, awestruck, as it disappeared over the mountains toward south mountain road...Travelling in a north east direction toward the hudson river and the indian point facility...I remember wondering if it had followed me that nite as i travelled home from pace university in northern westchester south on the saw mill river parkway toward the tappan zee bridge and then west over to rockland and north on the palisades parkway to my home in pomona...I had been the only car on the road that nite for miles and miles...All alone...Or so i thought...Until arriving home...I just parked my car, got out, looked up to the sky...And saw it...Years later, i learned of the book night siege, which confirmed what had happened to me was an actual ufo sighting...The one i saw that night was round and solid (against a beautiful star-lit october sky its solid nature was quite obvious)...And it had lights all along the perimeter...Either all red or all white...I was in awe, in shock, and terrified all at the same time...The second experience, yesterday, was also surprising...But as you can imagine i was already a believer...I am a fifty-something year old with a college education and can say one thing for sure...Once you see it for yourself, you believe! hopefully these are enlightened beings here to watch over, protect,and keep us safe...One and all...That's what i chose to believe anyway...But why some of us are seeing them and others aren't, i'm not sure...Why i looked up at exactly the right moment...Twice...I don't know... that puzzles and intrigues me...But

in our university, we used during the day. it was about 7:40 in the night, there was a lot of people in the university, my university is placed in the central area of my city, we were standing out the car, about to enter, talking about the videoclip we were making, suddenly my best friend who was looking to the sky, told us \"look that light!\" at the very first moment i sow it, i thought it was a plane, cuz it had that very strong yellow light, but i couldnt see those little lights, blue and red airplanes have, it was pretty far, so i waited until it was closer, in order to say yes it is an ufo, but everytime it got closer and closer, i realized from far away it was an ufo, for several reasons, one was that it hasnt the lights in the wings as airplanes have, second, it was way too slow for being an airplane, third, aeroplanes doesnt fly so high here in my land, specially not in the night, fourth, it looked like a star, that night was a very star shiny night, it was like one decided to move, but it wasnt a haley, becouse it moved way too slow, from the sight of an human into the eart it moved like 30 cm in the sky in about 5-7 min.(i have no idea how many kilometers are those!)fifth, it was quite, it didnt emit any kind of sound we could hear, sixth, it couldnt be a satelite, becouse the moment it was coming closer, almost over our head, it turned the direction to the right like making a \"v\" \"u\" shape, that moment we all were absolutly sure it was an ufo and there was no doubt left. the most incredible thing was that the moment it began to continue it new direction it started to turn red, and it changed the color really fast into a dark red (like the ones sown in phoenix the 21 april i guess)and slowly started to get invisible,it didnt left, it got invisible, it was clear, becouse it wasnt moving higher or lower, and when it dissapeared it wasnt bigger and then smaller, it was like dark red fading into a soft red that finally got invisible.\r\ntheres no way it was an helio ballon becouse we dont count with that kind of technology so easy as for wasting on some ballons.  when it dissapeared i kept looking at the sky, i dont know if anybody else sow it becouse we were so focused into that, my friend tried to record it in the camera but it wasnt possible, becouse something suddenly decided not to work, that friend lost the last part,i was kinda excited i sow one again, i love to search ufos in the sky but almost anyone believes until they see, my friends sow it too, i think we all were kinda perplex, it was the first time two of them see one so close, i got some anxius feeling but also for a second i got a bit scared, i was really happy i was with more people, after it i couldnt stop thinking about when they finally will arrive to our world, that is one chat me and my best friend usually have, we are trully believers and this isnt the first time we sow one, but the first time we sow it so early in the middle of the city with more people, i think that gives more credibility for esceptic ones, what is also very intersting is the fact that they were seen in phoenix near to the date we sow, perhaps they were the same, it is clear they are showing theirsleves everytime more and more.","distance":"Over One

flying birds. that's when i noticed a second cluster appearing below them. as that cluster appeared the first disappeared. they were white or silver; a color that reflected light well. i tried pretty hard to establish that these were birds but i could not distinguish the form of any bird i've ever seen. from my experience, if it is a bird and it's close enough to see then it's close enough to tell if it is, in fact, a bird.\r\n\r\n\"what the @#$% is that?\" i asked my wife, who was walking with me.\r\n\r\n  she looked up and saw what i was seeing. by this time we realized that these things were much higher and moving much faster than birds. the first cluster that i noticed was just to the left of the moon but the many that were appearing at different points in the sky as we watched were further to the north, some were lower in the sky and even directly overhead.\r\n\r\n  we were both carrying groceries so we had to take them inside and we wanted to get other peoples attention so we could ensure that others had seen it as well but we were both mesmerized for a moment before we could bring ourselves to lose line of sight.\r\n\r\n  we ran into our apartment as fast as we could and yelled out to our roommate to go outside. we put the groceries down and followed him. sure enough, the objects were still in the sky; still alternating appearing and reappearing in clusters.\r\n\r\n\"some of them seem to be flashing.\" he said. i looked closer and noticed that a few of the objects had a slight strobe effect.\r\n\r\n   at this point they started flying in formations. first a 'v' configuration from a couple of separate groups. my roommate later recalled some more basic shapes that were formed mainly during transition; a straight line, a diamond shape and others. one 'v' formation passed directly overhead, it was really, really high up and far away; it disappeared seconds after it appeared.\r\n\r\n   during all of this activity i noticed that six individual dots separated from the group and formed a circle or a six pointed star standing vertical apparently visible from the north or south. it wasn't hovering but rotating counter clockwise and moving to the west like a wheel rolling in the sky.\r\n\r\n  i shouted at some strangers who were minding their own business and they ignored me so i turned around to knock on a friend's door; sacrificing line of sight to get another witness. when i turned around they were gone. my wife had gone to put away the groceries and my roommate had to go sit down because he was experiencing some discomfort.\r\n\r\n  the overhead 'v' formation pointed to the north and they all seemed to be disappearing/reappearing in that direction so it's my guess that's the direction they headed. i would have imagined more people would have seen them but it was kind of like they were following i-35.\r\n\r\n  afterwards i noticed a resemblance to much of what has been sighted in mexico and south and central america. i didn't recognize the parallel between the circular pattern rotating while moving and the wheel but it strikes me as important. project paperclip would have definitely chalked this one up as \"high-flying birds\".","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

north phoenix near bell. her street name was utopia.\r\nanyway, i was going east coming out of my mothers little street when i noticed behind some of her neighbors homes in that community (in an empty field behind them) that there was this low flying series of colored lights. i thought it was a plane but realized that that would be impossible, especially for how slow and low it was going and how small the field was. tht lights were going about 15-20 miles an hour if that.\r\nso then i thought it was a helicopter and i kept wathing it as it came nearer the homes and up along side the street called utopia. \r\ni headed out of the community and onto utopia where i turned my car right (east again) towards the lights heading my way now (they were going north west). i got out of my car (it was very dark out) and i looked up at this strange \"helicopter\" as it slowly and strangley flew right over my head! if i was standing on my car top and jumped really high i just might have been able to touch it! it was large though, it couldn't have been a helicopter. i thought i seen figures too? i would like to go through hypnosis one day to find out.\r\nbecause it was so dark i could not make out an exact shape, but the lights were vivid and multi colored. not flashing multi colored lights like i have seen before, just solid lights. red, blue and white maybe green i really can not remember.\r\nbut it went very slow and i was really curious and enamored with it, i was excited but not afraid at all.\r\ni felt like whatever was above me knew i was there.\r\nby this time it was already following utopia all the way towards the end of the street it appeared to be goping a tad bit faster. then it went over this small hill/mountain and right over to the freeway.\r\ni realized at that very moment that it could not have been a helicopter because it made no sound, i mean nothing at all!!\r\ni got back into my car and still couldn't figure out what i had seen. \r\ni have seen ufo's before and i may even have some old reports on your site here somewhere.\r\nbut that(if it was a ufo)was by far the coolest!\r\ni wasn't ever really sure, oly because what others would say. but today i have read a few other reports that were so similar especaiily ones from texas. so i knew i had to come over here and report it.\r\nalso while i was typing this i remembered a dream i had about a multi colored ufo in an empty field that made no sound and was flying low and slow. i have always thought about that dream like it was teling me to look there, but i always thought it was one of the fields near my home in scottsdale. it wasn't until just now that i realize that, that dream was about this night that i am reporting now.\r\nthat dream occured a long time before these lights i seen near my mom's home. i never put them together until now, oddly enough. interesting!!\r\n  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

and then all go out in unison (including the most recently visible ones). if they were flares, they would have continued to burn out at a constant rate! plus they didn't dim slowly enough to be a flare or a firework burning off. the group of lights didn't move through the sky at all, so not a meteor either. \r\n\r\ni've been hearing the reports on the local news about a loud bang from meteors and military planes in the area breaking the sound barrier that night. if they were military planes with their exhaust ports facing me, then i would really like to know why they would simply turn off without changing color or shape (which would accompany planes flying away from my location at a changing rate).\r\n\r\ni have requested to remain anonymous, but i will disclose that i have a bachelors degree in forecast meteorology, a masters in cloud physics, and am working on my phd.  i have a very good understanding of \"atmospheric occurrences\", as the news are claiming to be one explanation for this. yet, i have never seen meteors or other natural atmospheric occurrences look or behave like those lights did.","distance":"Over One

spring of 1988 -- the sun did not set until around 7:45 p.M. so i believe it was spring/summer/fall in southwestern new mexico.  the drive from las cruces to deming is about an hour.  there is a border patrol stop about halfway between las cruces and deming.  i was driving about the speed limit, which at that time i believe was 65 mph.  a few miles before i reached the border patrol station i noticed in my rear view mirror what i thought was a large plane moving very fast toward me.  i thought it was a plane because in the glint of the sun toward it, the underside was shiny.  i was startled because i could see it in my rear view mirror and it was moving very fast.  i thought it was a plane from el paso that was going to crash but i didn't hear any sound, which i thought was because my radio was on.  i prepared myself to hear it roar over me continuing west but it never passed over me, which was odd considering how fast it was moving into view of my rear view mirror and then out of it (from east to west).  it never came over and i looked from right to left (north to south) and noticed an object to my left, at what i thought was a mile to the left (or south of interstate 10).  i thought it must be a plane or helicopter but it didn't quite seem like that's what it was but in my mind i thought it must be one or the other but flying low, lower than a private plane and it was not painted green and white for a border patrol helicopter.  altogether the view of it was not very clearly a plane or helicopter but was closer in shape to a plane without wings (like a small jet) but i don't recall a tail on it.  i came up to the border patrol station and i don't remember if it was open or not but i forgot about the object flying on the left until after i went over the akela pass.  at that point i looked to my left and the object was still there.  this struck me as odd because it was still in the same position and it now looked like a cigar shaped object but there was still a lot of glint off it from what was now a setting sun.  as i drove toward deming the florida mountains are on the south side of i-10.  the object was moving at about the same rate as my car, which i found strange, and it stayed fairly low in the sky.  when i drove past the florida mountains, the object stayed in the sky between i-10 and the floridas but in the same spot in the sky still moving at the same speed i was toward deming.  it stayed in the same spot in the sky until i arrived in deming.  i headed slightly north of the city to my destination.  when i stopped my car i looked for the object in the sky and it was in a set position in the southwestern sky.  by this time it was twilight and lights were coming from underneath the object.  i do not recall what color they were but they did seem to blink on and off somewhat but not steady like a plane.  i had noticed lights earlier when the object was passing the florida mountains.   for about an hour i went in and out of the house to see if the object was still in the same position in the southwest and it was.  i showed it to two family members who saw the light and outline of the object in the sky and they also checked it with me for that hour.  finally i decided to wait longer and see if it was still there.  i waited two hours (about 10:00 p.M.) to check again and the object was no longer in the sky. the whole event struck me as strange and i remember it to this day and one of my family members also remembers how much it affected me.  the thing is, i drove that stretch of road between las cruces and deming almost daily for three years and i'd never experienced anything like that at all.  that stretch of i-10 can be frequently very heavily populated with 18-wheelers and many personal vehicles.  however, there are many times when there was not much traffic and i would find myself alone for long stretches (5 and even 10 miles), especially on week days.  when the object was coming up in my rear view mirror it was one of those stretches where i was the only car in sight.  between the florida mountains and deming there was light traffic that evening.  occasionally, closer to deming there are crop dusters spraying but this object was not like that and the crop dusters clearly look like planes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10479,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.2759681,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04232008-0002","longitude":-107.7523404,"occurred":557391600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

was in my buddies' apt, watching the lights on the eastern horizon.\r\ni enjoyed watching airplanes coming & going by watching their landing lights & wing tip lights, when i noticed what appeared to be a cluster of landing lights  \r\nin a horizontal plane. when i first saw these lights i thought i was looking at a group of helicopters flying formation.\r\nafter approx 30 seconds i noticed these lights were headed in my direction.\r\nas the lights neared they began to blink randomly, & i estimated that each light was approx 50ft long by 10 ft wide in other words, each light was mounted vertically on the edge of the object, and they were much brighter than an arc welders torch.\r\ni will mention here that at this point that i could see that the object was \r\na perfect disc shape moving straight west at approx 100 mph at approx 1000 ft altitude without wobbling & no noise in fact when i was listening every -\r\nthing became dead silent not even birds were chirping.\r\nthe disc appeared to be incredibly large somewhere around 1000 to 2000 ft in diameter, which is why i thought it might have been a mother-ship. you have to remember that the sight i was seeing was so fantastic that i couldn't believe my eyes. when it neared my building it really got strange because i felt an entity on board the craft trying to communicate with me via mental telepathy. for some reason i became very frightened & jumped back which broke the link. a few seconds after this, the blinking lights started to blink in a different fashion going from right to left & reversing direction as if to say goodbye. as the leading edge of the disc neared the edge  \r\nof my building's roof i watched it disappear overhead & i counted the seconds it took to pass over our building from beginning to end. it was approx 10 seconds.\r\nafter the sighting i was completely bewildered because two days after the event the same object was announced on the radio indicating that it was spotted over many other

12-year-old son. i got up to let our dog out for the last time that evening and decided to stay with her to make sure she went about her business quickly. i like to look at the stars and did while the dog sniffed around the backyard. as i looked up, i saw and heard what was obviously an airliner flying east to west across the southern sky. it was a clear night. we are in houston hobby airport's flightpath about 15 miles out. as the jet cleared my view, i noticed another prominent light in the southern sky. i couldn't judge distance or size, because it was just a diamond of light in the night sky. however, it did have colored lights at its vertices that displayed (in turn at one-second intervals counterclockwise) red-green-blue-yellow while the center remained a brilliant white. the entire image was roughly the size of an ipod's earpiece held at arm's length. i stood and watched it for a while, expecting what i thought was another aircraft to come within hearing and pass by. it didn't. after two minutes, the object was in the same position as i had first seen it. no sound or movement at all. after five minutes of the same behavior, i went inside to get my son to come out as a witness. immediately, he said he had seen the same object in the same place in the sky two nights before. we watched it together for another 10 minutes, and it never waivered or emitted sound of any kind. by that time, we had retrieved a pair of binocculars and were taking turns viewing the object with them. magnified by the field glasses, it was just a larger version of what we had seen with our eyes--a bright white diamond with colored lights moving in a counterclockwise circuit. we decided to call my wife who was driving home from a meeting at our church. we told her what we were watching, and she tried to locate it in the sky as she drove. couldn't find it. at 10:20 p.M., my son noticed that the object was shrinking, as though it was moving away from us in a direct line (neither right nor left). it did this very slowly and moved toward the horizon as it did. we are surrounded by trees, and they began to obscure the object as it \"departed.\" we both climbed onto the airconditioner housings on the south side of my house to reacquire the object and did. at about 10:25 p.M., my wife arrived, and i got out a six-foot a-frame step ladder so she could see it too. she confirmed what i've told you so far. within 5 minutes, the object had left our view on the ground, so my wife and son went up to his second floor bedroom and were able to watch it for another 3-4 minutes before it disappeared below the horizon altogether. we never saw anything like a mechanical shape, just a bright, absolutely silent diamond of

bellefontaine,ohio,when i noticed a very bright shiney silver metallic object in the clear blue sky!,at first i thought it was a blimp,i pulled my car to the side of the road to get out and look at it,because in this rural farming area of ohio,we don't see things like that very often!As i watched it,it was just silently hovering in the sky,i watched it just sitting there in mid air for approxamtely 4 minutes or so,trying to figure out what exactly i was seeing!Knowing that a blimp has tail fins,and an under carriage compartment,this object did not!As i watched it i was alerted to a rumbling in the sky to the southwest of the object,when i looked,i seen 5 airforce fighter jets approaching(which are never seen in this area) at a very fast speed,they were in a triangle formation,they were flying at a much lower altitude than the object,it was at this point i came to the realization that what i was seeing was in fact a ufo!!,as they approached,the ufo shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was incredible,the 5 airforce fighter jets did a circular fly around,and headed back south towards dayton,ohio!!Until that day i was skeptical of the whole ufo matter,but after my experience i now know it to be fact!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":10470,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.3611643,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04222008-0016","longitude":-83.7596557,"occurred":867654000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":867654000000,"summary":"Bright

them out to my husband, and although he was driving, he looked and saw them distinctly.   the entire time we were on the 202, they did not move.  we exited the 202 at chandler village parkway and headed north.  after that, i forgot about them, and i didn't notice them when we went home from the mall.  i've attached a picture from the 1997 lights that i found on the internet - this is exactly

i went back to bed and dreamed of ufo's 1000's of them coming to earth in the near future. i say that for 1 reason only which is, my dreams that are so clear usually come true. and in the dream i was living in indiana, but i am moving back to florida this year. so from now on i will be looking to the skies until i leave.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":10466,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6619927,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04222008-0012","longitude":-86.1586156,"occurred":1208867400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1208867400000,"summary":"Very bright light in the southern sky, than disappearing and reappearing very quickly and slowly flying north until disappearing from my sight.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Mishawaka, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:377768"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Oakland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My girlfriend and i were walking with our daughter to the store when she pointed out what seemed to be two planes flying very slowly across the sky in formation off in the distance. the lights were pulsing at random, sporadic intervals and seemed almost to be blinking in and out of existance. the more we looked, the more we noticed how strangely random the blinking was. it was a very clear sky and we live in an area with little light pollution, so we could had normal planes and stars in the sky for a point of comparison.\r\n\r\nwith further observation, there appeared a faint beam between the two points. almost as if outlining the side of a craft. my girlfriend described a third point she had seen before calling my attention to it, outlining a triangle formation. this triangle form is what caught her attention, she first thought her eyes wee playing tricks on her. \r\n\r\nour eyes were transfixed on this object with astonishment, and we tried to get closer for a better view. after about five minutes it was nowhere to be seen, although the sky was still very clear and the normal planes and stars we had first observed to compare were still present.\r\n\r\nalso, i do not know if this incident is related, or just a normal astronomical occurence, but 30 seconds after the disappearance of the synchronous lights, a long trail of light resembling a shooting star crossed the sky. \r\nlike i say, i don't not know if this second event was an extraterrestrial anomaly, or a shooting star, but given what we had witnessed just moments prior, we couldn't be sure.

few planes in the sky and this was moving significantly faster than the low and high flying planes we could see. this object also did not strobe like planes lights do. this time the object was also
