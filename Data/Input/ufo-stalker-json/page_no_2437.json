it in the sky the chemtrails were shorter than even a dime. they were going straight down. i immediately thought that was strange. chemtrails dont usually go straight down. right below the chemtrails was an object. the object was not moving in any direction it was staying in one place. the chemtrails disappered and the object was still there. i could not make out the shape of the object or color, but it seems to be a reflective surface because the sun was rising and the object appeared to get brighter as the sun rose. or maybe it was a light getting brighter or dimmer. not sure but it seemed more like a solid object, not like a light. i watched this object while i was slowly creeping through traffic on the freeway for about 25 minutes. i was wondering if anyone else saw it. it was visible, why wouldnt anyone else see it? it was not very close however. at one point it seemed to get smaller or dimmer but then returned to its orginal size or brightness.\r\ni had to get off the

west in the tillamook state forrest to watch the peresid meteor shower. the skies were mostly clear but there were some patches of clouds. i was scanning the sky hoping to catch sight of my first meteor when off to the west i noticed a bright white light. at first i thought it must be the landing lights of an aircraft that was heading towards me, but i soon realized that the light was moving in a southerly direction and that ruled out landing lights. in addition i could not see any navigation lights nor any strobe or beacon. i next thought that i may be seeing a satellite that was traveling just above the horizon but it just seemed too bright to be such. i put my binoculars on the object and that verified my feeling that it was not a satellite nor a aircraft. the light was of a very bright intensity and very white in color. the intensity and color remained constant. it traveled at a constant velocity and did not seem to change direction or height. the light then went behind some trees that were about a half a mile away or so. the light would disappear as it���s view was interrupted by a tree and then reappear when the view was unobstructed. when the light passed beyond the trees i was then able to see that the light was fairly distant, maybe 5-10 miles away and that it was traveling fairly rapidly. faster than a jet aircraft would have gone at that distance and much slower than a meteor. its��� size was about 5-8 times that of the biggest star in the sky.  about the time i came to the conclusion that this light was not a normal aircraft or celestial object it disappeared. there were some trees on a distant hill and i couldn���t tell whether it had gone behind those trees or if it had just left the sky. i looked for it for several minutes and kept checking that part of the sky for the next couple of hours but never caught sight of it again. the whole sighting lasted maybe 4-5 minutes. i did see a total of 55 meteors that night. since it was just a bright light i didn���t think there was must use of reporting it, but when i read that there have been other sightings of a similar nature in the state i decided to file this report.","distance":"Over

first i thought it might be a meteor, but it could not have been, because when it first appeared in the east it was on approximately a 30 degree angle going north, then shifted direction on a more 32

anything there. i was trying to zero in on where the light was because it kept disappearing. finally, after about 4 more flashes, i zeroed in on it's location and watched, hoping to see it again. up until this point i had been sitting on one of the chairs on the balcony. when i finally focused on the light's location, i got up and stepped to the balcony wall and asked my friends to look at what i was seeing. at first they thought i was referring to one of the passing planes but i finally got them to see what i was pointing out.\r\n\r\nthe white light was slowly flashing, not like a strobe light, but as if someone were turning on and off a car headlight. it didn't flash like an aircraft faa light. it slowly turned on and off over the course of 1-second. and it seemed to flash once every 2-3 seconds. when the flashing light was off there was no indication of any other lights and since it was night, there was no indication of the shape, size or relative distance away from my location. the light didn't seem to move from it's original location from one flash to the next. the light seemed unusually large to be an aircraft light. we watched the light flash about 4-5 times before it simply stopped.\r\n\r\ni watched the sky for several more minutes to see if it would appear again in it's original location or if it might be seen somewhere else in our available field of vision but nothing happened. we continued to see aircraft fly by overhead but the light never re-appeared.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":10430,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7461036,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04192008-0018","longitude":-104.9827334,"occurred":1208579400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

the same property who stepped out onto her porch to smoke,called and woke me and said \"get up now and look out your back door\".She seemed frightened so i jumped up and looked through the window in the door and immediately saw what she was upset about. there was a large object in the sky visable just over my storage barn that looked like an explosion of some sort in slow motion .She and i watched it for several minutes (her on her front porch me on my back porch)then i got my witts about me and went in and got my camera.It looked like a cloud with brightly colored lights tumbling randomly around inside it.It was in constant motion but seemed to to remain stationary as if it were hoovering in the same place.The object also had a kind of halo around it.I took about a dozen pictures of it thinking that my inexpensive digital camera (kodak z740) would not pick it up as it does not get good photos in low light and this was in the middle of the night.I then went in and got my video camera and got a few minutes on it but it was so cold and i was pretty scared so i was shaking and it was hard even with bracing in my doorway to keep the camera on it.After almost an hour and a half it began to move due west away from us and in about five minutes it was gone.I remember thinking at the time to be very quiet and to keep my lights off because i didn't want to alert it to my presence.\r\n\r\nlate febuary \r\naround 3:00 am\r\nmy sister called to say the same thing was back but i got outside only in time to see it moving off to the west and got no photoes of it.\r\n\r\nmarch 22,2007\r\naround 11:30 pm i was again alerted by a call from my sister that the odd thing in the sky is back and in the same place .This time knowing that my camera would pick it up i got it and my tripod and set them up on my small back porch.Not being camera savy i took several pictures using different settings or modes and ended up with about 25 photos.I also took some more video tape.Having told him about our previous experience i telephoned my brother who lives about 100 miles south of us  in jacksonville ,ar.Because he said if it happened again he wanted to check and see if it was high enough for him to catch sight of,but it was not.We watched the show it put on for about 3 1/2 or 4 hours and this time when it began to move away to the west we felt braver and tried to follow it in my car but soon lost sight of it.\r\n\r\napril 20,2007\r\nat about 10:00 pm i was walking through my living room on my way to bed and when i turned off the lights i saw the glow from the object again this time from my window so i called my sister and once again set up my tripod and got about 25 pictures of it.We watched it for a couple of hours but having convinced ouselves it must be some kind natural occurance we went on to bed.\r\n\r\nit was not untill some time later that while talking to my step daughter about it and sending her the pictures over the internet via google's picasa program that shows you the information on each photo such as when it was downloaded, that we relized that we were seeing this at or about the same time every month.To be honest i had forgotten all about it until my brother called and said he had happened to see a program on the history channel called\r\n  ufo hunters\r\nepisode: 2008 texas ufo\r\nand he wanted me to watch the rerun of it today because the pictures looked shockingly simular to mine.And i must agree they do and with the whole thing being totaly silent the same way that the people described on your show i thought they might be the same.The photos do not give the live occurrence justice but i hope they will be of some help.If you would like to see all the pictures please just send me an email address so that i can put them on a private album for you at picasa\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

because we had been seeing lights in space all week but that night we could not see into space because it was cloudy.On monday we were looking at the three star triangle in space and we saw what appeared to be a light like a star move thru the triangle from south to north and thirty minutes later it went back thru from north to south.We were outside talking about what we had seen on monday night when all of the sudden it came out of the clouds close to us and it was shaped like a v and it had lights  around it and it was transparent white looking and it came towards us at about 300 feet in the air and we got a very good look at it.When it came over us it was moving slow and it had lights around it and they changed the lights and went from looking like a v to a diamond shape and it was totally silent and after it passed over us we looked at it from behind and we saw a narrow white light that was about 50 feet wide and then it turned the light off and we saw a black craft about 50 feet wide and it went back into the clouds.Three of us saw it and we came to the conclusion that it wasn't from this world it was incredible i have never seen anything like it ever.Tonight we are going to be looking into space with a camcorder so we can record anything that looks unusual.","distance":"101-500
