fireball flew completely horizontal not at a angle like falling meteors it continued that way for quite awhile until it just seemed to disapear being 18 at the time i really didnt pay much attention to it until about 30 minutes later when my brother and  friend shouted \"look\" the way he shouted really startled me it took a few seconds to scan he sky but than i spotted it,the object was made up of about 6 o 7 lights shaped in the form of a triangle slowly moving above the municipal airport now i know what i saw and so did my brother and several others and those werent no military flares we stood there in total disbelief it was so close. it continued  off in a westerly direction toward california until i lost sight of it it was wierd because it kind of hummed and the air became kind of

my friend was driving,i was in the passenger seat, and my 4 yr old son was in the car seat in the back seat of the car. when we were on 81 north  outside of wilkes-barre, my friend told me to look in the sky outside his window and tell him what i saw- i had observed him looking at something outside his window and was wondering what he was focused on. i looked out the front windshield by ducking down a little bit and saw a black object in the sky-it looked like a pyramid that was rounded where the points are and the sides looked slightly concave. i was mesmerized by the sight and my friend was relieved that i saw it, as he thought he was going crazy. we kept on trying to explain it as something like a plane,balloon, etc since we were close to the airport, but those explanations didn't fit. it seemed to keep pace with us as we drove 55mph down the highway and i kept wondering if other people saw it, as it was a beautiful morning and the object was very clear and visible. we kept watching and driving and then it shot away extremely fast and was out of site in seconds. it appeared to follow the susquehanna river north towards the tunkhannock, pa area. we were kind of freaked out that we actually saw a ufo. i kept telling people about it, but my friend got mad and started denying it in front of others-he said he didn't want others to think we were crazy. we still talk

the direction was west and there were no clouds in the sky. we were on route 98 that goes through a forest preserve and past tyndall afb. the gulf of mexico was on the left and further to the right was the airbase. the road paralleled the runway. it's probably important to note the road was long straight and surrounded by the forest of pine trees. through the trees to the right near the ground i saw something move. it was silver and big and \"floating\" towards the road in front of us. it was also rising so my first thought was weather balloon. we were a couple miles from main base itself so that seemed liked a possibility. then the best thing happened, we came to a clearing in the woods. now i had a good view and a perspective of its size with the pine trees behind it. at this point we're about 1000 feet away and getting closer fast. it has been rising steeply and slowly and never crossed in front of us. it was an orb that was at least 30 feet in diameter. i focused on it and saw it very clearly. it was a silver tone but not too shiny. around it was a thin faint aura that seemed to help it blend in with the blue sky. there were no sharp edges or features on the surface. just a perfect ball. the thing that fascinated me most was that the surface was not a solid color of silver. it was modeled with slightly darker silver and it was swirling. maybe a little bit like molten metal would look. it very briefly stopped at least 300 feet above the trees and then quicker than a blink it shot off. it looked like it instantly reached 1000+ miles an hour. the direction was exactly straight ahead from my view and up at maybe at a 20 degree angle which paralleled the runway further ahead. i'm sure it got smaller as it shot off in the distance. but wait. immediately after it was gone i had a second thought. if it got smaller (shrank) instantly it would have looked exactly the same. maybe it was a portal like a door that closed around it as it slipped into another dimension. i never resolved in my mind which method it used. after seeing this i had a deep feeling of gladness. finally, i got to see a real ufo.

or other man made flying machine could every move through the skies. this \"ship\" was moving slow in one direction, then speeding up, and then turning back the same way it came. after examining this thing for a while, i made up my mind that it was somthing out of explanation, and after panning the skies, it became clear to me that there was more than one, i counted at one time in the sky more than 5 of these blinking lights. but i kept my eye on the biggest brightest one, at one point the one i kept track of stopped, i watched for about 15 seconds and then a red dot appeard miles away from the ship and in an instant both objects dissapeard, and in seconds the ship was back, and at one point the big ship was stopped and a little ship beamed a light to the big one, and when that happend the sky lit up. i felt scared, but i was amazed at what i was seeing at the same time. we kept walking, and i might add i tried to get my friends to look at these things in the sky but when they would look they just kept saying i dont see anything and wouldnt take the time to look very long. so we were walking and an elderly man pulled over to the side of the road, i asked if i could use his phone, he said yes, and when i took the phone i said \"not to sound weird or anything but do you believe in aliens?\" and told him what i saw and made him look. he too didnt see anything becouse he didnt take the damn time to actually look at what i was pointing at. and when i said sumthin about aliens, he told me there was had been an earthquake that shook the midwest, about 10 minutes ago. the whole time me and my friends were walking we didnt feel anything shake at all, and this earthquake was a 5.4 the biggest recorded in the midwest. so while the whole midwest region was feeling the ground shake, i was experiencing the most shocking time of my life. if anyone seen anything like what i saw that night of the earthquake please say so, becouse i know it wasnt just me who seen these things,

(derived from the exif data of the first picture.) approximate location was the city of mchenry, illinois, the intersection of routes 31 and bull valley road, and traveling south from there, approximately one quarter mile. as i was walking down my driveway to check my mailbox, i saw what seemed to be a kite or windblown scarf, brilliant orange and darker orange in color, it was slowly moving toward me traveling from north to south very slowly, size at the time appeared to be no more than maybe four feet in any direction. i did not observe it intensely because it had a motion as though moving up and down as if tethered by a string from the ground, the speed of the oscillations were approximately three or four cycles per second, the range of motion restrained to about twice it���s physical size. the odd motion had me ready to grab for my pocket sony camera that i keep with me,  but still not enough to trigger a reaction to take an image, ���no need to waste memory card space���, i thought. i continued on to check the mail, it had not come yet, when i looked to see where ���the kite��� was located, all my internal alarms went off, the object was now abreast of me, it���s path seemed to be about 200 feet west of me, but i had no reference to gauge it's actual size, and it was never directly over me, it was clear to me that something strange was happening, the ���thing��� was rising up while still traveling due south, now directly west of my position, and abreast of me, any sense of its size was now lost, it may have been much larger than my initial estimate. it is worth noting that the bizarre appearance and motion of the orange object matched nothing in my mental catalog of known objects, it is almost impossible to even describe it accurately because it looked so strange, it had sharp angles and curves and as it was rising in front of me, it's motions were so fast as to cause it to be a blur as it was close to my position. the motion at this angle were now a horizontal back and forth, as it was rising, same frequency of cycles per second as noted before, about three of four times per second, and still rapidly rising. i did grab my camera, got it turned on, as i lifted it up, the lcd screen was completely washed out by the brilliant sunlit sky, i had to approximate the correct direction, the camera is set in bracket mode, it will take a series of three frames, each with a different exposure, one overexposed, one optimized, and one underexposed, usually at least one will be usable, and you can make an hdr image by combining all three together. as i depressed the shutter button, the multi hued orange ���thing���, abruptly faded out within one second, an extremely brilliant strangely hued point source of light popped into view slightly to the south of the orange colored object at the same instant, as the first orange colored one dissolved, the bright light appeared. the distance between the two objects locations was about the size of my fist held at arm���s length. upon examining the camera images i saw that i did capture the light points but they are quite underwhelming compared to the impact of the actual event. the sony cameras lens was set to minimum zoom which is 38mm, the average 35mm cameras lens would be 50mm, this means my camera (a sony dsc t9), was set to a fish eye setting as opposed to a zoomed in setting, this makes the light i saw too small and far away looking to provide images with high detail. the light had an odd purplish blue cast to it a little bit like a welders arc, but strangely different,  to my amazement, this small yet powerfully bright light began immediately moving up and away now traveling southwest an unknown distance, in just a second, it paused in its apparent movement and ascension, but then engaged in a series of severe and rapid saw tooth type oscillations, occurring within a second, while staying within an imaginary box, the size of which i could not guess due to a lack of references pertaining to size and distance. i was taking pictures all the time, there is a delay of several seconds as the three shots are written to the memory card and then it will take another series of three. the point source light then either dimmed or moved away at an incredibly fast rate, leaving again in a steep vertical climb, with a slight southwest direction of travel. my initial reaction as it disappeared from sight was that the thing i had just witnessed was very unusual and most likely not caused by any natural phenomenon i an familiar with, the rapid oscillations were so fast that i saw a streaking or elongating effect that happens with fast moving very luminous objects viewed with my naked eye. i would say the after image (the streaking effect.), behind the light source was very noticeable, like rapidly waving a glowing stick of incense in the dark. my impression of what it was is mixed, the first manifestation looked like something solid, but it moved erratically, it seemed to have a physical presence. when the point source of light appeared, it is hard to imagine anything moving so erratically could be moving under intelligent control, the motions were just so extreme. why would such radical motions be part of its operation or function, it does not make sense. i took pictures, but they are only of use to someone with some computer graphics background, i think someone with some photoshop skills could overlay some of the pictures and show the trajectory that the object took as it moved away. there are background objects in enough of the frames that they can be overlaid to show the differing locations of the light as time elapsed. the digital images do not show any streaking caused by the rapid motion, perhaps because of the bright conditions, the automatic settings most likely would have selected a very fast shutter speed on the camera, or it could be that the object happened to be moving at a slower speed at the moment the frames were taken. the pictures have no value to the casual observer, as far as the wow factor goes. but the testimony i give is honest and true. my flickr account has the images here. http://flickr.Com/photos/ring0/sets/72157604542071914/ there are 21 images in all. they are of very low usefulness for the casual viewer, no craft are seen, only a hard to see point of light in most of them, the last few images show none, but i included all the frames that i took that day.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then

training \r\n<_<\r\n>_>\r\n...At 11:00pm...\r\n<_<\r\n>_>\r\n...Over civilian homes...\r\n\r\nanyway my first thought was not safty or earthquake but those mysterious booms and shaking... i jumped to the end of my bed as fast as my feet could carry me and low and behold what do i see go right over my home but a large white pop in the dark sky it was so bright that for a split second i had to shut my eyes!\r\ni heard no noise but after this last flash the ground stopped shaking a few seconds after... but the report from the events in the incident from nights earlier a few counties over said that fighter planes were training at 11:00pm fire tracer rounds and going sub-sonic... now, that said my brother in law was in the 82nd airborne and i know enough from his 16 years of military service to know that training missions dont take place and sub-sonic speeds... jeez... why dont they just say its swamp gas so that atleast we will know they are lying and just dont care... atleast that would make themselfs look smarter... agreed? \r\n\r\nalso... had these been fighters going sub-sonic over my home i would have heard the sonic boom from their planes spliting the air... also last time i checked the military had special grounds for training missions... not over civilian homes! \r\ni stayed up for about 1 hour after this... the news had breaking coverage of whatever happened and say it was a \"possible earth quake\"... this in itself raises some interesting questions... why would they not simply say \"earth quake\"... usually when the ground shakes you dont put the word \"possible\" in from of the quake part... atleast thats just what i found curious\r\nnow this may very well have been an earth quake in the first place... but whatever rocked the country side only the night before not far away was at it again during this event at 5:30am... best guess is that whatever these ufo's are doing... they miss-timed their activities and might have thought this earth quake was going to take place the night everyone reported it the first time a few counties over... atleast they got their timing right this morning... but i still saw them!\r\n\r\nplease! feel free to email me or contact me in anyway... i really want to talk to people that saw these things the other night!\r\n\r\n
