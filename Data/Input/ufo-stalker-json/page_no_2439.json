would say that it was at least 5 to 10 miles away . the thing that was most noticeable was the flashing and pulsing of very intense ever changing lights . when it was close to us we could see the front end was round but the lights were the weird thing . they would go from red to maroon to blue and yellow they were like the intensity of lightning i would guess . \r\n we watched it between calling everyone i knew for almost 50 minutes. it would dart back and forth but only in short jumps not like when i first saw it . i even called 911 and asked if anyone had reported anything . they said no but that they would call the faa and let me know if they said anything and they never did call  back . i am not crazy i wouldnt have believeed it if i hadnt seen it .Finally we went in because it was getting cold and i looked again and it was gone  when i peeked back out the door . i tried to take pictures , but i couldnt get the stupid flash to stop working on the camera , and to be honest i was to wound up to think straight . i am not crazy and i was a skeptic , but what we saw was not like anything like anything man made i have ever seen

passed my position overhead, i could distinguish a dark outline of a left and a right wing. i was unable to determine the shape of the center of this aircraft (if any). these circular lights appeared to take up most of the width of the wing. as this craft passed me overhead, approximately two seconds later the object could not be seen anymore. this entire encounter lasted approximately 5-6 seconds. there was no wind and absolutely no sound to be heard. \r\n     at first i believed this craft to be a military test craft of some type.I have been around all types of aircraft helicopters,

anything the first few times i looked during my morning break, but as i was starting to walk back into the building a flash caught my eye and a definite saucer shaped ufo was right overhead moving very erratically. it was white in appearance but i was only able to watch it for a few seconds and then it zoomed away to the west over the building in the blink of an eye ! later on in the day, i was outside on my afternoon break and i spotted 1 ufo in the eastern part of the sky. one of my fellow employees who is also a good friend just happened to come outside at that moment and i grabbed him and said \"see...See ! i told you that i have been seeing these ufo's !\" i directed his attention to the one that i was watching when all of a sudden another one appeared almost right next to the one we were watching and it moved on past the hovering ufo and then stopped a short distance away from the first one. it was much brighter than the first one we were watching and was blinking randomly, either from the sun glinting off it's shell or from unseen lights. then the brighter of the 2 ufo's just blinked out of existence, leaving the other one just hovering in the sky. <break> i just came back in from my last break of the day with my friend/fellow employee, and sure enough we just saw two more ufo's that just 'popped' into the sky sort of to the south from overhead. the one just sat there and hovered and the 2nd one moved away and then blinked out completely...Not faded out, but bam ! gone. so that makes a total of 5 that my friend and i saw today. i did try to bring a camera with a telephoto lens to work, but it isn't working at the moment so i'll have to try and get a different camera to film these amazing things. at least now i have another witness that is seeing these craft and not just me....Thank the gods...I still can't believe that i have been seeing so many of these craft over phoenix. why me? i have been advised to keep track of anything 'unusual' happening in my day-to-day life...For what, i have no idea but i must say that i am a bit nervous that someone said that to me. what could be more unusual than a ufo sighting on a daily basis ?!\r\n\r\nuntil

to the east of the mill what looked like a laser pen dancing on a wall.  moved erratically over a fair distance and super fast.  the first thing i said was \"could that be a model airplane flying towards us?\".  i was laughed at.  the laughing stopped immediately when the object shot straight up vertically from an altitude of about 100ft to maybe 1000ft in less than a second and stopped on a dime.  we were probably over a mile away from the mill to the south (mississippi river to our east/right).  object was stationary for a few seconds.  we killed the truck and got out.  then the object came down a couple hundred feet (?) and shot east towards the river maybe a half mile, again in less that one second, and stopped.  it rose a little, and came back to the west behind the mill power tower, stopped, wiggled a little and then came in front of the tower moving back towards the river.  the lights of the mill are very bright, and this thing was multiple times brighter then anything around, and was constantly (but with no pattern that i can remember) changing colors.  no sound, no predictable speed or pattern.\r\n\r\nwe were stunned.  as we continued to watch this for what seemed like ten minutes (i'm sure it was only two or three), the object went vertical a few more times (with the same speed) and finally came back down to about 200 ft and stopped.  a few seconds later it shot off to the west towards mcgehee at the same altitude.  one can see the lights of mcgehee easily from the top of the levee.  it went out of sight over mcgehee in less than one minute (mcgehee is about 10 miles away as crow flies).\r\n\r\ni have only told this to a few people, and my family member with me that night will not speak about it, even to me.  i have seen two other things in my time that i could not explain, but would have to rationalize weather balloons/blimps and a meteorite/satellite before i would utter \"aliens\".  but until i see this thing up close and someone hands me a remote control for it, it will always remain unexplained to me.  i have flown with friends who are pilots and i fully understand the science of lift and drag.  there is no aircraft anywhere that can do what we saw.\r\n\r\ni have heard that others have seen lights at the mill before but have never talked about it with anyone else who may have seen something out there.  i am curious if anything has been seen since.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with

the number of planes that i could see in the sky (we recently moved to this location where there is a very good view of the sky in several directions compared to where we had lived and you could only see the sky immediately overhead)...It struck me as odd that i couldn't see any this time.  then i looked to the north-east and notice a bright light that i at first thought was a low-flying plane...I wasn't able to get a good view at that time as it was being blocked by trees.  after it came out from behind the tree line, i noticed that i was now looking at it from a side angle and the light was just as intese from this direction.  i watched it continue it trek toward the west until it was behind the house.  at that point, i went into the back-yard and continue to watch it.  i called for my wife to verify that i was seeing something out of the norm.  now, the view was the rear of the \"craft\" (for lack of better word), and again, the light intensity was the same.  \r\n\r\ni continued to watch it until it was out of site.  afterwards the realization of what just occured hit me and i realized that not once did i see any of the required strobe lights, nor, did i hear any sound either from a plane and/or a helicoptor.  i also noticed that at no point during this did i see any other planes around.  it was just surreal.  \r\n\r\nseveral moments after it passed out of sight, i then noticed that there were 3 or 4 planes flying through, all of which were easily identified as a plane because even though they were definately flying at a higher altitude, but, you could clearly make out the red and blue strobing lights.\r\n\r\ni have spoken to a good friend of mine who stated that it could have been the space station, but, this appeared to be much closer...At this point, i have

been flying fairly low so that the city lights reflected back from it ever so slightly. it was there long enough for me to say to my husband \"oh my god...Look it's right there, it doesn't have any lights\" and he looked up and saw it too. it was at least the size of my hand at arms length;as i said either very low or very large. it made no sound. it flew at about the same speed as maybe a helicopter would-not too fast or slow. we just watched it go out of sight travelling in a west/north-westerly direction. i don't know if it's related but moments before i saw the craft i had seen a shooting star over in the same direction that the craft came from. the day after i saw it i called nuforc who told me to make an internet report-we didn't have a computer then so i went to the library a week or two later and submitted a report. after all the january texas sightings i wondered whether i might need to let mufon know about what we saw back in october. it might be important for the ones who know what's really going on to know that whoever flys the crescent shaped craft were here doing whatever it is they do on october 3rd 2007.

light. i had seen them again yesterday and the weather was such that i thought tonight might be a good night to see them again. i am determined to get these bastards on video tape! i know i will.. anyway, i get to the park and shut off the lights and my car. the sun has just gone down. i sat there for about 20 minutes and got bored so i called my friend tim, in florida. i think we were on the phone for about 10 minutes when the obol showed up in the northwestern sky. it was about 45 degrees from the horizon and it was really bright! it was huge. like a baby aspirin at arms length. it was a yellowish amber orange color. and very sparkly. i grabbed for the camcorder and the bastard vanished. just quickly grew smaller and then vanished. and there was nothing where it had been. no craft or anything. there was enough moonlight that i could have seen a big craft but there was nothing. this is what sometimes happens so i got the camcorder up for more. they usually start to pop in, one by one till 2 or 3 or more appear and then they pop out the same way. well, this one was the only one. no more came. something was up. within a few minutes the sky was absolutely filled with what i called \"fireflies\". they were small jet aircraft. i could hear them. they were flying in double \"v\" formations and they were all over the sky where the light has just been. i watched as they made several sweeps of the area. 3 or 4 would break formation and swing back around toward the south and then make a tight turn back to the north. they did not have their red and green wing lights on but they did have on their strobes, so i could follow them, but it made it harder. that \"firefly\" effect was crazy! they were everywhere! damn, more started showing up and i had a hard time counting them or keeping track of all of them! the sky was crawling with aircraft! unbelievable!!!! after a few minutes they broke away and started moving to the north in small groups. what a show this was!!! while this was going on, i called glenn means, in peru. i had him on the phone telling him what i was seeing so you can ask him about the freaked out tone in my voice!  i had a weird feeling about what i was seeing. like something was wrong. something was up. something big. for the record, i was sitting in the parking lot at jackson morrow, the lot by the volley ball nets. i was facing the west and scanning the sky from north to south.. i was just west of us 31 at center road. (300s)\r\n\r\nafter the jets left and it seemed as if there wasn't going to be any more obol tonight, i took my cameras and went home. once i arrived, i stood outside for a few minutes, camera in hand, watching. waiting for something i could feel in the air. at about 10:10 pm i finally gave up and came in. i got my jammies on and went into my office to work.\r\n\r\nat precisely 10:24 pm there was a tremendous explosion outside my window. the window shook, my chair shook, my monitor shook, and it sounded like something fell on my roof and then off. (i need to go outside and see if there is anything or anybody laying in my yard!) i thought i had seen a flash of light out the window in my office that faces southwest. it all happened so fast i can't remember if i saw the flash before or after the explosion. i jumped up and ran in to the bedroom and woke dave up screaming, \"something is wrong, something is wrong!\" i had the hair standing up all over my body. i still do! about 5 minutes later my son,  casey, called me. he is at the cab company in town. he says, \"mom, are you guys okay?\" i said, \"yeah, why?\" and he proceeds to tell me that a plane has crashed close to our house! i jumped up and ran into the bedroom to tell dave and then i called glen back. i ran outside to see if i can smell anything or see anything. i can't do either. i do hear dogs howling and barking like mad again.\r\n\r\nso i go back inside and up to my office to flip on the tv because it's 11 pm now and the news is coming on. first off the bat is a breaking news: explosion in tipton county at the howard/tipton county line! they had a caller from kokomo on the phone.  she said that someone reported seeing 2 bright flashes of light and then the explosion happened. and the report said there was much debris strewn about the area. now they've come back on and said the faa in indianapolis reports no missing planes!\r\n\r\ni am here to tell you right now, that explosion has something to do with the military and that bright amber orange light i saw tonight. i saw the light! i saw the jets scramble and sweep the area after the light disappeared. i have a strong feeling those military jets and that bright light have something to do with this crash. i witnessed something tonight.  i have been thinking about skywatching all day today. i knew i was going out tonight and i had a strong feeling i was going to see something but i didn't think it was gonna be like this! i tell you there were at least 10 military jets sweeping that area after the light appeared and they were flying without their wing lights on. something was up and i have no doubt this crash is related to what i saw\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":10378,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.495737,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04172008-0003","longitude":-86.1259533,"occurred":1208407080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1208407080000,"summary":"Orange

morning for duck hunting at klosse's marsh. although i don't remember what phase the moon was in, i was able to navigate the sloughs to klosse's marsh at full speed in my 14\" aluminum craft 40 horse powered evinrude motor which pushed us along at 30+ mph. not possible through narrow sloughs unless the starlit conditions are not just right and they were as i did not need my brother who was sitting in the bow to use a spotlight to shine the way. being a short ride of about 3 miles we arrived in the duck blind about 15 minutes later with no change in the black sky back ground and its bright stars. my brother left the boat to go to the blind and i was pulling it onto the small isle we were hunting from. as he approached the blind he said look at the plane coming in to land and i glanced up to see what appeared to be a single large landing light descending as if it were a plane making an approach for landing. i, said yep your right, but he then said there isn't an airport in this area as the la crosse airport was due north of us about 10 miles away, by this time i was walking toward him, all the time watching the bright light descending on a slope that looked like a plane preparing to land at a speed that would seem to verify that. the glide path may have been a couple minutes long as by this time we were standing together when i suggested it may be a helicopter with a search light on. seconds later the bright light stopped mid air about 5-10k feet above the minnesota bluffs. it hovered motionless for about a minute, which confirmed it was as i suggested, a helicopter with its search light on. we then observed it slowly ascending and i said something to the effect i was right again, meaning it was a helicopter, but then half way up to the horizon it went from what one expects to an indescribable speed straight up....Amazing yes, but not as amazing as the perfect right turn at the same speed. its exit took it back towards the same direction that my brother had first seen it, but of course at a altitude i would not venture to guess at. the kicker is just prior to losing sight of this object it appeared to be throwing off sparkles of light. my conclusion and my brothers was we had just witnessed conclusive proof the earth is being visited by exterrestials or by our own kind that have developed the ability to travel back in time. my brother is sharp yet at 72 and i of sound mind have always felt the need to let someone know, hence i have decided to send this to you after listening to a ufo segment on the history channel that mentioned mufon. nothing to back up our story but maybe another unknown duck hunter in klosses marsh that early october morning, but being a combat vet of viet nam i knew how choppers and air craft fly.......They don't and can't do what we saw. it is as vivid to me today as any of my life's experiences, yes that includes combat. just needed to share before time takes its toll on my brother or myself. do what you may with this, but i believe it to be important and factual.\r\nglenn

south of the west ave. and dickson st. intersection in downtown fayetteville watching the stars come out. the sun had set not long before and i could barely see blue off to the west. it was a perfectly cloudless evening. it is at that point in time that you can watch the stars just sorta' come out of nowhere. at 9 pm i observed a red glowing object moving into my field of view from just south of due west moving just north of due east. my first thought was that it must be a helicopter because of its altitude and speed. it didn't take long for me to think to myself that it likely wasn't a helicopter because there was no sound and the lighting was unlike any i had seen before (still possibly an apache type military chopper with very little sound, but doubtful because of the colors.)\r\n\r\ni observed this object passively until i realized it was out of the ordinary. at that point i oriented myself at my best guess of due south and clapped off a 40 degree field of view to time the object through. 20 seconds, give or take. the object was situated approximately 35 degrees off the horizon and was the size of a dime at arm's length, or .06' and the object appeared, at best guess, to be 1/4 of a mile south of me moving east. if my (and a couple of coworkers) calculations are correct this means that the object was moving east at an altitude of about 924' above my current elevation of roughly 1,300' at a speed of about 158 mph and was 32' in diameter.\r\n\r\nthe glow of the object was very interesting. it had the appearance of having two separate lights. one on top and one on bottom. the former stayed on constantly while the latter pulsated in brightness without ever going out. while at its brightest i believe i could see the hull of the object in between the two lights. it appeared to be a dull gray behind the red glow. when the object crossed my field of view (due south) however, there was another light. now i was looking at this thing from a left rear perspective and i could see a fairly intense yellowish white glow from behind. (perhaps this is why people seem to think the thing changes colors? changes directional rotation relative to observer, or even pass them leaving them to look at it from another angle?)\r\n\r\nonce again, i have battled with the thought of a helicopter or even perhaps a small aircraft but i cannot see it. the wind was gentle out of the south at about 5mph. if there was anything to hear the wind would have pushed it my way. considering the oddity of the object and the fairly quiet evening even in downtown i am confident i would have heard something... anything. no sound. there was also a passenger jet passing overhead at the same time and in the same field of view but much, much higher. back to the time of day - the passenger jet was high enough in the sky that it was still catching sunlight. i could see the shape of the jet and even a portion of its contrail. the object in question was low enough and close enough to be completely dark other than the glow of the lights.\r\n\r\nat the time of the sighting and afterwards i had no abnormal feelings. i was just really intrigued by the object.\r\n\r\nsince then i have questioned myself about the altitudes and distances a few times but i am confident in my analysis and near 100% on the math.\r\n\r\nthis is the fourth time in my life i have observed what, to me, was a ufo but this was probably the most significant considering i have a firm timetable and measurement process to work from. the other times all caught me off guard and two of them were before i ever joined the military and later became a land surveyor.

bright star-like objects. i saw two again today spaced about 45 minutes apart. i did look periodically throughout the day on my lunch and regular breaks from work, but only saw the two and they were both heading to the south at a leisurely pace again...However the thing is, i know that these objects are just popping up in the sky out of seemingly nowhere because i can cover the entire visible sky in a few seconds visually and suddenly in a spot in the sky that was empty just a second earlier, one of these star-like things show up in it, usually it just sits there for a few seconds and then starts to move. i see other regular aircraft flying at about the same altitude, but they usually leave a contrail and are identifiable, unlike the star-craft things. something is going on here over phoenix and i would sure like to know what the hell it

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Believe me, i am reluctant to report this as i am my own worst critic when it comes to seeing ufo's in the sky, especially since i am so into the ufo phenomenon.  i've seen several strange lights in the sky's over the years, none of which i truly felt i had enough of to classify as a \"ufo\".  however, over the past week and a half, several nights, in the exact same direction and skyline, i have seen this object, which behaves unlike any plane i have ever seen!  the first night, about a week and a half ago, i was walking around 9:00pm at night when, on my way home, after star-gazing, i witnessed off in the distance, probably about 100-150ft. away, i noticed a very strange orangish/fire-colored \"orb\" or \"sphere\" in the skyline just over the tree-line.  i watched it, thinking it was the planet mars or jupiter and then i saw it moving.  but not just moving, but swaying back and forth, going one direction and then the other.  i started walking faster towards the object and realized there may have been more than one, but i wasn't sure.  i kept approaching until i realized i was getting closer and that it wasn't, unlike a plane which continues typically in a single direction until out of sight, wasn't really going anywhere.  it didn't really change brightness much at first, and then, upon cutting thru some yards, as i got closer, i found it again and as i saw it, it started to glow very bright like a fire and then i lost it.  i didn't see it leave, i just lost it.  two nights later, looking in the exact same direction as the other night, i saw the same object in roughly the same place, however i couldn't really track for long.  that same day, just before a hail storm i saw another strange, white object, soar overhead.  now, a few days pass, and then last night, i caught the very same object in the sky, the same place/same time as i had seen it before.  this time, i decided to track it as long and far as i could.  i got my binoculars and started on my way.  it, again, was unlike any plane i'd ever seen.  you could see it easily moving in the skyline, however, it changed direction a multitude of times, sort of diagnolly moving, like it was searching... it seemed to rotate in brightness... getting very, very bright orange at one point, then lighter and lighter until finally, becoming two little \"blips\" of a red dot and a whitish-blue dot... when i first saw the \"dots\" i thought, \"that's gotta be a plane\", but, i've never seen a plane hover in roughly the same area for over an hour!  i tracked it to the school, and then i lost it.  when i found it about 30 yards in the other direction, i peered thru the binoculars, which, when doing so, it appeared as if it were one single \"orb\", which had an orangish-fire color overall, but you could also see red, green, blue and purple colors all within the orange of the orb, not to the sides of it!  again, it moved diagnolly thru the horizon and, on foot, i tracked it for over an hour in roughly a 50-100ft. diameter.  it never went too far and it always came back when it did, always moving back and forth, back and forth in the sky, always getting brighter and brighter until it appeared to be on fire and then getting dimmer and dimmer until only one or two slight little \"dots\" or \"blips\" appeared... but again, it never left the airspace of the general vicinity and continued in a back and forth motion gradually continuing south/southeast until it was too far for me to continue tracking. at one point, however, it did travel much faster across the treetops to the eastern direction. i have never seen this type of thing before, and my only hesitation was that the object was never within a 100 ft. or less from me... but, it always appears in the same spot around the same time everynight, in the south direction just about rochester rd. and 18 mile.

something strange flying straight up at about 15,000 feet moving from north to south over the us capitol dome. the object was bright silver in color, disc shape, moving relatively slow and would stop on occasion- there was a bright white flash emitting from it about every minute or so, we couldn't tell if it was from the object or a reflection off of it. the object was flying in a rather odd pattern- it would stop for many seconds make a sharp left or right movement then start moving straight again. at times it looked like it was moving in a zig zag pattern than it would make right angle turns. sorry, its hard to explain. we couldn't figure out what this was because the area it was flying in was restricted air space. the police officer notified his superior about the object but i don't know what they did from there. the object was literally straight up above the capitol dome and was also seen by the tourist that noticed us looking at it. we watched the object for about twenty minutes until it was out of site toward virginia. sorry it took me so long to report this sighting. i happen to run into the police officer who witnessed this sighting with me, so i decided to finally report it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10369,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8970818,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04162008-0007","longitude":-77.0322758,"occurred":924764400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"District

far more luminous than any insect i've ever seen. they kept flashing and moving at an incredible pace, and i couldn't take my eyes off of them. at first i was frightened, but then i became awash with a sense of sheer awe. the flashing lasted for about 21 minutes, and the whole time i was riveted. the objects were cigar-shaped and, from a distance, i'd estimate that they were about 7 inches long. my whole family watched as they flew around our yard. and all of the sudden, in a massive and bright flash, they disappeared.","distance":"21-100
