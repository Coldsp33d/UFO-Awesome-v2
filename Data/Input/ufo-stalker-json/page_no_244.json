less than 500 ft above the ground and was probably 1/2 mile or so from the rd. the light was silver colored, and had the effect of a strobe light. i am a skeptic, but this is the second unexplainable

it was over my apartment building it seemed to pause or for example when and object moves fast it leaves a tracer...Only way i can think to describe it.  and it paused 3 times that i saw and just kept moving on same path out of sight.  i had the feeling of not believing what i saw.  i thought perhaps it was some kind of remote controlled object maybe but it was completely silent and it made those strange movements/pauses while moving that made no sense to any kind of normal movements for aircraft or remote control toys.  i am still in disbelief.  i told my friends and of course they say it was a remote controlled object...I know it wasn't.  it had to have been around 30 feet wide, shaped like a boomerang but with more curves and some patterns and or windows on the body of it.  it was dark outside around 10:15 pm and quite honestly i did not believe what i saw, i was confused, i did not try to chase after it to look more after it passed over the building.  i just said out loud to myself

brothers looking out the kitchen window. i thought they were looking at me as i arrived home and waved to them. they did not wave back. i proceeded into the house and my mom said, \"come here and look at at this\". as i looked out of of dinning room window facing south on the horizon i saw what appeared to be a pair of headlights in in sky coming at me. as the lights reached the point where they appeared to be just a couple of blocks away (growing in brightness as they approached) they suddenly vanished. there was no profile of a airplane that had turned and the vanishing lights were abrupt.  my mom said, \"look at the horizon\". i did and there were the lights approaching again. i watched with my mom and siblings for twenty minutes as the \"headlights in the sky\" would travel in a straight line from the southern horizon near sac airforce base in bellevue nebraska north towards my house in millard nebraska for 20 minutes. as the lights traveled towards us they became brighter and when they appeared to be just a couple of blocks away they disappeared. as quick as i could move my eyes back to the southern horizon the lights were already there coming north towards us. when the lights disappeared there was no profile visible as though a plane had banked away. as quick as my eyes could go from the lights that had just disappeared to the southern horizon the lights were already visible coming north towards us. at no time could i shift my eyes from the disappearing light down the block to the southern horizon and \"beat the light\" to the horizon. that night on the local news (i believe the news anchor was gary kerr) it was reported that 5,000 people had witnessed the \"lights in the sky\" over southwest omaha. we never called in to report our sighting. \r\ni'm

thought it might be an airplane.  i thought it might be a drone at first glance. but it was too large and too high in altitude to be a drone, i think.  the object made no noise. it seemed to be well above 500 feet at about 80 degrees above the horizon when we first spotted it. the lights were much larger than the usual lights that appear on aircraft, and were brighter than typical aircraft lights.  it was moving slowly. then, when the craft was about 50 degrees above the horizon, the right side lights (3 of them) stopped shining, so that the craft appeared to be a straight line of 4 lights blinking all at the same time. i stopped looking at it when it was about 45 degrees above the horizon. i estimate that it took about 2 minutes to move from 80 degrees to 45 degrees. i really don't know what kind of craft it was, and didn't consider it to be a \"ufo\" at first. i was trying to figure it out, and am submitting my report in order to gain information, if possible.  i didn't lose sight of the craft. i just stopped looking at it.  after the event, i realized i may have viewed a possible ufo.  if i did, it is the first time i have witnessed one.","distance":"Over One

huge ufo- it was surrounded by men with machine guns dressed in military uniforms.  (my friend told me they were machine guns as i would not know)  there were big lights on it the type you see on football fields.  he was a photographer -i want to say for the sun times but i'm not certain on this name.  he always had his camera with him and he shot pictures of it.  i remember asking where is this -it was in a metal fence enclosure and there were buildings there. he said this is back side of nellis afb- he was very excited -i was in shock -we went back how we came- and immediately went to his newspaper where he worked.  he called the head guy sorry cannot remember his name- he said we are going to run it on the first page.  we were there a long time and he gave me 3 copies of the newspaper with the picture of this ufo.  i don't recall how i got home i had called my sitter and said i'd be very late or early evening  morn.  the next morn i called my neighbor and asked her if she got the paper with ufo picture- she said there is no picture of any ufo -i said well i have 3 copies i'llc show you. when i went to get they were gone.  i called my friend it said #disconnected.  i called the paper the girl said no one there by that name.  i went to his apt it was empty!  i never heard from him again!  i was terrified and never told anyone -told my friend it was a dream.  but it was not!  i am 69 years old and even now have only told a handful of people.  it still scares me.  and worse i cannot remember his name!  in fact not long after some stuff faded from my mind. but never what i have written here.","distance":"20 Feet or

of aircraft.  the object was not visible when not flashing.  a second object was then seen flashing brightly but not as apparently large as the first and seemed to over take and then fall behind the first object.  the flashes were incredibly bright and not in a discernible pattern.  i observed that the sun was over my left shoulder and behind me and could not have been reflected back by an aircraft, and also noted that there were no clouds visible that could have caused intermittent illumination by the sun.\r\n\r\nduring the experience i attempted to understand how an aircraft could have produced those flashes, initially it looked like tumbling debris and i was concerned it might have been an aircraft having issues with control, and noted however there was no smoke or evidence of the two objects descending.  a weather balloon was also entertained however i could not surmise how it would produce two separate looking objects flashing out of sequence with each other.    i did go to the flight aware website to see if there were any aircraft travelling in the direction i noted they were moving, all aircraft over head were flying on the high altitude track taking them south west, not south to south east. \r\n\r\nthe objects went out of sight approximately 30-45 degrees over the
