halfway to the fence when a circle of bluish light shone all around me from directly above.  i would say the circle was about 8-10 feet in dia. on the ground.  i looked up and all i could see was the light.  it was bright but it didn't hurt my eyes.  it lasted about 15- 20 seconds, not long, i didn't think anything about it.    this was back in the summer of '68 or '69.  i didn't tell anyone about it because they would think i was looney.\r\n\r\nanyway, that winter, at the spot where the light shone down, the grass stayed green and needed mowing.  i remember my dad getting upset because my mom made him mow that spot just about every week.  that winter was the only one that i remember the grass growing throughout the winter.  it was st. augustine grass. \r\n\r\ni wasn't scared or anything, because i didn't know any better.  i had my head down watching where i was walking so as not to step in dog mess.  then just suddenly, a bluish light circle lit me up.  i looked up and yep, it was a blue light.  it lasted about 15-20 seconds and then it just turned off.  no craft, no nothing, no stucture or anything where the light was.  i was looking at it when it turned off.  there was nothing

dancing around the lead, almost playing with each other. the center craft was maintaing its heading. i saw them in the southwest sky and tracked them to the east till i could no longer see them. there was for but a second i could hardly make out the centers disc outline. it was really odd, yet i was very excited. i have a pilots license and i know what aircraft are capable of and i can identify any commercial, millitary and civilian aircraft, but the speed and the manuvering where unreal. i you were to see all three flying it looked like a wobbling duck with the center craft being the head and its wings were the 2 flanking it. i would estimate that they where less than 3 away miles, and 5,000 to 15,000 feet high and travelling 600-1000+ miles per hour and were completly silent and lasted 20 seconds. this was my first unidentified citing and i was strangly okay with it. i know for certain i will have my head turned towards the heaven much more now.","distance":"Over One

beautiful sunny day around 5:00 pm. after work i would take my  louisville slugger to the bay to hit rocks out into water, watch the sunset, and blow off a long work day. i was watching where my rock would splash down when a ball of light, very bright white, like a welders arc flashed up and out from the water on a thirty degree angle, traveled at least a 1/2 mile or more, wavered for a split second like a wobble, shot back the direction it came from, then back up again on a 55 degree angle traveling two to three times the distance. two more shorter  bursts in  two different directions  then shot out of site at about a 75 degree angle heading ssw. i think this all took about two to three seconds, never seen anything move that fast.  my best guess is that it was  around five miles out or more in the delaware bay the distances where probably alot more then what they appeared to me.  the shape if anything was round and white hot. i stood there in disbelief. i looked down both sides of the beach looking to see if anyone else was there, just me.  i didn' know what to think. when i tried explaining what i had seen to my friends a joke was made. one of my smarter friends told me it was ball lightning.  i thought it was ball lightning  after all was said,  i had never seen ball lightning and it fit.  the need to tell anyone else of this event was put on the shelf 27 years ago. 2008- my children where flicking through the channels six months or so ago  and one of the ufo programs was on, some of the details sounded very familiar to that day 27 years ago. i started investigating ball lightning on the internet and realized that no way was this ball lightning. this realization has led me to this point, one of knowing that what i had witnessed was maybee a once in a life time and that i'm fortunate enough to see it over and over again.   thanks","distance":"Over One

march 19th i hit the jackpot! about 15 or 20 minutes into the 1pm-2pm window of recording, a set of lights begins to emerge from the sheer blackness of space.  as the object comes into view, it seems as if it was emerging from the shadow of the station. the lights are in an area that is clearly not any part of the space station. i couldn't believe my eyes!\r\n\r\nthis craft is only defined by the light from its interior.  the exterior is lost in the blackness of space.  it appears that it is a hatbox circle or oval on top of a \"skirt\" disc/oval which is either dimmly lite from within or from the light reflected from the windows above.\r\n\r\nin the windows of the upper \"hatbox\" there is clearly a light inside behind moving pixels.  everyone who has seen these moving pixels believe them to be \"beings\". the light in these upper windows varies in intensity, as if various lights were being turned on or off. the \"beings\" move about the cabin, at least appear to be moving, because something dark moves in front of the lights time and again.\r\n  \r\nthe nasa people didn't catch this for at least 10 minutes.  when they became aware, they switched cameras.  on a new view of the

20 years to accept what i saw and i now feel a need to report it.  it was on the night of dec. 5, 1988 at 12:05 am.  i layed down in my bed that was situated underneath my window.  i had rolled over to go to sleep and a light shown in my room bright enough that i opened my eyes to see what was going on.  i knew there was nobody that could shine a light in my bedroom window because it was very high off the ground.  so, i sat up and looked around and saw out my window a single point of light in the sky.  it looked to be a bright planet but, it started to move at very high rate of speed across the sky in different directions.  it was no airplane because it could turn on a dime and go in the opposite direction with no pause .... it just flew about the sky with ease.  it never got very close and all i saw was the single point of bright light and when it was finished darting across the sky in no apparent pattern it zipped off to the north and was gone.  i could see the single point of light when it zipped around.  it looked like what you would see when you point a flashlight on a wall and zig zag it around. that is what it looked like to me except it was very high in the sky.  my first reaction when i saw the point of light start moving in an unconventional way was to try to scream.  i would open my mouth but nothing could come out.  i tried and tried as i watched this object dart around in the night sky.  i eventually go out a faint squeal.  then my squeals got louder and louder until i could scream very loudly and my mother came to my room in a panic wondering what was going on.  by the time she came in the object had darted off in the sky.  that night i covered my bedroom window and slept the rest of the night with my mom.  after that i moved my bed to the other side of the room and it took me several years to even have my bed facing a window.  now, i still am weary of looking upon the night sky afraid of what i might see.  here i am 20 years later

on friday april 11, 2008 i had the following experience.  i had just made a freight delivery and was pulling back onto fm 51 headed south/southwest approximately 8 miles south of granbury, texas.  i noticed a light hovering off to my left approximately 35 degrees above the horizon and 30 degrees to my left (slightly east of due south from my location).  my first thought was of the sun reflecting off of a conventional aircraft but as i continued to watch (casually at that point) i realized that the light was not moving and that the source of the light did not seem to be a reflection but rather was a glow emanating from that point.  i then began to observe more closely.  over the next two minutes (approximately) the light diminished in brightness until the well defined outline of an object could be clearly seem.  it was elongated tapering in an arc from a center point to sharp points on either end.  it was approximately 6 to 8 times as long as it was thick at the center point (approximately the shape of a track and field discus as viewed from the side).  i was unable to observe any other dimensions so the exact configuration could not be determined. it could have been a disk shape viewed from the side or an elongated bullet shaped object.  the object then began to recede directly away from me growing smaller but not changing shape or presenting any other view of it that would allow a better description.  i had to look away for a few moments to negotiate a railroad crossing (i was still driving a truck) and when i looked back the object had completely vanished.\r\n\r\nby some dead reckoning based on the objects change in position relative to my truck and the distance traveled before the object began to move away i realized that the object had originally been hovering in the general vicinity of the comanche peak nuclear power plant.  i would say within 2 to 3 miles of the facility and probably over the lake which resides on the north side of the plant.  this estimate of the objects position gave me additional reason to believe that it was not a conventional aircraft in that i am reasonably certain that it was well within the no fly zone which it is my understanding exists around all nuclear power facilities.\r\n\r\nthere was but one other item of interest to report.  that is the fact that approximately 30 minutes after the sighting i realized that i had acquired a significant sunburn on all exposed portions of my body (face, head, neck and arms).  while the sun was shining brightly that day i had not been exposed for any prolonged period; certainly no more so than on any typical day on my job and i rarely get sunburned on my job.  also, i had not felt the sunburn coming on as i normally would.  i simply had a sudden realization that i did in fact have a sunburn.  i really did not at first associate this with the sighting but after both my wife and daughter commented on the unusual degree of sunburn i thought back on it and realized the timing of discovery of the sunburn.  there were no other markings on my body to indicate any other type of contact with the object.  also, there was no lost time as i was on a tight schedule that was not disrupted.  this was not an abduction scenario.\r\n\r\nof some note perhaps is the fact that this incident occurred approximately 25 miles due east of the now famous town stephenville, texas.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

airport.  we left approx.  1830, crossing the local fairgrounds out onto the side of the east/west (unplowed) runway.  we traveled west towards the intersection of the north/south runway, and then followed the n/s runway northly to a cutoff that leads to the dam of hansen lake.  we crossed the dam and went up the hillside, ending up on an abandoned section of road (unplowed), and followed it out crossing the griffen ridge road.  here we parked across from the road in a potato field.\r\n\r\nwe had been there about fifteen minutes talking about school and the lights of the city of presque isle.  the airport was dark, the runway lights at that time were turned on by the houlton flight service station in advance of a departing or arriving aircraft. (note: i grew up at the airport and surrounding navigational stations because my father was the local navaids tech. for the fed aviation agency from 1962 until 1976)and there was only one home across the road next to the \"trail\" we used to get into the field.\r\n\r\ni was looking to my right, towards the south end of presque isle, where us route 1 enters town.  at this time a series of lights in the shape of a cigar appeared out of nowhere, over a point between the university of maine at presque isle and the fairmount cemetary. the lights moved across the sky from the southeast (our right) to the the northwest (our left).  the lights passed over the trees across the road from our field, passing over a mobile home and continued untill reaching the road (trail) that we used to reach our location.  \r\n\r\nit was at this time that the lights stopped, appearing to hover, (or maybe rotate) and then move north up the trail disappearing behind the trees.  we waited about thirty minutes, trying to figure another way home.  we decided that passing over that trail was the only way back so we retraced our path home with no events.  arriving home my neighbor's mother said that she was outside looking in that direction at about the same time and saw strange lights moving in the same direction as our lights.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home i asked my father to check with the flight service station and see if any aircraft were in the area at the time.  fss reported that there were no active aircraft in the area, or any request for the runway lights at the presque isle airport to be turned on that night.  there was no moon that night and the sky was clear with unlimited visiblity.  from the vantage point on the side of creasy/griffin ridge, all of presque isle was visible, in fact one would be able to see into canada.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":10338,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.683233,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04142008-0021","longitude":-68.0100615,"occurred":155030400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,  Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":155030400000,"summary":"Cigar shaped mass of lights swept across sky and disappeared","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Presque Isle, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:381528"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Indianapolis","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live near the indianapolis international airport, just north of us 40, east of 465. there is a flight path that is just north of me that flies practically over me. i see planes coming in this way all the time.  i am a heaven gazer and beleive in ufo's. i've seen several over the years but on this particular night, it was right in my face.\r\n \r\n it was approximately around august 28, 2006. it was a warm, super quiet night. the skies were absolutely clear and you could see stars forver. i just got home from work and backed into the driveway around 12:40 am. i was then looking east. i was sitting in my truck for a few and just taking in the night sky. what happened next really made me a believer. i seen something very huge, dark and moving slow from the left (north) heading south. i jumped out of my truck and was very excited, with jaw dropped. this thing was extremely quiet. you could not hear any noise what so ever. it was the size of a football field long, disc shaped, and as wide as 2 streets (in a housing district). there were no lights at all. it was lower than the planes coming in, flying over the houses. it was like staying on one precise course and heading due south.  i watched this thing until it got past the rooftops and tree lines on the other side of us 40. i was so excited about seeing this, i stayed outside for awhile and was checking the skies for something more. now you have to understand that there is no flight path that goes from north to south in a straight line where i live. \r\n\r\nmy conclusion to this is that it was really indeed an ufo, or the government has a copycat spacecraft out there and spying on all of us.\r\n \r\n\r\na week later i was telling one of my cousins about what i seen the week before and another cousin of mine, who lives the next street over (east of me) jumped up and freaked out. he said he seen it too and he even told me the time he seen it, which collabarated with my time. he described it the same as i did. he is a night owl and just happened to be outside smoking.

that friday and it was still somewhat light out.  the street lights hadn't came on yet.  i turned east onto beasely rd and as i got close to the entergy power plant. i noticed the object over the treetops. i noticed it because of the lights and because it wasn't moving at all. at first i thought that it might be a light on a radio tower but then i noticed that there was a tower much farther to the right and it had a single red light on it. i pass this way everyday to and from work so i immediately noticed it. it was right past the entergy power plant on beasely road on the right hand side.  as i kept going towards it i kept thinking that it couldn't possibly be what i thought it was.  it scared the hell out of me because i knew that it wasn't a helicoptor or plane because there were no wings or rotors and it was circular. also there was no sound.  i kept looking at it as i was slowly driving.  after about 100 hundred feet or so i pulled over so that i could get out of my car and look at it.  it was right above the treetops the whole time with the lights circling it.  it appeared to be at least a quarter mile in width. as i stopped my car i was still looking at it through my windshield. i opened my car door and stood up and it had disappeared in the 10 seconds or so that it took me to open door and get out.  i looked around in a complete circle and saw nor heard anything. i was so nervous and scared when i got back into the car because i didn't know where it had went to or in what direction.  i was so scared that night that i couldn't sleep. i stayed up all night with the lights on. for the 2 weeks following the incident i barely slept. i would finally go to sleep around 2am and then have to be up at 6am to get ready for work.  i told all of my co-workers and managers about it but they all just laughed at me.  i also told friends and family and no one believed me.","distance":"101-500

coranado islands. anyway it was initially very far up in the sky but it was so big it looked close. i remember as it started to decend it was pulsing in the center and the perimeter. like a sound speaker vibrares as sound is comming from it. it also had a cloud like aperature on the top of it in a 12 noon postion. like a mine solar flare. it took a long time for it to decend. but it never stopped pulsing like it was sending a signal or something,eventually it came to a stop. then started parallel movemet to the ground. for about ten minutes. then took off not real fast but faster than in had decended. i do not know how long it was there before i saw it but it lasted for 45 min. to an hour after i saw it.I called for the neighbors to come out but no one would come out and look at it. it was not in the news that night. or on t.V. i do not know how you could miss it. the wierd thing was the pulsing, and the strange cloud of orange vapor cloud or whateever it was. also the shear
