ufo films on tv.  i was driving home late at night from my grandchildren's home, and just as i got near my house, i looked straight down the street into the sky and saw this very bright fireball in what appeared to be a fast moving downward motion, with the streak of a fiery tail behind it.  the part i later thought about was that it was larger than any tiny falling comet i have seen in the past, way up in the atmosphere.  this looked close to earth and it was a bright light green color. the color around the edges and in the tail were more of a light yellow.  it was moving very fast, so i was not able to study it but a second or two.  i didn't think much of it at the time except to think what a neat experience to see something like that from the heavens.\r\nthen, later, when watching a segment on the history channel about the ufo sightings by two different men and the films they took, it came to my mind that this object looked very similar.  so thought i would report it. i had to guess at the date and the time (they are approximate) because i did not think of any significance relating to it until some time later (approx. 3 weeks). \r\nthank you,\r\njacqueline

in rockford illinois to the local root beer barrel.  the 16 year old witness interviewed, now 58 years old, glanced to the west and saw a small light blink about 50 yards away and 50 yards up.  the two boys turned to look at the light which started to decend directly towards them blinking at a rate of about once every three seconds.  the witness estimated the speed of the object at about 1 foot per second.  the object approached to about chest level and then started circling them at the same rate of speed for about 15 revolutions.  the object departed on a reverse course of it's entry but with an alternating left right zig-zag course blinking until they lost sight of it. \r\n\r\nthe object was described as about 5mm in diameter, a matte black sphere with four segments.  the segments were quarter spheres but were not delineated by lines or indentations.  the lower rear quarter away from the direction of motion emitted a light green light about once every three seconds that lasted less than a second in duration.  the object approached to within three feet, close enough to reach out and touch it.  the boys were afraid of the object and decided to toss one of their 4th of july firecrackers at it.  this they did tossing it near the object.  the object then left on the aforementioned zig-zag course. \r\n\r\nthe younger witness does not remember the incident and was not present.\r\n\r\nthis older witness also gave field investigator richard sherertz and myself a chapter from a book that his daughter in law is writing that described a similar sized ufo that blinked and came through a closed glass window.  the older witness seemed to think that this sighting twelve years later was the same object that he had seen.  i can't speak to the similarity without interviewing the daughter in law but i did relate a ball lightening incident that i had reported to me and that it also had penetrated a closed glass thermopane window.\r\n\r\ni mention this to indicate that this family has had some experience with ufo sightings.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

top of the stack, top to the bottom. then one by one from the top of the stack, they took off at a phenomenal speed heading west, but the objects flew in a mild \"s\" pattern almost like a snake path, instead of flying in a straight line. they all kept an equal distance from each other as they headed west. at the altitude they appeared at this was a faster speed than any conventional aircraft could fly at. i would say 10,000 mph + to take a wild guess. we lost sight of the objects after they had flown west. the entire time the objects appeared at a very high altitude, most likely out of the

program the other night in which it was released that ufo sighting in the stephenville area actually began to increase in the beginning of december. \r\n   at this point, i am still a bit unsure of the date and time, but i can find out more precise information if needed. let me disclose that i am ex-military, with 4 years experience with, on, and around military aircraft...Everything from a-6's to u-2's. that being said, i am at a loss for what i witnessed this night. \r\n   it was a thursday night and i was traveling to my deer lease on the edge of brown county. i live in dallas, but i had been down south the days leading up and to thursday for work. i decided to take friday off to enjoy a three day weekend deer hunting.  \r\n   i turned off of mills county road 574 outside the town of goldthwaite and began heading north on mills county road 531. because i was near the county line dividing mills and brown county it's not possible to tell if i was still on 531 or brown county road 267 where the event happened. as you travel from mills county on cr 531 into brown county, the road then becomes cr 267. it was very dark and i had never traveled from this particular direction before, so it is hard to determine where exactly i was in relationship to recognizable landmarks.\r\n   as i was traveling northward, i suddenly noticed a brilliantly bright white light flickering through the darkened silhouette of trees. it was on the left side of the road which in relation would be northwest i'm guessing, and it appeared to be approximately 100-200 yards ahead of me, again on the left side of the road.  i slowed down and rolled down my window to investigate. the light was intensely bright with the primary color being white with hues or flashes of orange or red. it was so bright and appeared with such little warning that my first thought was that a plane had just crashed. i began to try to rationalize the information but became more puzzled when i realized that i hadn't heard an explosion or and audible signature of a crash of any kind. this is an extremely rural area that is very sparsely populated. as i continued slowly ahead i kept trying to find a break in the trees to get a better look at the object. at this point i was still trying to find and evidence that this was not what i was beginning to think it was, a ufo. i thought for a second that it could be an electrical fire. but i quickly dismissed this when first i didn't hear the patented arcing and tracking noise that accompanies a high voltage phase fault, nor did i see the characteristic blue-white flashing flames. i finally stopped after i had gotten almost parallel with the light and kept squinting through the openings in the brush and trees. suddenly, as quickly as it had appeared, it stopped with-out a trace. i turned off my truck and listen as intently as i could with my mind racing for an explanation. i grabbed my cell and called a friend of mine who is familiar with the area. i was explaining to him what i had experienced and that i wanted him to keep an eye out on the news for a plane crash near my deer lease. \r\n   we had been talking for maybe 3 minutes when i notice several helicopters approaching. i could hear them as well as see the navigation strobes. they approached from approximately the north west in no particular formation. once near i counted at least ten helicopters in the immediate area. the oddest thing about their presence was that many of the aircraft had its search light scanning the terrain. they seemed to have been focusing their interest a bit north and west of my location and never came closer than 300-400 yards of my truck. after several minutes of loitering in the area they began to continue westward over a high ridge until out of my sight. the presence of the helicopters urged me to consider two explanations to the event. either an aircraft crashed and didn't make a sound, extinguished itself after approximately 4 or 5 minutes, and incinerated itself to-where no evidence was left behind. or, i had witnessed a ufo of some sorts and the attempt of several military aircraft to find it and or track it. \r\n   i don't know what i saw that night, but i know many things it wasn't. the object seemed to be hovering near the ground but at the time i couldn't tell how near. the next day i re-traced my step as best as i could. most of the area tree wise is made up of mesquites with hardwoods sporadically sprinkled in. the common characteristic of a mesquite tree is that is doesn't grow nearly as tall as lets say an oak. the terrain in other words was fairly low. from ground level the average tree line could be anywhere from 12-20' tall with the occasional hardwood tree cluster being considerable taller. whatever i witnessed never appeared above the trees, but at the same time it didn���t appear to be on the ground and or stable in movement. it seemed to float in a specific area not so much swaying but increasing and decreasing in size as the intensity of the light pulsated, never blinking or strobing, but pulsing slowly shades of white and orange-red. \r\n   i would like to stress that i never got an un-obstructed view of the object and that i make no claims as to what it was other than \"un-identifiable. i did find the presence of so many helicopters in the immediate area so quickly very conspicuous and interesting and that is the only motivation to file this report. anybody can claim they saw something in the sky that can't be substantiated by third parties. military aircraft, or any earth bound aircraft for that matter can't fly without leaving evidence of their actions. i also so think it's interesting all this happened in such close proximity to a military training facility. the national guard training grounds are just a few miles up the road on the west side of cr 267. this event was certainly in a civilian area but close enough to military instillations to cause me concern.\r\n   i doubt this has any bearing but i do remember as i was on the phone and as the helicopters were leaving the area, a white ford diesel coming from the opposite direction passed me heading south towards cr574.","distance":"101-500

schleicher county tx. that evening my wife took her first deer and we brung the animal back to camp and rounded everyone up from the evening hunt. my wife and son went into the cabin to start dinner as my dad and my father in law and i cleaned the buck. it was just after dark about 7:15 in the evening as we wrapped up with the deer.  as the three of us walked from our cleaning table to the cabin my father in law said \"look at that shooting star.\"  when i looked up to the north in the sky what i saw still makes my hair stand on end.  as i looked up i saw three balls of yellow light moving from east to west i would guess it was within a hundred miles and about the size of a beer bottle cap at arms length in the sky. they were moving maybe faster than a plane but not streaking fast. the objects were perfectly spaced apart and moving together slightly upward from east to west. my father and i looked at each other with shock and disbelief.  the yellow balls moved across the sky for about 15 to 20 seconds and then what happened i still cannot understand or rationalize.  i don't believe or disbelieve in these things but i wish i had not seen this and it still bothers me very much.  as the three balls of light moved across the sky they had a light blue glow around the outside of the three and suddenly the first ball punched a hole into the sky. i know that sounds unimaginable but it is the only way i know to describe it.  it was like throwing a ball into black water. when the first ball flashed out of sight the other two followed so fast they looked like a solid streak of yellow light. when the streak of light went into the \"hole in the sky\" it flashed shut and a purple blip of light shot across the sky in both directions for what i guess to be hundreds of miles.  it looked like when you turn off a television and that purple line shoots across the screen.  i have seen dozens of shooting stars and meteors. i have seen the shuttle come back in a couple of times. i got to see haley's comet when i was a kid but i have never seen anything at all like what i saw that night. i think about it a lot and as many guys that deer hunt that area that time of year i know my dad and father in law and i were not the only ones to see it.  i don't know what we seen that night but i cannot imagine that it was man

eastern sky, watching planes go by, and looking at what stars i could see. it was about 8:25 pm when i saw something that looked at first like it was an airplane without the red & blue wing lights. it was a large bright light. as i paid closer attention, i realized that the brightness of the light couldn't be a plane because at the size of the light, i should have been able to hear a plane. i had been watching and listening to them all night, as they flew through the sky. because of the nearby mountains, the sounds of the planes are very discernable. the bright light made no noise, and i started to think that it was just a super bright planet that i maybe hadn't noticed earlier, when i then realized that it had moved. it dipped down and then moved in a horizontal manner to the south, then it stopped and seemed to be hovering, as the light was not increasing or decreasing in size. then it dipped again and moved horizontally again. this is about when i started to think it was maybe something really strange but i didn't know how long it would be up in the sky, and i was afraid to go grab my camera. i didn't want to take my eyes off of the bright light in the sky. the object then dipped and moved about one or two more times, and then i watched as the light started to dim and then disappear entirely into a tiny dot and then vanished, without the sense that it had flown away. it simply faded away. i ran into the house at this point and called my husband on the phone. it was 8:28 pm when i called him. the whole \"event\" only lasted a few minutes. i didn't see the object again. i've seen meteor showers, a comet and many different planes and helicopters because i live between two international airports. the thing i watched in the sky didn't behave like anything i have ever seen in the night sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path

share this because i don't want to be considered a crack-pot by my community, but i just have to tell someone.  my husband and i were on our way back home after attending a retirement seminar at the monument inn restarant near baytown, texas.  it was a very dark night, with no moon.  we were eastbound of hwy 565 south between 9-9:30pm.  we came to the 4-way stop at the intersection of 565s, and hwy.3180 just south of mont belvieu, texas.  while we were at the stop sign i saw a triangular object come up fast on our left.  it was flying low, approx. 10-15ft. off the ground.  it slowed and hovered next to our vehicle probably 3 car lengths to our left for 15-20 seconds, then at a very high rate of speed shot off at a 45 degree angle away from us headed north/northeast cruising low over the housetops along 3180 before we lost sight of it.  it was headed in the direction of an area of new construction where rice fields had existed in the recent past.  i asked my husband what that was,...Could it have been a plane, and he said \"planes can't move that fast\".  i asked him to turn north along 3180 and follow it to see if it had crashed, but he said \"no, lets go home\".  (he now says he doesn't remember seeing anything and denies saying it was faster than a plane. he is in denial, but i remember vividly what it looked like.) \r\nthe object was totally silent...It made no noise at all.  the inside area of the triangle was very dark...Emitting no light, (almost as though it absorbed it) yet the outside perimeter of the vehicle was encased in a glowing cylidrical neon green light source.  the neon glow extended out away from the craft, but the light didn't reveal details as to the structure of the inner area of the triangle.\r\ndid anyone else see anything like it in our area?

time.\r\n15 minutes after the last car pulls out of the parking lot, my girlfriend and i were standing on the footbridge that crosses sucker creek (now known as oswego creek).\r\n\r\nwe were facing the willamette river, looking in the direction towards oregon city. it was a cloudless night and i looked up at the stars.\r\n\r\ni noticed one of the \"stars\" appeared to be moving. \"look over there - a satellite\" i said to my girlfriend.\r\n\r\nwe stood on the bridge and watched it move along for a minute or so. it seemed like the closer it moved in our direction, the lower in altitude it was. it was at about a 65 degree angle to us originally, now it was obviously not a satellite. it was flying above the willamette river, following the river's path towards portland.\r\n\r\nwe walked to the end of the footbridge to watch it. the object was now directly over the river from the park.\r\n\r\nat this point the object slowed way down and was no longer just a light in the sky.\r\n\r\nit looked to be about as large as small plane or a car.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared round on the underside and had a slight metallic shine. it emitted a slightly greenish/blue light around it, but you couldn't tell where it was coming from.\r\n\r\nfor a few seconds, the object seemed to change shape towards the top of it. to my eyes, it appeared to take on the shape of a dark greenish angel with a gargoyle type face, then changed back to the disc shape again.\r\n\r\ni could hear a very low pitched humming noise coming from it. not real loud. you could \"feel\" the noise more than you could hear it.\r\n\r\nat this moment the object changed directions and flew towards us at a very slow speed.\r\n\r\nit flew what appeared to be maybe 15-20 feet above the old iron furnace and stopped to the left side of it.\r\n\r\nwe are off the footbridge now and are standing in the parking lot.\r\n\r\nafter the object stopped moving, it seemed to take on a brighter bluish color. it seemed to not come from it, but around it.\r\n\r\nwe stood there stupefied. i instantly knew that \"they\" (whatever \"they\" were) knew we were watching.\r\n\r\nthe object seemed to be bathing us in this bluish light. i felt warm all over.\r\n\r\nat this point i seemed to have some sort of telepathic contact with the object.\r\n\r\ni could not hear an actual voice in my head, but more like the feeling of an instant memory. that's about as close as i can describe it.\r\n\r\nsome of what i remember them \"saying\":\r\nthey were in the area to examine the atmosphere.\r\nthey were on this earth to witness the second coming of christ.\r\n\r\nat this point, i had a dis-belief of what i was seeing and the \"voice\" said, \"here is a signal to you, so that you will know we were really here.\"\r\n\r\nat the very moment i \"heard\" this, small green lights lit up on the object. starting at the bottom right, and coming on one at a time until it reached the top. then two larger red lights in the center of the object came on and flashed a few times.\r\n\r\nthen the \"voice\" said, \"we are going to come down to you into the parking lot and take you up with us.\"\r\n\r\nat that moment i was terrified and thought back to them \"if you do that, i will go insane!\"\r\n\r\nat the very moment i thought this, the blue light that was bathing us turned off and i was cooler again. the red lights went out and then the green lights went out one at a time (in the opposite direction they came on).\r\n\r\nthe object then started shaking violently back and forth, then shot at extremely fast speed down and to the right.\r\n\r\ni thought to myself \"oh no, it's going to crash!\" it flew behind a tree but i raced out into the parking lot to see it going down.\r\n\r\nright before it would have crashed, the object sort of melted (heat-wave look) away into nothing and was gone.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend later said she could not remember anything that happened after the blue light hit us. she said she felt frozen in her footsteps and could not move until the object was gone.\r\n\r\nthe next day i had a slight sunburn on my face even though it was february.\r\n\r\nsee attached pictures for more

of 10 x 10 and a neighbor had her 10 x 50s. by this time it was getting bigger and bigger still just a very bright light. there were children and they were frightened and it was getting very chilly and dark.  inside on the south side of the house were two very large windows. we were switching the glasses around so everyone could see.. some couldnt find it but when i received the big glasses ..Whow..I saw a sometimes flat saucer shape and other times a football shape as i suppose it turned up and down.  a few minutes later it was close enough to see the real thing...It was huge with a ring of flashing green lights around the top of the saucer and flashing blue lights on the bottom or vise versa but it had red firing jettisons from top and bottom on each end and i was amazed to see across the top it appeared to be a halo. some entense bright light coming out of the top. it was very colorful and very active. there wasnt supposed to be a star between those two peaks but there it was.  why have i written this?  i am 71 and know it needs to be told before i die or loose my mind.  this is fact and people can go to the west usa and do their own searching but take something powerful to look through..I visited my sister in alpine texas and noticed a pink glow to an eradic moving star and before i could get my sister it dashed behind another star.. look for a pink glow that moves..Stars dont move.  i suppose the pink cast color comes from the jettisons. stars are very white white with a tinze of blue..People in phoenix aiz. do it this way. they get a blanket a dusk

north to south direction for about six to seven seconds not thinking much of it, but then to my suprise it took a sharp angle turn towards the west as it speed up quickly.  it then took another sharp turn east and then another north.  the three sharp turns and distance traveled were done in under 2 seconds.  after the turns it then shot out into space, away from earth at very fast speed.  it kind
