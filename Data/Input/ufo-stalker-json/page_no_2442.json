house.  it was going south to north which was left to right.  i knew immediately in was extraordinary so i started to run for the house to get my camera.  after a few steps i decided that it would take too much time to get the camera so i ran to the side of my house hoping to focus and get as much visual detail as possible with the time left.  as i turned the corner i heard what sounded like a jet engine but the sound level was very low.  that did not make sense because this thing seemed to be only 500 to 1000 feet above me.  the other thing that didn't make sense was that i had ran 15 yards and the object had moved only half the length of the house.  i have since estimated that it must have been traveling about 25 miles per hour or even less.  i stood there looking almost straight up at it.  i focused on the lights.  the configuration of the lights was rectangular with 3 white lights forward and 3 lights rearward with the center one flashing red.  to count the forward lights i had to move my head considerably from left to right.  the distance between the left most and right most light was 3 feet aal.  i focused on the left forward light.  it was glowing white with no hotspots.  the light was square with rounded corners.  it actually seemed to have a raised bubble like lens and not flat.  all six lights were shaped like this.  then i tried to see passed the lights to the object itself.  i tried to see the object in every imaginable shape but the configuration of the lights did not outline a shape.  the night was very dark and the object black.  i never did see an outline of the object nor surface features, only the rectangular lighting configuration.  that was frustrating and object would soon be gone so i walked away.  turns out my neighbor across the street saw the same object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

object. i was star staring, and there suddenly appeared a new star in the sky, in a what appeared to be a dark area with no stars. i thought that i just hadn't noticed it before, and that it was just a regular star. then i noticed that the object was emanating a red and blue glow.  not purple, but different spots of red and blue around it were forming. the object gradually (over the course of about 15 seconds) flashed red blue and white itself. it zigzagged at first, then surprised me when it went form star to star at impossible speeds. it looked as though making a hand outline. then it returned to the original spot for about 25 minutes. my feelings were similar to that of someone who has been reading about and looking at pictures of comets their entire life, but never seen one, and then did with a telescope, but only one other person saw it at all. that's about how i felt. i then told my mother (during the sighting) what i saw, and asked her what it was. she said that  she had no idea what it was. i told her that we were near arizona's borderline, and that arizona was a hotspot for ufos (roswell, sodona, etc, etc.). she watched it out of the corner of her eye while driving, and agreed that it was a ufo. i then tried to submit this report to mufon on her iphone, but her iphone was what i call \"weirding\". it would have wifi, then not, then the touchscreen wouldn't work, and so on and so on. we lost sight of the object when we took a turn, saw it for a few more seconds, then it just disappeared. like out of thin air, or something. as soon as it left, her iphone worked again, but i hate the touchscreen, so i decided to wait until we got home for me to submit this sighting. thank you for reading this true and miserably accurate sighting report.    \r\nthe picture

10-15 minutes away. the highway on cedar creek is highway 21 and from my house, just a few miles from the sr-71. west on 71 is the austin bergstom airport. \r\n\r\n i am well aware of commercial, private and military airplanes and helicopters that follow a regulated flight through the area. there is a light beacon on the intersection of 21 and 71 for the air traffic guidance.\r\n\r\nmarch 12th, 2008 on saturday at 11:49 p.M. i simply looked up into the night sky as i always do when getting into my car to go to work at midnight. it was a beautiful night, clear sky and plenty of stars to view, which is why i look up into the night sky. however upon my curiosity, i saw a glowing star behind our house several miles away in the horizon. at first i was thinking this was a plane with it's main front beams. i see that a lot from the direction the planes are coming from so they can land at the airport. this object was more intense than a normal aircraft beam. it seemed to have more spectrum to the light. \r\n\r\nthis caught my curiosity, but i didn't think too much of it. it was fairly far away and i had to get to work. then i pulled out of the neighborhood to highway 21 and there was the object. how it got to that point in just a mere minute or so really intrigued me. so now it's on the other side of highway 21. i watch it closely as i'm driving east towards bastrop very closely. the object then starts going in the same direction as if it is following me or reading my thoughts. i lose track of it for a minute and i come across the entrance to highway 71. i see the object had moved very far on the other side of highway 71. as i get onto 71, the object then heads east as i'm heading. at this time i realize, this is getting a little freaky. several cars start to catch up to me from farther back. at this point it was above my car, but i couldn't see it. i looked vividly in my rear view mirrors, but there was now nothing in the night sky. it vanished. \r\n\r\ndescription of the object:  no material matter was witnessed. it was star like and had absolutely no other forms lights. no flashing lights, no smaller wing lights. nothing, just a star like appearance that could reach impossible distances at speeds that i have never seen any plane achieve. i have never seen a ufo before in my life. i have always thought it was an interesting subject, but never had any reason to fully believe it was real until i saw this star like object. \r\n\r\ni have watched ufo shows and abductions from ufo's following families and such. this made me scared when the ufo was following me, because my wife is pregnant and due in only a few days. the thought of something coming into the house and doing experiments on my family is something i would definitely not want.\r\n\r\ni try to remain skeptical, because it's not concrete evidence, but i do remain more cautious about what is in the sky now.","distance":"Over One

clearwater, kansas on our way home to wichita, kansas in october 1966. approximately at 8 p.M when we were approaching the railroad tracks to the left of our car, we observed a very dark oval or egg shaped object hovering above the railroad tracks.  we all asked at the same time, \"what is that?\"\r\nthe object started moving in the direction of our car, flying very smoothly and slowly over the top of our car.  it then stopped in mid air to the right of our car, on the passenger side.  a very bright beam of light lit the entire inside of our car. this object was completely silent and made no noise of any kind.\r\n\r\nmy brother had completely stopped the car to observe this object. my mother also was staring at it.  i reacted with extreme fear and just felt paralyzed and unable to move or say anything for what could have been a minute or two. i finally said to my brother, \"don't just stare at it, just go\".  \r\n\r\nabout that time, this object turned it's beam of bright light out as it flew straight up into the air at a very fast speed and then just seemed to fold into the atmosphere, in other words disappear within one or two seconds. my mother made the comment, \"that was fast\".\r\n\r\nafter we arrived home, my mother made a phone call to the air force base that was located close to where we lived. they denied knowing anything about it and we never found any answers to what it might have been.\r\n\r\nmy brother and mother are no longer living and after all these years, i am left wondering what this very unusual object was that we observed that night. i was 18

them and kept walking we stopped as they were rather peculiar and so we watched them for awhile and decided to take a few photo's and a video with our camera.  the video was done with a camera that could only take short 15 sec or so video's so it did not turn out very well, the pictures did not really turn out at all.  we at first thought that the objects were just planes but decided that they did not move like planes and there were no sounds that seemed like planes, it was relatively quiet.  there were 4 lights that when we first noticed them formed a row with, from ground perspective, had maybe a cm or so of length in between each light (different lengths in between each).  the lights glided in a slow motion sort of way we had never seen before until they formed a triangle shape and then a perfect square (we started taping as they were moving into the square shape).  the perfect square formation stayed and hovered for a few seconds and then two lights faded and were just gone.  the remaining two lights (length side of the square) stayed in place for a few seconds as well and then also faded and were gone until there were no lights left. while watching this we did not feel that these lights moved in any way like a plane and are still not really certain what they were or what we saw. the video is poor quality but you can kind of see the square formation at the very end.
