at the stars, i noticed one that was moving side to side in a fast and eratic motion. i then observed approximately 8 other bright starlike objects making similar moves, side to side, up and down and zig zag motions. all of the objects i observed were completely silent.  while one of the ufos remained stationary, i looked through my binoculars and could see that they were round and had red and white lights rotating around the the edge of them.  at approximately 12:45am i then observed large v shaped object moving in a northerly direction. this object was at least a half mile in length from the apex of the v to the end sides. it also moved in complete silence and then, i observed approximately 30 red colored round shapes exit from the apex of the triangle and form a line over a mile long directly in front of the triangle.  the triangle had two rows of white light on each side of it.\r\nthe red line of red ball shaped objects had the ends of the line in about 45 degree angles.  both v shaped ufo and red lined ufos made a coordinated turnd to the west moving at a slow speed. then the v shaped object just disappeared and the red ball objects continued to move in a westerly direction. on the nights of apri 5th and 6th i observed the same starlike objects making the same movements. as an ex-pilot and retired police officer, i am certain that these objects were not conventional aircraft.\r\non apri the 7th while returning to oklahoma and traveling east on interstate 40 one of these star like objects stayed to the south of us following us for over an hour.  i was able to see very bright white lighted orbs at ground level moving in eratic motions around houses and in some of the tree lines that were less than a mile from the highway. i have a theory as to exactly what it was i saw, but i will only speak to a mufon investigator on that subject.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":10269,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.076745,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04112008-0014","longitude":-111.3137147,"occurred":1207371540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,

victorville to barstow at appx. 7:00 pm. a few min. after crossing the mojave river i noticed two lights to the west of quartzite mountain. they were pink in color. quartzite mountain has several radio/transmission towers on its summit but these lights were too far to the west and too high to be on the mountain. the light on the right was higher than the one on the left. after only a few seconds the left light dissapeared then the right dissapeared as well. this got my attention and i kept glancing back at the mountain as i passed it. the mountain was on my left. when the mountain was at my 8:00 a bright flash went vertically straight down. it began above the elevation of the mountain and passed in front of it. it had the appearance of a shooting star, but 1. it passed in front of the mountain and 2. it was overcast to the west. involuntarily, i said to my self, \"something is going on.\" no kidding, sherlock. not more than a few min. later, i saw a bright light above the horizon to the west. it was a white light with a red light on the bottom. both lights were solid. the object would dissapear and then instantly reappear several miles down the road to the north-west, still above the horizon. it dissapeared then reappeared three times. after the third time the activity stopped. all this occured between the stoddard wells exit and the hodge road exit on i-15. i have seen some interesting things since moving to the mojave desert two years ago from pennsylvania, but this event takes the cake. i can't explain it but when i saw the first two lights i knew they were not \"normal\". no aircraft i know uses pink id lights, nor do they dissapear and reappear in an instant many miles from where they were a moment ago. i am a teacher, and a pretty cool customer (i teach middle school!), but for the rest of the night i was pretty shaken up about what i saw. i know i couldn't have been the only person on i-15 that saw what i saw that night. i hope someone else will come foward with this experience too.

larger...From that height i'd say around 15 ft. long. what grabbed my attention  was that it was no plane...There were no wings..No noise and whereas the two birds far below rocked and swayed on the slight breeze this object never moved. it was at an odd angle as well. it wasn't horizontal or vertical it was tilted at a 45* angle. i watched for a few minutes. i remember chuckling to myself that if it was some sort of craft that if they were watching me they must think what a waste of time it was for me to mindlessly go round and round on that machine.The day was partly cloudy, so the sun would peek out and then go behind hazy high clouds. i observed that even when the sun hit the object there was no shine to it, as you would expect with metal. it was so odd and then, as i looked from the ground to it's position, to try to figure out how high it was it was gone. i saw no movement, it just vanished. i would have posted this before now but i was anxious to see if someone else would post something. odd. odd. i only told my husband about it, and that was after thinking about it for a day.I will also go ahead and post a strange sighting i had as a little girl while i'm here.

thoughts at that moment about what could be going on with my son and what could be causing him to see things and then i see what he's pointing at, right in front of my face, about three hundred yards out, a flying metal ball becomes apparent as it crosses from a back drop of white cloud to grey cloud (my son says he first noticed it as it crossed from a backdrop of blue sky to white cloud). it was a highly reflective metal orb. once i saw it cross from white to grey the shape and the detail of what it was became perfectly apparent it was a perfectly round , perfectly reflective flying metal ball. the ball seemed to move slowly and began to grow bigger for a very brief moment and then it rolled and began moving across the sky in a north east direction until it moved behind a tree and was gone. \r\ni felt surprisingly unsurprised by it. for some reason it seemed almost normal it wasnt magical and it wasnt like somthing out of a movie. once i could see it i understood it completely. it was a sphere, it was flying and it was disguising itself by reflecting the surrounding sky i also immediately understood that there is most likely plenty of them out there all of the

another set of fighter jets took off, made a note of this because i love to hear and watch the jets, i always say \"go get em boys\" and \"be safe\" and they make a very distinct sound when flying\r\n\r\n7:00pm kept hearing them fly over\r\n\r\n7:30pm after hearing the jets constantly flying over went outside, watched them for a bit making a large oval patterns\r\n2 fighter jets flying in formation in a large oval north and south direction 700-1000 ft altitude\r\n2 other fighter jets flying in formation in a large oval east and west direction 700-1000 ft altitude\r\nboth sets of jets flying in a counter-clockwise direction if looking up at them from the ground\r\nused binoculars to look at the jets they had a blue lighted cockpit (not a bright light) watched for 30-45 minutes \r\ngut feeling was something is out of the ordinary that this just isn't right they do not fly training missions on a thursday night over a heavily populated area that low\r\n\r\n8:00-8:15pm went back inside to help my wife put the boys in bed\r\n\r\n8:45-9:00pm got dressed in heavier clothes (cold out that night) and went outside fighter jets are still flying at the same level same direction. nothing else in the sky at that altitude i did see jets at a very high altitude flying what looked to be a grid pattern 2 north to south with the red and blue marker lights and 15 minutes later 2 east to west with red blue marker lights( those could have been commercial jets not sure to high of an altitude to tell)\r\ncommercial aircraft were still going to the airport but they were staying west of town, had a scanner on to listen to aircraft and i did hear a pilot tell the tower \"all we have seen is just a little light show tonight\"\r\n\r\n9:30-10:00pm in the middle of where the fighter jets were flying i saw bright white light like some one flipped a switch it was stationary for a split second before it shot up and out going out of the atmosphere in a sw direction at about 60 degrees there was a light trail behind it as it left it looked solid,holding your arms out it was about 6-8 inches \r\ni guess the best way to explain would be take one of those triangles from school face south hold your arms up and out at a 45 degree angle with the straight part of the triangle on the right side and the 60 degree angle on the left.\r\ni almost fell off my deck when i saw this \r\nabout 45 seconds later another object exact same thing from almost the exact same position just slightly more to the west and at about 4 inches up the trail of the other object that trail only lasted a split second but to give you an idea of the second object/lights position. the 2nd object/light took off up and out at a 30-40 degree angle in a sw direction also, again same thing face south use a triangle with the straight part on the right and the 30 degree angle on the left, up and out of the atmosphere\r\n\r\n10:15-10:30pm fighter jets landed\r\n\r\nnot sure what i saw gut feeling like i said something was very different, not right, i do not belive that the fighter jets were flying a training mission over a heavily populated area, i do not belive that whatever those lights/objects were anything coming into the atmosphere, they  were goin out, i have seen plenty of falling stars that was not it, i do not belive that it was space junk coming into the atmosphere either. the light was bright like melted metal and bright white. that night it was clear and dark. as goofy as it sounds it reminded me of a craft going into warp drive.","distance":"Over One

at the very top of a cultisac and right in the middle. also the street is on a hill. so im right at the top in the middle. i was smoking a cigarrette and listening to the radio, looking up at the sky like i like to do on occassion. a plane's flashing lights caught my eye and i watched it for a minute or to as it faded into the distance. it was to my right very high up and heading north. a bright light then caught my eye to my left. i looked at it and at first i thought it was either a car's headlights or a street lamp in the distance. but within a second from me initially seeing it; it began pulsating. at first i thought it had to be a plane. but when i looked up there were many planes in the sky but the're lights were flashing and had at least one that remained on at all times. this thing however was completely different. it wasn't flashing at all, no strobe effect. this thing was pulsating which was really weird. it's hard to explaing but it very gently got brighter then gradually got dimmer then would turn off completely then start up again. at first i thought it was a street lamp also because it appeared to be motionless. but as i watched it i notiched it was actually moving. it moved up and down left to right only about 5 feet at a time. then i realized i had my flashlight in my car so i grabbed it. the flashlight is pretty bright it puts out one million lumens. and this thing was not far at all. i know this was probably stupid but, i got the flashlight pointed it at the object and blinked it in unison with the objects pulsating lights. right when i did this, this thing stopped in it's tracks. i took this chance to run upstairs and get my camcorder. when i got upstairs my sister was still awake and so i yelled for her to see this thing throught the window. she was stunned when she saw the way it was moving and the way it was pulsating. we watched it for about a minute and a half until it was out of sight. i was determined to get this on video so i ran outside in the front to film  it but it was nowhere in sight. this thing was hardly moving. much slower then a person taking a stroll. yet in the 10 seconds it took for me to get outside. it completely vanished. after this me and my sister sat down and thought of possible explanations. we couldn't come up with anything. the weirdest part was that from it's distance i would say it was larger then a car but it wasn't making any noise whatsoever. also it was not very high either. only at around the height of a 4 or 5 story building! and like i said only half a block away. but came much closer to my house. it was spherical in shape. but i couldnt tell if that was the actual object or just the shape of the light. i couldnt see a definite shape. just this strange pulsating light which eventually made it's way almost right above my house. 10 minutes after me and my sister went to bed, we began hearing the neighborhood dogs barking very loudly i have 3 dogs and  the only way i can describe it is the type of bark they do when they are startled. this whole thing was really weird and the way it pulsated combined with the way it moved and the fact it made no noise was very eeire. i hope other people saw what i saw.

at 2010 i saw what i believed to be a red light on top of a radio tower.  i then noticed it had had a small white strobe to the right of the red light and thought this was unusual since i drive this route every week and had never noticed a white strobe.  as i got closer, i noticed it was moving very slowly.  as i got closer yet, i noticed a feint blue light to the left of the red light.  the object passed over the highway in front of me at an altitude of approx. 200' at a very slow speed just immediately se of the jim hogg county airport over what i believe to be the gruy ranch entrance gate.  i could not make out a shape of the object, but because of the configuration of the lights, it appeared to be oblong.  i slowed down from a speed of 55mph to at least 15-20 mph as i passed the object now immediately to my left.  after i passed the object, it hovered stationary and displayed multiple (10-12) ultra-bright strobe lights.  i drove about a quarter mile further and pulled over to watch the strobes until they stopped at which time i looked at my watch which read 2020.  i fumbled with my camera-phone but was unable to get a picture as i was too late.  i then turned around to go look for the object as it was proximal to the airstrip and i thought if it was a helicopter i would surely see it at the airport.  it was at this point that i noticed none of the usual lights or search beacons were turned on at the airport and they hadn't been the whole time i passed the airstrip.  i turned into the airport on the main drive to see if i could see a helicopter.  there were no lights on except for the blue runway lights and i did not see any aircraft whatsoever except for a small parked plane.  i noticed a do-not-enter/private property sign on the drive and at this point i decided to continue on my way home with no further sighting.\r\n\r\nborder patrol helicopters are commonly seen in the area, but i heard no noise and have never seen any aircraft whatsoever put on

towards our house when my daughter looked up at the sky and told me that the object above our skyline was weird acting and was not acting like a plane should be flying...I laughed and looked up and told her it looked like a plane to me...She said that it was wobbling around like a top or something and not flying straight like planes do...She has seen her brother off many times at the airport, plus, we live in kokomo, and see lots of planes go towards grissom air reserve base, so she should know....She got upset and bothersome at me and told me to come towards her and look at the object from where she was standing...So i  moved more towards her way...I saw what appeared to be small engine type plane...Like a 4 to 2 seater,....But sure enough, it did have some red and green lights on it ...But it did appear to be gyrating or the having the wobbling top toy effect and was not flying straight at all...It appeared to be circular looking once i moved around in the back yard to try to set a better view of it...Then i noticed after awhile that it was not moving on out of the area like a regular plane would do...It kind of stayed in one area.(almost looking it was just moving back and forth in one spot)...It almost looked to me like it was even rotating and wobbling at the same time some once i stared at it for awhile.....I went inside the house and it was still around the area pretty much in the same spot where it started...Weird i thought....Decided to report it to your website...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10241,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.487657,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04102008-0014","longitude":-86.1281833,"occurred":1207724400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1207724400000,"summary":"Object

always been interested in ufos and things like that since i was young, and recently i started taking it seriously, watching shows like ufo hunters and looking up stories and such. anyways on tuesday, february 5th, i was outside my house as usual, and noticed two very bright balls of light in the sky. they were pretty close to the ground. at the time i didn't think much of it, i dismissed it as an airplane or a star maybe. but on the next day, wednesday, february 6th i saw the same balls of light at the exact same location. they were just hovering there so i knew it couldnt be an airplane or a helicopter. they also didn't make any noise. now it couldve been a star, but in my opinion it was way too close and way too bright to be a star. i witnessed a couple of airplanes fly near the objects and then immediantly change course. so i now realized that this was something unusual and brought my cell phone out. i recorded almost a minute of footage. it is really bad quality,being taken by a cell phone, but you can still make out one of the balls of light a little bit. the second object can't be seen in the video because it is being blocked by a tree. i had to stop recording since my bus arrived and i lost sight of both objects. i saw these two objects at the same location for the next two days after that. on the last day, i attempted to keep sight of it while i was on the bus. to my amazement, it actually seemed to be gliding alongside the bus at a distance. as i got off the bus it was nearby behind a few trees. i turned to talk to my friend and when i turned back it had dissapeared. i have never seen anything like it. one thing i forgot to add is i did see these objects again, i don't remember excatly when, but they appeared to,not sure how to describe this, teleport in. as in,nothing was in the spot at first, and a second later there it was.I could just be overeacting of course, and what i saw those nights could easily be nothing more than something explainable, but for now i'm convinced that what i saw was something very unusual.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i were driving on a dirt road near the city of phelan, ca. i was in the passenger side with the window open, as i took random pictures of the desert landscape. we were traveling south, on anderson ranch rd at low speed, since the road was kind of rough. i did not notice anything until i downloaded the images to my laptop. a total of five pictures captured a bright teardrop or cigar shaped ufo of cylindrical shape. the object appeared on the first pictured at relatively low altitude, just over the san gabriel mountains to the south west. in the next four images, the object gained significant altitude, until the last picture, which shows the object at extremely high altitude. the last picture shows the object \"flashing away\" and leaving some sort of energy trail. i did not alter these five images in any way, and i have saved them on my computer as read-only, as to prevent any accidental changes. i used a sony cybershot digital camera to take the pictures. the images are available here, along with my own low-tech analysis: \r\n\r\nhttp://picasaweb.Google.Com/josediaz1111/seraphim\r\n\r\nhigher resolution images available upon request.","distance":"Over One
