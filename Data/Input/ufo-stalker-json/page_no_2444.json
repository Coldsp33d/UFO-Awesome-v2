these objects, i wanted to run in the house and get my family up.  but for some reason i did not.  i was afraid that i would miss some kind of and event.  i live about 20 miles from maxwell air force

that's not moving but when i take pics of it i get something thats either serpant-like or gyrating loops with orbs present.The first set of pics i took 5 years ago were taken in my backyard in modesto,ca.Something told me to get a digital and take pics so i did.The gyrating or sometimes serpant looking ufo pics appear gold in color while the more recent one's sept.2007 appear silver.Plus the ufo in sept.2007 first appeared as a huge ball of white light in the east but when my girlfriend took the pics it didnt look like a ball of light but again something gyrating or making images in the sky.No these were not planes flying overhead in 2002 since it took the ufo all evening until late at night to finally cross the sky and then begin to descend as if to land(you can see this in the photos)i have lots of pics a couple of hundred of them...Interestingly the hugh ball of light which began to appear in the eastern sky at about 4:30 am and lasted until daylight  showed itself during the muslims holy days of ramadan(sept. 26-29-2007).I believe that the ufos are skywriting in order to send messages to those below and who are smart enough to figure it out.I have decoded some of the

and i like to just sit out there and something to my left cought my eye up in the sky. there was a significatly brighter light in the sky in a part of the sky where there is not any bright stars out at that time usually its just those little bitty ones that you can just tell that they are there because they are so far away. this made those other stars look like fore ground.It was at first glance just a bright star but it had never been there before so i went ahead and sat down and just watched it thinking wow that sure is neat how it can change colors like that.I got up and ran in the house were it was dark closed my eyes and was thinking its just my eyes they are tired this is just my eyes being tired. i closed them and counted till 120 and took a deep breath and went back outside rushed back to the spot i was standing and it was still there i was freking out i could not beleive what i was seeing.I was totally floored. i tried to get it on video camera but i did not have night vision on the camera, so i could not see anything through the veiw finder. \r\n  my eyes were relaxed and i was not tired fully alert this thing started to move up and down sort of squiggilly movements and started this weired flashing type sequence with all of these different colors in a ballish circular motion the only way i can describe it was as morris code or something it would at the same time as changing colors would move. it went along in a fig. 8 pattern and up down and sideways.Then it would just sit still for like 10 minutes or so.And do it again it did this about 4 times. the second time it did it i saw another similar shape only bright white come across the sky towards it in its direction and do the same thing back to it and then it went passed it towards my left and pass it up.Shortly after that around 12:45am or so i swear these white streaks of really white lights would sort of come out of the bottom of it they looked like tails off of a shooting star or something only no sparkles more of a smokiness or light trail there was only about 4 or 5 of these they also went to the left of the object and it was sort of like it was following the other one.Then at 1:12am my husband came home from playing card with the neighbors and i told him about it and said you have got to see this this is real i am not crazy you have got to see this i am serious look it! so he 's like come on your crazy and i'm like just watch real carefully  and a few minutes later it started doing those weired patterns again and it moved up down if you were looking at a clock it moved  in the 1 oclock position from were it was previously sitting then back to were it was all the while changing colors and eveything it was doing before sticking pretty close to the same pattern everytime.Jimmy saw that and he's like did you just see that also and i'm like, told you so, our daughter woke up and he went in and laid down with her.I stayed out there for another hour watching it seeing ehat else it would do but it stopped moving as much and just stayed white. then it appeared to be moving toward my direction at that time it was a whitish color turning gold and orange and yellows then white agaian(probably our pollution thats up there because the moon does that sometimes here). it was getting easier to see and looked a little bit bigger that was around 2:42am. and started this weired flashing type sequence the only way i can describe it was as morris code or something it always paused after the patterns and the changing of the colors. it was almost 3 am and i had to get some sleep that was the last time i have seen it i have stayed up every night and at the same time gone out side to see  if it has been there and it is just not there the last two nights it has been cloudy and so i have not been able to see anything its going to rain soon. i have stayed up many nights looking at the stars from were i was sitting on the porch and i can honestly say that i have never seen anything like that before and i am now always going to look for it now on.

sightings but would have to be covert about it as the military has a real high presence in the area. stated that you could go to the melbourne international airport (mlb) and expect not to be allowed to enter, or exit if you fly in, as it will be crawling in military personel armed to the teeth.

around 11pm, as i was driving, i saw a small but bright white light far away that was moving strangely across the mountains/hills... alternating between streaking along and then slowing to almost immediate halt. i said, \"do you see that off to the right?\" \"yes\" was her response.  then i asked her a question that one of my brothers had asked me some time before: \"what would you do if an alien ship landed,took you onto their ship and invited you to travel with them... they assured you that you would not be harmed or abused in any manner, and that you would see wonderful things beyond your imagination; the experience of a lifetime... but!!  you would be missing \"without a trace\" for an entire week, you could have no contact whatsoever with your family, who would obviouly be distraught over your \"dissapearance.  you would be safely returned after the week and able to explain your absence\".  all this time we were glancing at the light. her answer was, \"no way\". i said that i would possibly do it, but only with my favorite brother (the one who asked me the question in the first place).  \r\n\r\nat the end of my sentence, the light came straight at us at an unimaginable speed.  we thought it would slam into us, but it stopped \"on a dime\" directly to the right of us, about half a football field away, in a field of hay, or?  we could see the silhouettes of farm equipment.  the lights went out for about one second and then came the light show.  the craft was suspended in mid-air (about 3 feet off the ground).  when the white lights came back on, the sound was very like the sound of baseball field lights being turned on: \"ch-chunk!\"  the lights were under the craft, about the size of very large - semi truck-sized tires and covered by a kind of metal grid.  the shape was like a one-story long bell with a flat bottom - shaped like the brim of a hat. \r\n\r\nall this time we kept repeating \"holy shit; oh my god\", etc.  the craft then started doing things that were just a shock, like staying hovering in one spot, first spinning like a top, sideways for 4-5 seconds and then froze for 2-3 seconds and this time spun end over end)- again the ch-chunk, but the lights turned into a light show of blue, red, white, ??\r\n\r\nour conversation turned to \"what should we do, should we stop?\" (me) and \"no, keep going!!!\" (her) and then, \"let's just see what it does, come on!\"  \"no way, it's my car, just drive, keep going!!\"  so i did.  we talked and freaked out all the way to prescott and when we arrived and relayed the story to my grandma, she said, oh, that must have been down there in congress; a lot of people see things down there.\"  the thing is, even though i had experimented with marijuana many years before, my sister-in-law has always been the most pragmatic, straight-laced person i know.  she drank hawaiian punch for her wedding toast.\r\n\r\ni'll never forget it, whether it was a military exercise or

sky.\r\ni had my camcorder pointed n-e, wide zoom, volume on high,pointed at my neighbor back yard, their house is a two story.\r\n\r\nas i was watching the tape the next day i saw what looked to be the front of a cloud, intill it was moving much faster then a cloud, it came around my neighbor top of their secound story and came around towards the camcorder but would dissiapate, like it was never there.\r\n\r\nthen there came one that looked like it made a 90 degree turn right for my camcorder and lite up the whole area by the camcorder. i could see something in the very bright light, but i just couldn't make it out, i was hoping with better equipment we could go frame by frame. the most i could see in the bright light is what looks like a bright black line.\r\n\r\nafter it stop a few minutes later another wave of what all i could say what looked like a cloud, which was close togeather as it came around the house it spread out and was just gone.\r\n\r\n1)i was in the back yard at

 stepped out of the truck and walked behind, my lady stayed in the truck, truck was faceing north,. i was looking at the peaks in the moon light when this round glowing sphere appeared, it was going east to west looked like one of those earth globs that was a soft night light, bluish gray glow, it looked like it came from nowere just next to the west peak. could see the object for just a short time, about a 5 to 6 degrees of travel then left just as quick as it appeared. there was no sound, no fire, this was huge, size was about 20% of the peak from were i was located. the peaks are about 20 to 30 miles from sighting point. another way of discribing the sighting, is you are standing on one side of an open door way about two of three feet a way and something flies by. you can only see the object through the door way.\r\ni could not believe my eyes, i new this was not from present earth. i ask my lady if she hae seen it but she was faceing the wrong way.\r\n\r\nthe reason i am just now saying something is i would like to know if anyone else has seen this type of ufo. personally i have not seen this type of craft in any ufo files. the time of sighting could be off by a lot the

beautiful clear weekend, no clouds whatsoever. we were house sitting for a friend and the river was completely quiet.We were laid back in our lawn chairs when across the river on the grafton, illinois side i noticed an orange glowing star (or so i thought) above the tree line of the bluffs. i pointed it out to him with a lithium flashlight we were using because it was so dark. i thought it must be a planet as it rose above the horizon because it glowed so brilliantly.It appeared to grow larger and i'm not sure at that point if it was because it was getting closer or if it intensified it's lights because i pointed and fixed my flashlight on it. but it did get closer, it began to come directly at us at a slow and steady pace, it came across the river midway across the river it was softball sized at arms length.There was no sound. we were terrified but at the same time transfixed on the object so we just stood there with our arms around each other.It hovered for some time then quickly moved to the missouri side of the river to a marina two houses from the house we were house sitting at where it remained for maybe 60 seconds, it sort of floated with jerky motions and at this point it was basketball sized at arms length it was probably 100 yards away from us, and 30 feet in the air, it hovered between two trees although it was only for a minute it seemed like forever. i kept wondering \"why doesn't it do something?\"the from behind us a smaller version came from behind the house and very quickly connected with the large object not touching but almost connected by a liquid light. the objects glowed the brightest orange gold almost painful to stare at but we couldn't stop watching they stayed fixed for a minute, they looked like a piece of candy from my childhood (circus peanuts) only the glow from it was something i have never seen before and have never seen since . after hovering it/they  seemed to morph into a cylinder shape. the orange glow turned a brilliant white and it almost disappeared into itself dimming from the outside in till it was gone, this happened very quickly maybe 3 seconds. he and i sat on the ground and talked about what we saw and there is no possibility it was any type of commercial aircraft there was no sound before or  after. we watched the sky for hours afterwards but saw nothing else. we have talked about it on and off for years but swore we would never go public with it. he passed away last spring so i have decided to talk about it now, as he would have never gone along with it.This first object came from the grafton side of the river and i did some research on the piasa bird a mythical birdlike creature the mississippian/sioux indians claimed came out of the caves on the bluffs, and out of the river and kidnapped people who never returned.I have been obsessed with the memory of this sighting for years and it gives me peace to have it off of my chest now.Since the sighting the number 3 has seemed very important, triangles , pyramids.. seem to be something i obsess over. i don't know if it's related to the sighting but i was wondering if anyone else has had the same obsession or if i am crazy.Have there been any other sighting reported in recent times in the grafton or portage de sioux areas?
