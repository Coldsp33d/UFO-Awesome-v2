happened to us.  i will go into more detail later on.  everything that i am going to write actually happened.  it changed my life forever.  it was one of those events such as the kennedy assassination and the world trade center bombing that is etched in most brains.\r\n\r\n\tthis event happened in 1964 on a late july weekday evening.  i was fourteen years old and dan lake was 13 years old.  the sun was just beginning to set in the western sky.  with all the air pollution of those days the sunset was usually a bright reddish color.  it was still bright enough to easily see.  the sky was perfectly clear on this beautiful day.  the temperature was about 75 degrees. \r\n\r\n\tfor the last couple of weeks dan and i would walk about a mile from our house  to the a and w root beer stand.  we called it the \r\nbarrel because the roof was composed of a huge wooden, orange barrel after a day of playing baseball  we would buy a root beer and the best hotdogs i have ever had. \r\n\r\n\twe would walk through the residential area and over the railroad tracks.  on north main street and adjacent to the root beer stand to the north was a nursery.  it is still there today.  we were about 30 yards behind the nursery in an open area heading east.  i looked behind me while we were walking to check out the gorgeous sunset. \r\n\r\n \r\n\tit was at this time that i noticed to the west, but not directly toward the sunset a light blink.  the object was about 40 yards away.  it was about 25 degrees above the flat ground.  it was heading right for us at a very slow rate of speed.  the best way i could describe the speed of the object would be to straighten your arm out and spin in a circle, taking about ten to thirteen seconds to go one revolution.   so as you can see it was moving very slowly.\r\n\r\n\tit was also still way too early in the evening for any lightning bugs to be out.  they are usually lighting up much closer to dark.\r\n\r\n\tthe light was a strange color.  i would describe the color as kind of a creamy green.  it wasn���t a bright green.  this attracted my attention because i had not seen this color in nature before this time.  i will describe more about the color and where it came from later.\r\n\r\n\ti should mention now that i was an eagle boy scout at that time.  we went camping in illinois almost every month.  the boy scouts went camping almost every month for many years.  we went camping for a week in upper michigan and canada every summer.  i went fishing approximately 20 times every summer at my grandparents place in southern illinois. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\twhat i am trying to say is that i have been outdoors and in the woods all of my life.  this was definitely not a lightening bug or the synonym, a firefly.\r\n\r\n\ti do wear glasses, but i have perfect vision with the glasses.  dan lake has always had perfect vision.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\tafter i saw this ufo i did extensive research for many years in the library.  there are very few bugs that are luminescent on land.  in the oceans there are more luminescent creatures deep under the sea.\r\n\r\n\ti talked to a couple of professors at northern illinois university about things that give off their own light.  they had never heard of such a thing that i described to them.  i also was feeling that they thought i was out of my mind.\r\n\r\n\tso because of the blinking and the color of  the light this object drew our undivided attention.  the ufo continued to head right for us.  my feeling at the time was not of fear, but curiosity.  i remember my saying to dan, ���what the hell is that?���\r\n\r\n\r\n\tthe ufo was heading in a perfectly straight line towards us, again at about twenty-five degrees from the ground.  the blinking light was also very strange in an additional way.  this is one thing i have been a little bit unsure of over the years.  that was how often the ufo blinked.  it seems to me it was about every three seconds. \r\n\r\n\t i am 100% positive that the blinking cream green colored light blinked at the exact interval with every blink.  the duration of the blink was very short.  the light did not stay on very long.  i would estimate about one fourth of one second.   so it went on, then immediately off completely.  this is absolutely nothing like a lightening bug.\r\n\r\n\tdan lake and i stood facing the approaching object with dan at my immediate left.  we were now able to get a very close look at the very strange object.  the ufo came down to our immediate left.  it was still blinking at the same interval.  \r\n\r\n\tit leveled off at chest high level.  i am six feet tall and dan was about a foot shorter at that age.  it remained at this height the entire time it circled us.  there was no change in its height whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\t the object was only three and a half feet from us.  it began to circle us in an absolute perfect circle.  the speed remained the same.  the height remained the same.  i am six feet tall and dan was about a foot shorter at that age.  the ufo continued to circle us over and over and over.  i can���t remember how many times it went around us.  the number of revolutions was quite high.  if i had to guess i would say 15 times. \r\n\r\n\ti don���t remember us saying much, but my heart was really beating fast.  when dan gets excited his eyes open really wide.  they were really wide when i glanced at him.\r\n\r\n\tmore about the ufo now.   i would estimate that it was about seven millimeters in diameter.  it was definitely not a centimeter in diameter.  i remember that is seemed to be perfectly round.  if it wasn���t perfectly round, it was very close to it.  \r\n\r\n\tthe object was not spinning at all.  i am also positive about this.  when you are this close to an object you can see  details like this.  when not blinking i could not tell the any difference between the front part and the rear.\r\n\r\n\tthe body of the object was a black in color.  the color did not change at all.  i also seem to remember the body being kind of segmented into four quarters.  the segmented part was very faint.  there were no distinct lines where the segmented part was visible.  \r\n\r\n\twhere was the strange light coming from?  it was coming out of the back, bottom quarter of the object.  when the light was not blinking, that segment looked just like the other three segments in color and shape.  no light at all was visible when it wasn���t blinking.\r\n\r\n\tthere were definitely no visible characteristics of life on the object.  there were no eyes, nose, ears, hair and legs.  there were definitely no wings of any kind.  \r\n\r\n\tthere was no sign of any kind of propulsion coming from the ufo.  there was no air disturbance of any kind.  the object was completely silent.  there was no buzzing or humming.  \r\n\r\n\t \t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

which is typical of heavy air traffic) but i had not noticed them earlier.  perhaps they were in a holding pattern until the other craft made its way through the night.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":10203,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.9962476,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04082008-0003","longitude":-88.1757001,"occurred":1207371600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1207371600000,"summary":"Loud sound from low-flying craft with two white lights and two red strobes","tags":["crash","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10203_submitter_file1__MUFONcase10203drawing.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Bartlett, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:386231"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Kingman","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am calling this an \"unusual sighting\", possible ufo-related.  on friday april 4, 2008, my friend and i were leaving hoover dam site and had just crossed into arizona on hwy 93 toward kingman.  about 20 miles into arizona i was adjusting ny seat and as i leaned forward i was compelled to look up and saw about 75 to 100 objects above the cirrus clouds.  as the clouds passed underneath the objects, they disappeared and then reappeared.  they disappeared in total and reappeared in total.  they were very large, and at about 25,000 to 30,000 ft altitude, they had to be at least 100 feet across, maybe more, each one.  they were about the same altitude as jets could fly.  this lasted from 3 to 5 minutes and when i had an opportunity to pull the car over and get a better look, they were gone.  the friend with me is a mufon field investigator and estimated along with me that the objects were at least 20,ooo to 30,000 ft overhead from my description.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":10202,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.192763,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04082008-0002","longitude":-114.0440365,"occurred":1207333740000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1207333740000,"summary":"75 to 100 objects appeared overhead, above cirrus clouds","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Kingman, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:386232"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Stuart","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Several weeks ago at the exact same time i witnessed what i believed to be a sattelite at this location. it was at a rest stop on i 95 where i work security. so, i decided to go out back at 2107 again last night and see if it passed ovewr again. sure enough at exactly 2107 it appeared again. only this time it did not appear from the horizon. it suddenly appeared directly overhead, as if decloaking. \r\n                         i watched it proceed south for about a minute. the one from several weeks ago moved from west to east. i gave three flashes three times with my mag light. at that time it appeared to slow almost to a stop and its light increased in intesity making it appear twice as big for about 5 seconds. \r\n                        then it continued to move south and after about 55 seconds simply vanished.It was high up like a sattelite. it was a solid white light and had no strobe lights at all. i dont know if it was signaling me or not when it increased in brightness. i plan to look again each night at 2107. to see which nights it appears. \r\n                               there are a large amount of chemtrails being sprayed in my area. especially each evening right before sundown. the red and white aircraft go over and leave their typical x patterns and tic tac toe patterns. this has given me respratory problems.

back to the east.  two objects shot off at a very fast speed.  three stayed side by side, then another shot off.  only two remained; the large, bright object and the smaller duller on.  the large object pulsated.  it was very bright.  by this time, about 4:00 pm, i saw two jets approach out the northeast toward the objects, which, at that time, sped off at what i can only estimate at about 17,000 ��� 18,000 miles per hour and out of sight.  the jets then turned around and headed back to the northeast.  \r\n        my brother, joe goforth, also witnessed the objects.\r\n\tthis statement

tried to tell people, they thought i was crazy and people started treating me differently.  im about may of 1988, i was going to pismo beach from the central valley in california.  it was late at night, i was tired and wanted to go to sleep.  so i pulled onto a road (bitterwater road) to take a nap.  a short time after stopping about 100 yards from the main highway, a circular golden/white light popped over the hill in front of me.  i thought it strange because it was so bright, and had it been later in the morning id of thought it was venus.  it took me a few hours to convince myself that it was remaining stationary over the hill and not moving with the background stars.  a little before dawn it started receding from me straight up at a fast pace.  when it was gone, i continued on to pismo but couldnt get the incident out of my head.  at the end of the weekend, i was driving back to the valley and decided to stop in the same place again.  shortly after i arrived the light appeared again.  i got out of my car, walked around a bit, then walked toward the highway when i noticed a second light around the hill behind me.  this second light was below the line of the hills (definately not a star) just hovering there.  after about an hour or so of watching these lights i decided to continue on home.  after turning back onto highway 41 and starting into the kettleman hills, i noticed a single light behind me the same color as the ones i had been observing, this was mainting a distance of a few hundred yards behind me and every once in a while it would disappear, at which point a car coming towards me would show up, pass me, get out of sight, then the light would reappear.  this continued the whole way through the kettleman hills till a few miles before i entered the valley.  for the next few years, i would return to the spot and almost allways saw something,  i even convinced two of my friends to go with me, one of them we didnt see anything when we went, the other though, got to see both the light that came up in front of me and the one that was around the hill behind us, he also got to see them follow us through the kettleman hills, afterwhich, i could never convince him to come with me again.  through the whole experience i was never afraid, more curious then anything.  i even tried reporting it to lemoore nas though they just called the police on me thinking i was psycho.  then one night i was feeling kind of down and went to one of my favorite spots to think.  it is a rock formation in the sequioa park with stairs cut into it and you can see the whole valley from the top.  as soon as i arrived i saw my lights in the sky, but there were more of them and not acting the same, i was afraid to go to the top of the rock, and shortly after decided to go home. the lights left me alone shortly after leaving that spot.  i made it almost all the way home but was still shaken up a bit so thought i would drive around a little longer.  i headed out to laton, not long after i drove through laton, i noticed one of the lights hanging over a field not far off the road.  i turned down the next road that went that direction (davis ave.) i had only gone about 100 yards down the road, the light was directly in front of me, all of a sudden a blinding light was shining on me and all of my muscles seemed to tighten up on me.  my next thought was that i had to get out of the car because a train was coming, i was very calm about this thought, and it didnt even register in my mind that i could not see.  things went blank again, then my next moment of conciousness was me being aware of being out of the car (though not being able to see still didnt register to my conciousness) then something sideswiped me almost taking my arm off.  things went blank again, and then i remember talking to someone (somehow i was aware of talking to the train conductor), and i remember talking to the police who were telling me since i was half way between fresno and hanford i could pick which hospital i wanted to go to (i told them hanford).  through this whole experience i was extremely calm till i got to the hospital, once in the hospital i was terrified for no apparant reason.  when i finally came to in the hospital, i found out that i had hit the embankment of rock that the train tracks rest on so hard that it had lifted the back end of the car onto the tracks, and a few hours later a train came along and wiped out my car.  my face had hit the steering wheel so hard that i broke my face and it had swelled up so bad i couldnt even open up my eyes, the train had sideswiped me on the way by and tore up my arm at the elbow.  after getting out of the hospital i went back to the site of the accident, there were houses on both sides of the tracks within about a hundred feet, and people were inside of both the houses, but noone heard a thing all night long.  i never told anyone about the events leading up to that night and i havent been back to bitterwater road or the sequioa forest since.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

(group 1) \r\n\r\ni called my husband to come out and watch. he didn't see the group and was skeptical, offering other explanations. then we saw 5 lights in a v-shape come from the west to the east. the lights were similar to the first group in color and speed. (group 2) \r\n\r\nwe called our son and daughter to watch. our son is a skeptical, logical type person and at first didn't believe us until another single light similar to the others came past. he tried to use binoculars but couldn't because it was traveling too fast. these groups and the next groups all had about 10 minutes in between them. (group 3)\r\n\r\nthen we saw another single light. (group 4)\r\n\r\nthen 5 or maybe 7 that flew together in a v formation, and then peeled off to the left and right. (group 5)\r\n\r\nthen 5 more in a line, one behind the other. (group 6) \r\n\r\nalways after the lights we saw several planes in all directions around them. these planes were similar to what we see at other times, but it seemed notable because there were more of them. they were quite high, but we could see them because each one had a row of many lights, bright and flashing red and white, on each wing and on the front of the fuselage. from that we could tell the shape. the wings went crossways, not swept back.\r\n\r\nnext i saw a much larger plane with swept-back wings. it came right over our house, very low, and made a lot of noise. we thought it very strange for a plane so large to come that low. my husband drew a sketch of it, showing a round jet opening at the back.\r\n\r\nour daughter described seeing the lights too, but her sketch is more like a circle with lights inside it. she isn't sure whether the lights were round or more like trails because it moved so fast. she saw 9 or 10 of these altogether. the descriptions are not exactly the same, but since the objects came and went so fast that doesn't surprise me too much.\r\n\r\ni've always wanted to see a ufo. that's why i always look up when going outdoors. i'm very glad others corroborated my sighting so i know i'm not crazy.\r\n*******************************\r\ntwo weeks later, on march 28, about 8:30 p.M. we saw lots of planes going back and forth east and west. then at 9:11 we saw about 20 lights in a very wide v, not a perfect shape, sort of like a flock of geese, but moving much faster. \r\n\r\nat about 11 my husband saw a very bright light. it first appeared to be a moving star, then it suddenly expanded to about the size of a cantaloupe at arm's length, then it whished up and away very, very fast until lost to view.\r\ni have included the statements written by my husband and son as attachments.

discuss these with anyone due to ridicule.I feel that i'm old enough to share these experiences with someone like mufon who are willing to listen.I was raised a strict roman catholic with the idea that u.F.O.'s were nothing more than the imagination of science fiction writers.However,when i was 13-years-old,this notion was turned upside down.During the summer months i would sleep over my cousin christopher's house several times.My aunt and uncle were fun-loving people who catered to us with the idea of having the most summer fun.Chris's bedroom was located upstairs of their house.The house was located on the shore of little bay de noc in the city of escanaba,michigan;escanaba is an iron port town on the shores of lake michigan in michigan's upper peninsula.After wrestling around on his bed,we went to a cluster of windows that overlooked the lake.We noticed a bright light hovering motionless over a lighthouse that is about 5-nautical miles out over lake michigan on the bay of green bay.Thinking nothing of it,we went on with our play.After about 15-minutes or so we went back to look out over the lake.The light was still there in the exact position!For some strange reason,we were glued intently to this sight,almost hypmotized.After several minutes the light began to move very slowly and perfectly parallel to the water as if it were on a frozen straight line sideways.We watched it move very slowly and perfectly parallel to the water;no airplane that we had seen ever moved this way without rising or falling in it's tragectory.Finally it stopped at stonington point,a peninsula about 2 miles across the lake.Suddenly it began to move from west to east along the stonington peninsula until it was directly across the lake and directly behind the line of their house!It stayed motionless for several minutes and then began to appear larger,as if it were traveling on a path directly toward the house.For some strange reason we were completely enthralled by this event,even though neither one of us were interested in u.F.O.'s at that time.We quickly ran downstairs to tell my aunt and uncle that a strange light was heading toward the house.Amused by our excitement,they agreed to go outside to satisfy our whims.We watched in awe as the light approached the house...Not a word was spoken.The object came closer until it was directly over their house,moving no faster than a walking pace.As it passed over we could see the underside of the craft and it's complete shape.It was huge,maybe half the length and width of a football field.It was oval-shaped from front to back and squared-off flat at the rear.It was no higher than 200 feet above the ground and we could clearly see what is best described as \"complex piping\" on the under belly,similar to ships in a star wars movie!It traveled nearly in slow motion and made no sound at all.We staired at it as it traveled from south to north over the city of escanaba.The feeling i remember as it passed over is that all time stopped and we were in a mysterious state of suspended animation.For some odd reason,we walked back into the house and began watching t.V. as if nothing had happened!Nothing more was said about it.My aunt has since passed away.But my uncle still remembers that night, although he will never talk openly about it.I would be willing to take a polygraph test to prove that this story is true!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10184,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.7510766,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04062008-0012","longitude":-87.0622201,"occurred":-14841000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-14841000000,"summary":"Silent

airplane at first, but it appeared to hover for around a minute.  i watched it a little longer, and it seemed to waver and quiver around, so i figured it was probably a planet, since i've seen venus appear to do similar things due to atmospheric distortion.  as i watched, the light sunk below the tree line, when this happened, i got off the phone in order to pay attention to this light better.  as i watched, i could see the light moving back and forth and up and down behind the trees, i'm not sure just how long i watched it do that, then the light emerged from the trees at about treetop level and started across the road and into the field, heading directly towards our house(the tree line is maybe about 300 yards from us).  the light appeared to be a diamond shape composed of 3 or 4 smaller yellowish lights, and there was no noise associated with it.  when i saw it start towards the house, i yelled and shut the blind as fast as i could.  my husband heard me yell, and asked what was going on.  i ran into the living room and told him what i saw, so we both went outside to look.  by the time we got outside, the light was gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

noticed off to my right and ahead of me up in the dark sky was an orange-reddish spherical glow.  the light stood out in the beautiful, clear night sky and grabbed my attention because of its illuminating light unparalleled in the night sky.  i could not gauge how high the object was above the trees but it had to be maybe at least a quarter or half mile high.  the object was a good mile or so from me or maybe even several miles away. i could not tell for sure, especially since it was over 2 years ago, although i remember the date and time of the event and the shape of the object like it appeared to me yesterday. i figured the light was maybe a star or something, yet the object could not have been the moon nor a star because the object was closer to the earth than a star or the moon would be... a lot closer.  not a second after i had noticed it, the stationary object immediately shot away leaving a streak of light as it flashed out of sight in the blackness of the sky.  this streak of light resembled the streak of light left by the millennium falcon as the spaceship sped into hyper drive in the movie star wars.  it all occurred so suddenly that i figured i saw a ufo because it was an object that i could not identify and it was hovering in one spot... flying... a ufo.  i am intently interested in the ufo phenomenon.  i had been studying and continue to this day to study the ufo phenomenon and read both fictional and non-fictional resources on the issue.  a friend riding with me at the time of the sighting was studying and did not notice it at all for the sighting was over almost before it began.  i have never seen anything like it before nor since.  the reason i am just now coming forward is that i had been debating whether to share this information.  also, i would like to know if there were any other sightings in the auburn area that fateful morning that may or may not be related to my own.  due to the abrupt sighting, no photo or video was taken

junction with route 59.  i noticed a large bright white light straight ahead of me.  it was much larger and brighter than a star or any airplane light i've ever seen.  i would estimate it was about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the moon and clearly not a point of light.  as i watched, i noticed that there were three distinct, also white, lights along the \"bottom\" of this larger white light.  they were visible because they were clearly outlined somehow against the larger light background. as far as speed, these lights appeared to be hovering with no apparent motion.\r\n\r\nthen, suddenly, the lights were gone -- disappeared as i was watching.\r\n\r\ni looked up again to see an entirely different configuration of bright lights, but still much more distinct than the lights of two airplanes (one to either side of these lights -- o'hare airport is not too many miles further away to the east).  these lights were \"sideways\" to me (in the sense that they eventually begin to move off toward the south very slowly).  the configuratin was three bright white lights in the form of a boomerang or triangle with the \"point\" to the south.  there were also two blinking red lights, one centered \"between\" the two white lights which were not the point of the triangle, and the other a definite distance back.  these lights did not change place in relation to each other, but remained in the same configuration.  after seeming to hover in one place, they begin to move slowly toward the south.\r\n\r\nby this time i was approaching the merge onto route 59, which i have to take northward to go to my job in lake zurich, il.  as i arrived at the stop light at the intersection of the exit from i-90 and rt. 59, i looked up above the treeline across rt. 59 to the east and saw another? single large bright light again -- looking like the light i had first observed, but, due to position, it seemed to be more likely a different source.\r\n\r\nwindows of the car were up, and no sounds were heard; nor were there any other sensory perceptions beside the visual observations.\r\n\r\nno shape or outline against the night sky was seen -- only the unusual and unusually bright lights and the strangeness of hovering or moving very slowly. \"not like any airplane i've ever seen.\"  and impression was that the lights -- especially the boomerang/triangle array were \"very large\"\r\n\r\n[note: the information above is attested to by the witness, connie kraft, and was recorded as above and verified as accurate according to the recollections of the witness at the

is a detailed report i also sent to ufocasebook.Com.\r\n\r\n\r\ngood day,\r\n\r\nmy father was on vacation in the south of france and just returned yesterday. knowing i had seen a ufo 6 weeks prior to this day and knowing the resulting enthusiasm and curiosity i had developed for the subject, he showed me two pictures he had taken the day before they returned.\r\n\r\nmy father wanted to take a picture of the sunset. both photographs were taken on route du grau de vendres in f-34350, vendres-plage in the south of france, in a north-western direction, with an interval of about 20 seconds. the first picture, taken at 20:50 local time, shows something out of the order. it was taken with the flash turned off. it is not the moon, obviously, and research conducted by myself has shown that on the day the photo was taken, 04/04/2008, the moon could only be seen as a very narrow crescent. it should be noted that the object itself was invisible to the naked eye and only showed on the camera. the second photo, taken by my father after he had seen the object on the camera's display, was taken at 20:51 local time, with the flash turned on. this time, there was nothing in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe camera my father used was a 7 megapixels pentax optio m20. the skies were clear in that region at that time, there were no clouds and it hadn't rained in five days. there are no streetlights in the area, so no reflection could have been caused on the camera's lense. no airplanes were visible in the area at that time. temperature was 15-16��� celsius (59-61��� fahrenheit).\r\n\r\nit is not a comet as there is no tail visible, and if there were a tail it would mean that the object was heading straight for earth. it is obviously no conventional aircraft, a claim that my father should know to dismiss as he is an aerospace-enthousiast, although he has no formal training. it's equally hard to identify it as a ufo as it doesn't seem to have any of the characteristics of a conventional ufo. it is impossible to tell if the object was stationary as it only showed on the picture. what struck me personally is the aura around the object and the fact that you can find a smaller reflection of the object a bit to the upper right. could this mean that the object moved so fast or even \"teleported\" from one place to another?\r\n\r\nit should also be noted that my father has been a police officer for 31 years this month and is a very down-to-earth sceptic.\r\n\r\nmy father has agreed to sign a form stating that what he has said in his testimony is true, that the photograph is unedited and has not been altered in any way.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time\r\n\r\nmarvin","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned
