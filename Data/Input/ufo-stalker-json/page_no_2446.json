middle of the circle of these objects that were about 50 to 70 miles from our position, so that would put them about 140 miles from northeast to southwest.\r\n\r\nthe sky was extreme clear, no visual oddities with star light or planets.  two shooting start observed, not identified with these objects.  no audible noise heard.  no  movement observed.\r\n\r\nall objects seemed to be geo syncronus as

fireworks look like. i also am a training pilot, and work in the aviation field with maintenance, and am still going to school for my airframe and powerplant license. i am really familiar with aircraft, their behaviors, their sounds, different types of aircraft, etc etc. it has been a hobby of mine to know as much as i can as it's a dream of mine to be involved with the aviation field, since my first flight when i was 7. so i have extensive time and research into aircraft of the public knowledge. \r\n\r\nwhat happened:\r\nit was after the re-run showing of snl that then would play until 1am. i asked my brother if he was interested in going on the dock and looking for ufos, which even after a serious car accident of his with head trauma, he still remembers. we were out on the dock, as i don't know the exact address, but can acquire it if needed, sitting out there on the lake. there weren't any trees over head, just the clear, dark night. so clear you could easily see the milky way. we were discussing things about space, life, anything us kids would talk about. we got tired of being eaten by the mosquitoes and decided to head inside to go to sleep. everyone, literally, which was an odd first for my past experiences as usually someone was up by the bon fire, but not this night, as they were all asleep. it felt like we were out there for at least an hour, it could have been longer or shorter, but definitely longer than 30 minutes. \r\n\r\ni remember my brother going to sleep before i did i am pretty sure, as i felt like i was the only one awake. i was watching the ceiling fan above me turn as i was laying on the ground in a sleeping bag in the sun room type extension to the house by the deck. it felt like i just closed my eyes, as i didn't have a clock to reference any time frames, it could have been an hour, it could have only been a minute. sometimes when falling asleep, it feels like it was only 5 minutes but 8 hours went by, so i am not sure how long my eyes were closed. just before reopening them, i had what felt like something/someone telepathically communicating to me, to look at it. where was it, well that also came with how it felt like i knew which direction it was coming from telling me this. like if you are in the room with someone, you have your back to them, they call you from your back or diagonally from you, and you know where to look, this is how this event was. \r\n\r\nit was like, look here, or look over here, or look at us/me something. i don't remember the exact feeling/statement, but all in all, it called out to me to look at it. i look out the sliding door toward it, where i saw a bright, glowing white sphere, hovering over the lake. it was dead quite, as far as the object is concerned. i remember saying, pretty much nothing, it sits there a few seconds, and it disappears. i remember saying, along the lines of, oh cool, or that's cool, but i remember remarking on how cool it was to see it. it was as if i was with them and they were saying bye, i can't explain it only that it was the most unique of all of my experiences with unexplainable events. \r\n\r\nso after it blinks out, literally just disappeared, i just laid my head down and went to sleep. i never told anyone as i knew i was young and everyone in my family is so skeptic of anything, that they would never listen to me. it came to me to start talking about it more openly after talking with a co-worker at work in 2003. i reported it to the nuforc then in a hurry and desperation to get my story out while the details of the weekend were still fresh, or at least more fresh than they are now. i know it was a 4th weekend, and i had to reference it within the last two years for the year. besides little details like the date, the actual sighting has remained fresh in my head as if it happened yesterday. it is something i will never forget. \r\n\r\nrecently, doing research, i have found on history channel's site, mapping your sightings tool. there is another sighting, of a 4th of july weekend. they might be the same age as me, but this sighting has more details of this sphere zig-zagging. i really want to know too, if they saw more of my event in my experience. so that is why i am also being really open about this. \r\n\r\nme personally, along the lines of other unexplainable events, i do believe that there was more to what i consciously know happened. i have my theories, but for what it's worth now, i saw what i saw, what else happens remains to be investigated.\r\n\r\nafter asking for more questions, i do feel i was abducted, but i don't have proof. it will take more time and research, hypnotherapy? i feel that there was more that went on then. i have had 3 psychics, one i worked with, tell me there was something going on but they can't see it because of the state i was in at the time. 3 different people, all not knowing each other, and tell me the same thing. so i will classify as ce4 until someone else says it should be changed. thanks!\r\n\r\nthanks for your time.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nmatthew heiser","distance":"101-500

in a circle around it. the lights were random, no particular order, and were fainter than the star-looking light. at one point a smaller light flashed on and went into the brighter light. i only watched it for about an hour, but it moved erratically, and i ran inside trying to find a camera. unfortunately i couldn't find one that would show the object/s. so i just went back to watch it for a

the story as he related it to me just recently almost 46 years after it occured.\r\n\r\n my brother and our cousin were playing baseball in our cousin's backyard. all of a sudden my brother heard a very loud ,high pitched whooshing noise. he said it sounded like jet fighters flying overhead at a very low altitude. about 200 ft. from our cousins backyard  there was a large 3 story house on the corner where a side street intersected garfield st. looking toward the sound of the noise my brother noticed a silvery torpedo shaped object, perhaps 12 to 15 feet long with a red tipped nose and small stubby wings zipping toward the large house on the corner. the object made a number of circles around the chimney on the roof and zipped off in seconds, as fast as it appeared. i know this happened over 45 years ago but i'm curious if anyone else remembers/or saw this event in hazleton, pa.\r\n\r\n   louis dorse   mufon member # 10544","distance":"101-500

when i and five or six other students witnessed two large glowing objects at a distance of about a quarter of a mile travel from east to west and disappear over some mountains. what really strikes me as totally uncanny about the whole thing is that prior to the sighting, one of the students was totally engrossed with the whole ufo phenomena. in fact, i remember that not only would he not stop talking about ufos prior to our sighting, but he actually stayed up all  night scanning the skies for ufos for two or three nights prior to the sighting. in fact, he was the one who initailly saw the object and woke everyone up shouting and yelling. my intitial reaction was, \"i am going to punch him out for waking everyone up and bothering evryone with this nonesense!\" but i quickly saw what he was hollering about and it was flabberghasting. initially it was a greenish white light followed by a second much smaller light. as the two got closer to where i and five other students were watching them, they changed to a bright yellowish white light. i also observed what appeared to be chunks of perhaps molten material falling from the larger object. when it was at its closest point i stared straight into the light to try and make out what was producing the light. to be honest, it appeared to be some kind of wobbly molten stone. it could be written off as just a tremendous falling star except for the fact that it travelled parallel to the ground and may have maneuvered intelligently above some low mountains as it passed over them. that and the fact that one of the students seemed to know that it was going to happen make it all much more noteworthy than just a large falling star. \r\n\r\ni must say that due to the distance and the way in which the lights seemed to behave as some kind of meteor, i wasn't terribly emotional in any particular way as i witnessed the whole thing. i think i recall that we were all kind of laughing about it because of how  the student who we thought had foolishly stayed up looking for the thing all night, night after night turned out to have been on to something. perhaps it was the fact that i was sixteen and not terribly good friends with the guy that i never discussed it with him how he knew this thing was going to happen. i also am quite intuitive myself, so i think i just sort of accepted the fact that he somehow knew something peculiar

i mean  most people looking up in the night sky would say that is noticible for sure ! a craft that is completly still in mid air, floating about someone's home ! and a triangle shape with lights at each point at that!  hello ( laughing ) anyhow that is my story and i am sticking to it .","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10165,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5820026,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04052008-0004","longitude":-84.3202194,"occurred":1207279200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1207279200000,"summary":"Dark triangle shaped object with lights at each point","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/10165_submitter_file1__SkyTri-s.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Carlisle, Ohio","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:387186"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Los Angeles","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I do not know why i got up from bed and went into the back yard.  the noise was not loud enough to wake me. no whirling sound, just a very low volume hum.  the craft was larger than the house, back yard, and the lot next door. the house had four bedrooms, and the back yard was a third again as large.  the bottom of the craft was straight across, three or four times as long as it was wide.  the bottom was not smooth.  there were formations that square or rectangular.  there were some lights mostly blue and red. there might have been some green. they were spread throughout the bottom of the craft.  these lights did not blink, but some went on while others went off, but did not do so frequently.  no pattern whatsoever; and they were not bright enough to light anything up, not even the tops of the trees.  there were 15 to 25 lights on at a time.  the craft went over my head from the fairfax district (the la brea tar pits) toward rancho palos verdes.  i could never quite figure out the shape of the top of the craft as the craft was too dark.  my friend in the house was angry that i did not wake her up so she could see it too.  the window to where she was sleeping was directly behind me, but i could not even think of doing anything else but watching it.  i did not light a cigarette, i think they might have been in the house.  i came back in the house after i saw it near rancho palos verdes and went to bed.  i thought it might have been the goodyear blimp, but it was such an unusual time of night.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":10164,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0568542,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04052008-0003","longitude":-118.2349849,"occurred":394268400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":394268400000,"summary":"Within 100 ft overhead,slow moving, huge, low hum, over back yard.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:387187"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Fremont","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This made a huge noise. it sounded like firecrackers as it passed by . it was liike it had an aura to it. i talked to people at school, and they said they heard it aswell, but only in certain areas. you couldn't tell where the sound was coming from, until you looked up. i saw the ship and it looked like a triangle. it was bigger and closer than normal airplanes. it's lights were flashing , and it was traveling slower than normal airplanes. also the lights were much brighter, i rembemr a red and white ones. after one of them passed, yet another passed going in the same direction. both made the huge staticky, firecracker, gunshot noises as they passed. and it slowly faded away but i can still saw it.

horizon. i did question this and said it may have been a car or tractor in a field or on a road. he said there are no roads in that direction, but just forests. my uncle knows this area very well as he was born and lived there until the present day. we then just saw this object slowly move up, and then stopped. suprisingly we went back to the house, but i returned with a pair of binoculars. i saw nothing for a while, but then out of nowhere saw this object rapidly 'travel' across the sky in a 'v' pattern. it started from my right at around 45 degree elevation and then moved so quickly to almost the same elevation to my left. i was absolutely shocked what i saw and swore so loud, in amazement, that a neighbour poked his head out the window. the next thing i know is the object zoomimg so fast away.\r\n\r\nmy uncle did tell me that a few years prior to that he and most of the neighbourhood saw an object just hovering above the hills for about two hours, about 1km away from his

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While driving on the dewing hwy before the town of pine center, on my way home to brainerd,mn i saw a large object in the sky above the tree line, it was a dull grey color it had a slight concave, or dip in the center it was almost triangular in shape, but with no distinct sharp edges. after a few moments of seeing it, my mind realized what was really happening as if for a few moments before i was mesmerized and needed a bit of time to sum up the event. i then instantly took note of the time on my clock, and noting every detail i could of this, for i knew this is very important, and iam a very observant person to begin with.The object was large it was high above the tree line, and i had a very good referance point. there was also something weird about the bottom of this thing, it had a almost greenish hue along the bottom, just like a thin line, not bright, just like a hue of somekind that was hard to make out, but was all along the bottom edge length wise. i tried hard to see around the thing but couldnt tell its exact dimensions, i could only distinguish a triangle shape is all. it hadnt appeared to move during this time, but as i was now slowing down  for some reason to pull over it slightly tilted to the right and up but not any other way, and it was gone, and almost as if there was a pocket in the sky or something, like a layer. very hard to explain. this whole event probably only lasted a couple of minutes i would say at best. i  had had my driver side window down prior, and during this, but there was never any sound that i heard coming from it nor any lights, flashing,etc. the sun was also still out when i saw it, and it was to the left of where the sun appeared in the sky and lower, but no glint or reflection from it, just a dull grey color. i cant be sure how large it was, but just a guess would be between 75-100 ft in length. not sure how deep,etc it was, and no way to tell from where i was seeing it. there also was no other vehicles behind or in front of me from either side, so i dont know who else could have witnessed it. i drove 60 mph  after this trying to gather myself, and trying to recall everything. i made it to town and immediately went to my local sherriffs dept. and spoke to an officer giving every detail i remember. that was all i could do, but i know this needed to be told to someone who may have experince in this type of area. i came home went on the internet, and looked for anything that i could that would give me a direction to who to contact, it was frustrating, i was nervous, and couldnt stop thinking about this, and i didnt find not one person, or link the night this happened. i  hadnt until today saw any response to help from anyone, and i couldnt sleep at all the night that this happened so i was extremely tired after the next day. and this is how i got the info to contact you.  i want to let you know, iam not in any way mentally disabled,i  also once lived in dover delaware with my sister, and later lived by leavenworth air base as well. i have seen so many conventional aircraft to know this is not something like anythimng i have  ever seen, no question,not even close. it was not any ballon, kite, mirage period. it was real. ironically the only thing i can even say this could resemble is something from a science fiction movie. i cannot think of anything to add, and my typing is very slow, and iam better talking with my voice than on a keypad. i hope that this information will be helpful. unfortunately i didnt have access to any cell phone, or camera to capture this event.I think someone needs to know, and iam not afraid to to talk about this experience, as i was the day after it happened. i had worried after reporting this i would either be labeled  a lunatic or something by someone, or could stir up a hornets nest from depts. or any agencies, this is from what ive seen on t.V. i guess. just now read not to put personal info, so i will not put my ph.# no down unless it is needed later sometime. i tried to put all this down as best i was able.

staking a pad in the woods for a gas well to be drilled. we start @ 6 in the morning so we normally eat lunch by 11. being as we waded through a beaver pond we were too wet to eat in the truck. while eating i happened to look up, there were big fair weather cumulus clouds in the sky. the two nearest overhead had a fairly large gap in between them and i saw this disk. i asked my co-worker what he thought it might be. he looked up at it and i believe it kind of scared him. he said he didn't have any idea. so we watched it for a few minutes and it slowly moved to the ssw until it was gone from our sight. a few minutes later i looked back up and there it was again in the same spot as before, a few minutes later it moved away to the ssw and it was gone.\r\n\r\nokay, this thing was large, if i were to estimate the size of this disk i would have to say at least the diameter of a commercial airliners length. it was of a grey or metallic color, shaded underneath, with a flattish underside. the sun was high in the sky so it was shiny along the edges. it had no markings or appendages and made no noise. as far as the top and sides go i couldnt see enough of them to identify. it was well above the clouds.\r\n\r\nanother thing i failed to mention was the area i was working in, swepco power plant is a few miles away, and the mining company had just moved into this area with a dragline in it's

wasn't shocked by it or anything. as more years have gone by i still keep my eye to the sky thinking i may see another. i have twins that love to spot planes, helicopters, and satellites if we happen

satelites normaly show up a greenish white colour and this was a coppery orange.  this made me watch the object, after about 20 seconds it started to turn and did a curved turn in the sky so it was going back the way it came and then suddenly turned again to go back the original corse forming a backward s shape in the sky if you where to trace its corse.  then it sped up and shot off into the distance.  it must have been at a very high altidude as planes flying overhead that night showed up crystal clear and stars likewise, but this had a fuzy glow around it as if it where amiting light rather than reflecting it.  please contact me over this issue as i would like to discuss it further.  i have seen many shooting stars, planes, and other objects and vehicles, and i know that at that

reddish-orange slightly vertical spheres rising from behind the hill blocking our view of downtown austin. my mom called my attention to the lights.  as we continued walking down a hill staring at the lights and looking towards austin to the east, 4-5 more light came up, south of where the first group appeared.  the first group began to split up, going in multiple directions; primary heading east and south-east until they disappeared. a third group of lights rose to the north of the first group and then the 2nd group of lights split in multiple directions. i began running towards the house, to get my husband to come out and see the lights - but by the time he got outside, only one light was still visible in the far north sky. \r\n\r\nmy mom called 311 and talked to the travis county

the lights. \r\n\r\nthe lights were not like anything either of us have seen before and they were certainly unexplainable.  the lights were not close, but we could hear  powerful engine noises.  the

the approaching darkness.  \r\n\r\ni noticed a very large object out of the passenger side of my windshield and then through the passenger window as i continued to travel but at a slower speed. it was big enough to be obvious to the causal observer who would glance up. since i was traveling east on 172 the object was south-south east of me. it was very large, black to smokey-grey and was hovering. there was no visible noise, but my windows were closed so i can't be totally sure.  it was a triangle and appeared equilateral in nature.  there were 5 bright solid lights on the underbelly - all green (like a traffic signal).  three were at the corners of the triangle and two more at the midpoint of two side.  i did not see a light at the mid-point of the side of the triangle furthest from me (not sure if it was blocked from me or just that it wasn't there).  i have no numerical idea of altitude, but it was well below other aircraft in the area.  if i had to guess i would say it occupied 20-30% of my field of vision from my vantage point\r\n\r\nmy initial reaction was what the heck was that and i wanted to get another look. there were other aircraft in the area at higher altitudes - they appeared as specks with lights blinking or solid.\r\n\r\nthe object was in my line of sight for maybe 10-15 seconds before i lost it in the tree line as i continued to travel east on 1rt. 172.\r\n\r\ni immediately pulled over to the right shoulder and got out of my car maybe 100-200 yds down the road where it was safe to pull over.  the tree line obstructed my view to the south-southwest.  i quickly got back in my car, turned around and headed west on rt. 172. i pulled into the next street off of rt. 172 i could find and got out of my car.  i could no longer see the object in the sky.  i looked everywhere and it seemed to have vanished.  i heard no noise to indicate such a large object was in fact moving as i would have expected.\r\n\r\ni immediately went home and told my parents.   i returned to the vicinity of the sighting with a camera around 8:30-8:45pm but saw nothing.\r\nlater that night i stopped by the bedford police department and called westchester county airport to report what i saw.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":10155,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.204262,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04042008-0001","longitude":-73.6437397,"occurred":1207278000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

with the address book,and just causally looking up and around the sky at stars,plans,and police choppers etc. i then looked to the west and noticed a very large airline probably a boeing jet coming into mccarren airport,after a few seconds of it passing by i then noticed a circle of light(greenish in color) circling,and circling,after a few circles and the clouds cleared i noticed a beam of light at the end of each circle(sorta like it hitting something like a wall) when it would beam off light,4more beams of light would appear,and just vanish. but the circle never vanished,it would just run in a pattern of doing the same thing over and over. the circling was about 5-10seconds long. at about 10:50pm my friend showed up,and i told him to hurry up he had to come see what i saw. he saw it too. we watched it for another 10 minutes with me. it was almost like hypmotising to just watch it go around and around. during the waiting period it was making a freakwynnsee sound off the light pole. almost like a sos thing. hummmmingcracklingbuzzing noise. i was almost tempted to call the police(but they would have just laughed,or been upset for calling for a non emergency reason)thats why i'm glad my friend showed up to witness it. i told him i was gonna try and find someone to write to about what happen. so this is our story of what happened in the las vegas sky last night. a never forgetting experience.\r\n(i even drew the whole thing on paper)so after our last 10 minutes of gazing, we both went inside. about a hour later 12midnight he decides to leave,and i said i'm gonna walk you out,and see if its still there. it wasnt. i was sad. i could have been up and stayed up all night just watching it. p.S. i have a cell phone cam,but for some reason it would not show up.,and i had

almost constantly waking up paralyzed and feeling that something is there.  i have seen many sightings before and tried to initiate spiritual contact without being prepared for the results.  i want to learn more, but i am too afraid because of the \"sensation\" that occurs when i do.  i become entranced by the communication if i attempt it, but i am trying not to anymore.  it started on march 3rd around 2:15 a.M., i was just finishing a movie that i was viewing on my laptop when i heard many of the neighborhood dogs barking ferociously outside at something.  out of previous \"experiences\", i did not attempt to find out what was happening  since i could hear loud whirring mechanical sounds outside, sort of like a buzzer that sounded quickly the stopped periodically.  i decided to close my eyes for a few minutes and just pretend that i did not hear anything, but then i reawoke to find a very orange light outside the sitting room window.  thinking it was morning, i looked at my portable alarm clock seated by me to see what time it was.  \"what?\" i looked at the alarm clock in disbelief as i checked to make sure that my time was not wrong.  all the clocks said 2:16 approximately.  i turned to look out the large window and the woods were reflecting the orange glow as if the sun was rising.  the whole house was lit orange inside.  i tried to wake my parents by shaking the fiercely, but they had just gone to bed a couple of hours ago so they were completely exhausted.\r\ni then checked my sibling's room at around 2:18 and sure enough, the room was glowing orange.  i finally summoned up the courage to look out the window and saw a ball of light which looked like the sun but you could actually look at it without hurting your eyes.  i was immediately frightened and crouched by the window only to hear the strange buzzing and the screaming of dogs and horses in the country side where i live. in about two more minutes i peeked through the window and saw the light lift up into the sky and fade.  i never want to see it again, but i know i must face facts.  they are here.  i have no reason to lie.  but when the time comes, we should be ready. \r\n\r\nfor more information please refer to my email.  thank you for listening.  i am tired of being fearful and felt someone should know what is happening over here.  \r\n\r\np.S.  many strange phenomena appeared during the

look for guess?, ufos, as he watches my laptop sometimes as i watch videos of ufo material and has really got into or shows interest in it. so tonight we went out to the top of our driveway and started looking up and talking,we seen several planes,2 satelites and had been out for about 40 minutes. i was looking south and i seen another commercial jet 30k feet or so. i pointed it out to him and we watched it for about 2 minutes,it was flying west,just for the record. anyways somthing in front of the path of the plane,probably several miles ahead of it,powered up or charged up because the sky was black infront of the plane until this vanilla/white and very green like a sea foam green color came to a glow in front of the jet,i pointed to it and my son seen it and the plane kept flying towards it and then id say with the jet just 5-10 thousand feet  behind it and closing in, the thing shot away from the jet and i swear it flew out of the atmosphere in 2 seconds with a trail behind it glowing green. i swear on my mothers grave thats exactly what happened. and my son seen the whole thing. this craft traveled the equivelent of mach 100 or something crazy. well there it is, i dont
