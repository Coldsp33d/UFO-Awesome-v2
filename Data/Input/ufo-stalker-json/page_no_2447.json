away. they flashed repeatedly over and over. i can't imagine no one else seeing them. they where more than chess pieces they where just symbols they flashed so quick it was hard to tell what they where but they stayed up there for about five ten minutes. it seemed like a long time. i don't tell to many people this because it makes no sense to me either. i was in new haven missouri right outside of washington mo. it was a nice night i was up late and saw the lights they where hugh for being so far away. they just flashed different symbols and then stopped. sorry thats all i can tell you it's not a ufo but its the weirdest thing i ever saw i can't explain they where high in the sky like the stars but not that far away just big about four feet in height from the sky. i thought what the hell was that about. there's no military bases that way or a spot light or nothing like that it was to distinct and clear and they flashed quickly and dissappeared. this was back in 1997.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":10143,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.5581072,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04022008-0010","longitude":-91.0120878,"occurred":870937200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron,

back up and vanished.\r\n\r\nat the time i was sitting on my sofa watching a mvoie and i was sitting sideways infront of my apartments 3rd floor balcony but for some reason i tured my head at that

i yelled, what was that? my fiancee who was sitting a little ways from the balcony watching the movie also looked at me in wonder as to why i was shouting at 12:15 am, knowing we had neighboors.\r\n\r\ni told him what i saw and that i was sorry for the neighboors for yelling out but that i had never seen anything like that in my life and i admit i was a bit afraid at the time,

street that u could see the monterey park hill near monterey pass road..That night i had a smoke, like i do all the time on my front porch..And as i looked towards the hills of monterey park i saw a red spinning object with what appears to be black windows rotating in a circle about 30 rpms covered with  red hot glow from this object i can see it is black and of a saucer shape from my point of view it was very close about 3000 feet in front of me and this object was hovering over a house on the hill and it was very close to that house about 300 feet above it, it made no noise..And it was there for about 8 minutes the red hot glow would go out then come back on and when it did go out, i saw a saucer shape craft it was blacker than the night sky. i saw it very clear and it was dripping what seems like molten metal..Still spinning slowly just hovering there...After reading the article on this site about the red object over monterey park i know i had the most clear visual of this alien space craft..I never believed in these things but since that night i got more questions than answers...This object was huge about 300 to 400 feet across bigger than a 747 airplane. it hovered over the hill where most of the commercial airplanes fly over..It made me believe that we are being watched...Sorry it took me 5 years to tell my story,i had too do some research and watching all those youtube ufos and stuff. i think i had the clearest view of them all...And it was a scary site cause it was so close...And not knowing what this thing might do..This thing is burned into my mind,remembered it like if it where just yesterday..It has been awhile and i haven't seen anything like it since..I didn't take any photos cause i was shocked and my jaws dropped  i couldn't take my

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  on 4/1/08 at 05:30 i saw three objects with very intense bright white strobes over  homer glen illinois. i was getting on toll way i-355 north, from west bound route 6 in new lenox. i noticed the strobes while on the ramp and watched them for the next several miles (minutes) as i headed north on i-355. the objects were northwest from the toll way and about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. the weather was dry but overcast, i have no idea what the ceiling was at the time. \r\n  the three objects appeared to be identical in the fact that all three had the same varying intensity, and frequency of the strobe effect, but the objects were not in sync with each other. since they were identical in brightness and appearance i assume they were of the same size and distance from me. there was also many strobes on each object with some slightly more intense than others, making each object look like a continuous varying strobe. there were no other lights, no red or green or landing lights, no steady lights of any kind, just very white intense strobes. i could not see any discernable shape of an object or objects, or tell how many strobes there were per object since the strobes on each object were very close to each other. my best description is each object was like a cluster of tightly packed, very intense strobe lights. \r\n  the objects also appeared to interact with each other, meaning as one moved another would follow. this dance went on for a minute or two. then while two of them were more or less stationary the third one headed away then quickly, amazingly quick, turned around and passed right between the other two and came to an abrupt stop shortly after passing them, making all three the same distance apart. shortly after that maneuver the three objects got in a straight line with one another (north to south), were equidistant to each other, and appeared to be heading south (remember i���m heading north at 65+ mph)  and then climbed away slowly at a 45 degree angle. at this point they were now due west of me. i never did see them enter the cloud deck or if they changed direction due to my vantage point while driving, and a strong desire to stay on the road. as they were climbing away the distance between them slowly increased but they were always equidistant to each other, as if in formation, and their appearance and strobe intensity although fading, remained constant between them.\r\n  i am an aircraft technician and i am very familiar with various, not all, aircraft and helicopter lighting. i see airplanes almost everyday and night, going into and out of chicago���s midway and  o���hare airports, and several smaller airports, as i travel over 100 miles roundtrip every day (or night) to and from work. i am very familiar with the traffic and holding patterns too. in fact i did see airplane traffic in their usual routes, north and east of my location (for the given wind direction at that time). these objects were not in that vicinity, they were alone. i am also aware that there was a hotel fire in lockport illinois, to the south and west from were i witnessed these objects, and the local news teams did have their helicopters up covering it, but these objects were nowhere near that location. \r\n  i have never seen helicopters with so many intense strobes. i have never seen helicopters or any other aircraft accelerate and decelerate in such a short distance(?) and time. and, i have never seen them ���play��� with each other for a lack of a better description, and depart in single file and climb at a 45 degree angle. i am not saying it couldn���t have been 3 identical aircraft or 3 identical helicopters playing cat and mouse in the pre-dawn hours, all i���m saying is i have never witnessed anything like it in my 30 plus years in aviation.

elected to stay outside in the car.  i was reading the bible for the first time in my life.(revelation) i looked up in the sky in the distance and what appeared to be a star i noticed kept getting brighter. i kind of started talking to it and the light kept getting closer. the closer it got i could make out 3 red blinking lights in the shape of a triangle.  this was really freaking me out but i really enjoyed this kind of wierdness.  anyway long story short when it came very close i sat my butt in the car window and looked over the car.  they slowly moved and gradually were almost over my head when i realized that the pulsating red lights were not on one unit but three because they were not in sync perfectly.  they made not a sound. i could see the units were silvery metalic and cigar shaped or bullet shaped like a blimp. they came immediately over my head.  two gents drove into the parking lot and got out of their truck and i screamed at them to look at what i was witnessing. it was as if they did not hear me.  however, my friends (about 6 or 7) finally exited the restaurant and i told them to look up and they all saw it too.\r\ni thought it was going to take me away so i started telling it to go away.\r\nwhen my friends all came outside it did start going away slowly.  i was scared shitless because i had called it to me.  \r\n\r\ni am not crazy but i have held that

job. my mother, two brothers and myself were at the drive-in movies, parked in our vehicle toward the right rear of the lot. we and i'm sure most of the drive-in attendees noticed a solid silver-like titanium (not chrome)disc shaped ufo aprox. 500-600 feet across. it could have been larger. it had a briliance all it's own and it was a clear night with no moon. it was also silent. rotating above, between us and the big movie screen. it was more to the right of the screen. as it hovered, it also rotated. the disc had a raised portion on the top and the bottom. but it was one solid object. slowly rotating you could see 3 different lights on the bottom. as it rotated, you could only see one light at a time due to the distance or the angle of the bottom portion. we viewed the ufo for aprox. 20-30 seconds until it decided to leave. when it took off, it moved faster than anything i know moves to this day and still no noise at all. as it flashed across the sky to the left we could no longer see it due to the landscape. on our way home, the radio announcer mentioned ufo sightings that were seen by many that evening in the san juan area. my older brother called the radio station and spoke with the announcer. he told him what we saw and he said he would get back to us. the air force said it was a helicopter with a neon sign on it. being only 9 years old, i know exactly what i saw and that was no helicopter. years later, still to this day, we discuss what we saw. once you see one, you know we are not alone. it gives you a whole new perspective on life and the universe. when i'm outside day or night, i'm always looking up. it was a wonderful and enlightening experience.

left.Appearing to be banking out of a turn was a very large triangle shaped aircraft.It was black but stood out from the night time sky.They have an air show here every year and i know the size of aircrafts from the distance involved.It disappeared behind a condo building that is about twenty stories high.That building is about six blocks away and it went out of sight maybe three quarters up.Thing is there are casinos higher than the condo building for about thirty blocks so it had to be beyond them.Compared to objects in size from the air show that were probably at a closer distance the black triangle shaped craft was twenty to thirty times larger and probably more if as i suspect it was a couple of miles away.To be clear i saw it clear.It was triangle winged with what appeared like a conventional pilot type area forward.I didn't even tell anyone for a year now i have to reconcile its existance with known physics and philosophy and there is none.It just brings to mind that shakespeare quote something about us being sport to wanton gods as flies are to us.Something is out there and i saw it but it is beyond anything i can figure out.","distance":"Over One
