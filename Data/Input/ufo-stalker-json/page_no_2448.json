coming back to the house about 9:15 pm (approx. i was walking up the drive heading west. as i approached the walk to the front door i noticed good sized red and white lights through some tree limbs. i stopped to get a better look and thought to myself what kind of airplane is this. i moved to the right a step or two to get a better look at this object. that's when i saw the four red and white lights. i was looking through some large limbs and couldn't get a real good look. i moved to the left three or four steps to get out of the heavy limbs. as soon as i moved to get a better unobstructed view the lights (object?) moved with me so i could get a better look. these lights weren't any higher than maybe 100 ft or so and seemed to be just across the road in the field. this all transpired in a time frame of\r\nabout 10 to 15 seconds. a few seconds after the lights moved with me they disappeared. the lights just turned off. i didn't see anything or hear anything. the sky was clear  with no moon at this time. i live just east of the grissom afb about four miles off the runway. that was why my first thought was an airplane. after the lights went out i stood and scanned the heavens for something else or the same thing. nothing happened so i went into the house to tell my wife what i had just witnessed. i was excited and she got excited about the experience. i went back out to scan the sky again for about another ten minutes. my red/white lights didn't materialize. however: to the southwest to grissom afb i witnessed what appeared to be a falling star in reverse. it was just a white light that i observed coming from close to the ground and rising straight up to a good substantial altitude and then the light disappeared. i was really excited. the last time that i had witnessed any ufo type of activity was in jan 1968 in vietnam. i also must tell you that my wife and i are intuitive and on some level psychic. when i asked my mind how many i saw that night, my minds eye told me that there were actually three citings. but i can only recall the two. so now i am very diligent when i go out at night. also that night our dog drove us crazy wanting to go outside. he wanted a revolving door that evening. he would go out and stand at the end of the deck and just look in the sky. we have a lot of spirits hang around our property. i thought they were bothering him which they do alot. i told them to go back to the garden and leave the dog alone. now i know it wasn't the ornery spirits.","distance":"101-500

very early a.M. from visiting my husband who was hospitalized for several months. i was approx. 24 yrs old. i had the baby sitter and my son with me. as i got out of the car i looked up as light caught my attention, i yelled at lori \"do you see that?\" we both watched in awe for a short time and it than went up and dissapeared.\r\nit had red lights, was very close to us, had white lights. and was hovering. we felt a small amount of strange heat. this was winter for us.With snow all around us. but it left as the craft left. i reported it to people than and only got laughed at.\r\n\r\nthe second sighting: sometime in 1900 approx. my husband again in hospital, my son approx age was 17. we were riding talking to one another about his dad, when we both noticed this very large ovular very lit up object hovering over the drug and alcohol rehabilitation center that was all lit up. we both got out of the car, and saw the bridgewater fireman at a nearby pond filling up their tankers, almost as in slow motion, in the lot above was a baseball team playing ball, we couldn't hear any noise from any of them, very odd. very warm sensation hit us both, and we both thought how odd it was that all around us seemed in slow motion and quiet.\r\nwe watched for quite some time how long i do not know. we stood watching as it appeared to be hovering, only slight movement. shortly after we started walking towards it, as we did it rose and started coming towards us, my son was really scared so we went back to our car, and as we did, it went up and looked to slide sideways in the air. this object was huge, it was over powering the building it sat above and that building is huge. there were a lot of lights  on in the building and we wondered if somehow this was attracting it. well it was a long time ago, but to this day i do believe there is another life form or being watching us. we have seen many strange things since, but never as close up as these two. so i saw your article and said what the heck i'll tell you about it.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

minutes later as we were still observing the night sky, in the distance east of our farm, we observed an extremely large cylinder shaped \"object\" with four large yellow/orange colored lights.  these lights were nothing like we had seen before in all previous sighting reports. initially, one might think these lights were a rear auto/truck/aircraft assembly but the size at arms length were the size of four large spotlights in single formation. the lights flashed twice, possibly 15 to 30 seconds in duration then went out completely. there is another farm to the east of ours with a barn.  the

and also watched the light.  it was moving at a steady rate, more at a downward trajectory than away from us.  i asked my wife to compare it to the airplane with the beacons still in view and blinking.  she did and could not make out any similairities with the light above and moving away from us.  together we watched the light fade away, which took maybe three to five seconds.  the total sighting lasted for at least 2 minutes.  after the light faded out, no beacons or anything for that matter could be seen.  there was no streaking effect with this light, no beacons, no sound(we listend for aircraft sound for a couple of minutes later).  we see shooting stars and all types of aircraft all of the time in our skys, but nothing like this before.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":10099,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.5332871,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03302008-0005","longitude":-111.7213719,"occurred":1206849300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Montana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1206849300000,"summary":"Brilliant

out to see this plane hovering for more than 5 minutes. i saw the four propellers turning but it was silent. it was a dark gray in tone with no markings. after about 6 minutes i became board, thinking to myself to leave, just then it began to move forward very slowly. i watched for a couple more minutes as it moved about twice it's length. i would be late for work so i got back in my car and headed down the road. about a quarter mile down the road i stopped again, perplexed. i figured the plane would be seen again after i lost view of it over a small wooded lot that obstructed my view. i never appeared on the other side of the woods.\r\n\r\ni passed it off as some sort of new military plane. i didn't know then that they had retired those planes in the 1960s. it has bugged me for years. i often wonder if i was experiencing some time warp. or maybe an alien encounter.\r\n\r\ni recently heard someone else call into coast to coast am and report a similar incident that happened to them in

big and low it was. it was flying low, it was silent, and had a decent glow. it then made 90 degree turns slowly towards us. we then realized it wasnt man made, nothing i've ever seen before could move like that and how slowly it kept its pace. then it was directly above us. it was meticulous and precise. it was like it calculated it move directly above us. i somehow felt it was trying to communicate with me. suddenly fear swept over me since i didnt know what it was going to do. then all the fear went away and felt overwhelmed and amazed at what was happening. my friend was going to record it but she felt the sun was too bright since it was 95 degrees outside. then i thought to myself \" show me something that nothing that i know of can do.\" right after that, the light that was emmitting from the object slowly started to fade and then it disappeared. my friend said \"oh my god did you see that! it just dissapeared!\" i told her of what i telepathically told them to do and

(yes, we are going to start doing this since i have been seeing unexplained objects in our skies lately!)i was standing at my big window when i saw one bright orange light in the sky that sharply turned right (my left)or i guess it would be east. i didn't say a thing to my husband until it came back a second time in the same location. i gave my husband the strangest look as he was sitting on the couch. he told me that i was seeing things and that these things would not come back a second time!!(first occurrance was on march 6th at 8:02p sharp). he got up and couldn't believe his eyes. shortly after the first 2 orbs just towards the west we saw a linear line of 4 lights just above tree top height. these lights came on one at a time and dimmed one at a time but were much closer together and not as bright reddish/orange this time. (as the march 6th incident). i would say that the lights/orbs looked much different and acted much different almost as if it was a coverup. i was not scared by these lights. nothing really eerie about them. i called my sister north in rochester as i was outside this time watching these things. she was on her cell phone and walked outside as i was telling her to see these things. she said \"oh my god! i see three lights. they look like head lights on a car in the sky.\" as i watched these lights come and go they moved fairly slowly towards the east. i did notice a huge amount of jets in the skies this time but no sounds whatsoever. the incident only lasted maybe 15 minutes. if it's a clear night tonight, you bet i'm going to be watching the skies. if you are in northern indiana, i suggest that you do too. i need to know what these things are!! who is doing this and confusing the public. or is this a governmental cover up? what i saw on march 6th does not compare to these lights at all!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

and i was looking up at the stars. i noticed the small red looking light (star?) and thought that it started moving. then i noticed it was areally bright light that was moving not the red light. it was moving northward and it seemed to be moving pretty fast. i had everyone look up and we were trying to figure out what it was and as it was moving across the sky heading to the  north it quickly changed directions and started moving eastward, it didnt turn it moved quickly to the east and we continued watching it as it dissapeared into the sky it appeared to disapear into the stars i watched it untill it could no longer be seen. \r\nwe all deducted that it moved too fast and changed direction to fast to be a plane also it was such a bright white light. we all tried to come up with a logical answer to what we were seeing but all we could figure out is what it wasnt a plane, a sattelite, a comet...... would love to know what it

wasn't pulsing or anything either. it wasn't making any noise, and it is a clear night. i called for my wife, who came out and also observed it. it went right over our house, and passed the edge of our roof out of view. i ran into the yard and caught a glimpse of it before it completely disappeared. it had no blinking lights, but i got the impression it's altitude wasn't very
