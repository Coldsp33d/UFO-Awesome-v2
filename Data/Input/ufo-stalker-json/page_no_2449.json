(i have several pet birds)  now i wonder if it had something to do with these lights as they would have been clearly visible from my house and i know the last time i saw them, i saw them at about 7:45 pm and then my friend saw them at like 8:30 or quarter till 9, so i know they hang around for a while when they show up.  i sure would like to know what they are.  they are absolutely not an airplane or anything i have ever seen before. the weather was nice.  sky was clear and stars were abundant.  the temp was cool, approximately 36 degrees.  \r\n\r\nand p.S. jerry:\r\n\r\n abbe said she was sorry she hasn't gotten back to you yet but she was planning on it.

east the then swerved north and started to fly away. i immediately returned to my house, 8 feet, and went up stairs to mention the sightinhg to my wife. i then looked out of the bathroom window andd called my wife to come to the window as the craft had circled around and were flying some what in a circle. again there was no noise. i then called to my son who also came to the window and thought that they appeared unusual. they gave the appearance of flying like helicopters with their quick movements but without the noise. we thought that they might have been searching for somthing but they didn't use any searchlights. after about 15 minutes they then flew off in a northwest direction. several minutes after they flew away we observed and heard several aircraft fly north usung the usual

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I remember this vividly as if it just happened yesterday. it was circa summer of 1979' in murietta ca. it was late evening, and the sun was settling behind the mountains to the west of town into the pacific horizon. i am not certain of the exact date, i have been conducting online research trying to find more info on this incident but can't seem to find one single article related to my testimony, frustrating. but no matter, i believe my story to be noteworthy because of the mass hysteria it caused, after all it mobilized the air force and stirred the media. i have been trying to track public records of this event but yet have found none, if anyone has information on this incident please let me know. i know what i saw was in fact a ufo, because my brother remembers it just the way i do.  \r\n\r\nhere's the story; me and my brother and some of our playmates were playing football in the field right next to my house (note i was about eight/nine years old). it was late evening and getting  dark and the sun was setting on the pacific horizon which illuminated the sky with a bright burst of orange, yellow and red. the mountains to the west of murietta cast it's shadow over us. but being determined children we were not going to let the darkness interfere with our game. something then caught my eye. i looked to the west and right above the mountain range hovering, floating not but maybe a mile above the peak, was the most strange and most awesome object i have ever seen in my life... now first let me explain that even at that age, i knew the difference between airplanes and helo's, my oldest brother was in the army and worked on cobra helicopters, and we even went to local air shows and i will tell you now, even unto this day i have never seen nor heard of any man made air craft do, what i am about to explain that this thing did in fact do.\r\n\r\ni directed everyones attention to the object, my brother and all four of my playmates saw it. we were to young to understand what a ufo was, but we all knew what aircraft were and we were all amazed at the spectacle. it appeared as solid and as shiny as gold, as if the surface was a golden mirror that radiated it's own light. there was a line of portholes running along the length of the craft. but what was most shocking to us was that it appeared as if we were seeing shadows moving in front of the light of these portholes. as if, somthing or someone was moving about inside the craft itself, mind you these shadows were faint because the craft was far away. but these portholes were huge. it looked as if they were standing in front of these portholes taking in the view, like they were on an interstellar tour bus. the craft itself was huge, perhaps the length of three football fields. standing in central murietta ca, if you held your thumb up to the mesa de burro mountain range, the tipped ends of the ufo would peer out from either side of your thumb. this sighting lasted for about 1 to 2 minutes, and then, with no sound or warning, and without breaking the sound barrier this craft flashed in a streak headed south towards san diego. a few minutes later it streaked back towards murrieta and stopped in the exact spot that we first sighted it. my brother ran into the house to tell our parents, but they wouldn't come out because a news flash came on over the tv and reported that lax and edwards airforce base were tracking a ufo over los angeles and san diego!!! they were glued to the distraction box. the craft then streaked to the north, and was gone for several minutes and then came back, to the exact same point in the sky we first sighted it! it hovered there for a few more minutes and then streaked to the south. the speed of this craft was unreal, if you want an example i would put it's top speed near that of a polaroid camera's flash. yet you could tell which way it went because it left a brief streak of light trailing behind it. similar to a shooting star.\r\n\r\ni then went in the house and the news people on the tv were still reporting it, they verified on the air, that both lax air controllers and edwards air force base command were in fact tracking the same ufo that me, my brother and our friends witnessed. murrietta lies between edwards airforce base and camp pendleton marine base. today, being older and more mature, and a ufo novice, i believe this ufo was curious about these installations, but that's pure speculation.\r\n\r\ni wanted to share my story with you, because i feel it needs to be told and a record of such an event should be maintained. i am frustrated that i could find no record of this event on the internet, it was on the news for christ sake, and yet, it's as if it never happened. but i know somewhere the evidence is there, to prove that this incident did in fact take place as i described. i know it was a long time ago, but if anyone else is a witness to this incident, or if you have any information, your input is certainly welcomed. thank you.","distance":"Over One

a light in the distance.  at first i thought it was a plane but i realized that it remained stationary rather flying toward the tampa airport.  as i watched more closely i could see lights blinking red, blue, white and green very quickly.  the shape seemed to be circular because of the lights, but (i'm not sure why)i thought the overall shape or configuration of the \"craft\" was box-like.  (sorry if that doesn't make sense.)\r\n\r\ni started taking pictures.  my hand is not always completly steady so i tried to zoom closer.  then i decided to walk to the wood fence surrounding my house to rest the camera on top to keep it steady to hopefully get a better picture (closer and no blur.)\r\n\r\nseveral minutes had passed and the object stayed in the same position and continued to flash the colors.  i had returend to the backdoor of my house.  while i took a few more shots and a mosquito started to bother me so i stepped inside and closed the screen door.  i decided to look at the object through a pair of binoculars.  (i think this is really weird.)  i guess the screen between the binoculars and the object had some sort of effect because now the object and lights were in a straight line.  i could pretty much make out the shape of a rectangular object with three larger lights spaced and smaller blinking/flashing lights in between.  i tried to take pictures through the screen but they did not show anything but the screen for the most part.  when i stepped outside again the object was still the original circular/box shape.\r\n\r\nabout twenty-five minutes had passed and the object seemed to very slowly move away into the distance. i tried to take photos with my pentax k1000 but not sure if those will turn out because of the darkness and i had no light to even view my depth of field measurements, etc.\r\n\r\nwhen i wanted to take pictures with digital camera again the object was gone.\r\n\r\nthis occured in land o lake, fl around 12:30am march 28, 2008 and lasted roughly thiry minutes.

always look out the window at birds, airplanes, etc. and the window sill makes for a good place for me to set my coffee, phone, remotes, etc. as we have no end tables. i looked up and watched as this strange white light crossed the sky moving from west to east on the south side of my home, about 1-2 miles south. at first i noticed that it was a constant light and wasn't strobing like the airplane traffic that usually crosses.  so i thought well i guess its a sattelite or something, but it was very bright and clear and didn't look like it was at a very high altitude. i grabbed my binoculars which hang on my coat rack (i frequently watch military traffic to and from ft carson, as i'm a veteran and find such things interesting). i went out on my back deck to look with the binoculars. again even through my high quality binoculars, all i could see was a solid white light, but also saw two aircraft in the same area with their blinking lights as usual. i called to my wife to come out and look at it, of which she did. she too, could only see a white light and being somewhat ignorant to anything that fly's failed to see anything strange about this solid white light. even after seeing other aircraft with blinking lights around it. it then began to travel slightly north and was obscured by the corner of our house.  i then ran to the front of the house and was able to see it again. i would guess it was about 3-4 miles (to the east) away by now.  as i watched it, it turned almost directly north bound at a 90degree turn, i estimate the speed was 300-400mph during the entire flight that i saw. after the turn it continued to fly at the same altitude (this never changed). i began to second guess myself because i thought it was an airplane on approach to land at centennial airport (even though it had just made a 90 degree turn at high speed).  just as i was about to dismiss the thing as some strange sattelite or something, it just dissappeared in front of my eyes as i watched it through the binoculars. very, very, strange.  i noticed that my neighbors across the street were still working in their backyard, which faces that direction, and asked them if they saw it, but unfortunately they were doing yard work and had their noses in the dirt. i don't know what to make of this but it is strange.  about 30 minutes later i called my friend in grand junction colorado (300 miles west) to confirm our elk hunting plans as our applications are due in a few days, and his wife had seen the very same looking object not more than about 20 minutes earlier heading east. i don't know if its coincidence, but i'm very interested in hearing if anyoneelse has seen this thing today. as for describing my \"reactions, feelings, ect\", i had an amazing ufo experience about 10 years ago way more remarkable that scared the hell out of me, but i just don't know what to make of this one. it didn't look at all like what i saw 10 years ago, but all i could see was the light, but even that was a different color than last time. i'm just really interested in what this could be. i even referenced to see if nasa had something going on and almost thought i had it, but the shuttle landed before this happened. has anyone reported anything similar today?","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

this bark was the latter, so it got my attention. i looked up from the grill to the ne at my barking dog, in the reflection of my truck windshield i see a bright white light, that began to fade out. i turned around to face almost due sw and caught the end half of the light fading nearly strait up in the air travelling almost due ne. silently. my initial thought was that i had just caught the end of an irridium sattelite flash. as just as i was thinking how fortunate i was to have seen even the end half of an irridium flash by sheer chance, it got bright again. very bright. almost to bright to look at. a few seconds later it began to fade and i had mild light spots in my vision.(not sure what their called but like when you look at the sun, only not as intense). i was a bit enthralled with this light so it didn't occur to me to look down and see if i could see the light on the ground, but it was far brighter than anything i've ever seen in the sky. when it pulsed it dimmed to an orange-ish light as when a sodium halide light is turned off. the light's shape was an uneven oval, the long arc on the left side was like a soft angle rather than a curve. it took longer to fade out than fire up and i watched it pulse 6-8 times before it sank below my fairly proximal tree line. i watched it 30 - 40 seconds. my dog only barked when it was lit up bright and did this for about 70 seconds after it went out of sight. the tree line is about three hundred feet from me and i'd estimate about a 45 degree angle from my vantage. i couldn't make an estimate of how high in the sky it was being near dark and no noise to judge by. but it moved about the same speed as the coast guard helicopters do when they fly over at about 4-6000 feet (with significantly more noise of course). it flew in a strait line, due ne never changing trajectory or velocity that i could detect. \r\nthe pork shoulder was uneffected by all this and delicious.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

stared outside of my window into the sky. about 2 hours later i realized a bright star and it caught my attention so i stared at it for a while and slowly five smaller stars came out from the brighter star and the smaller stars started circling the big star and it was moving around. i was really amazed at what i was seeing. then i saw it fly away really fast. i tried waking up my brother to tell him but he was fast asleep. i wasn't too sure it was a ufo that i saw until i watched the history channel about 2 months ago and they showed the same ufo i saw and so i was sure i saw a ufo. i couldnt sleep that night because i couldnt belive what i just saw.So then i came to this website to report me ufo sighting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stars at that time, as bright as any star or planet i've ever seen.\r\n   \r\nit was at pretty high altitude, i'd guess at least 10,000 ft & moving slowly, about the speed of a slow moving commercial jet.\r\n   \r\nbut it was a warm white light, like a star, with no red beacon light & no flashing strobe like a normal airplane. also, it was heading south to north, which i never see airplanes go in the skies here. also, airplanes heading away from you do not look like bright stars.\r\n   \r\nafter it went out of sight an airplane crossed its path at a similar altitude, which was a great reference because you could clearly see that the lights were totally different, as well as the ufo was going much slower.\r\n   \r\nalso, the ufo made a couple of abrupt turns, about 20-30 degrees each, in a way that airplanes & helicopters can't. it also seemed to slow down almost to a stop at one point, then sped up again.\r\n   \r\nit also went from very, very bright to extremely dim, almost out, then back to very, very bright. and there is not a cloud in the sky, which you can see from the satellite image i just got from the weather channel's website (see attached).\r\n   \r\nit also didn't make a sound, which is not unusual, but several planes flew over within a few minutes & 2 out of 3 were easily heard. and it was very, very quiet out here.\r\n   \r\none other thing, is that it sometimes it seemed to leave a small brief trail of smoke or vapor behind it, but i thought that was maybe a trick of my eyes. but then i watched that plane fly through the same area a couple of minutes later & it didn't do that.\r\n   \r\ni've watched the skies extremely carefully for about 20 years, i can tell the difference between a plane, a helicopter, a balloon, a shooting star, a satellite, weather, etc. this didn't fit into any of the normal categories.\r\n   \r\ni'm not saying this was aliens, but it was unidentified, flying, & an object, hence the term ufo. also i have only had one-third of one beer! anyway, i just wanted to write down all of the details while they were fresh in my mind.\r\n
