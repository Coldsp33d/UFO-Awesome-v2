i decided to take the long way home by taking palos verdes dr. n...Which snakes along the cliffs of palos verdes. after driving through lunada bay, i could see, in the distance, a greenish glow coming from the point vencenti cove direction. as i got closer, the greenish bio-luminescent glow grew. i finally rounded the corner where the turnout to the cove was and the glow, by then, was all consuming. i pulled the car over in the turnout they have there, half expecting to see a movie being shot.\r\ni got out of the car and as i walked over to the cliff's edge, i noticed three people to my left looking down at whatever was in the cove. it was unusual because i saw no other car parked. it was dark but, i could tell it was aa family of 3...A mom, a dad and a small boy. the mother had her arm around the child. \r\ni continued to the cliffs edge and peered over. directly in the exact middle of the cove and hovering 8\" above the water, was a classic saucer shaped domed craft, ringed with green lights and no more than 50 yards from me. it was big, at least 40 feet across, was domed and had an unreal skin. the closest thing i could compare it to - is a, slick oily puddle. the rainbow colors were dull but prismatic and had a swirling motion. \r\nit began to hum and as it did, the water beneath it began to bubble and steam. \r\ni yelled over to the family left of me but they stood there silent, motionless, memorized by what they were seeing (or so i thought). i was beginning to get spooked. i wanted to see the craft submerge or take off but, i was getting an overwhelming feeling of dread. i couldn't believe my luck and/or my eyes, seeing this astonishment so up close and personal.\r\ni looked over to the family but, they were rounding the corner, heading down the path that leaved to the water's edge. that was it. i wasn't going to stick around. i got in my car and took off. this story has been weighing my mind down lately. thank you for the catharsis

could not get it out of my mind how in the movie he used prime number signaling to summon craft and intelligent entities. i thought this was so far fetched yet instinctively knew that there was in fact something to it. two nights later on feb 24, 2017 at around 9:45 pm something or some feeling made me pop up off the couch, grab my phone (which was fully charged and plugged into the usb port of the television i was watching) and head outside to try and signal some ufos like i saw christo roppolo do in the movie. this is way out of my character to do something like this on a random evening.  i have never done anything like this and do not know why i suddenly felt the need other than the subconscious thoughts stemming from what i have already outlined. my phone screen was on its brightest setting and i had a text app running after just texting my girlfriend. this bright screen of almost all white seemed bright enough to use for signaling so i began to signal upward at a 45 deg angle to the horizon. holding the bright screen down to the ground and them up at a 45 deg angle. i did this two times and 2 ufo orbs started signaling back to me or so it seemed. what i would describe as two bilateral, white light emitting orb shaped ufos signaling light sequences and alternating between being stationary and moving across the sky at different speeds and in different random directions. at first the two orbs just stayed about a foot apart and seemed to signal back at me or to each other, i was very excited due to the surprise of such success trying this new method i had seen on tv. one of them began to drift off right slowly but then became stationary after moving about what seemed to be 1/8 of a mile. this same orb then began to move upward for a short period then back down and over, then stationary again. eventually after filming them for almost 5 minutes and my phone being completely drained, they flew of in separate directions, one fading out the other flying out of sight at an increasing rate of speed that seemed unreal or unfamiliar how something could move like that. it was a very clear night and i do not remember there being any clouds, the temperature was mild and i only wore a short sleeved shirt and was comfortable.The entire sighting lasted over 5 minutes. what i witnessed very much resembled the light emitting ufos which i have seen others post on youtube. they often seem to align with each other to form a perfect triangle or other symmetrical shape. i never saw these things before that night and my only pre-reference was the movie i saw, the youtube videos i found after the fact in researching whether or not anyone else has ever seen this type of phenomenon. the two orbs of light that i saw looked almost like eyeballs looking at me and they appeared to be communicating not only with each other, but also with me. my phone drained to warning level but was fully charged at 100% battery power upon stepping outside. i was able to get 4 plus minutes of video footage on an lg stylo ii smartphone, only it was very difficult to find the ufos through the phone's viewfinder screen. i did manage to get a few glimpses of these thing on video from what i can see on my old computer. it is hard to explain the feeling but it was is if they summoned me off the couch and to begin signaling them, it is also such a coincidence that my attempt to signal worked right away as if they were waiting for me to come out. i now for some reason feel that is is not the signaling that actually gets their attention but rather just having the thought behind the effort of signaling is what works for those who find it easy to summon these things whatever they are. - very hard to explain why i even have a thought about this but i do and don't know why. \r\n\r\nas i witnessed this i felt as if a message was being sent to me which i admittedly have refined a bit but that should not take away from how strong this message was at the time of the sighting. here is the message: \r\n\r\n\"we are here and have been for a long time. everything matters. do not fear us. keep learning, have patience, teach others, practice unconditional love.\" \r\n\r\ni have found these same light emitting orbs documented hundreds of times with video on youtube.. the same orbs i saw have been filmed all over north carolina as well as about 20 other countries as far as i can tell thus far. there must be a simple explanation for theses orbs and the best way to figure it out is by using the data we collect from witnesses and that is why i felt the need to report it. sooner or later we will either make sense of the data, or whoever is responsible for these things will come forward. since this event, i see clearly that our society is moving forward as fast as possible regarding what is revealed to us about extraterrestrial life. it is almost like it is being revealed one person at a time based on their own ability to digest the knowledge so it won't overwhelm then and screw up their life. each person will learn of everything at exactly the right time for them it seems. this is a much less frustrating perspective as opposed to being angry at the government and others who hold on to old ways of thinking. i think a lot of what we want to know about the universe is already on the internet in one form or another, you just have to separate the disinformation from the valid info. using a discerning intuition. this is much easier now that i have had this experience for some reason.\r\n\r\nscreenshots of the video (which are

quebec, lac bernard area, cottage country.  i was speaking with my partner as he was looking for his lost cat outside. he was standing outside the patio door. i noted 3 straight lights in a row in behind him coming over the trees. never have these lights been seen here as well as how low they were. we realized it was some sort of craft, drone, plane... it was dark, but going slow enough for us to run to front door and run out as it went over the house. we stood on the front porch as it went over us. we heard nothing but a very very faint hum.  although we saw lights on it as it was coming towards us, when looking up underneath it, there was no lights at all. it was solid black. it covered a large area of our view and blocked out all the stars but also provided us a silhouette of the shape of the craft. it was triangular, but not a perfect triangle, more long then wide.   we continued to watch in wonder and terrified, desperately trying to get pics or videos.   some were obtained, but quality is so poor being it was night, all i have is the back lights as it left. the back lights had one red, and 2 others that looked white, one on each side of the red. the back lights did not appear parallel to each other as did the 3 white front ones. \r\nthe craft continue over the house and kept following its path. it was huge, very huge however, deceiving as we could not gage the height. \r\n\r\nas i disappeared over the trees making no sound, we ran upstairs to try and follow it. we did see a blue orb ball like thing in the distance which seemed to come from it. it flew erratically close to it. we lost sight due to trees. \r\n\r\nthe whole duration from the time we saw it to the time it was gone was no more than 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nafter coming back downstairs, partner opened the front door, and our lost cat came into the house terrified, i have never seen a cat's eyes get to big and look so scared. we are glad our cat is back, however, cannot explain his return at that very moment or how he was found. \r\n\r\ni chose not to tell anyone in fear of being ridiculed. kept it to ourselves mostly... however, its been over a yer and it is bothering the hell out of me.  i cant get it out of my mind.  \r\n\r\ni relooked at pics, and videos, nothing is clear, you can hear the despair in the voices,  however, the time frame of pictures covers 59 minutes. the issue lasted 15 minutes. \r\n\r\ni just dont get it and had to finally bring it to someone attention. i am hoping you can find out if there was a very large silent black drone in the area that night.

would frequently witness odd things occur at. it was only a few streets away in a typical township neighborhood. i highly doubted his words and just decided to go on the walk for good health. we got to this \"spot\" he so highly acclaimed. 30 seconds into us being there out of no where this long, red and white glowing object appears. no audible sound emmiting from it or it's direction. it appeared like a train going by when you are in a train terminal. you see square windows pass by rapidly until the train's length passes you ajd the last car goes by. it was much like that but doing ot while remaining still. as if it were possibly spinning ajd making a rotation though we were only seeing it from a flat perspective. possibly even of a 4th dimensional object that our 3rd dimensional eyes could simply not perceive. then it did the stranges thing and started to tetraform into these strange shapes while maintaning as one single entity. shape shifting into many shapes but non i could describem it did that as it made its way towards the direction bearing east. then if got so bright and its colora became more red and yellowish white and it shot off but left a trail and almost appeared like some kind of nuclear missle with radiation pouring a short lasting trail behind it and it was gone. personally i have always found the idea of an otherwordly or dimensinal life form or craft coming to our solar system and observing our species or resourses and found it fascinating. i always thought of it as a ship though. this though i do not believe was a ship or was in our atmosphere. think of a giant whale that floated through outerspace. some kind of life form obviously not of our dimension and beyond our comprension. gigantic and observable from our vantage point. thats what i beleive it was after much time spent dwelling on it. some living entity drifting through deep space or in our general atmosphere that was so large it was able to be seen beyond our atmosphere and the light pollution reflecting off of our atmosphere. i wish i had thought to take a video or picture but i was living in that moment. it was too fascinating to look away. i feared the second i did it would be gone and i didnt want to miss a thing.

angeles valley during my laboratory astronomy class , i and three other witnesses saw a ufo--unambiguously a structured craft. we were standing on the roof of the las angeles valley college astronomy/planetarium building, near one of the big telescope domes. we were using our $1,500 celestron alt azimuth telescopes. we started by observing the moon, first with 50 magnification and then 200...The next object we were to observe was the orion nebula (m-42). i was having a hard time getting a fix on it with my telrad, as the orion stars were quite dim...As i tinkered with the telescope, i called my professor over to get some help.\r\nsuddenly, i heard the group behind me freaking out about an object in the sky. “what is that?!” etc. i quickly left my telescope and ran to them (they were right behind me) and asked them to point out the ufo. at first, i couldn’t see it. it was very faint, and the sky was dark. but as i looked, my eyes quickly dark adapted (dialated in about 10 seconds) and i could see it very clearly, unambiguously, it was there. my eyes had to dilate to properly see it (and i was looking right at it)--and once they did, i could see it so well i couldn't \"unsee\" it. a clear, structured craft, a perfect sharp v shape, clearly contrasted with the rest of the sky. the craft itself was very narrow, but the arms were at a very wide angle, like a “v” but turned on its side...A sideways v. a perfectly symmetrical boomerang like shape, with no body or midsection and sharp edges, turned sideways.  i could clearly see the borders of it--it was a solid v shaped craft--not a v formation of objects, but one solid object. there were four big circles of light along each arm of the v, but no light at the tip. the light was a dim opaque white. the object was large considering its distance. the object wasn't particularly bright--it's surface was distinct, but dark and dull. if one were to draw a circle around it, the diameter of that circle would be greater than that of the moon (as viewed in the night sky). it was much larger than any regular airplane i’ve ever seen. flying very low, far too low to be a commercial aircraft... low enough that if it were an airplane it would’ve obvious. it moved at a staight path--45 degrees roughly from the horizon, going from west to east in direction for about a minute, before it was blocked from our vision by a tree in the foreground. it was moving rather slowly--slightly faster than a regular commercial airplane in the sky, but still quite slowly and visible--though it could have actually been moving slower than a commercial aircraft, but appeared to be moving faster because of it's lower path/closer proximity. its direction was from west to east, in a straight line path. it was “drifting”--if i had to use an adjective to describe it’s motion, i’d say it was “graceful”--it didn’t move like anything i’ve seen before.. when it was visible again, it was only a few seconds before it got dimmer and dimmer, and then disappeared...Like it was fading out, fading into the rest of the sky. almost as though it was “cloaking” or dematerializing. there wasn’t a sound...Silent as a mouse the entire time. my professor was tinkering with my telescope while all this was happening...We were freaking out, screaming “professor look at the ufo! look at it!” but he was completely oblivious and focused on finding the orion nebula and getting a fix with the telrad. the professor asked if it could’ve been a meteor or an airplane. it was very clearly neither one...If it was earthly in origin and some top secret craft, then it is very secret indeed because i’ve never seen anything like it.\" \r\n\r\nthe next time the class met (1 week later), i collected signed testimony statements from two of the three other witnesses (asking, of course, that they do not read each other's statements so that the testimony is uncontaminated., with descriptions and sketches. some interesting corroborating details from one of the other witnesses (slightly paraphrased): \r\n\r\n\"saw an object overhead, v shaped with dots lining the object's underside. the object was also almost opaque and difficult to see. it was maybe 30-50 ft in width, 20-30 ft in length, about 100-150ft overhead. moved very slowly, seemed to ascend as it moved further away. it was travelling at about 15 miles per hour. as it left, it became harder and harder to see. it was moving in a southwest direction\". \r\n\r\nthe testimony statements have sketches attached (i plan on showing them to whichever field investigator gets assigned to my case, and publicizing them in the final report).","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
