to 10 of us there ages 8 to 52, males and females.  someone shouted, \"look at the ufos over there!\" and sure enough, as i looked i saw the 5 dancing lights bouncing around very much like the way the sighting looked in the recent great britain video taken outside a pub.\r\n\r\n  i had actually seen the exact same phenomenon in 1975, at lake bowen, in inman, sc when i was 19 years old.  a friend and i were sitting on the dock and it was probably about 10:30 to 12:00 pm/am and i was so excited and was yelling up toward the lake houses of my parents and our neighbors, trying, especially, to get my mom down to the dock before the ufos disappeared because my mother had seen one in washington, dc in 1952 and had been interviewed by the project blue book people and is a big believer, as am i.  my dock friend was truly the skeptical type but even he had to admit that it was a weird sight.\r\n\r\n  during the 2003 event i tried desparately to get in touch with any radio station to let someone know about the ufos but they soon just vanished off into space as did the ones in the 1975 viewing.\r\n\r\n  in 1976 i witnessed, by myself while driving away from someone's house ,a ufo which just hovered and made no sound.  it was not a star (too big) and ofcourse, not an airplane.  i just sat on the road in my car and stared at it up in the sky.  it was probably about midnight, or later, and it occurred in a rural area outside clemson, sc.  it felt as though we were having a staring contest though i could not see any type of being inside, or anything, but the craft just kept staying there, not moving, until i finally got tired and drove back to where i was staying.\r\n\r\n  but the interesting thing is is that both times i saw groupings they were in a cluster of 5, some going to the left, some the right, some down, some up - no particular pattern. and the span of years was 28 years!\r\n\r\n  why doesn't congress talk about this?!!!  we as americans have got to get the dialog going and out in the public realm.  this is insane to keep everything so \"secret\" when everybody knows it's really no secret, as millions of witnesses have seen unexplained flying objects. the disclosure project is great, but the national press club meeting was 8 years ago!  hello?!\r\n\r\n  i am hopeful this information is somehow helpful.  wish i'd done more \"digging\" on my own and had known about mufon and it's too bad the sigthtings were so long ago, but every bit of witness testimony must help the cause, i imagine, to get legislators and whomever interested enough to declassify all the documents area 51 and the military are holding.\r\n\r\nbest regards, \r\n\r\ndc","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

back porch with the window open. it was very cold that night! i know they said on the news that the satalite was suppose to get shot down, but it dont suppose to reach earth until march and when it hit the atmosphere, it wasn't gone be no bigger then a foot ball!\r\ni emailed cnn,fox and cltv and told them what i recorded that night and i didn't get no response back yet! maybe they think i'm pulling their coat tails or something.\r\ni don't know, but as i was recording the lunar moon with an old camcorter,(sony hi 8. model:ccd-trv108)so you know i can't stage or fake what i recorded, all of a sudden out of nowhere, this bright light was falling real fast and disappeared.My girl thought it was a falling star and i said stars don't fall! i knew it couldn't of been the satalite either! so what was it?\r\nthe next day i played my tape back and what i saw wasn't no falling star, no satalite and damn sure not no air plane!!!!!!\r\nit was this light from a far distance, but yet in our atmosphere falling super fast. as i kept rewinding my tape, around this light, looked like some smaller type lights, flashing all around it, poping on and off like shoots from a gun at night! it wasn't attached to the falling light, it was flickering from a distance around it!(mind you, it was from a far distance, recorded on an old camcorter!)\r\ni seen ships all my life and i would of thought i was crazy if i seen them by myself, but i always have somebody there to witness it with me every time! this time i got it recorded on tape and it's all real!!!!!!!!\r\ni let my dad and friends view it and they can't explain what it could be either.\r\ni can't down load it on my computer, because i don't have the proper connects to plug to my camcorter and computer. the computer old too! need an upgrade.Lol! \r\nbut anyways, i just been sitting on my tape, trying to get some feed back and hopefully paid for my discovery, caught on camara!!!!!\r\ni'm sorry i can't send a copy, but i still got it thow!\r\ncontact me or leave a email and let me know what should i do from here.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\n         w. randy pitts","distance":"Over One

south-west/western area of the sky from st. catharines, ontario which is in the eastern time zone.  i did not notice this object while initially photographing, and probably could not have found it with the naked eye even if i had been trying, the sun was extremely bright and caused massive glare. once i seen i had caught it on the camera, i went back and took 4 more pictures, and the final one while trying to get the object without the sun within the picture. i did a little research, and assumed what i was looking at was venus.  i read you can apparently see venus always near the sun, but from what i read, venus should be west of the sun, not east, unless im mistaken.  it appears to have a comet like tail pointing towards the sun, yet looks like it had moved in various pictures.  the one photo where i tried to get the object singularly, without the sun in the background, shows what appears to be two tails pointing in different directions, and showed up much more faint without the sun within the picture.  photo sn850079.Jpg shows the object much closer to sun, almost hidden within the glare, yet it is still there, just a little south-south-east of the sun if one were to use the exact middle of the sun as a reference point.  i don't believe this is any kind of unknown craft, descriptions i have read of the credible unknowns people have caught in film/photographs, do not match

of a light that was in the northern sky above the tree line. it seemed to be at a distance so i didnt pay it much mind. as i walked to the front door of my home, the source of light was not so far away. it was actually just above the trees.  i stepped onto my porch and the light then slowly from hovering above the tree, moved over to about ten feet from the porch and about ten feet from the ground.\r\n     there was no noise, and i did not feel threatened in any way. the light just hovered there.  as i stood there for approx. two minutes just looking at it, the object then began to emit a sound from it.  it was a low tone.  it was as if the object was playing music to me. it went from a low tone to a high tone, then back to the low tone. as it stood there trying to figure out what it was the object then began to change color as the tone it was emmiting began to change in pitch and length of tone.  \r\n     the object \"played\" the \"music\" to me for a period of time i did not make a note of.  as i stood there listening, i raised my hand and tried to feel if there was any heat coming from it, it then made two bright glows of a light blue light the became silent.  it hovered there for a few seconds then it darted into the night sky at a high rate of speed.\r\n     i have no idea what it was nor what it was doing in my presence. i do believe in life out in the universe,

when i looked up and saw a saucer-shaped craft approaching very slowly from the northeast. it was quite low already and came to a spot directly above me. this occurred i believe in 1966 when i was 6 or 7. i had not experience or reference for flying saucers at that time.\r\n\r\ni was not afraid at all. just curious about the interesting 'plane' i saw in the sky above me.\r\n\r\nthe craft had a polished aluminum/platinum metal exterior and a very slight dome on top. it seemed the size of  an average 3-bedroom house. there were no windows that i could see but on the bottom was a round circle of colored lights, which were changing according to its movement. as it hovered over me the lights rotated a variety of colors very slowly (not sure if the craft itself was rotating). however, after a couple of minutes it ascended slightly more quickly and the lights seemed to rotate more rapidly and with more colors.\r\n\r\n(and no, this was not like the jupiter ii from lost in space but a lot more polished and streamlined than that.)\r\n\r\ni believe there were additional, larger circles/lights on the outside of the colored lights. there were no legs or wheels that i could see.\r\n\r\nno light or anything emanated from the craft. i did have the sensation it was simply checking me out. i do not know if i experience what you would call missing time. i did see my friend afterward as they had some new puppies i wanted to see. i did not tell them about the plane (why should i as i had no idea this was something that should not be in the sky?)\r\n\r\nthere was no noise that i recall, nor vapor trail. it flew off, moving higher in altitude in the same direction from which it came.\r\n\r\ni think that i did tell my mother when i went home about the round airplane with no wings. i'm sure

of camden. they were riding away from town on dunbar rd. when an orange ball slightly larger than a golf ball hovered centered, 12\" over the hood of the car. \r\n     they became frightened, and turned around, heading back towards the high school on mill st.. when near the intersection of oswego st. the sky lit up and they first became aware of the ufo presence. \r\n     a large ufo illuminated the immediate sky, trees, & complete surrounding area. it lit up a tree line approx. 150-200 yards away. it appeared to be hovering or sitting upon the high school roof, approx. 300 ft. distant.\r\n     the object appeared to be the size of two semi-trailers long, about 100 ft. in length. the object appeared trapazoidal in shape with upward sloping sides, and a row of windows. there were 9 entities looking at them and turning their heads as if conversing.\r\n     within one to two minutes, they became aware of two grey entities appearing at the driver side window, and two or three appearing at the the witness' passenger side window. one also stood at the front of the car holding a white glowing ball approx. 8-10 inches in dia. the entity held it in both hands with arms somewhat extended.\r\n     the next thing the witness could immediately recall, was standing outside in the door of the car. he noticed what appeared to be a laser spot touching on his chest.\r\n     not knowing, or remembering opening the car door, he looked up at the ship which was closer now. a grey entity stood up in a \"roof hatch\" at the top of the ship. he threw something out, and looked directly at the witness. \r\n     the witness was scared and jumped back in the car, he and his friend fled the area.\r\n     years later the witness relived this event in a dream/memory and recalled being dragged semi-concious through a doorway and placed naked on an exam table, or doctor's bench.\r\n     the witness was terrified. he recalls a very sharp instrument being inserted up his nose, he could feel it penetrate into his sinus cavity.\r\n      there were 5 or 6 entities surrounding him, and they began to take one of his eyes out. he tried to scream in pain but couldn't and one of the grey entities touched his head and shoulder area, and the pain seemed to stop.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

and mother-in-law pulled into our driveway and directed us to view an object in the sky.  we looked up and saw a white light in the sky.  it was not moving.  it seemed quite large.  we stood and watched it for a while.  i called my neighbor friend from across the street over.  the five of us stood and watched it. i got out my binoculars.  i told my husband to get the telescope out from the garage and he set it up. we passed the binoculars around so that everyone could see. i called selfridge air force base and inquired about it. they knew nothing about it.  then i called the news station. first the reporter stated it was a weather balloon.  i said that thing is not a weather balloon. i said we have a telescope set up with a camera ready to photograph the comet kohoutek.  i was surprised when the reporter's voice changed and he then told me. \"yea, we don't know what it is, but we have it on film and it is big as a house\". i thanked him and hung up (i was surprised). most people at that time were not familiar with the comet kohoutek so i guess the reporter thought i was a scientist. (i wish we did actually have a camera on the telescope) we kept watching the light in the sky. we then noticed something happening. a red light descended from the bottom of the sphere, straight down.  the red light then stopped and waited until the white sphere began disintegrating. when the much larger white sphere had completely disintegrated, the red light began proceeding in a somewhat southwesterly direction. because i had completed a meteorology course, i didn't believe it to be a weather phenomena. it made no sound at any time. we could not see anything else other than the large white light and the much smaller red light. our thoughts were that a small vehicle had left a mother ship. the white specks falling to earth from the disintegrating white sphere did not fall to earth so that one could collect or inspect them.  i watched the newspapers.  two weeks later (around october 11, 1973) i read of the abduction of calvin parker and charles hikson in pascagoula, mississippi.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":10016,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.4951,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03232008-0003","longitude":-82.881234,"occurred":118306800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":118306800000,"summary":"Large white sphere stationary in sky, small red object decends then waits for white sphere to disintegrate. the red object then flys away.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Detroit","timeZoneName":"America/Detroit","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"St Clair Shores, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:390118"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2450}
