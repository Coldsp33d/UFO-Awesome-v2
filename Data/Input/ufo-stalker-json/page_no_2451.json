(center for employment training ) and was working on my second job after taking second course(1st job was at watxxxs johxxxn) after going back to school to add to my studies (microwave theory)- (my studies where in electronic eng.)@ telxxxne micxxxxve in palo alto.\r\n\r\ni was drivng from hollister california where i had just played music for an outdoor party ( friends party) and was on my way to play another party in san jose california, i remeber i was suppose to arrive at the party about 8 pm so i left hollister about 6-6:30 ( i was running late). the sun was coming down, and weather was changing as i drove in gilroy california.  i took 156 hwy to 101 hwy north ( had to pick up extra equipment in san juan baustist (my home).\r\n\r\njust after passing morgan hill i noticed a bright blue/red light traveling\r\nalong my side, i figured about 1-2 mile on my left side. at first i thought a helicopter because a plane wouldn't be flying that low, it look like it was flying about my speed then it shot 2-3 mile in front of me in an instant. i didn't relize this at first, i just thought oh these guys turned off there lights. as drove on i saw the light again in a field near a small lake but i notice it wasn't moving so i slowed down.\r\n\r\nthen something amazing happen: the disc light up and you could see the disc shape semi oval with what at first didn't notice small windows in the center area. the bottom half of the disc look like it was rotating and the top light seem to dim down so i could see the size of it ( size of a football field).\r\n\r\ni almost lost it (driving) becuse i could beleive what i was seeing, then just as quick as it light up again it shut it light off again and moved another 2-3 mile ahead ( i knew this becuse this time there was nothing to block my view-mountain, hills, trees).\r\n\r\ni then got kinda excited and keep thinking this is hoax, this can't be real, but how can a blimp travel so quickly, i speed up to finally catch up to it just outside of san jose california near tully road exit. i stopped my car along the side of the road and got off as the blinking light got closer, i could'nt see the disc just the lights.\r\n\r\nthen suddenly just like the first time, again it stopped, no sound of engines no sound period, then the lights at the bottom lite up... only that then, i saw something i had not noticed the first time, the windows seemed much closer and i could see figures in the wondows walking back and forth from one side of the disc to the other.. i was in shock because i knew then that this wasn't a hoax, i don't know how long i was stareing but if it hadn't started raining i might have not snapped out of it.\r\n\r\ni jumped in my car and proceed to honk at passing car's to see if somebody was seeing what i was seeing, but started raining harder so i couldn't tell. just as i drove into san jose i decided to stop again because the disc lite up again and i was hoping somebody would stop with me.\r\n the disc had crossed over me and now was hovering on my right side at least 300-500 ft above the homes in the area, then i did hear a sound.. which at first i thought came from the disc but soon relized it wasn't.\r\n\r\nthe disc shot straight up at incredible speed and the sound i hear was 2 jet fighters coming in fast and low, the came in above and shot up in the same direction the disc ( it was dark but i could see there after burners ( that how i know ther was 2 jets) direction and the last sound i heard was a sonic boom,  i believe came from the 2 jet fighters i believe to have gone to mac speed.\r\n\r\nwell, i got to party late (9-9:30) but most of the people there where allready a little tipsy so no one beleived me. its get better, i made a lot of phone calls the next day to military bases and police (moffet field around the corner) but there where no reports filed on that night on my siteing, i told my friends, co-workers, and bosses in telxxxne and the next day they had put a giant flyer in the warehouse with cartoon pictures of me and aliens saying\" jose's see's little green men\".\r\n\r\nyear's later i was watching tv and a special came out about ufo and there was a picture draw by a man which decribed the same ufo i had seen, almost 10 years later. i was happy to see it, i knew then i wasn't seeing things.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

started taking pictures from my balcony of what i thought was an orb under a tree(i'm familiar with ufos and orbs).  i've lived here for several years and frequently enjoy my view.  this night was especially interesting because of the snow.  this was the first time i had ever seen, what i thought to be at the time, an orb from my balcony.\r\n\r\ni don't know what to call it so i will just refer to it as \"the light.\"\r\n\r\nin the attached pictures, the times and dates are correct and no photos have been altered or doctored in any way, shape, form or fashion.\r\n\r\nthe light was on until i went to bed.  i'm not sure what time that was but the last picture was taken at 1:35 am.\r\n\r\ni'm going to give you my story along with the pictures for simplification.  the pics i'm sending are huge.  my camera is a nikon d40x, 10k megapixil.  most of the shots were take w/ a 200 mm lens.  the shots taken on the 7th are shaky, didn't have a tripod and the exposures were very long.  the shots on the other evenings were taken w/ a tripod but are still not especially clear because the exposure was very long and it's hard to focus a digital camera in the dark (think i got it figured out now).\r\n\r\npicture dsc_0031 -  resize the shots in photoshop or whatever you prefer and you'll be able to follow me.  this pic gives you an idea of where the light is in conjunction from where the pic is being taken (please note this was not taken on the first sighting of the light).  on the bottom of the pic is the railing on my balcony.  along the fence line you can see four trees.  the second tree from the left, look at the base of the tree and follow up the base to almost the top.  just to the left you can see a an orange light...Bingo.  the white object to the far left in the tree line is a plastic garbage bag.  on the three occasions that i saw the light, it appeared in the exact same place.  i estimate the distance to be 150-200 yards from me.  speaking for all three occasions, i did not experience anything out of the ordinary other than seeing the light.\r\n\r\nit looks as if i can only attach three pics here.  i'll be happy to send more to your email address.  i'm not sending pics from the first sighting in the snow.  those are the worst ones in the batch (no tripod).\r\n\r\ndsc_0027 - taken march 10, 12:28 am.  just happened to look out and there it was.\r\n\r\ndsc_0035 - i never saw those green lights to the left of the light.\r\n\r\ni'm going to nutshell this, i have to run.\r\n\r\non the 18th i found a great way to brace my binoculars.  i did not and never did see what one would think of as an orb.  what i saw...I swear to god, looked like glowing yellow, orange or gold light (never saw the actual source of this glow/light) with sparks rotating \"in\" the light at varying speeds, brightness and intensity. the \"sparks\" themselves did not seem to be the source of light that they were contained in.  the \"sparks\" more or less seemed to spin horizontally to the ground in a clockwise motion.  i spent hours watching this and i'm still floored.  the detail was amazing.  i would see \"sparks\" outside of the glow and most of those seemed to keep appearing in the same places, mostly just to right of the light.\r\n\r\nbottom line - i have tried to get to the source of the light but have had no luck, will explain later.  if you have any researchers in my neck of the woods, i'd be more than happy to interview with them.  more than that, i'd like to have someone on call.  should i see the light again, they can come over and take a look for themselves.  \r\n\r\ngive me a call.  \r\n\r\np.S. the three nights i saw the light had one thing in common...It was colder than usual.  i know, big

object then more than tripled in size as it glowed a purple color. then it was gone. \r\nwell i was blown away here i had a real ufo experience.  the following day at sunset yea a stunning chemtrail sunset i parked my vehicle close to a field and watched. \r\nas i watched a plane flying northeast and wondered where the object and its living passengers might be, what looked like a gray plane on a similar path as the first moved closer to where i was parked.\r\ninstantly perhaps telepathically i recognized the object not as a plane. and just like that the object glowed and then another time with the same intensity in succession an orangereddishviolet color.  so i turned to secure my vehicle and bring my dog to the center of the field.  in nervous excitement i rushed and as i turned to move closer to the object it was moving away from me and disappeared into the \"clouds\". \r\n allright the third was saturday 15march o8 and driving back to chicago on hwy 50 driving east i noticed a light among the stars that seemed different. by this time i had made the walmart run to get binoculars.  i saw a light that was vibrating with color from white to red green blue some orange and purple and moving randomly forward backward up down and more.\r\na state trooper came up to check on why i was there and i handed him the binoculars to see for himself. his take was an airplane in a holding pattern. \r\n let me finish by stating that for me this experience was nonthreatnening in fact loving and peaceful.  trusting this will benefit us all as we travel together on this exciting path, shaping the story of our times. \r\ni bless you and thank you all.\r\nin truth peace love and joy\r\nana    \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

toward the west. as i watched it i noticed there was no sound and this bright light coming from a cylinder shaped object had no red or green lights on it as a plane would. i continued to watch it for about 5 mintues as it moved up and toward the west until it reached a spot in the ssw sky and appeared to stop and remain for at least an hour. i got my video camera off my dresser and went outside and set up a tripod and took video for about 50 mintues. the light can be seen on the video changing size and shape for ~50 mintues until it got bright enough outside that the light could no longer be seen in the video. i could still see it with my naked eye but was no longer able to see it on video. i then went inside and veiwed the video on my television. the light sometimes gets 10 times bigger but moves very little. it appears to have taken up a position in the sky and remains there until the sun eventually gets bright enough so the camera no longer picks it up. i am able to see it for another 10 mintues with my naked eye but shut the video off because it can no longer be seen by the camera. the video shows some very unusal shape and size changes. i have contacted 3 local television stations to see if they are interested in observing the video and am waiting for their response.I am 55 years old and saw a disc shaped ufo in december 1965, in pittsburgh pa. which was 30' across and my mother and step father all witnessed this object which was only 30' away and going about 2mph at tree top level. i was so close i could see the tops of equipment racks (baby blue) through the windows on the ufo. since then i have seen nothing unusal until today. i did witness ball lighting in the mid 80's while driving north on mopac in austin, texas where i now live. i never for one mintue though it was a ufo and i don't want to say this object was but the video shows some very unusal size and shape changes while the sony ccd tr 940 recorded this object for over 50 mintues. if your interested in veiwing this video contact me soon. i would like for you to veiw it before any news media  gets it. i don't trust anyone because i know the government can & will cover this up if they get half a chance. i am also interested in becoming one of your field operators for this area. there have been many reports lately of ufo's in this area. stephenville and lake travis have reported ufo's in the last 6 months. the reports say the ufo was cigar shape and extremely large (1 mile long). i never heard of ufo's this large before. the reports i've heard in the past were of cigar shaped ufo's about 300 to 400 yds. long.Anyway, contact me soon as i would like your people to see this video before any news or government get a hold of it. we know they can not be trusted.

larger in size.  i jumped out of bed to watch it out my window as it continued to move to the east and to my surprise it started zig zagging upward and downward in the sky for a few seconds.  at this point i knew for sure it wasn't any airplane or helicopter.  it went back to its previous position and headed east once again.  still in my view, i continued watching it and then it did something i didn���t expect it to do and that is drop downward in the sky and circle around heading westward back in the direction it came.  the bright light and large size appeared to be getting smaller as it

1,500 ft or aircraft carrier sized, only wider than an aircraft carrier (the uss nimitz is 1,092 ft long).  \r\n\r\nwe stood there speechless watching in fascination as the 3 craft (object and 2 fighter escorts) flew almost directly over us.  when it was over we all turned and looked at each other and someone said \"what the heck was that?\" i think that the realization that it was obviously a man-made craft kept us from being scared, my reaction was one of fascination and excitement at seeing such a huge object, obviously of human origin flying just above us. wonder about the technology behind such a device and what the heck is it used for and how do they keep something so big a secret.  we lost sight of the object when it flew over the mountain that we were at the base of.\r\n\r\nthe obejct and it's jet escort were traveling in a southeasterly direction. we observed the craft and it's escort for about 1 - 1.5 minutes while they flew almost directly over us.  it looked like they were flying so slowly that the fighter jets were struggling to stay in the sky, but on further reflection, i think this also was an illusion due to the enormous size of the object.\r\n\r\nother things i remember: at the center of the fuselage on the underside, there was a soft white light emitted from rectangular area directly between the wings, about as long as the wing attachment and about 1/2 as wide as the fuselage. the sides were vertical from the bottom of the object straight up, until it met the \"roof\". the back end of the object was flat and looked like a steel farm building, complete with pointed roof.\r\n\r\nnone of us had been drinking at that point and we were not using any other mind-altering substance.  we all saw it and remarked upon it and have discussed it many times since.  this object was definitely man-made, but is not listed in any catalog of military aircraft that is available to the public.  besides the three of us, i have talked to 2 other people who live relatively  near taos (within 75 miles), that have seen either the same object or something very similar, both of these witnesses also saw fighter jets escorting the object at the time of their encounter as well.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, we did not have any type of camera with us at the time (last time i ever go hiking without one!). but i have provided a drawing of what the object looked like.\r\n\r\nin the 2 years since i have seen the object, i have reflected on what we saw that night and i have wished many times that i had carried a camera with me that night.  however, i probably would have been too dumb-struck to actually use it had i had one.  i and my hiking partners all feel that this object was man made and some type of secret military aircraft with technology that was far more advanced than anything we have been led to believe is currently available.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

thought to be a large airplane hanging over the lake or the neighbor hood behind the lake. it was dark black almost like a shadow but it was odd because it was not flying just hanging there. it was very low to be that big of a plane. i would estimate about 15 stories or a mini skyscraper. anyway as i was driving toward it was getting larger and more visible so i know it was not moving. at first it looked like a f-16 type of plane but on steroids because it was at least the size of a jumbo jet. it also had sharp edges or jagged just like a fighter would.I was driving and it was on my left when i got up closer it seemed to turn into different colors almost like it had spots that changed it seemed as if it were alive almost. it seemed to morph a little, at first i thought i saw wings but then i could not find wings. it had a bubble like dome on top with a gold blob or maybe it was a light inside it. i finally found a spot to pull off into the neighborhood, there were many trees and by the time i found a clearing it had vanished completely. i looked at the clock it was 9:58 am.\r\nat first i was excited but as i got closer i was afraid, it was like my mind just could not comprehend what i just saw. i think it was some sort of disguise and the closer i got the illusion that it was a plane was gone. as i write this later in the afternoon it is becoming increasingly more difficult to picture it. the odd thing is the people around driving did not seem to see it. my husband who was 2 minutes behind me never saw it, he said he was making a call at the time.","distance":"101-500

so i'll be 40 years old in may 2008 ). i had 2 sightings of the same nature between the ages af 5 and 15 approximately in the same village where i grew up ( les escoumins, quebec, canada). here we go...\r\n\r\n1- i was about 5 to 7 years old. it was after diner , maybe 6 or 7 pm in the summer. i was in the kitchen with my family which is the family room in our house. one of my sisters started screaming, asking us tocome in the solarium to see this huge object that looked like a giant fireball. it was going on a straight horizontal path over the nearby mountains. it was heading south-west on a steady speed and crossed the entire horizon without leaving any trace of smoke behind. it took about 5 minutes to cross the horizon visible from where we were. really fast, the phone rang and neighbours who were observing the same phenomenon were calling to ask if we were seing the same thing in the sky.  i really felt like it was a huge fireball, several times the diameter of the sun, orange like. i was very young but i could tell that no one was able to explain what it was.  \r\n\r\n2- several years later when i was young teenager, i heard of car accident about half a kilometer from our home. it was in the summertime;at about 9pm.  there was no lamp post on that section of the street which was uphill from our house. i went to see the accident but it was all over when i got there so i headed back home, walking down the hill. as i was lookin west ( halfway to my right ), i saw the exact sae fireball i had seen years ago. this time it was much further away . it was going in the north-east direction this time. it was a surreal object. exactly the same description as the object i had seen before. it lasted only for a couple of minutes as i lost sight of it over the trees. we were used to see military jets all the time in the area since i was a yung child and it had nthing to do with it. i would call it a real fireball. no noise at all and no smoke trail.  going at a steady speed horizontally. no change of direction. \r\n\r\nthat's all i've seen. never seen anything like that ever again in my life. i've seen shooting stars ,  northern lights, military jets a multitude of times in my life and i can tell you that it was none of those objects. \r\n\r\nthank you.  steve\r\n","distance":"Over One

 i told him i could not sleep and after the cup of coffee i was going to bed.  he said ok and went back to bed.  i never told him or his wife what happened.  i looked at the clock and it was about 2:00am  i have no idea how long anything happened only that it was 2:00am.  \r\ni saw another ufo in colorado off the side of the road parked getting ready to sleep.  i was really tired and i pulled off the side of the road and parked.  i decided to smoke a cigarette before sleeping.  i lit the cigarette and was looking out over the fields at the ranch houses in the distance about a mile from where i was parked.  all of a sudden i saw a light come out of nowhere and shine down on the ground in the field below. i could not really see what it looked like because all i saw was te light shining down to the ground which looked to be about 20 feet around. it stayed on about 35 seconds and went off!  i woke my husband up to look and it disappeared in 2 seconds to the sky!  this happened in july of 1979 at 3:30 am  the whole thing lasted all of about 4 minutes from the time i first saw it to the time i tried to wake my husband.  i was excited by what i saw but amazed at the same time.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":9983,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.3665007,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03202008-0002","longitude":-124.2178903,"occurred":1192687200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1192687200000,"summary":"Made fast flashy movements and disappeared after 1 and a half minutes.","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Coos Bay, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:391071"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2451}
