States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I believe it was just after dinner, when my dog started barking at the back door of the house i was in around the black river falls area.  he usually is alerted to sounds, like vehicles, etc. so we thought someone had drivin up to the house or there was an animal outside.\r\n\r\ni went to the back door, and heard air planes overhead.  the planes were quite loud, so myself and my dog along with my dad and his girlfriend went outside.  we saw that the planes were flying very low.  at different times we saw up to 5 airplanes in the sky from the northwest to the southeast of the house.  so approximately 50% of the 360 degree view around the house had some activity in it.  \r\n\r\nafter watching the planes circle around the sky in the same general area flying low and loud, we saw off across the field in a tree line to the northeast a flash of 4 plus bright orange/yellow lights in a row.  the lights were steady, they did not ascend or descend and were gone within a few seconds.  all three of us witnessed the lights, and we were like \"what was that?\"  \r\n\r\nat first i thought it might have been a plane, however there was no way that a plane would be that steady in the sky for that long of a period without moving from its current location.  the object appeared to be at an angle from us, so when we saw the flash of lights again, but more south and west of the original siteing it seemed that there might be more than 4 lights.  these lights were about 50 times brighter than the lights off of a plane, and were lower in the sky that the other aircraft we saw.  upon seeing the lights several more times, they seem to get further away from our original location where we saw them.  they moved more west and a little more south.  \r\n\r\nafter the frequency of the seeing the bright lights had tappered off and the aircraft had moved further west along with the bright lights, we got in our vehicle and headed west to see if we could see anything more.  in the general area, you can see several towers with red lights, but none of these were anything like the bright flashes of lights we saw from this unknown object and they were verticle lights, not horizontal as these lights were.  \r\n\r\ni am unsure how i really felt, as i had heard about different experiences from others and have often dis-believed their merit.  however, this is unexplained.  after i relayed the story to my brother, he thought that what we saw might have been a military maneuver called counter measures.  he showed me some pictures from google.Com, however, all of these pictures showed that the counter measures would descend and fade out.  these lights did neither.  at the beginning and at the end the intensity of their brightness did not fade or go any lower in the sky.  it was as if a light switch was turned off and on, the objects were stationary and instantly intense and then instantly off after a few seconds.  \r\n\r\nafter we had driven the area, about 5 miles from the original location of the siteing, and saw no more flashes we were not sure what to think.  we did notice that there was a lot of airplane traffic in the area, from high flying jets to small aircraft.  it was a clear evening, so it was easy to see these known and unknow aircrafts in the sky.

footer private yacht with open fly bridge), we leave nassau in morning and anchour out in the central lagoon between atoll islands comprising norman cays different islands.Weather was fine , clear sky , some clouds , no swell, come into contact with norman s cay around 5 pm or 5/30 pm , cruise through to central canal where we stay at double anchor , a front one and aft one as strong currents between tides make that necessary for yacht to stabilize.\r\n\r\noccupants of yacht are my uncle ( businees man) aunt ( architect) myself ( student in a business school in those days) and his skipper , a retired former captain on us navy frigates and destroyers.A very well trained and experienced officer.\r\nour aim was to visit with canadian business friends of my candian uncle who own an atoll on norman s cay with their own private airport and plane and estate.Contact was made by radio in the afternoon and they expected us around 6 pm at their private cay with the yachts tender.The private cay is in the central lagoon only a few hundred yards from where the yacht lies at anchor.A crashed dc3 lies in the lagoon only minutes away from the yacht as was our landmark for returning at night with non light tender to yacht.On the right side of the yacht , a sand bank separated us from high seas.Depth from sand bank to deeper seas averages pristine blue sandy bottom ocean floor with average depth of 20 to 50 meters and abruptly some spots would go down way deeper .All about 500 meters to a kilometer from where we stayed at anchor.\r\n\r\nonce all is ready to get going to freinds estate, while my uncle tries to contact them by radio , nothing happens as if the radio is dead and the yacht positionning lights start blurring and flashing , then all goes dead , including little electric fly bridge crane to put tender in water.\r\nat this stage it is approwimately 6 something pm as sun had just set early as per tropical countris.Perhaps a little later not really sure as had no watch on.\r\nuncle checks fly bridge antenna while skipper verifies electricity in the engine room.Nothing works , just a small torch which rapidly wore out too.My uncle calls us all to join him on fly bridge as he says something amazing is happening out there:we join him quicly and see several fuly light underwater objects moving underwater.\r\nit s dark by now and we clearly saw for or five seemingly circular or oval shapes  with a yellwish shinny light, moving at high velocity from large to shore close to the sand bank where we were at.\r\nit was difficult to observe exactly the shape of these \" uso s\" as they were underwater and moved rapidly , changing course at strange angles suddenly , at velocity the skipper reckoned from his experience being at least one hundred knots.They moved like \"bees\" just moving around in some kind of strange ballet , clear separate objects , at times in shallower waters some yellow luminescent foam or white water would appear at sea surface and would stay like that a few minutes (shinny and yellowish).\r\nthe raddio and electrical power did not work on the yacht all the time of this event.\r\nwe just found it amazing first of all , no real discussion just observing these \"things\" , then curiosity left place to terror , plain all of us being very scared.We asked ourselves wht this could be ?\r\nthe experienced cpatain thought it might be some new technological breakthrough of the us navy being tested off shore as he said happened at times when he was on active duty on rotations from puerto rico to guantanamo back to south florida .\r\n\r\nwell about that statement finished , events proved it wrong as we saw all four or five lights join underwater to become one full lighted larger object which came out of the water perhaps five hundred meters away .We heard water fill some void and splish splashes as the large circular object hovered above the water , yellowish foam had light it enough as was just a few feet above sea level and just suddenly flew off in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nwe were all shaken but and didn t know what to do with this and really it challenged all of our realities so we were really reticent to talk about this.As soon as the object was out of sight , light and power were back on , and we were able to join the canadian landlords and get to their place.\r\nthe subject did come up as we explained why we were later than expected.Their place only six hundred meters away didn have any trouble with it s generator.They listened at told us that they had seen some funny stuff around at times and didn t want to speak about it further either.\r\n\r\nwe just went back to our normal lives after that and have never spoken about this experience ever again at any occasion.\r\n\r\nthaat

several airplanes - it wasn't one of those; &, several satellites pass overhead and it definitely wasn't one of those.  but the most interesting thing happened with the satellites.  when one of the many that i saw passed nearest by the moving star i saw the object's motions settle down and come to a complete stop.  then stranger still - the satellite passed over the star - making the star closer to the earth.  very interesting.  once the satellite had passed a safe distance away my little friend started to play again.\r\n\r\nat all times i felt very safe, with the exception of the first few moments of the sighting.  having never seen an unidentifable object in the sky before i was somewhat nervous knowing that i was all alone for miles and miles.  it was during that initial moments of having noticed the item that i saw it come very far down in the sky...In a direction towards me.  foolishly i hadn't brought any with me to view it up close, but i could tell it was getting very low in the sky and and definitely in my direction.  after a while though it retreated and thankfully my nerves calmed substantially.\r\n\r\nthis viewing as i said continued on for hours.  this is a purely a subjective impression (and a very anthropomorphized one at that) but i started to have this feeling like this 'star' had been dropped off at 'ufo daycare'.  i know it sounds bizarre - but it seemed like this object was given a confined space to 'play' or try out its 'wings' waiting for the 'parents' to finish their earthly errands and come back.  projecting wildly i know - but that's how it 'seemed'.\r\n\r\nit was a few hours into this encounter that i had the brainy idea to start looking around the sky to see if i could see anything else.\r\n\r\ndisclaimer:  this is where i even start to have a hard time believing...\r\n\r\ni noticed after looking around and staring carefully and intently that there were more of these objects in the sky...2,3,4,5.  many.  stranger still each one of them appeared to have their own 'character'.  they were of different radii, moved in different styles at different speeds, all in a uniquely 'organic' way but each to their own design.\r\n\r\nwhat happened next was where i began to think that i must surely be hallucianting (luckly this story has strong witnesses shortly arriving) because i noticed that these 'stars' turned completely still every time i stopped looking at them.  when i turned my attention back to the inidivual objects...Each began to move again.  it was almost like i 'inspired' them to move again which to me sent a chill down my spine because it meant - they knew i was there watching them.  (see wild explanation in my conclusion below)\r\n\r\nagain, i did my best to compare these moving objects against a reference of established stationary stars.  for each object, i could put them in perspective of static celestial objects while they continued to move about.\r\n\r\nto say this was fascinating would be an understatement.  i watched for hours, but then realizing that it was well past midnight i thought it might be time to start back to calgary.  was a difficult decision to make on account of i did not know whether or not i would ever see such a things again (luckily i have not had to worry - but that's for another submission).\r\n\r\ni started to drive back north to calgary looking out my windshield every once in a while to see if the first object i had spotted was still there.  sure enough every time i looked it was happily 'swimming' away in the north sky.\r\n\r\ni drove about an hour north to the town of longview, ab: http://www.Mapquest.Com/maps/longview+ab/? - still there.  i drove on to the town of black diamond: http://www.Mapquest.Com/maps/black+diamond+ab/? - still there.  i then decided to drive to the town of turner valley: http://www.Mapquest.Com/maps/turner+valley+ab/? as i knew that they had a detachment of the royal canadian mounted police and i thought if i could get someone respectable to see it too, my hallucination would be absolved and my story would get some much needed credibility.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, it was closed and all the officers had gone home for the night - such is crime ridden canada.  i continued to drive on back to calgary not being much more than an hour away.  by this time it was easily 2am if not later - when a brain wave hit me.  on my home was the local university's observatory - the rothney astrophysical observatory: http://www.Ucalgary.Ca/rao/ surely there must be some people charting the perseids - perhaps i could get them to corroborate my story!\r\n\r\nagain being canada, the door was left wide open and i walked right in.  i managed to find two astronomy grad students working at cataloguing the meteor show.  i asked them if they could come have a look at 'something'.\r\n\r\nboth came out and i pointed out the object.  it took them a while to discern exactly what i was pointing at but eventually they both saw it.  first question - is it moving?  yes.  second question - do you both see it?  yes.  third question - what the $^&# is it?  this is where the story got interesting.  it's probably a satellite they said - look again i said.  what is it i asked again?  it's probably the north star - look again i said.  what is it i asked once more.  it could be lidar (no not a napoleon dynamite reference but this: http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/lidar).  does anyone operate lidar in this province?  no.  then what...Could...This possibly be.  i finally got the answer i had been waiting for.  i...Don't...Know.\r\n\r\nconfirmation - i'm not crazy.  the one grad student went back in but the other stayed very enraptured.  he lamented that they had not bothered to bring out the infra red cameras they normally had as they didn't think they'd need them for a meteor show - so all we could do was look through binoculars where we saw the exact same thing only bigger.  no additional resolution...Just a star.\r\n\r\ni stayed for a while, my sanity restored, and eventually went home to get some rest.  once i reached my house it was only an hour or two before the sun was due to rise.  i decided to grab a quick smoke before turning in.  my curiousity demanded i take one last look.  sure enough my new 'friend' was still above busily swimming away.  what happened next - completely unnerved me.\r\n\r\nhere i was in calgary, canada a city of well over a million people when i saw it - in every direction i turned i could see little companion objects, swimming away in time to their own particular tunes.  the numbers quickly became surprising and by the time i decided to go to bed and contemplate the impending invasion - i counted no less than 12 in the sky at once.  amazing.\r\n\r\nthe next day i told a very open minded friend of mine and he said he had spoken to someone in a nearby bedroom community of cochrane, ab: http://www.Mapquest.Com/maps/cochrane+ab/? and they too had seen it.\r\n\r\nthat's the story.\r\n\r\nconclusion (of an armchair variety):\r\n\r\nin the days that followed i thought very hard about my experience.  i had little trouble accepting what i saw, with the exception of why there should be some interplay between me and these objects - that they should only come 'alive' when i looked at them.  that part i had a very hard time accepting and explaining.  that's the part that made me feel like i was completely nuts.  not too long after i happened to re-watch the docu-movie 'what the bleep do we know' and something in their struck me.  in discussing the topic of what truly is reality they spoke about one of the first experiences of native americans having seen the arriving europeans.  to summarize the chief felt compelled to look out over the sea for a long period of time.  he stared but saw nothing.  i can't remember for sure but i think he even heard noises coming from the sea.  he continued to look and eventually as if by magic the ship appeared from no where.\r\n\r\nmy take on the situation was that his brain had absolutely no frame of reference, no experiential background, no basis of comparison with which to process this visual information and so his brain - unable to resolve the disconnect - 'decided' to fill in the blank and superimpose something he did know...The sea.\r\n\r\nthis has become my theory for a very important reason.  before this date (& being 36 years of age) i had never seen anything in the sky...In my entire life.  but since then...I see these same objects...Very often indeed.\r\n\r\nif you look at the reports, you will see that i will have soon filed two more (hopefully soon).  and those are only the good ones.  it seems very often now i can go outside and if i look around long enough and pay enough attention - at least one of the stars will start to move.  my brain has accepted the image of what i have perceived allowing me to perceive it much more often.\r\n\r\nunderstand this is not projection.  this is not some halo effect - wanting to see what i want to see.  this is not some observer effect - it...Just...Happens.  most recently the full lunar eclipse of last month held another instance.  and stranger still it is often the same stars that come out to say 'hello' while the rest around them stay as fixed as...Stars in the sky.\r\n\r\nthis event was fully repeated next year.  as soon as i can write this much again - have a look for ufos + meteors: part 2.  even better was what happened this past winter during the leonids.  again i will try and post that as well very soon as that was particular impressive.  look for 'leonids' in the title.\r\n\r\nmy total guess is that these showers provide some natural form of cover to these 'objects' and that is why they tend to be more profuse during these times.\r\n\r\nthis happened over two years ago so i am doing my utmost to recollect.  without question i have missed some things here and there and smoothed some others, but the kernal of this experience is rock solid.  this is what happened.  and to my best knowledge this phenomenon was nothing terrestrial that i have ever seen or have ever heard of of.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"07:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9965,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.532505,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03182008-0002","longitude":-114.230948,"occurred":1155528000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1155528000000,"summary":"Ufos

3/15/08, i decided to try again on 3/16/08 just after 2:00am because i couldn't sleep.  it took a little while but i was able to find the same light again or one very similar which later became a triangle formation of three.  throughout all the filming i had my focus locked on infinity but the light fades out beyond max optical (40x) zoom (digital zooming).  this time i was not as shaken as before and i remembered to include background objects in the video and thus give more detail than i had done before (i learned this on the web site when reporting the first sighting).  i also tried turning off the super nightshot mode and learned a little about that.  when you see me do this in the video it was the second time i tested different modes and it returned the same result.  you hear me say, ���its kinda hard������ and i was describing turning on the super nightshot mode where you have to jump through menu buttons on a touch screen to enable it and that is hard to do and aim the camera too.  plain nightshot mode is a physical hardware type switch and much easier to operate, basically foolproof.  in normal video mode (all nightshot modes off) my camera can see the light from my tv remote very well but in normal video mode the��� i���ll say ufo because by definition it is, the ufo is just barely visible and this is also true of nightshot mode.  i still think it is glowing in infra-red only because i could not see it even on a dark night unless i looked through the camera.  in super nightshot mode it is quite visible although harder to see on the camera���s tiny screen than on a tv or computer screen.  it is never visible to my unaided eyesight.  super nightshot seems to take a long exposure in infra-red (by long i mean ~1/10 second or something like that ��� longer than other modes).  after watching the object and filming for a while it became three objects in the form of a giant triangle all moving in synch.  it���s hard to guess the size.  the three lights seemed connected as if lighted corners on a big triangle, bigger than several large jets, silently hovering and basically invisible to all but infra-red and best viewed with sony super nightshot.   i have edited the video to keep up/download times reasonable.  once again, as before, pain from my disability caused me to stop filming.  it had gotten boring anyway because it just hovered and didn���t do much else and i already had enough video to show that.

girlfriend who lives with me on the northern side of the lake was with her friend who was moving in a building on the direct opposite side of the lake.  i was in our apt feeding our 4 month old son when my girlfriends friend called me on my cell phone freaking out about some lights in the sky.  at first i didnt believe her because she always would give me grief about my interest in the topic until i heard my girlfriend in the background freaking out yelling \"its getting closer\".  understand my girfriend is a very grounded person who before hand never believed in any of this stuff and didnt joke around like that so when i heard her i immediately ran outside with my son still in my arms looking in the sky.  at first i didnt see anything at all and i asked her friend who was still on the phone with me where it was at and she said to look to my left.  when i still didnt see anything i started walking towards the lake thinking that the building i lived in was blocking whatever it was.  as i was walking backwards looking up all the sudden i see several small fire red perfectly round shaped objects zipping upwards over our complex.  i couldnt believe what i was seeing at first because of how fast they were moving.  it reminded me of insects buzzing around the sky.  so as im watching these red objects i had completly forgot about still being on the phone (i had a bluetooth earpeice) when i heard her friend yelling what the hell is that.  i turned around to see what else she could be possibly talking about and saw what looked like a small jet but it had no red or blue blinking lights but one large pulsing white light almost like a strobe light flying directly torwards these red objects in an almost s like pattern.  the objects started flying off towards the east over interstate 75 it was almost like this jet was herding them  off and suddenly they zipped strait up into these low overcast clouds that were hanging over that area to the east and the clouds turned bright red for a moment and then just faded.  again i forgot i was still on the phone until i heard \"where they go\" in my ear but i could still see this plane flying directly over the tree line from my point of view for a moment then that too i lost site of so i asked her friend if she could see it from where they were on the other side of the lake and she said yes so i started walking around the lake torwards where they were standing to get a better view.  they were on higher ground than i was.  as i was walking over there i heard her say \"theres 3 of them that just came back down\" and i saw nothing at first because i was right next to the line of trees that was blocking my view but i caught a glimpse of one of them through the trees so i stopped to watch and then it took off to where i couldnt see it anymore so i asked her friend if they were still seeing it and she said yes but they were flying off towards the east and the plane (jet) was chasing after them again.  so as im walking over still holding my son i start to see other people running by me shouting in spanish obviously freaked out and then the closer i got to the clearing by the other buildings i saw alot of people standing around shouting about what was going on.  there was one man standing on his balcony yelling out \"please tell me im not the only one who just saw that\" and right about then i was approaching where my girlfriend and her friend were standing.  i ran up and handed my girlfriend our son and climbed up a swingset to see if i could see anything from a higher point but by that time everything was gone.                                                                          later when things kinda calmed down i asked them what exactly they saw from the point before i saw anything and they told me that at the first moment of seeing anything it was a big triangle of white balls.  my girlfriend told me it looked like a glowing pearl neclace in a triangle form and she then said it started in formation doing a figure 8 fomation when all the sudden it in her words \"exploded into several fire balls.  that is the point my sighting of it started.  we had several cop cars around our complex afterwards and i approached one and asked if they were called there because of the sightings and the cop i spoke to said in a sarcastic way \"yeah people were calling in about strange lights out here\".  he then told me they were supposed to tell people to calm down and it was the blueash airshow that was taking place the following day out practicing their flights.  i immediatly thought that was bunk unless they were goin to reveal some aircraft not known to any public.  i watched the news that night and saw nothing about it but the following day on local 12 news they said people in blueash which is to the east of us reported on strange lights.  they showed a newsman interviewing a witness and he said he saw 3 objects that looked like flaming marshmellows flying around.  the anchorman then said they contacted blueash airport to see what they knew about it and said they knew nothing.  it wasnt them out there.  the anchorman then started humming the theme to close encounters in a joking way to make fun of the story and that was all i heard after that.  if there werent all those other people who saw it that day i wouldve thought my mind was just blowing things outta proportion but i know what airplanes are capable of doing.  at least ones that are known about to the public.  all in all there were probably 20 people here who saw it.  the thing that bothers me is all the time it was going on i had a camera/video camera phone in my pocket and never once thought to grab it and get pictures.  now i know why the footage you do see isnt any good because nobodys thinking of any thing while theyre witnessing something like that until its over you think i shouldve grabbed my camera!!!!!\r\n","distance":"21-100

evening, after viewing a movie at a nearby shopping mall complex in sandton south africa. when i experienced the event, we were in the sandton suburb of parkmore, not far from the movie theater complex.\r\n\r\nsitting in the front passenger seat, i noticed how dark and clear the night sky was, when i suddenly had the strongest premonition that i needed to look as high into the sky through the windshield as i could  because something was about to happen. i leaned forward as far as i could and looked up through the top part of the windscreen, at which time a bright ball/circle of the most intense vividly neon green/electric light seemed to come at me from the depths of space. the way it brightened so fast resembled possibly how a locomotive might come at you through a tunnel. \r\n\r\nit appeared to travel forwards at me, hold my attention for a brief instant of time and then recede on itself, as though traveling back down a tunnel. this light did not move horizontally, vertically or diagonlly in the sky. it only appeared to come at me (increased brightness of the light) and recede in exactly the same manner (decreasing in brightness very fast). i sensed it as being extremely far away.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat struck me then was the almost ''clairvoyant'' nature of the whole event; that i knew in a split-second that something was going to happen in the sky above me.\r\n\r\nthe entire event lasted no more that about 12 seconds, yet it has remained very clear in my memory to this day.\r\n\r\ni am an aircraft enthusiast and love anything that flies, generally. i

just lit a smoke when i saw what looked liked a spark or something in the smoke stack.\r\n\r\ni told myself it was a spark that came out of the exhaust but i noticed it was moving in an elliptical

seconds later it came back following the same pattern.\r\n\r\ni then called for my wife to come look at it. as she got her robe on it came and did the same pattern again. i called for my wife with more urgency since   i had become really startled. she came out on the balcony and i told to just watch the sky behind the ship and to focus on the smoke stack.\r\n\r\nshe gasped about 10 seconds

to get to the very aft of the ship and then we bolted for the elevator and we got out on the 12th deck and continued aft of the ship. we sat back there for a few minutes with camera in hand.\r\n\r\nafter not seeing anything we kind of lost interest and starting looking at the moon and stars. then suddenly out on the horizon north of us we saw the strange orb \"turn on\" and glide
