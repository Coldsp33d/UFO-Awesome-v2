witnesses to recent obol events in region.)\r\n\r\na woman and her daughter were driving home in kokomo at 7:30pm when they both noticed an orange ball of light (obol) flash on, then off seconds later while stopped at an intersection. as they were turning and discussing the obol, a second one appeared and performed the same on-again, off-again performance - illuminated for just a few seconds before going dark.  the woman judged the size of the obol to be at least a quarter held at arm's length.  as they drove home, they witnessed another obol illuminate near or over their neighborhood.  the woman called her husband who was at home to see if he could see the obol.  altho he looked, he did not see it, and waited as his family arrived moments later. then, together - they kept watch on the skies overhead.  minutes later, another obol appeared - this time to the far west - exhibiting the same characteristics but more distantly.  moments after it \"went out\" another obol appeared through their tree line down lower to the horizon before winking out.  they became concerned and frightened and went inside their home.  later, the woman recalled going back outside and verbally asking the obol to reappear to no avail.  she did notice several small planes which appeared to be circling the area  of sky where the obol display had been earlier.  the planes all departed the area within an hour of their arrival.  despite her fear, she was excited and wanted to see more of the phenomenon.  the witnesses described the obol as stationary, not moving laterally or vertically, and only illuminating for a few seconds apiece.  they also spoke with friends about their sighting and learned two friends in different locations had also seen the obol, one of those witnesses actually videotaping the display.  the video witness was described as being frightened and nervous about what he saw and taped, and extremely hesitant about sharing his information. their other friend who saw the event described what he saw and believed to be flares from aircraft.  \r\n\r\n(the mufon field investigator has requested the original witness contact her friend with the videotape and try to get

yard and saw this dancing like display in the viewfinder.  i looked without using the camera and it was not visible.  i knew immediately that it was something very unusual when it just kept happening and i could just follow it around the clouds with the camera. i realized the star-like objects making these trails were quite obviously above the clouds and it was about then that i just knew it was a ufo.  i couldn't believe the first thing i recorded with my new camera was a ufo.  i freaked out and my first comment was me talking like a sailor and then my heart started really hurting and i prayed for my heart but i could not stop looking.  finally i was hurting so bad and they weren't doing anything new and i was truly hurting bad enough to scare me so i stopped filming. i have back problems too and the combined pain just stopped me.  i know that sounds crazy right now (it does to me too) but i was scared that i might even have a heart attack because it really rocked my world and my heart really hurt and i needed to get away from it.  it almost seemed like it was hurting me directly.  i know it wasn't but in a way it was...  i also know this stuff happens everyday now so its not that special but now i know its real and this was different than what i've seen because the dancing was in the clouds and well defined and easy to see in the video.  i recorded about 2 minutes worth of video of about 3 star-like objects dancing (i mean it seemed like dancing) and leaving long well defined tails in every frame. they would fade in and out behind clouds.  they looked a little like a laser when you twiddle it to get a pattern but they showed up in clear and cloudy sky and faded behind the clouds.  it is a very clear video and its obvious that it is not camera movement because of the clouds in the picture.  since i couldn't see them without the camera i think they must be infra-red light but i didn't think to turn off the nightshot feature.  i was using manual focus at infinity and they are well defined.  i tried to zoom in more but they seemed to fade and so i zoomed back a little.  i was at a pretty good zoom level but i don't know how much. i sure would like some guidance on what the right thing is to do now and i am honestly still quite shaken by this event.  it was so unreal that i almost expected to see nothing on the video but there it is clear as day.  if its some new airplane its unreal because it can make a bunch of big fast turns in one frame of video.  i have much more video than i shared below but i used some sailor talk and then prayed for my heart so i don't want to share the rest without cutting the sound out.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9947,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.8959296,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03152008-0004","longitude":-106.3054522,"occurred":1205588580000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

began to grow and pulsate from midair. i watched it for about 15 minutes. i know it was not the moon, it was already visible when this sphere appeared and it was much larger than anything else, besides the moon, i have ever seen in the sky. it grew to about the size of nickel at arms length, about half-mile from my house. the reds and oranges swirrled together like a lava lamp, i think it was rotating but with the colors moving i could not tell. looking at it i became afraid or aware that it was not of this world or dimension. i got the feeling that something was looking back at me. i stepped out of my screen porch to try and make more sense of this thing, and when i did a small sphere detached itself from the main sphere, about a quarter of its size. it detached itself like two water drops would seperate. once that happened i was more afraid because i dont know if they really were watching me, i went back on to the screen porch and continued to watch. the main sphere began to shrink or dim out, while the smaller one began unknowm course south. eventually both spheres where not visible after 15 minutes. i do not know if this is related but i experienced sleep paralysis that night or what i believe, an attempted abduction. everyone else says i had a bad dream, i am no dummy, the paranormal and the human psyche amaze me. the first thing i due is try to disprove the event with rational explanation. i couldn't find anything to explain my paralysis and the fear that cosumed me when i felt a chalky hand grab me from behind. unable to move, scream,and protect yourself. thats all i remember, i dont think i was abducted but then again with hypnosis that could change.","distance":"101-500

and i had been cooking a breakfast/dinner type deal. for some reason, i decided to go outside and pee, depsite the freezing temperature. while looking west, i'd noticed a star shimmering in the sky and changing multiple colors--not the usual red and blue. this caught my eye and i ran inside and got my brother from the shower. he came outside and, through the binoculars, we could distinctly see an object, not a star, not a planet, changing colors. we decided to get closer so we jumped in his car and drove about five miles north on highway 441. we reached an rv park and began filming with my jvc high definition camcorder. the camera was not steady on a tripod but i got it on film changing colors and such. we decided to go home and see if it was in the same position. it wasn't. we could no longer see the object. the duration of this was about fifteen minutes. the next night i looked outside at the same time in the same position, and it was no longer there. \r\n\r\nnow, three days later, march 3rd: my brother, myself and two others were going to the gym. we had been talking about the ufo video. my brother, r, decides to check the sky once more and, alas, the light in the sky further south, towards a very large lake in my area called lake apopka. it is the third largest lake in the state. we jump in my car and drive to the lake where we get out, with the camera and binoculars, and see the light hovering over a city known as clermont. it was sitting well below the light pollution line and seemed to be about ten miles away. it very faintly disappeared. we caught it on film. then, behind us, we see two lights, appearing out of nowhere, hovering north of the lake, about ten-fifteen miles away. i get out my camera and film the pulsation lights as they sit there, not moving. my dad is an airline pilot, so my brother and i know what a plane looks like. it sat in the same spot for over three minutes before silently, changing from two lights to three, moves across the lake to the east. it disappeared behind trees. we sat there for some time and another pulsating light appeared in the east, directly above the tree line.\r\nwe filmed it as well. after about twenty minutes we decided to leave where we met up with a few friends at my house. they all left and it was my brother who, after getting a distinct \"euphoric\" (as he describes it) feeling, telling him to go to the lake. we jump in the car with the camera and binoculars. we call our friend j (who witnessed the lights with us earlier inthe night.) he tells us to come to his house where there is a light that has been hovering towards the south. we arrive at his place and see the light... except now it is west, sitting just above the treelines. i grab my camera, binoculars and tripod and set up. i get the light on film. now here's what scares us the most. from what we saw, the light moved across the sky right to left, before disappearing beyond the trees. what was caught on film was the light merely dipping out of the sky. there is so much more i would prefer to talk to a person directly. all four of us who witnessed the event are skeptics, and this is a life changing thing. i am most likely going to call the mufon number to speak directly to a person. i believe i might have definitive evidence ufos exist. at least i hope so. our feelings during th event were mixed. we were all very excited and euphoric and felt very special to be touched by such an event. when i saw the lights move in the sky, despite it not being on camera (i believe the aliens tampered with the evidence) i knew, in my soul, that ufos are real. please, any help or advice you can offer would be great! i'm willing to provide more information and answer any questions you might have. please email or call me

10 minutes and then realized the light was getting bigger like the object was coming closer.It was red and yellow flashes.After another 10 minutes i saw it moving very slowly from north east direction to north west direction and lights got smaller and went sideways.The ufo was stable for 30 minutes at its position.I then went down and found couple of people down and showed them the light.They were also suprised as they had not seen something like this before none of us had a camera a video cam.I then came back back up to appartment.At 11:50 am i contacted the ufo reporting centre in washington and filed a report there.At 1:22 am the object has moved north west and the lights went smaller and smaller and sideways stopping every 2 mintues in one position until it went pretty further away for me to see it .If you want the image of this object my best suggestion would be to take satellite photos at the precise time i saw this.You might able to pull some images.This is my first encounter with something like this and will never forget this day and sighting for the rest of my life.You can contact me at 647 989 6110 my name is ameet asrani.

what i did. however, for your research purposes, here was my encounter.\r\n\r\nmy husband and i were just leaving a dunkin donuts drive-thru in bristol at 1:10am. we were talking about how rude the drive-thru worker was, when i looked up and commented on how cloudy it was. my husband loves astronomy and we look at the sky often to observe. anyhow, i was looking up, just east over the town skyline, when i saw a oval shaped, pewter blue colored hovering object. i did a double take, as it seemed to appear out of nowhere, and tried to discredit it as the moon. however, that theory got shot down when the moon made an appearance right next to it, under the overcast clouds. it was hovering low, seemingly just above the town, but high enough so the neighboring town of southington should have been able to see it. i thought i saw lights on the bottom of it, but am not sure as i had my husband speed up, not slow down, and we had minimal glare from the street lamps. i rolled down my window and stuck my head out so that i could see it better. i could clearly see it, sans the lights. it seemed like it was trying to blend in with the clouds, and almost looked transparent in nature. if it wasn't for the fact that it was actually a shade lighter than the clouds, and the moon near it illuminated it, i don't think i would have even noticed it.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was there for about 2 minutes as we drove. it seemed to be moving as we were at that point, because we sped up, but it was still alongside the car. i became fearful and told my husband to step on it. when i looked back a second later, the object was gone, there was only the light of the moon. \r\n\r\ni wanted to see it again, even though i was scared. so as soon as we got home i went looking for it. however, i did not see it again. after wrestling with the idea for 20 minutes, i called the local police to report the incident to them. interestingly enough, the officer told me that he had heard nothing of this nature being reported prior to my calling, but he knew the exact location where i saw it without me telling him. it's also important to note that he did not seem to find a bit of this comical, on the contrary; he sounded quite shaken.\r\n\r\nthis was my first sighting, and it was truly like nothing i had ever seen in my life. i will never forget it, nor will i forget that we are truly not alone.\r\n\r\nplease contact me with any questions. i apologize, we do not have

gustaria compartir mi historia con ustedes porque pienso que talves pueden entenderme y darme un explicacion ,acerca de lo que me sucedio el 15 de julio  del 2005. un tiempo despues me vine a estados unidos.\r\npero antes , quiero remontarme haci mi nines, en donde recuerdo haber tenido un avistamiento , a la edad como de 5 anos.\r\nen ese tiempo , solia vivir con mi familia en un sona mediana mente rural,en donde no habia muchas construciones,y el bano no esta muy cerca de lo que era la casa.\r\nhaci que tenia que caminar un poco ,para poder llegar a donde esta el bano, entonces  mire al cielo y vi una formacion triangular/no tengo mucho detalle de como eran los objetos , pero depues de esto empece a tener suenos extranos. cuando cerraba los ojos miraba luces de todos colorez.\r\nel peor momento del dia era cuando llegaba la hora de dormir. porque esas imagenes se hacian grandes y pequenas en mi mente.Por ejemplo: si pensaba en una flor, esta flor se hacia grande y despues pequena,y tenia movimientos hondulantes.Y todo se movia.Con el tiempo todo esto paso,y ya no me pasaban esos suceso que me ocurrian cuando era nino/\r\ndespues el suceso mas facinante que me ocurrio fue en la casa de un tio ,donde estuve de vacaciones muchos meses. en la misma cuidad donde vivi siempre, en tucuman , argentina.\r\ntodo fue planeado, prepare todo para que esto sucediera,claro que nunca me imagine que fuera tan rapido.La idea surguio de un programa de television donde un grupo de personas ,todos de bolivia , se internaban en el bosque, o cerros.Equipados con reflectores o linternas con mucho potencia, para haci hacer senales luminosas haci el cielo, y esperar una respuesta de los llamados  \"fufaiter\"( cosa que no sucedio).Teme  la idea de ellos.\r\nyo tenia una linterna de mediano tamano , en realidad no era ni siquiera grande .Apenas alumbraba unos 60 metros .\r\ntome una silla , y me fui a sentar en el patio de atras de la casa.Ya  estaba oscureciendo, y la noche esta imensamente clara ,pasadas las 8.30 pm  el dia ya estaba acabando ,y era la hora preciza para empezar , a lo que yo considera  \"que nunca  iba a pasar\".\r\nentonces ya estando en mi lugar , me dispuse a encender mi linterna, la prendia 5 veces y la apagaba. y haci continua mente por unas dos o tres ves.\r\nde pronto unos 3 o cuantro minutos despues , aparecio un luz pequena ,que despues supe que le decian \"fufaiter\" la primera impresion fue quedar sorprendido. no tuve miedo.Esta luz se quedo dando vuelta por lo menos unos diez minutos.Y despues  desaparecio de mi vista .[en los dias siguientes hice exactamente lo mismo y el resultado fue igual , una pequena luz aparecia , daba unas vueltas y despues se iba. esto sucedio por lo menos , desde que comense hasta unas dos semanas despues.Apartir de eso ,y por un periodo de casi un meses , no pude ver nada.\r\naunque estas luces , en el periodo de dos semanas que pude verlas , siempre fueron muy puntales. aparecian de 8pm a 8.30pm./\r\ncuando yo pense que eso no iba a funcionar ,y que estaba perdiendo mi tiempo. volvieron a parecer ,pero esta ves no era un solo\"fufaiter\" si no eran como 10,  no lo podia creer , ya que el dia no era propicio ,porque estaba nublado y parecia que esta por llover. lo que  me llamo la atencion es que siempre fue a la misma hora, de 8pm a 8.30/\r\nyo estaba emocionado por lo que me estaba pasando y lo que estaba viendo, pero a la ves tenia miedo de que algo me pasara.\r\nno queria que algo me apareciera , creo que no lo soportaria.\r\npero lo mas emocionante todavia no habia ocurrido,de pronto entremedio de la luces que estaba mirado, aparecio un triangulo ,que les puedo jurar que paso raspandome la cabeza.\r\nsolo lo vi pasar en cuestion de unos segundo , yo creo como 5 talves,no mas de esos.\r\npero si pude notar que era transparente y tenia unos puntos en el medio.\r\ncreo que tenia un color como blu.\r\nhe hizo uno sonido , como cuando el viento sopla entre los arboles.\r\nun sonido suave.\r\ncuando paso todo esto, quede sorprendido, emocionado.\r\ndespues tuve algo de miedo,mas adelante pense que estaba teniendo alucinaciones y nada de lo que paso era real. empece a negarmelo a mi mismo.\r\naunque esa etapa ya paso. es la primera ves que cuento esta historia en publico.\r\nno me gustaria que me tomen por una persona , \"loca\" por eso nunca le conte  a personas allegadas a mi.\r\naunque en los sucesos que yo mismo he vivido no tengo pruebas fisicas o material propio para poner en este foro.Tengo otras puebas que encontre investigando en \"google earth\"buscando  detalle por detalle.Encontre lo que prodria ser una base alienigena, que esta situada en el polo sur.\r\npero que puedan llegar a una conclusion.\r\npor mi parte tengo muchas teorias,pero es mejor dejar en manos de expertos.\r\nsolo son algunas de las decenas de fotos que podria mandar.,pero que pueda investigar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9933,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-26.9468463,"location":null,"logNumber":"AR-03142008-0003","longitude":-65.2857082,"occurred":1121484600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tucumán","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1121484600000,"summary":"Tranquilo.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/9933_submitter_file1__polo6.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/9933_submitter_file2__polo5.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/9933_submitter_file3__polo2.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Tucuman,

bright object in the sky and at this moment i can not remember if it was moving or not. i just had to really look at this thing and find a category for it.\r\ni looked away and back at it to see if it was still there and then to try and comprehend what it was doing, it moved fast and slow which makes absolutely no sense and i had a hard time determining how close or far it was. it was a bright orange oval moving gradually across the sky and then behind  a large group of trees on the property across the street from me and when it passed behind the trees i thought it must be close. what amazed me the most was the brilliant glow i witnessed through these trees, it was then i decided to look at the clock to document the time 12:28a.M. it sort of had a tail but not really this is why i checked the off the teardrop above cause it had that effect but it was moving across the horizon.\r\n the tail would shrink and grow as it moved kind of distorting the whole shape, i still cannot identify with the way it moved and the only thing i could possibly relate it to is a comet, but i looked them up on the internet and i couldnt find anything similar, i did find a few related pictures on some ufo sites.\r\nas for the way i felt, i was very aware of my feelings because i am a spiritual person and i didnt have any fear i was just awestruck.\r\nafterward i laid in bed and tried to

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting outside smoking a cigarette, facing northwest, on a clear day with only a few wispy clouds.  i routinely watch the skies. never know what i'll see.  today i noticed a bright deep-orange object almost drifting from ssw to nne across my line of vision.   at first, i thought i was seeing an inflated advertising balloon/blimp that had come untethered and was escaping.  there was only a slight breeze on the ground, less than 5 mph probably, and the few scattered clouds were not visibly moving at all.  this orange object did not drift upward, as an escaping balloon might.  it moved steadily in a horizontal nne direction, at about 75-80 degrees above the horizon.   i got a pair of (inexpensive) binoculars and with them the object appeared to be a bright orange cube, slowly rotating on one point of the cube, with black semicircular areas at the two corners of the cube, which were the leading edge and trailing edges of the cube, given the direction of travel.  these semicircles were large, deep black, and pulsated on and off at regular intervals.  it made no sound, had no visible means of propulsion, and was moving slowly and steadily.  i cannot estimate the height or size of the object very well.  it was at approximately 75-80 degrees above the horizon, and could have been any distance out from me; i extended my arm/thumb, and the object appeared about 1/2 the size of my thumbnail.   \r\n\r\nwhen first seen, the object was to my right, in a line of sight with the sky over nellis air force base.  my next thought that the object originated at the base, but its line of movement was from over the city, not the base--hence the escaped balloon theory.  the nellis jets routinely fly over my house when returning to land at the base; this object was traveling in the opposite direction, and no other aircraft were immediately visible.   \r\n\r\nthen, from my left, a small, one-propeller airplane came from the nnw, approaching nellis at a fairliy low altitude, as if on landing approach.  it was white, with red strips, which i'm told are nellis planes; they are seen frequently here.  i'm also told that the air space in my neighborhood is restricted to air force traffic, that commercial aircraft from mccarran field and from a smaller, private airport in north las vegas do not use the airspace.  very infrequently, when winds are bad, some commercial outbound flights from mccarran are routed just south of us, but they always follow a specific path and are easily distinguished from nellis jets by their speed, markings, and light configurations.   \r\n\r\nthe small airplane i observed was lower than the ufo, and did not deviate from its flightpath.  the orange object continued slowly nne, then stopped, then started forward again.  no other craft were in the sky by that time.  the black pulsing half moons were still operating.  the object paused a second time, the black halfmoons switched off, and then the craft shot straight up; no sound, tremendous speed.  i searched the sky with the field glasses, but no sign of it anywhere.

about 4-5 miles out from our home . we started up the hill toward the college and noticed this large object coming over the hill at the same time. we suddenly stopped and said to each other check the clock. as soon as we said that i looked at the clock and it was a little after 1 am. the object stopped directly above us.No more than 50 ft above us. it was oddly shapped. shapped like a triangle with a point coming down from the center. the front glass window was clearly visable. it had 3 rectangle glasses and in the background you could see a light board. kinda like a wall full of little flashing lights. i seen a shape but wasnt clear enough to see what it was. it was human form but larger head. the object stayed above us for approximately 15 minutes before it just left as quick as it came.It was like there was noone else around but us and the object. we seemed to be the only people on the earth at that time and that was a frightening. we immediatly went home and called the police department and asked if there was a report of an stelths in the area. the replyed no. from there we just sat there shivering in fear and wondering what it was we saw. to this day i still know what i saw and i know for a fact it was a ufo . not sure what it was doing over us or what it wanted but i am still frightened when the thought comes up. i dont have a picture of this object all i have is

(i was hurrying to get home so i could watch american idol, so i am real sure about the time.)  a flash of orange light caught my eye.  it was off to the left of my car.  i was traveling north on county road 350 east in howard county, between st rd 26 and center road.  this was a dark stretch of road that had empty fields on either side of it.  when i saw the flash of orange, i immediately saw two bright orange balls of light, low in the sky.  in relationship to the horizon, one was at about 30 degrees the other about 40 degrees.  the were about two inches (when i hold my hand up and measure with my fingers) apart.  they were about the size of a large pea at arms length.  i pulled over to the side of the road to watch them for a moment. i at first thought they must be some kind of light plane with some really crazy landing lights or something.  i rolled the window down and heard nothing..  not a sound and they were close enough to me that if they had a motor i would have heard it.   then, they started moving and i knew right away that there was no way this was a plane.  it was obviously two separate craft and they were moving very strangely.  they kinda \"danced\" around each other.  one bobbed up and the other bobbed down..  then they both vanished in thin air!  i sat there for a minute trying to absorb what i had just seen.. the light had a kind of sparkly glow about it that seemed unnatural.  i felt very uneasy and as soon as they disappeared, i though, \"damn!  what just happened?!\"  i check my clock for missing time but all was normal there.  i raced home and excitedly found my husband when i got in the door, to tell him what i had seen..  i felt all tingly for about an hour after that i i felt very nervous!  paranoid almost..  like something was watching..  i had a real hard time falling asleep.\r\n\r\nthen, today, i am at my massage therapist and the first thing she says to me is, you are not going to believe what i saw the other day.  i looked at her kinda funny and said, wait, don't tell me..  2 orange balls of light in the sky?  she about fell over.  yes, she said, but not just 2.  she saw 4 and her timing was a little later than mine.  she saw hers about 15-25 minutes after mine, but they were in the same western direction..  i am sure she would be glad to verify this is you want.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":9928,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.495147,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03132008-0011","longitude":-86.1324133,"occurred":1205290860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1205290860000,"summary":"Looked to west and saw two bright orange balls of light dancing in the sky at low altitude","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Kokomo, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:392078"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Sonora","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My girlfriend and i,my best friend and his girl were driving through tuolumne county when i noticed an orb in the sky.At first you could see thru it like a bubble.It looked as if something was on the dash,reflecting on the windshield,i rolled down my window & put my head out to be sure it wasnt a reflection and about that time it changed to a milky white and you could no longer see through it.All 4 of us saw it.It seemed to zero in on us at which time i became very scared and pulled my car to the side of the road,turned off the lights and engine.My heart was pounding as it moved in closer,and it hovered above us for several minutes,moved left and right at very high rates of speed,probably thousands of mph? then did what to me looked like the nucleur symbol and shot stright up and out of sight at high speed.I had never seen or heard of the orbs until i told a close friend and she had a ufo book which showed many pictures of the ones like i saw.Also i saw the movie poltergeist and at first it did look like those bubbles coming down the stairway.So i have never been sure if it was extraterrestrial or spiritual.Also,ironically 7 hours later my best friends girl accidentally fell to her death,she was with us of course when we saw it,so i was never sure if there was a connection there or not.I have only told a select few people ever about this for fear of ridicule,etc. but let me say that anytime i hear naysayers on t.V. trying to explain away things seen in the sky i say to myself,\"this guy has obviously never saw a ufo because if he saw what i saw he would know for sure they exist,without a doubt!\" i am a normal,average kinda guy,definitely not some wierdo,well educated,rational thinking person,and clearly saw this object in the sky,unobstructed.  thank you for letting me tell my account,timothy w. hoelzel,jr.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":9927,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.9840911,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03132008-0010","longitude":-120.3821381,"occurred":424584000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":424584000000,"summary":"Clearly observed a white orb in sky it \"zeroed in\" on us then shot strait up and out of sight","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Sonora, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:392079"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Tucker","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Looked outside and saw two objects go over my house. so low it could have landed, a small object followed. it was like a disk, with a red and white light underneath. the red light was blinking. i heard no sounds until it went over and i watched out the front of my house, it was still tree top level. it was like looking at two ships playing tag with eachother. the sound was loud whoosing sound. i followed it for about 3 to 5 minutes. my cats were acting really strange i was really excited. i didn't sleep until after the event. i was up for several hours.

then a bit of fear came over me as to why i was the only one on that road and this thing was here alone in front of me, as if i had caught it before it could leave? i slowly opened my door after maybe 2 minutes just staring at it,very still in the middle of the road, a slight light was around the center. very faint light, very odd! as i stood there standing next to my car, door open but holding on to the car, without even a sound or a whisp of air it switched to its side! in a nanosecond. in a blink! wow i thought! now i was very afraid looking at it i started to get back in my car and then without a sound or even a whisp of air it took off it seemed like instantaniously in the night sky. in a blink! now it was off in a far distance and just stopped dead in its tracks. i turned to look behind me again for my husbands truck, he was still no where in sight and neither was anybody else. i watched the disk in the air hoovering there around 2 more minutes, then it seperated instantly into a ball of flaming fire, the ball exited the disk on the left side, it was amazing!!!!! the ball of fire was orangeish and the same size as the disk. now i had the disk on the right and the ball of flame on the left. they just stayed that way for a minute or so and then shot off into the way beyond my sight range. it all happened with absolutely no sound at all. i stood alone for a few minutes in the street next to the car. wondering what i had just seen. as i stood there a minute longer wishing it was still there i heard the truck turn the far corner onto 28th street behind me. my husband came up behind me and asked me what i was doing standing alone in the middle of the street. i said i had just seen a ufo or something and was very shaken and i needed to go see my mom right now to talk about it. he laughed at me and said i think you need to get home and get to bed. i asked him if he believed me, he said well you obviously had something happen to you, but a ufo??? i started to cry and said i wanted to see my mother right now because she has known me all my life and she knows i would never make up a story about this. so i turned my car around and went to my mothers home, she was only 10 blocks from where this happened, it was now around 2:45 in the am. i approached her home rang her doorbell and asked her to please put the coffee on, because i had an emergency and needed to talk to her immmediately. she said o.K. and let me in and put that pot of coffee on and listened to my eyewitness version of what had happened and agreed that i was not out of my mind. she said she had also seen things on her houseboat in the middle of the night she could not explain. she said it was best not to share these things as most people will label you nut's and i would be the brunt of peoples jokes. so i took her advise and never have really spoken about it until now. i am absolutely sane and very sure of this testimony. i hope by sharing this, this helps validate other peoples sightings. when something like this happens to you it is hard to deal with yourself, i cannot explain why this happened to me, let alone worry about how others will percieve me.  teri lynge","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":9922,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6676874,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03132008-0005","longitude":-81.5077735,"occurred":290944800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Fireball,  Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":290944800000,"summary":"It appeared flat, then flipped on it's side, then took off , then seperated","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:392084"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Mississauga","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was leaving to go to work as a turned on the main street i saw something on the right hand side of the passenger window,i looked again and noticed that it was quit weard,it kind of scared me i pulled to the center of the island on the road and got out to look at it,it looked like a huge circle of murcury just floating in the sky i looked at some cars driving by and felt like i was looking kind of stupid as i got back in my car turned it around cause i wanted to go home and get my camera it went away....When i got to work i told my friend kirk and he started laughing but then realized that i wasent joking,i also told my wife i called her from a payphone at work and she believed me,till this day i have no fkn clue what it was but i know one thing for sure it was not a plane a baloon or a blimp,i mean ive looked at mercury before and thats what this looked like in the air.I am a trae believer and am sick and tired of the government not having the balls to tell the world what is really going on,\r\n\r\nthank you \r\n\r\nmoe","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":9921,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.5921552,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03132008-0004","longitude":-79.6411198,"occurred":995439600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":995439600000,"summary":"It looked like mercury in the sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Mississauga, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:392085"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lowestoft","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 9pm i let my dog out into the garden, whilst waiting for him i was looking around at sky over the north sea & noticed a star that looked as though it was being moved around by the strong winds. it was going up & down & side to side. i then called my husband out & he saw the same thing.\r\ni also saw this star last sept. what is it?
