along with the radio. i looked up into the sky and i saw a strange orange light. i felt almost hypnotized by it, then it disappeared. immediately i told myself that it was only a glare from a passing vehicle. as i was turning to ask my girlfriend if she saw anything. she was actually turning to ask me the same thing. so was a loud, simultaneous, \"did you see that!!?\"\r\nnow skeptical, but still thinking logical, i assumed it was a cloud passing over a bright star. or even a planet. that's when i looked and about 3/4 mile northwest of the initial observation. i saw another one and then another right next to it. each time one appeared... one disappeared in a timed sequence, and in a perfect, counter clockwise circular motion.Hovering, and like a domino effect. now intrigued, i frantically rolled down my window despite the cold winter air. just when i thought it was gone another sequence would appear. each time it appeared to multiply or pulsate, and always in a perfect sequence. there were never more than three lights in each one. i saw a total of three individual sequences on the way home, (like a 5 minute time period). \r\nwhen we got back to the house my girlfriend was trying to convince me that it was probably a helicopter or something. it wasn���t. \r\nso now we're standing in the driveway waiting on these things to show up again. it didn���t take long for them to appear. this time there are 2 sequences in the sky at once about a mile apart from each other, (she no longer thinks its a helicopter), and we can barely see super small twinkling lights in between each pulse. i also noticed that there were suddenly several of the small twinkling lights all over the western sky, moving in random directions. some fast some slow. some times disappearing/appearing. i noticed a low distant rumbling during the sequences. like an engine, or explosion, or breaking barrier. every dog in the neighborhood was barking. just as fast as the show started, it ended. \r\ni personally cant think of a logical explanation. fireworks? in the winter, with no sound, and in 2 different parts of the western sky... doubt it. maybe a flare? why? and how so timed in 2 different areas? could be a hoax... but someone would have to have a lot of time on there hands because i did some research on this today. i discovered several, damn near, to the \"t\", same observation as me. not only that, they were in different years and in different locations. something else i noticed in my findings is these sightings almost always occur in the western sky.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

know\"! just as he said that, in a split second, this object shot straight up into the sky and then shot across the sky in an easterly direction. it was gone! the neighbor jumped in his car as if to try and follow it. my cousin and i ran back into her house to call her parents. the phones would not work. tami started to cry. our adrenaline was pumping and we were scared to death! after a few minutes we were able to call the fire dept. to report it. i then ran down the street to my home to see if my parents had seen it. unfortunately they didn't. the next day there was an article in the post tribune. two women driving down central avenue (10-15 miles from where we were) had to bring their car to a stop. they described the exact object that we had seen. they stated that it looked like it was going to land in the middle of the street! of course, the city tried to say it was the art hill ford advertising plane. i had seen and heard (extremely loud) that plane on several occasions.

could have almost touched it. it was moving exceptionally slow, almost stationary. i then went into the store for maybe a minute or so, came out, and it was completely gone. to note, right after this, the f-16 fighters from the nearby airforce base (hill) started to fly into the sky in the general direction of where the object was.","distance":"21-100

thought to myself, maybe that's what i saw? i doubted it, but was the only explantion that came to mind.  but within 30 seconds, i caught something out of my peripheral vision again to the right

the rode when in my mind i thought, \"that didn't look like a bird.\" at that point i was parallel with it over the field and i looked at it closer. i noticed that it seemed to move like it was a

riding down a major highway on a motorcycle at 60-70 mph and let off of the throttle, but did not brake to slow down. i was litterally having a hard time processing what i thought i was seeing. the object was black and somewhat cigar shaped. as i try to remember i believe it had fins similar to a submarine, but i could be trying to asimulate it to something i recognize. the front end was round like a globe. the middle was a bit smaller and the back end was cylindrical. the very end was flat like a flashlight end. i created what my minds eye sees when i try to remember it in the computer

no other aircraft i have ever seen. as i continued to coast down the highway my mind was racing. i am not sure, but i beleive the object noticed me as well. the front of the object seemed to point in my direction and that is what made me think that it was under intelligent control. at this point i am well past the craft and begin to throttle again. there is no real safe turn around spot on this

record with my story. in 1998, i was 25 years old and working as a production coordinator for a video production company out of new orleans, la.\r\n\r\na couple of times a year, i would travel to louisville, ky to work at conventions and i would drive the company equipment truck, a 15 foot penske cube-type rental truck. i had just finished up a week long convention in louisville and was in the truck, headed home to new orleans, late one spring night. it was around midnight as i drove alone.  i was traveling south on interstate 65 and had made it a couple of hours south of louisville which, i would say put me around bowling green, ky.\r\nin that area, nothing but wide open, rolling cow pastures were on either side, as far as could be seen. i had the window cracked to catch the breeze while i drove.  the radio was off. all was very quiet, just the sound of the wind. i was cruising at about 65 mph in the slow lane as i drove a pretty boring and straight stretch of road. \r\n\r\nthen, what i see next out of my peripheral vision is another vehicle coming up to pass me in the left lane. as it breaks ahead and then eases over into my lane, just 2 car lengths in front of my truck, i realize that this was not just another car. it was a craft that was hovering about 4 feet off the ground, at level with my windshield and had assumed a fixed cruising speed with me. i sank back in my chair, jaw hanging to the floor in utter shock at what i was seeing. it was the shape of the typically reported, hat shaped saucer, about the size of a compact car. it was like a yellowish tan color, smooth all over (no visible windows, lights, doors, bolts, handles, creases, etc. that would make it seem man-made) it had a noodily looking thing that reminded me of a parascope, probably about the width and length of an arm, sticking out the top of this craft. i would call this craft slightly metallic, as my headlights gleamed off of it like a finely waxed show car would. but, i would not say that it was glowing or emitting any of its own light. it hovered there in front of me, in that fixed position, for only about 8 seconds. but, believe me, it was plenty of time to get a good look at it. it then proceeded to gradually and smoothly accelerate away from me. in another 10 seconds, i lost sight of it over the next hill. there was only one other car on the highway that i could see,  way up ahead of it as it moved away. i���ve always wondered if that other driver got buzzed as well. needless to say, my adrenaline was through the roof. i then proceeded all the way back to louisiana, an 11 hour trip that was started at 10pm at night after a full day of work, without stopping. normally, i would check in to a hotel at the halfway mark on those trips but, not that night!

noticed the ufo was toying with the jets the jets appeared to slow down as if they didnt want to get to close to the ufo it was like they were just shewing a fly away. the  ufo begins to back up it then sling shots out of the sky out of sight in the blink of an eye. the jets then turn around and head back south. my friend and i begin to see people pulled over on the side of the road pointing at the sky for the next 20 miles. my friend wanted to stop and say we seen it too but i told him to keep driving because i felt really distraut by what i saw and wasnt thinking clearly. since i never stopped on that side of the road to tell the rest of those people i saw it too i decided to find this website and do so here. and how i felt towards the ufo was the weirdest thing it was like it was saying i come in peace and to not be alarmed no one was running in fear or great devastating panic it was like a cool calmness came over me and i was not afraid. since this knowledge is not meant for everyone but only those who truely believe they are real p.S. i hope to see u in 4d.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

air.  there were.  i saw 2 passenger jets.  but higher up i saw a light colored object flying.  this object was moving quite rapidly, and it went behind the trees, so i had to change my position to see it.\r\n\r\nas best as i could tell it was light colored with a darker center.  the reason i saw it was because sunlight reflected off of it.  after i changed position i saw another object of the same description as well as the first.  \r\n\r\nthe first object was initially moving in a north by north west trajectory.  the second object was moving as well, but i am not sure of the direction, as i only saw it for a short time.  when both objects neared each other they veered to the north east.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and bright. after observing for approximately 30 seconds,  i lost them in the sun, and i also began to see bright spots reflecting.  it was at that point that i made note of the time:  1515 or 3:15 est.\r\n\r\nthere was the sound of a jet present, but i do not believe that the objects were making that sound, i believe the passenger jet, or another aircraft from dulles international airport was responsible for that noise.\r\n\r\ni was in the marine corps, and am familiar with most types of aircraft.  these craft did not appear to be anything that i have seen before.  it is possible that they were birds-except for the fact that sunlight glinted off of the first object, which is what drew my attention in the first place.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path
