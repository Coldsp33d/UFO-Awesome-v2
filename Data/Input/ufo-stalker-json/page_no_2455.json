the stealth, but i don't believe the stealth would be covered with numerous, individually discernible white lights (almost like led's) with a solid white border. it was not moving, but appeared to remain stationary.\r\n\r\nmy guess is that it was very large and very high up, maybe about the height a commercial airliner flies. it was not directly overhead, but was off in the distance, but the odd thing was that i could see it in such sharp detail. as i mentioned, when it lit up, i could see the dozens or more individual lights on it when it lit up, it wasn't just a solid glow. i wondered if the people in the small plane had seen it also. it happened so quickly that i didn't really have time to react. i lost sight of it when my dog pulled me on her leash. after that my dog and i just finished our walk and went home and i told my wife that i thought i might have seen a ufo, and told her about it.\r\n","distance":"Over One

my left i noticed different colored lights on a very large object slowly moving past our house. i thought why is that blimp so low to the ground and it sure has a lot of colored lights. i only saw the last half of the object because our rooftop blocked the front part of the object. it was traveling from the west towards the east. our 2 dogs were out in the backyard with me and one of them barked at this object but the other one did not notice. well the object bothered me so i went back into the house but curiosity got the best of me and i went out the front door and on to the front porch. the object must have made a u-turn because it's heading towards our house. it had a very bright white light which appeared to be coming from the bottom of the object and it was scanning the ground like it was looking for someone or something. i thought how odd that this blimp was flying so low to the ground. it was using some sort of searchlight to find whomever. it got closer to our house to where it was almost overhead and the bright light was now shining on our front lawn. just then a car coming down our street came to a complete stop just to the left of our house. i assumed that the driver must be seeing what i was seeing. i never heard any noise coming from the object and that was another reason why i thought it was a blimp. i was never able see the object's shape but by the placement of the different colored lights it appeared to take on the shape of a blimp. i saw it for probably 5 seconds when i was in the backyard and was initially taken back by the size of the object and the fact it was extremely low to the ground. when i was on the front porch my observation was probably about 15 to 20 seconds and the only thing that my eyes could actually focus on was that extremely bright white light. the closer the white light came towards the porch that was enough for me and i quickly went back into the house. i immediately went to my roommate's bedroom to tell her about the blimp and asked if she wanted to see it. she said that she was tired and was going to bed.  i never went back outside that night because it bothered me alot. i'm now convinced that it was not a blimp nor a helicopter. what it was i don't know but i do wonder if i'll ever see it again. if i do, i hope someone else would be there to witness it with me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

rotate toward me and then away (rotating from east to west),lasting for five seconds, and then disappeared. the pressence of anything that bright immediately got my attention. i checked the time, then used my hand held up to the driverside window to measure this lights exact elevation .It was two hands up from the horizon. several minutes passed as  i continued to seach the dark moonless sky for this strange light.Then as suddenly as it had appeared the first time, it was back in almost the same location for maybe two seconds. as soon as it disappeared, another light the same color appeared almost a finger length  away to the east and was there for approximately five seconds when a series of five lights appeared one at a time in a straight line to where the first light had been. this series of lights were of the same color and appeared as flashes and had no rotation  as the other lights had. at first i thought it could be a helicopter using a seach light but quickley ruled  that out when i couldn't se any  marker lights.I thought it could  be an airplane doing cloud seeding, but there were no clouds and again there were no marker lights . i was going to garden city, ks from

car when i looked up to the sky towards the east and i noticed 7 or 8 slow moving objects low in the sky, it was a crystal clear night and i could see every star in the sky.  at first i could not tell what the objects were at all, i wasnt sure if what i was seeing was the reflection of light off of birds in the distance or firefly's or what these things were, then again, ive never seen fireflys in march up in maine.  but as the objects slowly came closer i realized that they were deffinetly some sort of craft in the sky that flashed white lights. there was no red lights or any other lights on these objects.  i could not tell if they were small airplanes or helicopters, but they seemed to be relatively close to the ground, my best estimate would be somewhere around 5 or 10 thousand feet, but i am no expert on that.  the objects made no type of formation in the sky and made no noise that we could hear at all. they seemed to be floating slowly along heading west. im not sure if weather balloons or satelites can travel together, but whatever we saw in the sky was deffinetly a group of objects traveling together, making no noise, pulsating white, they seemed to be smaller in size, about the size of how a star looks but deffinetly in our atmosphere and fairly low to the ground.  the whole event lasted about 4 or 5 minutes i would say and the objects simply went out of view over the tree line.  i am 23 years old, and i have always been observant to airplanes and objects in the sky, and i have never witnessed or observed anything like this before.  it was the strangest thing ive ever seen and i have been thinking about it since the time i witnessed this.  i emailed our local news to see if they had any explanation for the phenomenon that my friend and i witnessed in the sky, they did not return my email and i have not heard anything else about this.  there is a jetport about 5 miles away from my college as well as the maine medical center, so i am accustomed to seeing and hearing helicopters and airplanes fly over my apartment and college quite frequently, but these objects were different and seemed to be coming from the ocean and heading west, as i live in portland maine, right near the water. i am sure there must be some sort of explanation for this, but it was very creepy and they were certainly unidentified flying objects.  i would be thrilled to find out what these things were.

sphere would completely light up, this was very bright, and slowly dim back down to the point where it could not be seen until it lit up again. i have been hearing about all of the ufo sightings in texas and figured i would report this because it was something i have never witnessed in austin skies my entire life of living here.

(no other cars or people are any where to be seen). we cross the intersection and stop about 20 feet over the crosswalk line(we are looking south directly north from the object). we are in the left lane and all of us are speaking to eachother about if we are all seeing the same thing ,, and we all agreed what we saw was a ufo. we sat there for like 4 minutes. in that time it was just floating there immediately over the fire house, this thing was very low! if someone at the fire house seen it they could have actually thrown a rock and hit it, thats how low it was. looked like it was doing something or checking something out at that firehouse. it seemed like it didnt even care that we were staring at it. it had to have clear veiw of us. it had no noise. not one sound came out of it. no smoke, nothing! \r\nthen im pretty sure it saw us or something because we were all pretty freaked out and were screaming to eachother to figure out wat it was. it suddenly began to move across mountain heading east. it was over the parking lot now, heading southeast. we turned around and went south on mountain. we entered the parking lot of the ontario plaza, and continued to follow it. it kept in a southeasterly direction. once it floated over the buildings which were fairly small one story buildings, it started over the neighborhood. there are alot of trees and it went out of sight. it never once took off at a fast speed nor did it look or go in our direction. our observation of the lights is that it seemed like they were used as eyes of the object .. slowly scanning the area around its location. we were all pretty scared , we immediately new that we saw was not from our world. we were in disbelief! we drove home and promised eachother to never forget wat we saw.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":9872,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0713143,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072008-0008","longitude":-117.6429276,"occurred":820494000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":820494000000,"summary":"Silver disc with a rounded middle shape, circular lights wrapping around the center area, with the center  slowly revolving in a circular motion around the disc","tags":["lights","disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Ontario, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:393985"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Not sure","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i were driving to everette, wa to pick up my step-daughter.  we were traveling down interstate 90 going west.  i was on the passenger side of the vehicle laid back reading a book.  i looked to my right and saw a strange dark object in the clouds.  my first thought was \"that's a strange dark spot in the clouds.\"  i ignored it and went back to reading.  i saw a streak out of the corner of my eye.  i looked to see what it was and saw a new cloud in front of me with the same dark spot.  this time i took a picture.  since then, i have been having some weird occurances happening lately.  i am fully awake in my bed, but cannot move.  a dark silhouette figure with a pear shaped head walks up to the side of the bed i am laying on.  he touches my forehead.  the whole time, i can see the alarm clock.  when the silhouette touches my forehead, i come out of the frozen state but two hours have passed.

when i suddenly observed a long thin object (perhaps 400 feet x 20 feet wide) with 3 dim pinkish or amber lights perhaps 1000 feet up moving in a due south direction at about 600 to 800mph. the object was slightly askew, maybe 10 to 15 degrees, but moving in straight course. a grey solid surface was evident. there was no sound. i lost sight of it as it passed over a neighbors roof top. my initial response was \"what in the hell was that?\". i have lived near jfk and laguardia airports all my life and have never seen anything like it. it left me with a very uneasy feeling.\r\n\r\nfast forward to last night. 3/7/08.\r\n\r\nthis was the first night since my encounter where the sky was again clear.\r\ni looked to the same area expecting to see nothing when suddenly i observed 2 whitish / yellowish relatively bright lights moving north to south again at a very fast rate of speed. another set followed about 5 minutes later. these were completely different from what i observed the first evening. these actually looked as if they might be some sort of huge spot lights, but unlike any i have seen before.\r\na half hour later i returned to my yard to have a smoke and to my complete amazement observed 5 bright whitish, yellow lights in a triangular / delta formation (one light in front and 2 on each side) heading from east to west, and again at a very fast rate of speed and silent. this was again different from the other observations. at this point i'm thinking this must be something being projected from somewhere ground based. there is no way i'm the only one who has observed this. no way. i began to think if tonight's observation may have been a way by someone to cover up what i observed the first night. while tonight's observation left me with the feeling that it could be something domestically projected, my original sighting was clearly unearthly.\r\none odd thing was that after tonight's first observation i went to use my cell phone which i had just fully charged and it was completely dead.\r\n i have no idea what is going on here, but it's all starting to make feel terribly stupid. i'm afraid to talk about it and the few times i have i was met with understandable disbelief and sneers. if tonight's lights turn out to be some supermarket grand opening, or movie debut i would feel dumb, but ultimately much better about everything.\r\ni wish this could all be logically explained to me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

the car around to head south, we stopped and were overwhelmed by what we seen in the eastern sky.  there were 3 sets of orange lights in a triangle pattern.  each set of lights had 3 lights in a horizontal row, totalling 9 lights.  each set of 3 lights were perfect spheres that had even distance between them. almost immediately the lights started dimming and going away, starting with the 3 lights at the top point.  they dimmed from left to right one at a time.  then the bottom left point of the triangle started dimming in the same process, left to right one at a time.  finally the right point of the triangle started dimming one at a time left to right.  this process lasted under a minute.  the lights were very bright, definatly orange, and perfectly spaced between the three points of the triangle.  the size of the triangle patter was very large.  i would say each point of the triangle was at least 100 yards apart. it was way to massive to be one craft and i assumed it was 3 different crafts aligning to form a perfectly shaped triangle.  it was truely an amazing sight.  at this point we pulled the car off the side of the road and sat there to discuss what we had just seen.  we were nervous, excited, and a little frightened from what we had seen.  never had we seen anything even close to this before.  as we sat there we then seen a small cluster of dim white lights in the sky twinkling and almost seemed to be chasing each other around.  they were to the southeast of where we seen the triangle pattern of lights.  these lights also dimmed and disappeared.  a few minutes later another set of three orange lights appeared to the south of the spot where the triangle pattern of lights was and it dimmed and disappeared.  almost as soon as it dimmed another orange set of three lights appeared to the east of that one and then dimmed and disappeared.  this went on between these two sets of orange lights about 5 times in about 10-15 minutes.  after sitting for about an hour total, we went on home since the lights seemed to have stopped.  this is by far the most pecuilar thing both my girlfriend and myself have ever seen in the sky.  i have nothing to

couldnt make out its exact shape but what i did find strange was the lighting. one white light at the front and 8-12 lights on what would be the rear edges of the wings running the width of the object in a perfectly straight line.  all lights were in white apart from the one on the right which was red.  none of the lights pulsated or flashed.  no tail light which seemed to give it a triangular shape. i would estimate the size about the same as a military hercules type plane and could have been just that, but i have never seen these illuminations on a plane before. was moving approx north then banked west. not sure if it was a plane or not so i thought best to mention it.\r\n\r\nsighting 2:\r\nlate sept 2007. st.Teath. out watching the stars at about 11.30 pm, saw a single ball of high intesity white light heading in my direction. very fast, silent and very near to the ground. it made me instictively duck down as it got near. i would estimate 25-30 feet from the ground.  scared the life out of me.  about the size of a large beachball, no idea what it was. sighting lasted only a few seconds. clear sky, good weather. headed north out towards the sea, went out of sight in seconds and i had a long field of view from where i was standing\r\n\r\nsighting 3. st. kew.  as above but early eve in march (10th or 11th?) 2007 at about 6.45pm. sighting lasted under 10 seconds.  nice weather, very little cloud, about 1 hour before sunset at a guess. 2 white balls of light side by side appeared to be touching each other but only just. looked just like what i saw later in the year (in sighting 2) but heading west, again low and very fast, no noise. these two objects seemed to fade out and dissapear as i watched them. left me very confused.\r\n\r\ni cant express how bright these balls of light were, they reminded me of firework intensity only more constant and much more pure.  really hard to put into words. anyone else in the southwest seen them? please contact me at davecat440@aol.Com as i would love to know what is going on.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9862,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":63.595863,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03062008-0010","longitude":-154.4905019,"occurred":1204862100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alaska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1204862100000,"summary":"3

noticed a beautiful,golden orb that looked much like a large venus, or saturn or star, standing in the south sky. it was a clear stary night and i could see many stars and planets, but this was about 5 times the size of the largest stars visable. i quickly jumped out of the car to get a better view of the magnificent sight! \r\n\r\nas i stood perfectly still watching this golden orb, it made a quick short horizontal movement back and forth. then to my astonishment, another beautiful orb exactly like this one came zipping out of nowhere and stood next to the other orb. for a few seconds neither of them moved, then suddenly they both began to move quickly back and forth in a rocking movement much as if they were dancing with each other. with another quick movement the one to the right zipped out of sight. the movement was much faster then that of a shooting star and i barely caught a glism of a light trail for a split second.\r\n\r\ni quickly ran inside to call my family out to see the awesome sight, but when we came back out, both golden orbs were gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

114 in indiana about 35 miles west of ft. wayne and about 2 to 3 miles east of disko.  we were facing south and looked off to the west southwest.  it was hard to tell distance, but it definitely didn't look far off maybe 7 to 10 miles.  there were 6 stationary bright lights in the sky.  there were two rows of three lights and they were positioned as if they were on a boomerang that was tilted forward slightly towards the viewer. as shown below...\r\n\r\n\r\n      *                                      *    \r\n                          *\r\n

time.  the lights definitely didn't accelerate.  they were there and then they were gone.  from the time the first one disappeared until they were all gone was a matter of seconds.  but none of them left at the same time.  everyone disappeared individually.  they left in the sequence to the above figure...\r\n\r\n\r\n    1                                      2

around bunker hill/kokomo area.    they don't usually fly in that area, but they do training over our general area, so it wouldn't be out of the question to see a plane in that area.  but there were too many lights and no strobe lights on the wing tips to reveal an aircraft.  there are no cell phone or other towers in that area of the sky that could possibly give the illusion of lights disappearing.  there also was no movement.  none side to side or towards or away from us.  it was hard to believe.  i watch a lot of the ufo hunters and ufo files on the history channel and usually am a skeptic.  if i hadn't seen this with my wife, i'm not sure i would have believed it other wise.  it was quite an amazing experience.  i just wish i would've had a video or photo camera with me.","distance":"Over One

deep pulsating sound.  not really noisy or loud, just this low deep sound that i'll never forget but am at at a loss to really describe, maybe something like noises from a power plant or something, like electricity??? and it may have been imagination but it sounded like a rotating sound??  we had some woods and a park directly in back of my backyard and i remember thinking it had something to do with the street lights that were in the park or something. anyway, i just remember laying in bed and listening to it for a while, and i just remember it scaring me, but not really knowing why, and just waiting for the noise to go away and trying to make myself go to sleep.  the next morning i woke to my mom yelling for me to come to the back porch and look at the yard, she was all excited.  when i looked outside there were three circular places on the grass that were like matted down.  one in the front nearer toward my house and two behind that one- they were in a triangular formation.  it totally freaked me out.  my mom was going on about how aliens had landed and was joking about it and i told her what i had heard that night while in bed, and i started getting really scared.  she basically just teased about it and told me it was nothing and not to worry about it.  well, she basically put me at ease, because that was the age when my mom was still right about everything and could protect me from anything.  anyway, years later, when i started hearing about crop circles, etc, this whole incident came back to me and now of course it freaks me out thinking about it.  i was just talking about it today, and we were wishing it had happened during this time of digital cameras.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9859,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.1024831,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03062008-0007","longitude":-72.582161,"occurred":407491200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":407491200000,"summary":"Sound

north carolina waiting for the movie to start.\r\nwe heard a sound in the distance louder than a jet. it sounded like the ocean was in the sky. we looked up and coming from the east was a huge\r\negyptian pyramid (like the one on the back of the one dollar bill).\r\nit was fling 2000 miles an hour stright towards us. it had the outline of a jelly fish (picture a jelly fish 200 ft high, 500 ft long with a egyptian pyramid inside the front part of it). the pyramid had this outline around it and it pulsated light pink to bright red. this was no human craft of any kind. it stopped to our left and out my driver side window it hung there in the air and did not move, but the outline of the craft (the jelly fish) looked like it was swiming slowly in stationary position with this object. the tintagles of the jelly fish would turn blue\r\nand would make something like electronic sparks. this was somekind of sheild that protected the craft. i looked stright into the pyrimid as it was stopped now and it had indivisual black stones stacked one atop the other. i could see the lines of the stones so clearly. this craft looked just like the one on the back of the one dollar bill, except the cap stone\r\nwas connected on this craft. i stared stright into it and and felt the \r\npresence of something completly evil!!! i tried to get out of the car, but\r\ni could not move nor could she. then all of a sudden this craft started backwards toward the north and it took it less than 30 seconds to completly disappear from our sight. a minute later an air force jet came from the west on the exact same heading that the craft had came in on.\r\nthis jet slowed down as it approched the same air space where the craft had been, which told me they had it on radar, because he was fling so slow\r\nhe was like \"where did it go\"? what was it? let me put it this way, bush sr. has said when it comes to ufos \"we don't no the half of it\". we have all these satelites pointing into space because we are tring to find life somewhere out there in the universe. these ufos are only 25,000 ft off of\r\nthe ground here on earth. if they wanted to make contact with us, why don't they just answer air traffic control? if you believe the bible, it makes it very clear. god exists and his angels, the devil exists and his angels, you and i are here and there isn't anybody else according to the bible. do you know why the government is keeping all this a secret?\r\nthey have to because the truth cannot be made known until the time appointed. the object that landed in kecksburg, pa in december of 1965,\r\nwhen the government and nasa reveal what it was, it will be a lie and a\r\nmajor deception. life on other planets? as long as they can keep you looking into space for that, you can't see what is going on right under your nose.
