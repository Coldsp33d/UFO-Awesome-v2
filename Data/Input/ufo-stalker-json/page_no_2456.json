county road 12 a couple miles past smith res. on a dirt road running across a small piece of land that i own there. upon waking, i realized that i needed to \"relieve\" myself and dreaded getting out of the car as i imagined the wind must really be blowing to cause all the tumbleweeds to be hitting the car as, after waking, we had heard several more \"knocks\" on various parts of the car. \r\ni opened the car door and there was not the slightest bit of wind blowing. i quickly shut the door and had to think hard as to whether or not i wanted to get out of the car without knowing what was around the car. i used a flashlight and car lights to try to distinguish the location of the noise. during this time, there was what sounded like something giving the antanne on top of the car a thump with subsequent twang noise. as we could see nothing and i still needed to relieve myself, i went on ahead and got out and squatted very close to the car to take care of business. there were not any sounds while i was outside and i actually used telepathy on the outside chance that i was dealing with \"another\" entity and asked that \"whomever\" not scare me while i was out of the car. i stated that i have a heart condition and that a fright could literally kill me. the noises did not start again until i got back in the car. none as loud as the original noise but persistant -- every 15 seconds to a minute in between. the noises were all over the car. i listened for scratches from claws but heard none and ruled out grasshoppers as some of the noises were too loud to be attributed to that. \r\nwhen i got up the next morning, i immediately got out of the car and checked the fine sand all around the car and found no tracks of any kind. i did spot what appeared to be raccoon tracks off of the road but nothing discernable around the car. my friend stated that she thought it might be the car cooling down but we had been parked since about 7:30 that evening and i've camped in the car before and have never experienced anything like that.\r\ni will, of course, be car camping there again in the future and will let you know if i discover anything. there was also a female written about in the book \"that crazy lady down the road\" that had a similar experience.\r\nthe ufo phenomena has been a subject of interest to me for years and if you've heard of others who have had a

called were all out of service???\r\ni am not usually paranoid, but a little is sometimes healthy.  hope this reaches you!\r\n \r\n \r\nmy name is w. loring warner.  i was in the u.S. coast guard from 5/65 through 5/69.  i was stationed at uscg air station, elizabeth city, nc where i was a radio man.  my duties included hf communications with airborne ascents,  monitoring 2182 mhz, the distress frequency for marine use, teletype network, and, on the mid-watch, listening to a vhf network of military installations  in the area.  this included bases in north carolina like cherry point.  norfolk and all the airbases. maryland and andrews afb. i had seen this system in operations several times when an aircraft was missing and resumed down.  one night something very strange happened.  at the time i wrote everything down as it happened, some four hours worth, but over the years and several hurricanes, the file was destroyed.  however, because i did write like a mad man, i do remember some key points. i can not be specific on the date except to say i believe it was summer, and the year had to be either 1967 or 1968.  \r\n \r\nas soon as i heard the tone go off on the network speaker, i went into the pilot's ready room to listen.  eventually, many units were speaking with each other over this net.  andrews was tracking an object coming up the potomac river.  visual reports were being given first hand as to the size of the object. some station advised that they had deployed their theoda light to try to determine the altitude of the ufo. military  air assets already airborne confirmed the object from above the object. it was approaching washington dc.\r\nas i said, this went on for as long as four hours i would say, and the hair on the back of my head stood up the entire time.  i knew i was listening to an historical event.   but there was never a mention of the event anywhere, anytime.  over the years i have been waiting for someone to bring this significant sighting to light, but it is as if it never happened.  it did happen in the dead of night, but should have been seen by some civilian, or law enforcement.  the military was in a near panic as they tracked the ufo and each base that reported had a different angle of view.  \r\n \r\nit bothers me that such a significant event could go for this many years without having some type of discloser.  perhaps that is why i am writing this account. i am not given to exaggeration.\r\n  \r\ni am, however, a believer.  like faith in god, i believe on faith alone.  i have seen things i couldn't explain but could not classify as truly unidentified.  and although i experienced this event simply through the ears, there was no doubt about what they were seeing and how they dealing with it.  if i had to categorize their voices, it would resemble the bentwater recordings.\r\n \r\n \r\nin conclusion, sceptics must be the most miserable people on earth.  i appreciate this opportunity to let you know abut this incident.  and i feel better for having shared it with someone who can perhaps shed some light on this unknown incident of an unknown flying object. i heard fear, amazement, concern and total concentration as to the implications of a second breach of dc by a ufo.  and, no one was joking about what was happening.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"For fifty-one years, i have kept silent.  but now, because i may no longer be considered a hallucinating nut, i will tell my story. \r\n\r\ni did not see a ufo or a flying saucer.  but, what i saw was a saucer . . . unpainted silver metal . . . parked in a large well-lit hanger . . . fitting the classic description of a saucer . . . with the words united states air force painted on the disc���s top near the saucer���s edge.  \r\n\r\nhow i came to witness this craft is through a bizarre string of events.\r\n\r\nin october 1956, my husband, who was an army ordinance armament engineer at the detroit arsenal in warren, michigan, and who had top security clearance, had orders to visit a research and development company in a los angeles suburb.  since his brother lived in la and had never met me and our three month old daughter, my husband made arrangements for us to accompany him. \r\n\r\nour commercial flight was to take off from the detroit airport and fly non-stop to la.  as i recall, it was to depart in the mid-afternoon and arrive at our destination in the early evening there.  for an unknown reason our flight was cancelled and all passengers were rerouted to other flights.  i remember how nervous i became because i was in the process of weaning my infant from breast to bottle and the delay would upset the feeding schedule.  this concern was relayed to the airline agent.\r\n\r\nseveral hours passed and we were finally ushered onto the same plane that was the original aircraft scheduled to fly the cancelled flight.  no one else was on board except the crew.  it was explained that the plane had to be in los angeles for an early departure out from there the next day, so it would fly dead-head.  it all sounded plausible.  \r\n\r\nwe were told that we would fly over the grand canyon and with such a clear moonlit night, we should see it clearly.  the stewardesses and an officer joined us for visits and we were treated like royalty with food and drink.  i did not drink, but my husband had more than enough and was soon in a deep sleep.  after i saw the grand canyon, i closed my eyes and tried to rest.  even though it was very dark out, the stewardess lowered my husband���s and my window shades (we were sitting across the aisle from each other).  in a short while, we started to descend.  at first, i thought we had arrived in la so i raised my shade.\r\n\r\nthe airport we landed at was a large complex with many hangers and single-storied buildings, but i don���t recall seeing any that resembled a terminal.  since i had never been to la before, i still assumed we were there.  the plane came to a stop far from any buildings for only a few minutes.  i heard little sounds and low voices somewhere in the plane.  then we taxied further down the tarmac to the end and turned to roll down another runway.  that���s when i saw the large hanger with its doors completely open and all the lights on.  inside stood a saucer shaped disc that filled the center of the hanger.  it had a clear dome on the top-center and stood on three legs.  various objects were attached, protruding out from the edge and underside.  the words united states (star emblem) air force were painted on the top disc near the saucer���s edge.  no one was in sight in or around the hanger.\r\n\r\ni was shocked, but completely fascinated.  i didn���t believe in ufos or saucers, but here was one about 150 to 200 yards from me in plain sight.  i tried to wake my husband so he could see it too, but it was useless.  i had about two minutes to observe the craft as we completed the turn and rolled past it.  then, we made another turn and picked up speed for take-off.  i don���t recall seeing any city lights in the area.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw the stewardess again, i asked her about the stop and the place that we landed at.  i didn���t mention the craft i saw, probably because i may have still been in shock or maybe because i was aware that i���d seen something i shouldn���t have.  i can���t remember her exact words, but she soothed me and said they just had to make a quick stop to drop something off, that it was nothing and would not delay our arrival time in la.  it seemed like we were aloft for a short while before we started our descent to la.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived at la and my husband finally woke up, i told him about it, but he was in a grouchy mood and told me i was crazy.  there was a rash of sightings in the 1950s and he scoffed at all of the witnesses���so did i.  later that night and several more times, i told him about the air force disc.  each time he got angry at me.  he said i made it up or that i was  hallucinating.  he kept insisting that we were on a through-flight and there were no stops.  he told me to shut up about it���that people would think i was nuts and it would affect his job, so i spoke of it no more.  every time i thought of that

'that plane's really low'. it seemed to be only 60 or 70 feet or so off the ground. we watched where it had gone for a moment and it suddenly came back into view as though it had just turned around, right where it was. 'must be a helicopter' we thought - it was still very low and manouvreing like a helicopter.\r\nwe continued to watch it until the traffic lights turned to green and we moved forward. it wasn't until we were about 100 yards or so closer that we realised it wasn't a helicopter. this object was basically triangular in shape though its corner points were missing and it had various coloured lights - i distinctly remember red, white and green along it's edges. unlike aircraft lights which flash, these lights were pulsing slowly lighter and darker as though 'breathing' over a two to three second period. \r\ni know that many reports of black triangle craft describe them as huge, football-field sized craft (for example, those described by colm kelleher, previously of the national instiutute for discovery science organisation [nids] in america), but the craft my son and i were observing would only have been about 30 feet on each side.\r\nwe watched astounded as it weaved its way around, approx 60 feet above ground level, at a distance of about 100 yards from us. we continued to move with the traffic and my son watched as we moved. i kept an eye on this thing in my door mirror (that's how low it was). eventually it moved over the roof of a b&q hardware centre and went out of sight.\r\non our way back home an hour or so later, i looked over to this centre. it was unusual in that it had large illuminated light panels in its roof and a large illuminated canopy over its gardening section. of all the buildings in the vicinity, this was the only structure that actively directed light upwards and so may have 'attracted' the craft. the centre also had a tall, 20 feet raor-wired compound area. i noticed a strobe-alarm light had been set off inside. additionally, i noticed there was a power pylon immediately behind the store. we last saw the craft moving towards this pylon.\"\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the object when the traffic lights changed and we moved forward with the traffic turning into taunton road, losing sight of the object behind buildings.\r\n\r\ni attach a digital sketch i made of how the craft looked from where we sat in the traffic\r\n","distance":"101-500

visible. at arms length, each about the size of a peanut, perhaps slightly larger. one was higher than the other, but both still below my own roofline. they both hovered about 5-10 minutes, with steady lights of blue, green and red.  by green, i mean a light turquoise. as i watched, trying to set up a telescope, but was unsuccessful in spotting them before they began to move off, one seemed to grow smaller and turn orange and began to move to my right. at first i thought it was moving directly away from my position as if it were moving off into the distance, but then i realized that it was moving in a straight line, slowly on a horizontal plane. i ran around to the front of my house and could watch it moving further until it disappeared from view behind rooftops. the other light

(names changed to protect their identity), came forward at our meeting on february 19th with a mind-blowing story. \r\n\r\nwhat follows is my recounting of what befell bob on a fateful date in january 2008...\r\n\r\nhaving caught a late night movie at a theater in the area, bob dropped off his friend, todd, before heading home. with the soaring price of gas, bob decided to take a deserted country road back to his place, which served as a shortcut. around 1:45am in the early morning of jan 21st, bob drove east on copper canyon rd. driving over a railroad crossing, at a sharp bend in the road, something otherworldly suddenly appeared from behind a tree to his left! \r\n\r\n(the attached photo was taken of the illustration todd drew, after bob reported to him that he'd seen an \"alien\" in late january.)\r\n\r\nslamming on his brakes, bob was stunned as a thin, gaunt, hairless, long arm, long legged creature, suddenly was caught in the high beams of his headlights. less than 20 feet away, this weird, 5 foot tall, slumped forward, long fingered entity darted smoothly across the road, alarmingly in 2 seconds flat! however, the real shocker came when it stopped under the yellow light of a streetlamp looming overhead, then turned, glancing in his direction!\r\n\r\nlike the eyes of a cat, yellow light reflected back at bob as he tried fighting off the fear of the unknown. a riot of conflicting emotions and questions flooded over him. what the hell was it? what was it going to do? \r\n\r\neven as all this began welling up, he stared wide-eyed and shaken, as the unexplained nocturnal visitor silently turned and resumed fast, gracefully sliding strides, thankfully away to his right. bob's mind whirled as he watched it quickly squeeze through the partially open gate of a driveway. within moments, while bob's lungs finally filled with short, agitated breaths, the thing vanished into a line of woods on the far side of a field to the se. \r\n\r\nit was so difficult for bob to come to terms, let alone grasp, what to do after seeing something so profoundly peculiar, at such point blank range. in an absolute state of shock, the rest of his drive home was a blur. closing and locking the door firmly behind him, the true nature of reality wrestled with everything he had personally ever known. therefore, it was only natural that he refrained from openly sharing what had happened, fearful people would think him crazy. \r\n\r\neventually though, he told his friend, todd, days later. being something of a hand as a graphic artist, todd worked extensively with bob to successfully reproduce the detailed illustration of the being i've termed, the creature of copper canyon.\r\n\r\nif all this wasn't already amazing enough, earlier that very evening, around the stroke of midnight, my wife, mary, and i witnessed a glowing, amber colored, chevron shaped object zooming through the sky. the ufo appeared to only be about 1000 feet up, and moved like a stone skipping across the surface of the water. looking up through our car's wind shield, we watched the flying object travel se down mckinney rd, for the approximate 2 seconds it was visible.\r\n\r\n(the ufo picture was taken by charles miller, in north carolina, in 2007; found posted on http://www.Ufo-reports.Com. i felt compelled to include it due to the astonishing similarity between it and the one my wife and i briefly saw on january 20th, 2008.\r\n\r\nremarkably, tuesday, february 26th, bob phoned, saying he had found the ticket stub, i'd asked him to look for, from the movie he had seen the night of his incident. our mutual exclamations of surprise must have reverberated for miles, as nagging suspicion became instant realization. the ufo we had seen took place only a few hours before bob's sighting of the creature of copper canyon! \r\n\r\nthrough getting the image and story out into the arena of public opinion, which has begun by appearing on www.Coasttocoastam.Com, we're hopeful that our observations and ongoing research into this bizarre chain of events, may engender others to come forward and share what they know. \r\n\r\nbelow is a link to a forum thread i made to discuss the creature of copper canyon and ufo sightings in denton, texas area

lightning to our left.It remained \"lit up\" for a long count of approximately 2 to 3 seconds. she stopped the car and we were looking at the spot where it had been. then it (the lightning) happened again. this time we saw definition and it stayed lit up for another long count of 2 to three seconds. it looked like it was coming from an object 70 ft. or less off the ground. we could see the dark outline of something and the lightning came out of the bottom of it. the lightning looked like it was in a glowing martini glass. the top of the \"glass\" tapered down to the \"stem\" and the lightning went through the center of it. there is a small hill in the back of the object and it was below the top of it. we couldn't see exactly what it was but it was not small. i would say it was about 100 ft. long and 30 ft. high. the \"martini glass\" was fairly large and it glowed off the bottom of the craft. there was no sound as with lightning and it was very bright. gale and i looked at each other and she said \"nobody is going to believe this\". the object was less than a quarter mile away. there was no sound at any time. then it just disappeared. the next morning a friend dropped over by my house and i asked her if she had noticed anything \"weird\" last night. she (very excitedly) said \"you mean the blue lightning\"? i said yes and she told me that her and her boyfriend and my landlord and other people down the street she had talked to saw it also and they were all talking about how beautiful it was and how it was so strange that there was no thunder and how it lit up the whole area. we didn't get a good look at the object but for an outline of it against the hill. it definately was something that none of us had ever witnessed before. i,ve heard that there is a

a fellow investigator, bob, had eyewitnessed an \"alien\" crossing a rural road on january the 21st, 2008. while on location where this incident had taken place, bob repeatedly expressed feelings of being watched. none of us present saw anything obvious in evidence to cause this. however, something i can't put my finger on literally gave me the willies; hair raising, a unexplained gut feeling of something strange, a rare thing in my book. \r\n\r\nwhen i left, my odd sensation of something unexplained going on held on until i pulled into an exxon a couple of miles away for a cup of coffee. an unusual chill nagged at me, which i can't solely contribute to the cool weather, but i shook it off as i drove the 5 miles home. yet, the capper of the evening happened after i pulled into my driveway and parked. \r\n\r\nas soon as i got out of my car, and looked into the clear, starry, northern sky, i was surprised to see a fast, glowing, diffuse light appear. approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon, it travelled east to west, in a slight arc that appeared to take it a little further away and downward from my perspective. it was there and gone in a second. \r\n\r\nwhat made this so truly amazing to me, is that this sighting was strikingly similar to the previous sighting my wife and i had on january 20th, 2008, which we now know occured hours before bob's sighting of what i've named the creature of copper canyon! \r\n\r\nit was hard for me to believe, let alone admit, sighting another object in the same area, since no one was with me when i saw it flying by. it's just my word,

cat fireworks out of rawlins.  we spent a couple of weeks shipping fireworks all over the state.  on the evening of 7/2/81 about 11:30 we left rawlins and headed for laramie with a pick up truck loaded with fireworks.  my five year old son was sleeping on the passenger seat with his legs on the floor of the truck and his head resting on the seat.  about a half an hour out of rawlins, i looked up and saw three very bright, large objects lined up in a row.  i said to pat, \"look at those stars!\"  i had no sooner said that when the center object descended at a incredible rate of speed and came straight for our windshield.  i screamed and yelled, \"it's going to ram us!\"  i kept thinking that that thing did not have air brakes!  as soon as i said that the object stopped and descended slowing to the pavement less than 100 ft from our truck.  we were stopped by that time on the side of the road.  all traffic on interstate 80 stopped and all head lights went out.  \r\n\r\none of the obects was to the north of us by that time and was being pursued by a jet, i assume out of warren afb in cheyenne.  there was also an object to the south of us and it was keeping equal distance at all times from the ground, which was very hilly.  \r\n\r\ni started to get out of the truck and was stopped by pat.  he said wait until you are invited.  i thought to myself that this was an invitation.  \r\n\r\ni looked back to the object that was to the north of us and the jet was still chasing it.  all of a sudden it looked as if the jet had just stopped in midair!  then i realized that the object picked up speed and left the jet behind.\r\n\r\nthe object that had landed on the highway in front of us was as big as a house.  all i could see was a brilliant light.  i could not see past the light.  then all of a sudden the object disappeared in front of our eyes.  it did not take off that i could see, it just disappeared.  i felt a terrible loss when this event ended.  i really did want to go with them, even though i was afraid at first. \r\n\r\nthe whole event seemed to take only about 20 minutes, but when we got to laramie about 1-1/2 hours from rawlins it was almost 3:00 am already.  \r\n\r\ni started having dreams about the incident shortly after and did recall being inside the object. \r\n\r\nthis incident was reported to leo sprinkle, phd after the event had happened and also has been included in a book written by tim beckley, inner light publishing and myself.  \r\n\r\nafter the event ended traffic on interstate 80 had returned to normal.  i do not know if anyone else has reported this incident or not.

decided to take my two dogs out for a short potty break. i was on my way back to the house when i stopped to let the dogs sniff around. while they were occupied, i looked up at the stars, enjoying the evening.  i looked for the big dipper, found it, then started to look for other constellations.  i was trying to remember which star in the big dipper was supposed to point to the little dipper and started going out from each side of the dipper to see if i could find it.  when i looked out to the northwest, i saw a very high star-like object moving across the sky from east to west.  i watched it for a couple of minutes trying to decide what it was.  it was too high to be a plane. it was right up there as high as some of the stars. i thought about a satellite, but the satellites i have seen from this area did not follow that path, but travelled from west to east.  i was puzzled. it had to be a satellite, i thought, because it was so small and so high.  just then it abrubtly reversed its course---it simply stopped as though it had hit a wall and went straight back--no turns or change in path involved.  right then i knew it wasn't a satellite. i continued to watch and it went forward again, then suddenly went straight up in the air vertically, then straight down vertically, then back to its original path.  it continued doing these same manuevers as i watched for another minute or so. i could not believe what i was seeing. no plane or satellite that i was aware of could do that. i was very close to the front door of my friend's house and, although i was afraid i would lose sight of it, i really wanted someone else to see what i was seeing, so i ran to the front door and called my friend to come out.  he did, but when i got back to look for it and show him, it was not visible. i watched for a three or four more minutes, but could not find it. i went in the house and did not look any more because everyone else teased me and was skeptical.","distance":"Over One

when we spotted a set of, what appeared to be retangular lights in a triangular pattern, moving from the east to the west. when it was directly above us, i noticed that i could see an outline of a triangular object that literally blocked all stars in between the set of lights. it moved very fast and very quietly. i ran out into the street to get a better view and by the time i really was able to comprehend what i was seeing, it had gone over the house and was gone from view. i was in awe, i couldnt believe what i was seeing. i estimate that it was roughly severaly hundred feet off the ground and was massive in size. estimated guess would put tailend of the craft at aprrox. 150' in length. i knew right away what i was looking at, i know what i saw. i've served in the u.S. navy in san diego and have seen many kinds of specialized aircraft and what i saw that night was something that i had never seen before or anything like since. the wife tried to say it was a tri-pod(3 meteorites fall in sync), something i had a very hard hard time accepting. it left no trails, wasn't a fireball and lights were to symmetric to be an anomaly. to this day, i am still baffled by what we saw that night.
