nothing out of the ordinary was in the pictures except for one. now we did not notice this object  when we were making our visit, but when we got home from our vacation i saw this strange object that was kind of the shape of  a boomerang mostly black and gray. we didn���t notice it while we were physically there but hopefully you guys can tell us and examine the picture of what  we saw.\r\n\r\n to

i pulled down my road, which is out in the country(going from west to east)@ about 1:45. as i was coming to my drive way, i notice a ball of light(redish-orange flickering).It was about a mile or two away.As i stopped in front of my drive way, i opened the door and put one foot on my rail and the other foot inside the suv. i took a picture, my finger covered some of the field of view. the object can still be seen, its under the finger in the picture. so, i took another one thinking that i need a better shot. the second picture, my finger is above the object. the object can still be seen. i told myself, i'm going to get beside my suv's hood and use the hood as a stand(for my rt. elbow). before i went around the door, i flashed my bright lights @ this ball of light(flashed about 4 times). as i walked around the driver door, i started to say in my mind: if you are real,come,show me, and give me something to show people.  thinking this in my mind, i was placed with my right elbow on top of the hood. very secure, so i could get a motionless picture. as i look at my cell phone display(how you see what you are taking a picture with), the object was close. about 90 to 100 feet away. as i took the picture, four cylinder green beams of light shot out towards me(as the flash went off, i think that the bottom two green lights are a reflection of the top two. because of the hood), as if i took them by suprise. i only saw the ball object in my display, before i took the picture. the flash brought out the other 4 beams. when i saw the beams, it scared me. i ran around the door and jumped in my suv. all i had to do was turn my steering-wheel right and hit the gas and i pulled up to my garage door. i turned the suv off and said to myself: i did not just see what i think i just saw. stund and not knowing whether to get out or stay in my suv. i got up the courage to get out and walk down my drive way and look down the road(to the east, northeast) to see if i could see anything. i did not see anything. went to sleep and went to work the next morning 10:45 a.M., when i got home around 9:45 p.M. i download images from my phone. this is when i realizied that i caught something in a picture that is not normal. as i played with the contrast,tint,& etc...   my right shoulder blade began to itch, i noticed a rise in my skin where i was itching. i took off my clothing top, to discover these 1.5cm lumps or bumps that are in a certain area(13 bumps)(1.7 inches above shoulder apex and 2cm medial to medial shoulder blade and a inch from my lateral right side of my body). these bumps are in my epithelium tissue. they are not radiopaque and sometimes send shooting pain into my shoulder blade and threw my under arm(very seldom do they itch). the next night 2/29/2008(took picture and theres the object again--blew it up on computer) i took another picture 3-2-08, caught the object again. these two pictures, the object is position up & down -n- left to right,respectfully. today(3-3-08) my relative came over to by time, before his girl got off work(6:25p.M. till 7:58p.M.). i ask him to take a picture of the sky. aim to the north northeast---make sure that theres nothing in the sky. he calls me @ work when he's on his way to his girl's house. he was startled and said what is that. i ask him, you saw something? yes!!! that gives me the chills. i feel goosebumps--i do too, i responed. i ask him, was there anything in the sky before you took the picture. he said, there was nothing in the sky and then i placed my phone in the dircetion and could see a ball of light. it move out of my camera's view and only caught the end of it(you can see this object with the camera running and can't see it with your naked eyes) he thought it was his radar detector, so he unplugged it. then put the phone up and caught the ball w/a big head and tinacals, attach-but to the side of the ball(zoom up, just like my picture that i caught with the 4 green lights.Zoomed-looks the same). haven't down loaded images, yet. he's emailing them to me. he also told me that he felt like crying and that his eyes would start watering, when he took the picture and when he thinks about the image that he saw. we have talked on the phone and both of us feel this crying and an intense feeling of somebody watching or staring at you. we feel these tingles and goosebumps. but the intence urge to cry comes on like in waves.\r\n    i come home @ 8:17p.M.(3-3-08) and stop in front of my driveway and take a picture. i catch the image again, but it is at a farther distance. i can't zoom up enough to get a clear image. it does look like the ball or object thats been caught on camera.\r\n    these things are watching me, at lease at home. i haven't tried taking pictures at friends houses yet. if you could please send some investigators to check this out, it's a little spooky. aka:the

satelite moving through the sky but about 5-10 times the speed. it was dimly lit but visiable to the naked eye. i saw a dim star like object but my friend says it looked like a boomerang. we are living right on lake michigan so when we saw it the object was slight east of the lake and direcly south moving north at a very very high rate of speed. so fast that it moved from south to north in a matter of 10-15 seconds. as it passed over our heads it did a 90 degree turn and headed out towards the lake viering northwest. at this point we still had a good vantange point but the object completely dissapeared. it made no noise and had no flashing or blinking lights of any kind. the only color it had would be a dull yellow/white. we both were conviced that it had to be a ufo. we ruled

croix river.  at the time of the sighting we were in chisago county headed toward marine on the st. croix township.  as i was driving i happened to noticed something eye-catching to my left across the road.  there was a small house with a shed on a hill no more than 60-70 yards away.  the sun had just gone down over the trees and it was getting hard to see rather quickly.  i counted four big lights, hovering and wobbling, above the shed.   the first thing that came to mind was that a helicopter was hovering above the shed but there was no sound (window was down) and the lights were way too big.  the lights were flat and reminded me of flourescent panel lights because they did not shine a beam or anything like that.  the lights were glowing and then as i drove on and looked back, they dimmed down and turned off-like someone deliberately didn't want to be seen.   i did not see any disc or a solid shape above the lights but rather a dark image occupying space above the lights.  i was more focused on the ackward hovering lights than anything at the time.  i was also driving  about 55 mph parallel to the site for under a minute.  it was sudden, ackward, and by the time i adapted to the new paradigm, our car had passed the location rather quickly.  my son was in the backseat right behind me and never said a word during the situation because he was experiencing the same scenario.  he told me that he saw two giant round lights, a disc shaped craft that was greyish in color.  he did not see four lights because he was more fixed on the shape and body while i was driving and focused mainly on the lights.  either way, together, we have put together a mutual picture of our experience.  it was just too dark to make out anything 100%.  now, here is where the sighting gets more weird.  we had a car about 50 yards behind us the whole time so i decided to find the nearest turnaround to head back to investigate what we saw since i had my video camera in the car.  we were also very excited and curious.  the next turnaround was approx 1/8 of a mile so we took a left and turned down a gravel country road to head back.  we had to drive a while before finding a series of crossroads.  the car that was behind us also turned down the same road.  there were no other cars in the area so this was easy to determine.  i then took a few right angle turns on various dirt roads to see if the car would continue behind us and it did.  in fact, i couldn't ditch the car.  it paced itself with us and matched every move.  unfortunately, i was forced to leave the area out of fear that we were in danger so i headed back to the main road and sped to the nearest town about 10 miles away.  the car finally turned off when we reached a populated area.  the car was grey or silver and looked like a classic cop car from the 70's.  at least that was my impression because it was dark and hard to see in the country.  other things to note:  we frequently travel this spot and there is nothing around the shed except for farm fields.  there is no tower, windmill, silo, or any other buildings in the line of site of the shed for miles.  there is just forest that reaches the st. croix river.  my other thought is perhaps the car that followed us around wanted to speak with us to validate what he or she had seen as well.  i did not feel safe to stop and chat with someone who mysteriously followed us around.

texas. i'm not sure of the date, time of year, or the time of day, but i think it was evening.  at that time i was young and had never heard of a ufo, so i had nothing in my imagination for comparison for what i saw.  one of the neighbors called me and my husband outside to see the strange lights.  many neighbors were watching it descend on us - a giant, neighborhood-sized circular set of colored lights low over the neighborhood, and getting lower.  i can't remember if the lights were only on the outside or all over. i just remember that the lights were colors, pulsating, and silently descending. i don't remember what colors were present.  i don't remember seeing any object behind the lights, so now my mind wants to say that the lights were all over, but i'm not sure if that's a fact.  the circle of lights was unbelievably huge.  i was so terrified that i ran into the house to get my babies.  i thought it was the end of the world and that the brilliant lights were god coming to earth, because my mind could not fit what i was seeing into anything that i already knew.  i told my husband that i was not ready.  we picked up the children and then i ran around in the house a few moments trying to figure out what to do.  when we went back outside a few moments later, it was gone.  a neighbor said that it just went away, and swung his arm up to the sky.  the next day, the newspaper said that the lights were probably just the aurora borealis or something similar.  yea, right.  you can���t use old reasoning to understand this new phenomenon.  you have to just accept what you saw and not try to make it fit into what you used to know.  once you have experienced something like this yourself, it doesn't matter what the authorities or anyone else say to make it fit into something common.  you saw.  you experienced.  you know.  you just know.  you have one piece of a mysterious puzzle, and you long to find people with other pieces.  eventually we will have the whole picture.  since that time, i have not agonized over what i saw or worried about it in any way.  i feel comfortable with having had the privilidge of that experience.  i do believe that what we saw was not of this world.","distance":"101-500

upon landing the lights switched to a bright beam of white light.I put on my shoes and coat after seeing 3 sets of 3 craft swoop in and land out there somewhere. i grabbed my binoculars & headed out to the front yard,to watch the 4th set of 3,as i could see them coming...As i'm standing there looking thru binoculars & getting them  in my sights, i can hear this turbulant swish sound above me , so i tilt my head up to the sky above me,binoculars still on my eyes,and to my great surprise, directly above my head/yard was a craft with the same circular lights right there!All i could see in the binoculars was the lights,it was that close...So i move them away from my face and watch 3 of these things fly right over me, i think they were so low they must have barely cleared the top of my pine tree! i don't know where these 3 went,i just can't recall...I think i was in shock,& i duct in on my porch because suddenly i was very scared for some reason.I came in & looked out the window again,but saw nothing else going on after that.I can't even say that the last 3 i went out to watch coming in , actually landed...Which is stupid because i'm very interested in ufo's and had encounters before and was able to keep my witts, & this time i just forgot my purpose of being out there after seeing those 3 go right over my head.(and, by the way , i couldn't see a shape to the sets landing out there, but the ones that flew over me , definately black,definately triangular,but had smoothed corners,not pointed .And rotating,flashing lights of many colors.","distance":"21-100

to grow somewhat larger as it approached. after awhile, it appeared to have stopped dead in the sky in our clear view (i would estimate at about a 15 to 20 degree angle from our vantage point). my older uncle was insisting that the object was \"shivering\", but being younger and more contrary at the time, i insisted that it was due to the atmosphere. as the darkness set, the fireworks started. after about 45 minutes to an hour, the display ended and we continued to sit on the porch. we then noticed that the object appeared to be floating away, back in the return direction from which it came. now sensing that this was no ordinary object, i ran inside to get my 35mm still camera with telephoto lens. by this time it was night, and even with bracing the camera on top of one of our cars, the best photo result was a pin point. i estimate that from the time we first noticed the light, and the the time it finally disappeared, was probably about two

making a tomato sauce i heard somthing like a very large waterfall, like the niagra, outside. it did not sound like a plane so i went outside to check it out. in the southwestern sky, heading southwest, i saw about 9 dull red lights that were all perfectly spaced apart, not more than 100 yrds.I thought that they could be planes, i'd never seen planes fly like that,  but they did not have lights like a plane and they seemed to be attached to each other. they were moving together like they were attached to a larger superstructure. if they were then the craft had to have been over a mile long. i called my girlfriend out to see it and she said that the lights could in no way be planes. i concured. the lights were low flying, below 2000 feet, and were moving very slowly in comparrison to a plane. they were all moving in a straight line as well. after the lights past, about 10 min,  we went back inside. i was thinking that st louis had its own stephensville type sighting, that is what it reminded me of. my girlfriend thought it wass pretty crazy to see something like that but she really doesn't get excited about that much, since she is pregnant, i on the other hand felt exhilirated and in wonderment. after a couple of minutes i heard the same thing again and went outside and it was another one with only 3 lights but with all the same characteristics. i watched that one fade away and then went back to cooking, really weirded out.

door open.  as i was watching t.V., a bright white light in the sky caught the corner of my eye through the doorway.  it was so bright that it was distracting.  but i just assumed it was a star.  five minutes later i heard my mom yell from the kitchen, which had direct view of the front doorway, \"what is that bright light in the sky!\" \r\n\r\nwe went outside and stood there watching it.  it just looked too bright to be a star, but it wasn't moving and it didn't make a sound.  we stood there for about 5 minutes, and then all of the sudden an amber ball of light lowered from the bottom of it.  at first i thought maybe it was two helicopters and one was coming from behind the other.  but there was no sound, and the white light had been hovering for ten minutes.  \r\n\r\nafter the amber light lowered, it hovered below the white light. then, green and yellow lights started blinking on what now appeared to be the bottom of a craft with a bright white light at the front. the green and yellow lights were on either side of the front white light and they went back at an angle.  and then the white light, with green and yellow blinking lights, zipped away fast.  2 minutes later, the amber light followed. \r\n\r\nthe whole time not a sound was heard, and the night was so still you could hear a pin drop.  it didn't make sense to me, and there was nobody i could talk to about it, so i just blew it off.  but my mom wrote it in her diary.  it wasn't until i saw out of the blue, that i heard about an amber ball of light coming out of a ufo.  that's when i felt a cold chill down my back.  it was the reality that i could have witnessed a ufo.    it was 20 years ago but i remember it in detail like it was yesterday.  we never told anybody about it.  we only realized this when we  brought it up to the rest of the family a week ago and they never heard us mention it before.  probably because telling about it doesn't nearly capture the feeling of actually being there and seeing

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I've had a couple of weeks to think about this by now so i have a very clear rememberance of what occured that night. \r\n\r\nmy two friends and i were outside of my band practice on the front porch smoking cigarettes. it was a pretty clear night, there were some thin clouds scattered around. there is a sand pit (same pit from my last post) which is about three or four miles across and about the same wide across the street. there is a strangely blue and very deep lake out there in the middle of the pit. this lake is actually strangely blue. oyster creek nuclear power plant is roughtly ten miles away. \r\n\r\nwe looked out across the street to the pit. my friend j pointed out two glowing orange lights hovering about 150 feet in the air and about a football field apart from each other. the lights were moving up and down and moving aound but staying the same distance apart. then we realized that the lights were at the tips of a huge blimp shaped object. at first i thought it may be a blimp, but it was way too long and not as fat as a blimp would be. we then noticed another one on the far end of the pit lower to the ground. a bunch of planes appeared in the sky. there is usually air traffic through the area (we are near three military bases located to the west or nw of us) but not as many planes as we saw coming. \r\n\r\nthe first object that we saw started moving upwar and appeared to be moving slow. the three of us got excited and started running across the street toward the pit. i jumped on my phone and called my friends who were still in the house to let them know what was going on. three more of our friends ran outside and joinded us. we watched the first craft float away into the sky and dissapear. when it crossed over the moons light you could see that it was constructed of some sort of transparent dark material. three of my friends went back into the house assuming that they were airplanes of some sort. j, w, and myself stayed and watched. the planes directed their attention from the object which dissapeared into the sky and started heading towards the other object (which was identical too the first). the craft started making its way across the the pit in our direction. it would have crossed the street about 50-75 yards to the left of where we were facing. \r\n\r\nwe ran into the street and sprinted in the ufos direction, losing sight of it behind the trees (this craft was maybe 100 feet in the air when we were watching it). we got to where the craft should have been, but it was gone. it should have passed directly over our heads. we kept watching into the sky amazed by the large number of planes flying around looking for the crafts. there were roughly 20 or more planes playing around the area at all different elevations. \r\n\r\nsuddenly a small saucer (completely different from the two blimp like ships)popped out of a thin cloud directly above our heads. it was completely illumintaed (white light, no colors). the saucer shot up into the sky very fast and in a matter of two seconds was miles up in the sky (giving us plenty of time to point and scream \"oh my god! what the #@%& is that!\" the craft paused, backed up, and then shot out into space dissapearing comppletely. the planes all began heading towards where it came from and where it went. we ran away screaming and excited about what we had witnessed. \r\n\r\nw made fun of my friend k and i after our last sighting (k was not present for any of this second experience). when we arrived back at the house w immediately appologized to me for giving me a hard time for the last one and stated that he is now a \"believer\". \r\n\r\ni still get a rush when i think about the events of this night. we were yelling so loud the whole time that i'm suprised that no neighbors called the cops on us. i would be shocked if no body else saw these events that night. someone else had to have saw it. i even almost called the police, but decided that they would probably think i'm just wasting thier time. besides, they would not have been able to do anything about it anyway. \r\n\r\nwhen j, w, and i told everyone about the second part we saw everyone was interested and we got no critiscism because they were able to admit that the first two objects were strange. my friends mother let the dog in the house and we noticed that the dog was acting strange and kept begging to go back outside (which is unusual behavior for him). the dog has been strange ever since and go outside much more frequently and for longer periods of time. i dont know if that could have anything to do with that sighting but it its wierd. \r\n\r\nfor about 45 minutes after the sighting there were military planes flying around the area, some very low. (they looked like some sort of fighter jets and were silent, we could barely hear them even when the low planes passed over us. eventually the planes started heading nw and the air traffik lessened. but the activity from planes in the sky was still unusually high for the rest of the night. \r\n\r\ni still get a crazy rush from just the thought of our experience. the best part is how clear my memory is of this experience. the sighting lasted for a solid 10-15 minutes. \r\n\r\nthis past week we started discussing a local legend about a ufo landing sight about three miles from the house(where we saw the ufos being chased) deep in the thick woods of the new jersey pinelands. according to j, wierd nj (a nj print about wierd stuff in jersey) has an article about this place (i tired looking for this aricle online but havent had any luck yet). the myth says that the trees are all pushed back in a perfect circle surrounding a 20 foot deep crater. the trees are suposed to be chipped up in spots on the tops of them not like a meteor hit but like a saucer landed there. story has it that when you try to take picturs of this crater your camera will die. j has been there and vouges for this story including the camera part. some of the guys and i went looking for it, but it was getting dark when we went and the trees were so thick that you could barely walk through them, not to mention that it is a swampy area. we also got delayed because were were caught sneaking across a golf course as a shortcut. i plan on making it back there soon and trying to get some pictures... hopefully! i will be sure to send them in. \r\n\r\nthis article is about a different ufo landing in nj with witnesses in the 1960s: http://www.Weirdnj.Com/stories/_ufos02.Asp\r\n\r\nif anyone saw this or knows anthing about these events please write in!!! we really want to know what we saw, there is no reason to be scarred to tell your story! people see these kinds of things all the time and im am so happy that i finally know that there is life elsewhere!!\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

people saw were the same we and the eugene police saw in 1982 near eugene, or. we were asked by chief rutledge to contact fbi which we did and the fbi declined investigation. in march 2004, agent john stoffel, dod intel unit, travis afb, said that we should not have taken \"no\" for an answer from the eugene fbi so this case is being persued by dod intel at travis. please contact them concerning our case and the fact that we are currently building a prototype here in the portland area at voxtel, inc. beaverton, or. it is our contention that the sightings are the continuing assistance to us to build and test our space vehicles to perform macroscopic qauntum tunneling (mqt) whereby we can traverse vast distances at ftl and or tunnel in time. i will be available for discussion as i will call dod intel on monday (john stoffel just retired) and discuss same with john's replacement. if you have any further contact with said spacecraft please be advised that the pilots signal with a light source the fibonacci sequence. that will let them know to contact that particular person or pilot by coming into contact as they did with us on oct. 18th, 1981 and landed within 10 ft. from us and turned off the main rgb laser light and turned on the odvs interior light while hovering for a few seconds. i hope to hear your comments on the subject asap.\r\n \r\nregards,\r\n \r\nlarry d.

exactly what my coinventor michael miller and i have based on our reverse-engineering (us pat. no. 4,817,102) for our proposed space vehicle. please visit our website at www.Unitel-qht.Com for more info. the craft descriptions definately sounds like our mqt time travelors and what we intend to build and what the dod intel is supposed to be investigating (meaning our two sightings and eugene, or police dept. request to fbi in 1982). i think that the jet pilots will admit these are opur drones that are incapable of interception with unlimited ceiling and maneuverability (non-ballistic motion). totally silent, quick as a wink and orange carona off the stern with white laser light composed of rgb sections at the bow of each tear-drop shaped drone. \r\n \r\n we would enjoy discussing the

\"jump\" and maneuver erratically.  we also saw three to four flares to the east of these lights.  i told paul these were not planes, and for a while he disagreed with me, until he also saw them
