freeway i saw three lights glowing in the sky. you could not miss it, the sky was very clear that night. the lights were white with yellow around it. they were as bright as headlights in the sky. i knew right away it was not a plane. the height was airplane level (or at least level to airplanes about to land by downtown. i thought at first it was a firework but i didn't see any more right after it and they were moving too slow to be a firework.  i thought maybe it was a shooting star, but there were three. maybe a meteor broke up into three pieces? it was moving too slow for a shooting star also. then they got brighter and dissappeared. they dissappeared just as a shooting star or firework would dissappear. i knew it wasn't a plane for sure, i saw a plane right next to it and it was giving off nowhere near the intensity of illumination as what i saw. there was also no clouds or fog to disappear into.I thought it was strange but didn't really think anything of it. \r\nthen about 10 seconds later i saw the three lights appear again but in a different location, it was more to the left of my view and in the same triangular positioning. when i saw this i knew 100% that it was not a firework or shooting star. it did not come from the ground up like a firework and it was not falling from the sky down. it was already there and lighted itself up. i was completely mesmerized. the three lights got brighter and then dimmed and then got brighter again before they dissappeared. once they disappeared i thought to myself,why i didn't take a picture. i was so confused and focused on these unkonown objects that i missed my 5 n freeway also. at this time, i am in downtown and i saw one more ufo, much lower than the three that just dissappeared.  i figured that there were four but this one was blocked by buildings earlier. i grabbed my camera phone and took a picture. i realized that there are so many lights in downtown it probably wouldn't turn out. i took it anyway and when i zoomed in the picture i saw 4 objects, not just one. i was really tripped out, i still am, because the three had already disappeared but yet they are captured in my picture in the same location and positions where they were before they disappeared. after reading other reports, i noticed the times and some sighting were an hour later. i wonder if these ufo's are invisible and flash their lights once in a while. maybe they are here more often than we think???","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":9789,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.781571,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02292008-0010","longitude":-119.4099124,"occurred":1204166040000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1204166040000,"summary":"3

about 8 feet in diameter, as it hovered.  when i first saw it i said, \"what the hell is that?\" then i lifted the camera, and started filming it.  then a telepathic presence came over me on me,

 the doctor alien said, \"what is he doing?\" then the object retracted further out, until it looked like a dot of white light.  it stopped at about 45& from the horizon, hovered for a couple of

appearance, no strobing or colored lights flying in a flat trajectory from the north to the south it was about the same size as the airliner i had observed earlier but it had no visable wings or such and appeared to be jusy a cylinder, as it got closer i noticed two large round spot light type lights on its right side, the side facing me, it looked much larger as it was now quite close, it then went into a cloud and did not emerge, what bothered me was its very close proximity to normal aircraft flying by, the cloud formation the object went into had a very unusual shape, the best way i can describe it is, it was like a giant football, with an eye in the center almost like a tornado cloud,\r\nphoto attached, althought the object was fully visable i could not identify it and so it remains

wondered if it could be a plane show. but i have never seen a plane move such a long distance in just 3 seconds. when they reappeared again they turned off one by one then re appeared again in a

distracted from the lights in the sky. i kept looking in the sky to find the lights to see if they would come back, but nothing. i thought i had just experienced a ufo sighting. but somehow i thought it had to be some kind of a light show. it was very strange to see that, i have never seen anything like it before. later that night i watched the news and they where talking about ufo sightings and they showed a clip of one that looked exactly the same as what i had seen earlier that night. i thought that finally i was going to have an answer. but the clip was from a different date not from that

mesmerized and it was almost as if there was some amount of lost time or something.  then it suddenly shot off at an angle upward and disappeared.  we seemed to stand silent for another minute, then broke out in screams and yells.  the strangest thing about it seems to have been forgetting about it for a couple of days immediately after that night.  it wasn't that we actually forgot about it, but our minds didn't register that it happened i guess.  it is hard to explain.  then one day we were sitting around talking about the pledging of that night when someone said something about the ufo.  we all burst out in excitement talking about it and what it could have been, like our memories had come back.  we concluded that it was some sort of military secret weapon or government experiment.  many
