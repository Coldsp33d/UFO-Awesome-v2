driving away from the airport on 436 heading towards the 408.  my roommate first noticed something hovering in the air.  i thought at first it was a huge military helicopter, and my roommate thought it was a blimp.  however, the weather was severe.  there was lightening, some rain, and very strong wind gusts.  there were blinking lights on the craft and we could almost make it out because the sky was light (even though it was 11:30pm).  the craft hovered for awhile, then moved forwards and backwards and up and down.  we started to notice that there were multiple crafts in the area.  we pulled the car over to watch the crafts and realized that they were neither helicopters or blimps (at least none that we had seen), and the inclement weather did not appear to have any effect.  we started driving again, and then noticed a huge triangular craft with lights outlining the entire craft.  at first i thought it might be a stealth bomber, but it did not quite fit that description either.  it also hovered and could move back and forth without being effected by the windy stormy weather.  we pulled the car over again.  this event was approximately 15 minutes in total.  we drove further down the road and noticed more of the elongated crafts.  we probably saw six of those in total, and one of the triangular shaped crafts.  the crafts seemed to be staying in that stretch of land between the airport and the 408 on 436, but we did not stay until they left.  we continued driving down the road to see if we encountered any more of the unusual aircraft.  we tried to call the orlando aviation authority to inquire, but the office hours were long closed.  we watched the news for any military activity, but none was reported.  we looked on the internet, and did not see anything that really resembled the enlongated crafts, but the triangular shaped one seemed to be a common sighting.  i was referred to this site by an uncle that is an avid ufo enthusiast.  this is the first time that i have seen aircraft that i could not identify.  we were very excited by the entire experience, and extremely perplexed.  unfortunately, we did not take pictures of the event.  we were too pre-occupied

very low altitude.  as i walked through an apartment complex, and trees i saw the light at times.  w#hen i got to the preschool on my street i saw it, and it stopped.  i was near the street sidewalk looking northward, as the object was hovering silently over the preschool playground.  the large bottom of it was painted white, and 16 feet in diameter.  there was a tower in the middle of it made of dark bubbled glass.  it was dark inside, as there was no light emanant.  in the front of it where it was painted white was two high beam car headlights.  they were close together.  after viewing this object for about 2 and a half minutes it budged a foot northward then took off with amazing speed.  the only way i was able to determin it path of departure was by the tracer its headlights left.  it went northward at 20% from the horizon.\r\n\r\ni was most amazed by its speed.  it really did not look like it could go very fast, and it looked kind of junky.  it took off a couple of seconds after i thought that probably teenage aliens are flying it, and that it does not go very fast being that it related to a busted up car.  actually it was in pretty good condition.  the paint looked pretty fresh, and its bubble glass tower was made in panels about 6 feet high.  the tops of each panel was cut flat on top, and then angled on each side.  i still think that the panels would not be able to stay in place with such acceleration.  or that they would greatly slow down the object.  thank you.  i have many more sightings to share with you.  i do not know why i had so many of them.  orbs of different sort have been in my area since 1986.  i have 8 hours of dvd footage on them that i took.  i wish i can share it with you, but i do not have the software to upload it, and i do not know how to.  is there a snail mail address for mufon where i can copy my dvds to vhs, and send it to you? i filmed some saucers, and some other interesting, unexplained anomulous objects.  also i was abducted twice (when i was 4 and 26).  are you interested in abduction, and alien encounter experiences? i have it all written down.  to do one at a time on your form would be too much work.  unless i send them by pasting.  thanks again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9733,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.7770553,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02272008-0007","longitude":-117.9385177,"occurred":746862600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":746862600000,"summary":"It

the door yelling for me to come outside and look at this. i immediately grabbed my glasses and went outside where he showed me an object flying very slowly west over hiway 377. it had three huge lights--a very bright white light and bright red and blue flashing lights. i then went in the house and called my teenage son to come out to see it. we all decided that it could not be a plane because it was flying too slow and it could not be a helicopter because it made no sound. my husband tried to snap a picture with a regular digital camera, but the camera was not made for great distance at night. the guys decided it was flying at around a half mile altitude. it was quite large to be that far away. we just watched it from our front yard untill a treeline blocked it from sight.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
