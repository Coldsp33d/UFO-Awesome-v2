sleep; i then woke up and something was wrong. i was in a white room, sitting on the end of a metal table... i was completely naked and the table felt cold to the touch... i was in a state of shock when i realized i was not alone in this white room. there was a woman in the corner of the room, just standing there looking at me. i went bright red, as i was so embarrassed because i was naked: she then started to approach me. i could see that she was wearing blue overalls and she was very beautiful...Her hair was blonde and she has beautiful blue eyes. she looked like a pleiadian. it was then she spoke to me and said we can't keep doing this... i said doing what? with that, she pushed me back on the metal table; she then took off her blue overalls and she was naked. i couldn't believe what i was seeing, she had the perfect body; her breasts were nice and perky and i was very aroused by her appearance. she then forced herself on me and i put up no resistance. we then began to make love and she said if you make me pregnant you will have to come back with me... i said back were? she just smiled... i then blacked out. next i woke up on the bed and thought what a great dream; then i realised i wasn't under the bed covers... i was on top of the bed covers; and i thought, that's very odd, as i don't remember getting up in the night. i also quickly discovered that my pyjamas were on backward and so were my underpants! i know for a fact that my clothing was on the right way before i went to bed. later on that day i also noticed that i had bruising around my genitals. what the hell is going on? have you ever heard of anything like this before? this is just bizarre: i am so embarrassed to tell you this, but this really happened on the 17th of october 2016 at newton abbot, devon,

i had a strange feeling of being watched so i looked at our sliding door to something looking at me the running away. i caught just a glimpse to a humanoid figure without any type of clothing! my roommate and i thought it was a intruder at first so we were in hot persuit! as we got outside there was no sign of anything other than small foot print marks in our grass that just vanished (it flew off or something) as in no more indents in the grass! as it got later i grew reluctant to go to bed as this is my 2nd encounter with a entity, but i had work very early!! i awoke around 330am screaming from the most vivid unexplainable dream. about that time my roommate was in the next room hearing me freak out decided to use the bathroom and have a cig (he was unable to sleep due to what i saw earlier and the events a few nights prior) and as he opened the door he saw a little humanoid creature looking in the window he ran to turn on a light and it was gone! he stated he has never seen anything run as quickly as that little thing did! he then lost his nerve to smoke and retreated into his beadroom barricading his door! at that point her heard movement in the hall with his dof

like i did - about to run. i said, \"did you see that!\". in front of us was a gigantic craft - it would've been over 1 km wide, & the aspect was the same as if you looked at a jet from the front. it looked like a pyramid on its side, looking up at the point. we could just make out the right angles. the thing was silent, & we felt really eerie, & got the hell out of there. interestingly, around that time there were multiple sightings of smaller craft reported, but as far as i now we were the only witnesses to this thing.\r\n\r\nthe really disturbing thing about this is the fact that we were just north of australia's largest city, & people were oblivious to this craft. where we were sitting was a populated area too, & the people there had no idea what was sitting just off the coast. if

was 14 years old and driving home from the small town near our acreage home one afternoon. i had my learner's licence and my mom was sitting in the front seat with me. my grandmother and younger  brother were in the back.  i had to slow down coming into our subdivision as the road has a sharp bend close to the lake edge.  here is where i noticed a black triangular object some distance away over the edge of the lake. i stopped and rolled down the window to hear if it made a sound.... i thought maybe it could be a helicopter with something hanging under it (the black triangle) but i could not hear anything and it continued to sit perfectly still in the sky. i remember blurting out something like \"what the heck it that... a ufo?\" i looked at it for a short time and decided to continue driving.  i wanted to look more but i was worried about cars coming up behind me ( i was a new driver). i was also worried about frightening my mom and grandmother. i knew they would not be open to such ideas as ufos. however, i could not stop thinking about the strange object.\r\n\r\ni continued to drive (approximately 1/4 mile) until i reached the approach to our acreage home. i don't know why i stopped and looked over my left shoulder and up into the sky, but i did, and there it was!!  it was directly over the road and was just over the tree tops. i put the car in park and shut off the engine ( i wanted to hear if it made any noise) and i felt a sense of excitement to get another chance to have a look at this strange object.  i got out of the car, leaving the door open, and gazed up at the craft hovering above the road, almost directly above.  no one else got out of the car and no one said a word while i was looking at it.  the object was not black, it was a dull charcoal grey colour.  it made no sound and had no visible lights. the bottom of the craft had sections with some type of pattern, maybe symbols; however, i cannot remember the details very well. i wish i had drawn a diagram but unfortunately i didn't.  i wanted to see if it had any windows or identifiable markers, so i walked around the front of the car to the other side to get a better look. the sides/front/top all seemed to be solid with no windows, markers, or seams of any kind. \r\n\r\nas i was standing and gazing up at the craft,  i felt a sense of awe and wonder and i became aware of my thoughts being read.  this may sound really weird, and i would probably leave this part out if it were not for the fact that i have come across other people's accounts of having similar experiences. i had  a real feeling that this was an amazing event and that this craft was not of our world. i wanted them (whoever they were) to know that i was greatly honoured to have had the chance of a lifetime to experience something so amazing.   i started to think about what the  occupants may look like and for the first time i felt a sense of fear creeping in. i don't know if that was the reason; but the craft started to move, gracefully gliding like it was on ice. it moved a little forward ( following the road) then made a 90 degree turn facing east (towards the lake) and took off in a fraction of a second over our house. there was no sound, no smoke, no lights.... it was just gone! there was not even any movement in the leaves of the tall poplar trees that surrounded the area. \r\n\r\ni never spoke of the event with anyone, not even my family, for fear of ridicule. i had just started a new school and i pretty much blocked the event out of my thoughts until later in my life. i began doing  research on the ufo topic as an adult in 2009, while recovering from surgery.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:12:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

\r\n\r\ni am a photographer and i was trying to photograph some snow on pine trees in my front yard (late at night).  i had a remote flash set up but it did not fire on this first photograph. the only light came from a street light across the street so it is woefully underexposed, except for the several faint trails of light and especially when that light came very close to my lens.  it is a decent camera (nikon d750) and the erratic light lines are what is most intriguing.  i tried to search images to find something explainable by physics but could find nothing similar (google search).

who were barking alot.  i live in a rural area of texas and have very little light pollution, so i can normally see a night sky filled with stars.\r\n\r\ni was outside for a few minutes to make certain that everything was alright with the animals and quieten the dogs, then turned to go back inside the house.  before i went completely into the garage, for some reason i turned and looked back at the sky.  the sky was very clear that night and i do not recall seeing any clouds – only stars.  \r\n\r\ni was facing the north east at the time and saw a very bright, single light moving slowly across the sky, parallel to the horizon (i.E. sideways, tilted slightly upwards).  this was approximately the speed of a single engine prop plan – based on what i could tell.  this was absolutely a single light and it did not have a tail, so it absolutely was not a meteor, meteorite, or falling star.  we see a lot of those in the sky, but this light was 2-4 times larger than most of the ones that i see.\r\n\r\nthe light was moving east to west, again, very slowly and i observed it for a few seconds.  suddenly, the light disappeared completely.  it didn’t fade, as a meteor or meteorite does, it was like someone turned-off a switch and everything went dark.\r\n\r\nthere was nothing in the sky to block my view and this light was well above the trees.  also, there was absolutely no sound at all, so it obviously was not a plane, drone, or helicopter.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch after the light disappeared, but it never returned and there was never any sound.  everything was still extremely quiet, except for some cows about 1 mile away.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

not a helicopter but i kept watching as it approached i got up setting my ipad down and leaving my phone on the table next to where i was sitting i walked out of the enclosure looking up to see the object fly over my home. there were no clouds over head so i had nothing to judge size or altitude but the object flew overhead and slightly north of my home. it looked perfectly round , made no sound, no flashing lights and no wings just shimmering orange glow. i kept watching as it flew towards the setting sun, it was around 6/6:30 and the sun was behind clouds to the west(none overhead)but still very light outside. the object proceeded toward the setting sun and was still bright enough to see until beyond the tree line and clouds to the west. i watched it until it went out of sight and turned around to return to the pool enclosure. i looked up to see another object that looked the same and moving in the same path at the same speed. i watched the second object until it also went out of sight to the west. i have lived at this home close to the small local airport for 26 years and have never seen anything like this. again it made no sound, no wings, no flashing lights just a two shimmering orange balls moving at high speed east to west. 2 nights later, new years eve we had a small fire in the side yard and was telling my daughter about what i had observed when we both looked
