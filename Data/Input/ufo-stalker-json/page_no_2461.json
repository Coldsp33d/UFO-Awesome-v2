i noticed to the east,  a very bright light appear on the low horizon.  i glanced at it through the binoculars,  seeing an array of colors emmitting.  as it drew closer,  my girlfriend came out to see the eclipse.  i told her to watch the light in the eastern sky.  we both continued to observe the light as it drew closer.\r\n  i looked at it through the binoculars repeatedly.  it had a bright light in the front and one behind.  i estimated it's altitude to be approximately 8 to 10,000 ft.  it made no sound.  as it flew directly overhead,  i say again,  it made no sound.  there is an airport near and jets fly over frequently.  even at higher altitudes,  the jets are audible.  this craft proceeded in a direct east to west path.  as it was overhead,  i looked at it and focused my binoculars.  i could see the shape of this craft. it was a long cylindrical shape,  with a rear glowing area,  and a glowing appendage in front,  kind of cresent shaped.   this was not an airplane,  jet,  helicopter,  sattellite,  star,  bird,  or any kind of meteor.  \r\n  even my girlfriend was puzzeled as we discussed the lack of sound from the craft.  i asked her later to draw a picture of what she saw.  i did as well,  and our recollections were extremely close. there weren't any of the faa required green and red marker lights whatsoever.  no strobes.  \r\n  the lights were a constant glow,  very bright with varying color.  i was am still convinced that this wasn't any craft known.  the part that reaaly gets me, as well as my girlfriend,  is that it made no sound. no sound at all.  it just smoothly glided over. the craft just flew in a western direction and disappeared, just as it appeared.  very strange.  i must say,  that i was very excited at this sighting.  i've often seen strange things in the sky,  but this was the best view i've ever encountered.  \r\n  now,  the next day,  i was watching the morning local news.  there was a report that on that night,  people had witnessed strange lights over the saginaw bay,  out a ways over the ice...Above the ice.  they reported the lights to the local coast guard post in essexville, mi,  but the coast guard found nothing.  it still rides heavy in my mind,  this sighting.  i know what i saw,  as well as what my girlfriend witnessed.    we both agreed to what we witnessed as being real,  not an illusion.  it was as real as the lunar eclipse itself.  i hope that i see this again.  i do believe that we are being visited,  but like many others,  need proof to solidify the belief.  i think i have my proof.\r\nduff

feet from a level paved rural road in front of a house.  the area was very dark as it is rural and there was no moon and no nearby street lights or security lights in the area (sunset was 5:22 pm).  the night sky was clear and the temperature was around fifty degrees.  i was looking directly across the road at a small field on the opposite side of the road when in the right side of my vision i saw small lights approaching.  i turned toward them and saw four lights. the lights were gold and about the size of an orange. they were almost reflective but, they didn't light the ground below them nor seemed to have a focused beam. they descended slightly then leveled off and traveled about four feet above the road surface in my direction.  i would estimate their speed at about fifteen mph, maybe faster at the first sighting, but they slowed as they neared me. when i first saw them they were about one hundred fifty feet from me and at a height of about seven feet. i knew they were over the road because there are cedar trees along a fence line on the opposite side of the road.  i could not have seen them had they not been over the road or the side shoulder because the trees would have obscured my view.  they were in a line one behind the other.  the first two were about 30\" apart followed by the second two, also about 30\" apart. the second pair was separated from the first pair by about ten feet. when they were about sixty feet from me they began to oscillate up and down from 3-6 feet above the road.  they continued this vertical oscillation along the road until they were nearly directly in front of me but on the opposite side of the road.  then they stopped and came to level flight (all four).  they hovered, without any movement at all, about four feet above the road.  again there was one pair about 30\" apart and approximately ten feet to their right was the second pair also about 30\" apart. they held this position for about four seconds.  then they dimmed greatly, probably 95%, and descended to the ground. after settling to the ground they had a pinkish orange glow with lavender or purple/pink spokes radiating from the center. they appeared to be translucent, maybe glassy or gelatinous. i scanned quickly at all four to verify that they were all there. then, i  stared totally at the second one from the left because it was the brightest or at least sat highest in the grass about 6\" from the side of the pavement. after about four seconds they dimnmed all the way out and could no longer be seen in the darkness.  total time of this event, fifteen seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe above are the simple facts of what i saw. however, i would like to describe my thoughts as this occurred from moment to moment. when i first saw the lights i thought people were either biking or skateboarding in my direction.  as they approached and began to oscillate up and down i thought the people were possible jogging. again i thought- people.  i started say \"hey\".  just as i was about to get \"hey\" out of my mouth they stopped and began to hover. i looked into the background around the lights to look for the outline of people. but there were no- people. and up until that very moment it never occurred to me that it was anything but- people causing the lights.  as soon as i thought out loud incredulously, \"gosh no people\" the lights dimmed and lowered to the ground. only at the realization that there was no one there did i become a \"good\" observer. i stared intently at the four objects on the gound and watched until they were no longer visible. i looked on with astonishment and thought to myself \"what in the world have i just witnessed?\" whether they disappeared, vaporized, or simply flew away into the darkness i have no idea.\r\n\r\nuntil this event, i have never given ufo's much thought. however since 1/7 i have thought of hardly anything else. i had never googled anything even remotely related to the subject. now i google hardly anything unrelated to the subject.  to demonstrate my lack of ufo curiosity, when the four lights dimmed and were no longer visible, i didn't even look up at the sky! i now wish that i had looked up.\r\n\r\nmufon- kennethh\r\nbubbaandoz@aol.Com   ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

alien with open mouth. i have no idea why it looks green what's going on? when i took the photo and looked at it briefly on the camera, i thought it was an apparition of a soldier with an army helmut. then when i uploaded the photo to my computer, i saw what looked like a green alien face with very large eyes and mouth open. looks like i just caught the right half of it's face and torso. i think the flashes of many pictures attracted it, then when it came closer, the first smaller flash startled it,it opened it's mouth in a panick then the main big flash caught that site/expression.(back in the summer of aug-07, i had an encounter with a very large star-light craft, that flew silently over the huge tree on my street right in front of my house, i waved/flagged it down, it came towards me very low to the ground and i ran towards it, my friend came out of the house and towards me, the craft saw him approach and it took off the other direction going east of orillia,ont,canada. since then,nothing has happened,that i know of..There were however pictures in the local newspaper of crafts the week before i saw mine.)\r\n when i took my photo's, i made sure i held my breath when i took each shot. there was no smoke,bright lights or fog around. this photo is just one of 4 amazing pictures that really need to be checked out by professionals.\r\nwhat do you think this is?\r\nthe second

be a lunar eclipse that night and i was bored and i am fascinated by stuff like that so i went to watch. i'll say the eclipse was about one quarter completed when i sat down on my small back porch and started watching, then about three quarters through the complete blackout of the moon, i notice to my right [coming from an easterly direction heading west] some lights. of course i wasn't thinking hey what's that! houston's not far and we get a lot of planes buzzin around. so i glanced over and immediatly i noticed something odd about it. no blinking lights. just 3 white lights. i still didn't think much of it so i continued to glance back and forth from the moon to the object[s?] cruisin along the skyline. it started to bother me quite a bit, because i've always been a bit of a skywatcher for weird stuff like this, and i had the twinge in my head like, man don't take your eyes off this you never know. and then it passed between me and the moon. dead silent. nothing there. just....Lights. 3 lights, a perfect triangle. not blinking. then it took off, and not like you see in the movies, like instantly to warp 9, it was like a rev up from slow to light speed, but it hung long enough for me to see sort of a trail. and it kind of lit the clouds on the horizon a bit, like in passing. then something went after it. a purple/blue cylinder[beam?] with a sort of tail behind it. and that lit the sky up for real. followed suit after the ufo, same direction. i've seen something very similar to this in a video that's been aired of a nasa sts mission in which a ufo was traveling over the earth and it veered suddenly following a sort of flash and streak of light seeming to be aimed at the ufo.  while the ufo was in my sight, and for quite some time after the events, like maybe 5-10 minutes i was absolutely mortified. slack-jawed, scared to breathe, maybe i thought they could see me, who knows. but after i composed myself, i went inside and grabbed my brother's camcorder and went outside to see if maybe some more freaky stuff would happen. no more activity.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9677,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.4607876,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02222008-0004","longitude":-95.0513172,"occurred":817718400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,

summer as i went back for a summer break to my family home, in france in the rhone alpes region which is a region about a third the size of california, with montaneous topography.\r\nthe county where my family home is is called loire mainly made of countryside, with a couple of big towns.My home is in a hilly region surrounded by a lot of woods as you can see on the pictures, with very few houses around within 1 miles radius.\r\n\r\nthe picture was taken as i was walking early in the morning taking pictures of the surrounding of my home, it must have been about 8.30am when i took  that particular picture, not being aware of the flying object/bird you can see on the upper left of the pix. i took this picture using a digital camera (panasonic)  on a wide angle.When i came home i quickly downloaded/ batch/formatted all the pictures on my laptop and look briefly at all those pictures, but this picture didn���t cath my attention.\r\nit���s only 6 months after taking that picture when browsing for these pictures that i came across that weird black ans white spot you can see, and it did catch my attention this time for two things:\r\n-the perspective makes it really hard to figure out what it can possibly be:\r\na bird of whatever size will be much blurry and only small birds would fly with their wings stuck o their sides as the shape of the object would suggest, and if it was a bird then it will be much blurrier on the pictures, and much much smaller as well, as when looking at the object it looks like it is at least some distance away, so if it was a bird it would have to be at least a one meter long bird to appear like this on the pictures, and no bird of that size exist in that region.\r\na plane or glider, could make more sens to me, but the perspective again makes it difficult to clearly identify this object as a winged flying object, and also if it was then i think that the shape would have been clearer.\r\nalso the oval/disc shape is very intriguing as unless taking by profile front or beside you would see the back fin, and an airliner at least will leave a track of smoke behind it.\r\nthe last thing is that when you zoom the pix in your photo browser (in window) you can see that there���s some type of metallic roof or white roof with some shadow below it, which suggest a spheric object.\r\nyou however really need to zoom in to get a clear idea of what i���m taking about.\r\nso i���m perplex as to what this thing could possibly be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

for an elderly woman in her home. the house is located along the ocean up on a bluff with a wonderful view of the pacific ocean from every room in the house. the night was crisp, cold, and clear. the ocean was very still and also calm.It almost seemed like i was looking at a lake. out side the house looking over the ocean is a magnificent small island of clifs and rocks. in the winter the island is home to hundreds of sea lions. the noise is ear splitting and incedible at the same time. this was the last full moon of 1999. the entire night i kept look out at the wonderful sight. the night was so bright it was almost like day light. i first noticed the then star shaped object in the sky. it kept shinning and spinning with colors of red,white,greenand blue.  i kept watching it through out the evening in fact, it seemed i could not help noticing how much it was twinkling. from about 9:00 p.M. to midnight i was awake then i slept until 4:00a.M. i woke up to help my patient to the restroom i helped her back to bed and then i sat on the edge her bed and looked out at the view.So once more the star shaped object was there spining out the window in the sky. the whole time when i observed this star spinning shape i would squint at it the shape would change to a cigar shape form. so in my mind i looked at it as if it was far away and by squnting i brought it closer. so at some point i thought o.K.\"your are not a star show me your stuff.\" amazingly the object did respond as if i caught it in the act. so sure enough this sphere started spinning and then it slowly started moving out over the ocean. at this moment i realized watching the cigar shape was closer than it appeared earlier. so this star ship proceeded to continue going slowly out over the ocean. then it seemed to stop and a cone shaped light showed down on the ocean and it seemed like there were small round orb like objects comming and going from the big ship. then it would glide over the ocean and shine another cone shape light over the ocean. then proceed out farter at this time it seemed the moon was starting to set and the sky was getting lighter. what i observed next was  a very fire red round orb came out of the ship and seemed to be comming back over to where the sea lions were and the red orb disappeared behind the rock island. at this point it seemed like i had watched for maybe two hours. i guess i was a little freaked out that the red light was comming back my way and i had had my fill for the night. so i went back to bed and i went to sleep. afterword i have felt that who ever was on this ship made me think this ufo was way more interested in the ocean and maybe the sea lions. i felt honored to have wittnessed this sight and it made me wonder if we some how are allowed to see other dimentions if we slow down enough at 4:00 am.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

telecommunications systems engineer. \r\n\r\ni was 14 at the time and was with my parents who also witnessed the event.\r\nmy mother and i are in complete agreement as to what we saw.\r\n\r\nit was the first week of august 1986. we vacationed for 2 weeks every year at the outer banks, nc (nags head, kill devil hills). one night the stars were out and there was good visibility of the night sky. we were sitting out on a picnic bench facing the ocean. the ocean was calm as a lake. \r\n\r\nfrom the south moving very slowly north were 2 very extremely long triangular craft flying. i couldn't give you an estimated altitude. they flew in parallel with the coastline. each point was marked by a red light. the red light was not exceptional - what incredible was the size of blackness that blocked out the night sky. i can't quite put enough emphasis on how huge the \"footprint\" of these craft was in the night sky. there was nothing else in terms of colors, lights, etc. the triangle was acute and much longer than wide. there was no point of reference but we had an unobstructed view of these things.\r\n\r\nthese craft were both silent. but, i do remember sort of a very low frequency hum that was felt more than heard. it is very difficult to explain how the low frequency sound was barely audible and you could easily have not heard it if you were not paying attention to what was happening. but, in terms of any other sounds or noises the craft were completely silent.\r\n\r\nthese two craft very slowly worked their way north and that was it. i mean we sat there for an hour pointing at and talking about these two craft and we spent all of the time just trying to understand what it was we were looking at.\r\n\r\nwe didn't have cell phones back then or even a phone in the beach cottage we rented so we were at a loss in terms of reporting it.\r\n\r\nwell, i wanted to report this. of my 35 years this was my one ufo sighting. i keep my eyes on the sky but have not seen one since. i am not a pilot nor have any special training at looking at or understanding objects in the night sky. but, i thought this might be of value for your records. hopefully, maybe someone else will come forward with their report to mufon that will corroborate my report.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\njason","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

coming from kingman, az when my husband  who was driving said ���what is that?��� i looked up and there was a plane flying across in the distance  directly in front of us. i told him it was plane, obviously.  he said ���not the plane, where did it go?���, then exclaimed and pointed ���that!��� i leaned forward in the truck to look up into the sky thru the windshield and  at the upper left side i saw a metallic disc shaped object which was brightly reflecting the sun. it was tilted at an angle toward us and didn���t seem to be moving at all but staying in one place while it tilted at those various degrees. we couldn���t tell if it made any sound or not because our windows were rolled up. i watched it for a few seconds in shock that i was seeing my first beyond a shadow of a doubt ufo , till i realized i had my camera with me and i told my husband to pull over on the side as its visibility was lost from me where i was sitting and digging in my bag for my camera. when we got to an area and pulled over it was gone and no where to be seen anywhere in the sky. we stayed there for a while looking for it and hoping it might come back or maybe still be there and show itself again, but nothing. \r\n   i asked my husband about it and he said the reflection of the suns rays reflecting off of the shiny silver metal caught his eye and he look up  and saw it. at that time it was completely turned on its side so that he could see it was a perfectly shaped round disk. it was so close that it was about an inch in size and we could see the grooves where it had a small bump in the middle of it. as my husband was looking at it and asking me what it was, it turned ���right��� side up where he lost it for a second then it became ���visible��� again (and when i saw it), when it tilted at an angle and the suns rays reflected off of the metallic body again. \r\n   the only other ufo that i, personally have seen and video taped was when we lived 30 miles out of kingman, arizona which was oval shaped and light in color but was pretty far away and was reported on the news that day to be seen all over arizona (phoenix, flagstaff, kingman etc) but it was explained as being a weather balloon. now that one i would accept a lot more easily as possibly being a weather balloon but this ufo we saw yesterday was so clear, detailed and in broad daylight on a nice sunny day that we both (my husband and i) know it was real and like nothing we both have ever seen before that could be logically explained.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9667,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.1495774,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212008-0010","longitude":-114.5636583,"occurred":1203198600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

seconds..Stopped again being in the desert it was very plain to see even at distance..I watched it about 3-5 more minutes, it then went due west about 30-40 miles once again in seconds, stopped all the while with the flshing lights below going round and round.. finally it went straight up and out of sight in dissapeared in seconds.....This was the first time i saw anything like this and i lived in vegas around military installations and saw all kinds of aircraft..Also because i was in the military myself....The next time i saw a craft ..Actually 2 out side las vegas about the year 1997 above lake meade one at.. i worked for the national serat this time. and was on my way back to park from vegas.. was dropped off by  a friend a couple of friends and would walk or wait for someone to pass by because on this road it is the only road to enter the park from this area... about 8pm the sun just set it just got dark after they dropped me off i looked towards the lake and over  lake meade at both end of the lake i noticed 2 triangle shaped objects about 3-5 miles from me i was far enough to look left and right and the two craft were brightly lit  they looked just like the old rubics cubes....Not the first ones..That were square but the newer ones that were triangular and very brightly lit ....No noise once again ...To my back about is nellis air force base ..Many times i saw many jets and other aircraft take off and land after flying above on manuvers  both day and night  time and even from way farther away i could always here them...I then heard a prop plane take off the base on its wings there were pylons with strobe lights at this time not on...No visable lights either the plane approached the one ufo circled about halfway then turned on its strobe lights the ufo wnet crazy with lights flashing backand forth almost like the two were sending messages ...I heard the pane but not the ufo after totally circalling the craft the air force plane took the lead and the craft folloed and they flew due south and out of sight all this took about 15 minutes... the plane was a military plane the ufo who knows.. i then looked to the other end of the lake for the other but it had dissapeared... i was picked up by another park employee and told them and many others about this event...","distance":"101-500

get the binoculars and returned outside the object was still there in the sky moving slowly to the north.  when she looked through the binoculars she said it did not have any windows, was flying lower than an air craft and did not have a jet stream after it as it flew.  i sked her if perhaps it was a blimp and her reply to me was that it wasn't as round as a blimp and was flying higher than a blimp normally would.  i then asked her if it was a space shuttle knowing that one was supposed to have landed sometime yesterday and she again siad it had no wings and no tail fin.  i was just curious to report her sighting to someone and see if anyone could give us an explaination or if any other individuals had reported a similar sighting.  any information you could give me on this would be greatly
