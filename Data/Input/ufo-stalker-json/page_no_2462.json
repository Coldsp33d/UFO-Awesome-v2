stephenville and after reading that the mexican air force observed ufos through their infra-red cameras, i decided to try the infra-red camera that my husband has in his work as an engineering test pilot. \r\n\r\ni pointed the camera toward the southwest sky. we live in burleson, close to joshua on acreage. there were intermittent clouds. \r\n\r\nat first we thought the bright, white lights were meteors.But meteors obey the laws of physics. \r\nwe observed these lights, usually one or two at a time, zig-zag, some just stopped then changed direction,some made spiral movements and one moved in circles, some just seemed to zip through the sky upward or downward,like a game of ping pong.  my three daughters also observed this on the 8 in x 8 in. screen for the infra-red camera. soon it was too cloudy to see and it was about 10 p.M. we will try again another night when the clouds go away. my husband is going to connect the camera to a video-recorder and tripod. \r\n\r\nhas anyone else seen the same thing using infra-red. it was compelling!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

wind would make seed or insects wobble. these objects did not do that. i ruled out seagulls because i could not see any wing movement and the speeds at which the objects travelled was too fast.

triangle formation above longmont. the 3 lights slowly shifted into a diagonal line across the sky and sat stationary. they proceeded to shift into a horizontal line across the horizon and then slowly spread apart. for the next hour, the three lights seem to move in a large rotation across the sky but sat stationary for long periods. i placed high powered binoculars on one of the lights and it was a very bright golden color with a little red. the light i was observing was absolutely stationary in the middle of the sky close to the horizon. as the three lights where slowly rotating over a large area of the sky, one rose straight up in the sky with an enormous white beam below it. the beam was so large that it spanned a great deal of the sky as the light rose. the light rose up and gradually disappeared. the stationary lights also seem to be rotating in place-they glowed very bright at times. two of the lights remained stationary in the night sky along until 8:15pm when they were gone.
