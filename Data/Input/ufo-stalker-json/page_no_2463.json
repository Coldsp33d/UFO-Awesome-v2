floor and have lived here for over 6 years and am well aware of what sorts of things i'm likely to see in the skies over town. there is a local hospital that gets visits from the air ambulance several times a week and also a local police helicopter that is bright red and instantly recognisable. a few miles away there is a training camp which used to be an airfield and rescue helicopters are still based there. i mention these because i am well aware of what a helicopter looks like and have seen aircraft of all types close up and from a distance. my eyesight is also excellent for my age (48).\r\nat 9.30am on the 8th of february 2008 as i stood waiting for the kettle to boil for a cup of coffee, i witnessed a strange object pass over town from the south on a northerly heading. the object appeared to be only a few hundred feet above ground level and was almost at eye-level. it was a clear sunny morning & i was instantly confused by what i was looking at, as it didn't look like a bird or a helicopter or anything instantly recognisable, so i opened the window to listen, but heard nothing but the usual morning traffic in town.\r\nas i watched it seemed to shift its shape almost like a coiled up worm or snake tied in a knot, but it didn't get any bigger or anything. it was dark in colour, almost black/grey and when it moved like that i got the distinct feeling i was looking at a creature not a craft. as it got past town i noticed that there seemed to be something under it and i watched as it went over a hill.\r\nonce i couldn't see it anymore i went to the front of the property to see if it was in sight but it had gone. the entire incident had lasted no more than 30 or 40 seconds and i was left very puzzled as to what i'd just seen.\r\non reflection about half an hour later i saw a helicopter pass at the same angle of view from my kitchen and it struck me that what i had seen earlier was either very big or had been much closer to me than i initially thought. if it had been an aircraft on the same heading, it would have been about 10 times as big as the raf rescue helicopters. if it was closer then it was still bigger than a london bus and yet there was no obvious sound coming from it when i had opened the window. nobody else i know saw it but it was all over very quickly in about 30-40 seconds and if i had been pouring my coffee i would have missed the entire episode.\r\ni could do a sketch if neccessary as i am an artist, but all i would draw would be a dark blob like a dark knot changing shape (like a writhing snake) with an odd hazy area underneath it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

media about a comet (or possibly meteor) that would be visible early one morning between 2-3am. being a curious person i set my clock to wake up so i could witness this celestial event. i went outside that morning and within a few minutes i did see some heavenly body streak across the sky. just before i was about to go back inside to bed, i saw something else that i've never seen the likes of before or since. in the not too distant night sky i saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. it was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object. i was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where i was standing. after about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. i would estimate the disc at about 500ft in diameter anf flying about 500ft in the air. there were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. the flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and i remeber wondering what government technology could produce such an object. at about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and i remember a strong fear coming over me. i was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. from various windows inside i continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and i ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. the object never made a sound. there were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. i watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly flew out of sight. no airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that i know of could account for that sighting. i will never forget what i saw that night and i have come to believe that others have  seen the same thing as well.","distance":"21-100

discovered this way to report it.\r\n\r\nthe first sighting was in the summer of 2004, the second was the summer of 2007.  (that's about as accurate as i can get, sadly.)  both sightings were in boulder, colorado.  both times it was raining with very low cloud cover, and both times i was on my apartment balcony, facing north (which is more coincidence than anything, no doubt).\r\n\r\nduring both incidents, i happened to be looking at the cloud formations when i would catch sight of a very small, moving speck of reddish-orange light.  at first i thought it was a small bird, as it looked to be about that size.  but i then noticed that it was moving in a perfectly straight trajectory, and certainly faster than a bird.  i'd be hard-pressed to guess the exact speed, but i'd guess it to be the average speed of a moving car.  this was, however, little more than a point of light from what i could see, and it seemed to be skimming the base of the cloud cover, moving in a perfectly straight line.  i seem to recall that in both instances, the objects were moving northeast.\r\n\r\nit wasn't a particularly frightening experience, but it was certainly like nothing i had ever seen or could explain.  i watched the object for quite some time, and both times attempted to call my wife out onto the balcony so she could see it, but by the time she got there it had moved out of sight.\r\n\r\nsince the last sighting i have looked on line at both commonly-reported ufo sightings as well as weather phenomena that would explain this, and i have not found anything.  i would be very interested in learning if this has been reported by others, and if it has been explained.  thank you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":9621,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0163056,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02182008-0001","longitude":-105.2692856,"occurred":1085986800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1085986800000,"summary":"Small, fast-moving speck of light","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Boulder, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:399876"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Sunset Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was about one in the morning on a warm summer night. i was sitting on the sand at the beach, about 20 feet from the water. i noticed a light traveling from north to south at about 1000 feet altitude, probably traveling at about 200 mph. this was a solid, white light with no blinking red or green lights like those of a helicopter or an airplane.I was on a west facing beach looking toward catalina island. the name of the beach is sunset beach, in so. california. i watched the light on it's south bound course for about 15 seconds, and then it abruptly assumed a 45 degree angle to the water, and went into the water. it was probably several miles off the coast, so i didn't see or hear any results of the impact, like splashes or noise of the impact. one odd thing about the change of course was that there was no gradual turn into the 45 degree dive, it was very abrupt.\r\n\r\ni saw a program on tv about underwater anonalies (usos)and it brought back the memory of this sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":9620,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.7164069,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02172008-0009","longitude":-118.0689517,"occurred":174643200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":174643200000,"summary":"Object traveling horizontal over ocean,@ 1000 ft., assumes a 45 degree angle, into the ocean.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Sunset Beach, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:399877"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Detroit","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Well i see this object often from far away from my home.  it looks like a lightbulb, kind of light tan colored.

have seen allot of things in the sky but i cannot explain what i saw. i was helping a friend move from his apartment in katy, texas. my wife, my friend, and i were in my friends mini-van on our way to his apartment. being a pilot, i tend to pay attention to things i see in the sky. on this particular day i saw what i thought was a parachute jumper with an inflated canopy at a very high altitude. i was having trouble identifying the exact shape of what i was seeing. as i watched this, i was in a moving vehicle looking up through the windshield. as i watched, i noticed small white balls around the main object in question. i first thought it was parachute jumpers free falling around the parachute that was open but as i watched i noticed that they were not falling down but instead began to move from a stationary position to moving across the sky with some of them moving in different directions. the main object moved toward the northwest with the smaller whitish-silver balls remained relatively close to it, while several of the other white balls moved in different directions and eventually disappeared, but not over the horizon, i mean it disappeared before my eyes in the distance. i continued to watch the main object and the smaller ones as they moved faster. while i was watching my wife asked me what i was staring at and i told her i don't know.  we all got out of the van and observed the objects for 20 minutes or more.  there was no noise.  if you didn't look up and see it you wouldn't even know it was there.  it felt as though we were being watched and observed.  we weren't scared but more curious and frustrated that we couldn't figure out what it was.  after watching it disappears into the sky, not over the horizon, almost like a shooting star but going into outer space vs. falling to the ground.  we kept a vigil over the sky for the next couple of days and started researching it on the internet.  what we found blew us away.  it was exactly what we had seen yet it was seen all over the world.  in spain, mexico, germany, peru and they recently had a sighting over san diego on new year���s day.  if you go to ufo fleet with mother ship that is exactly what we saw.  it was over pecula, mexico in 2006. i can tell you i can't explain it.  it was definitely not balloons, paper lanterns, geese, fireworks, military aircraft, airplanes, hot air balloons, weather balloons or anything that i have ever seen.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello mufon,\r\n\r\non friday, february 15, 2008, at three o���clock in the afternoon, i saw an object in the sky over eugene, oregon.  i was sitting on a patio at the time, in the downtown area of the city, having a late lunch.\r\n\r\nthe day was slightly overcast, with only a thin layer of high altitude cirrus clouds, and it was very warm for february, about 55 degrees.  i was thinking about how nice it was, and i happened to glance up to see if any rain clouds had formed.\r\n\r\nhigh overhead, and slightly to the east of me, i saw a small object that appeared to be at least a thousand feet above the ground.  i���m judging it���s altitude mostly by the cloud cover.  i know this particular type of cloud is always at least a thousand feet high, and the object was moving in and out of the scattered cloud cover, although it was never completely hidden by the clouds.\r\n\r\nthe object was not large; it would have been covered by a golf ball held at arm���s length.  but the detail was very clear.  the object was brilliant white, and it appeared to shine with it���s own light source.  it was round on top, and there was a flat area on the bottom.  the flat area was slightly concave, like a crescent moon, waning past the half phase.  below that, there was a thin, bright filament of bright light.  it looked like a string of pure light.  at the end of this filament, there was a round light, switching in color from orange to green to bright white.  this lower light would also disappear, as part of the cycle of color change.\r\n\r\nthe lower light  was moving in a circular pattern below the larger body, as if the filament of light were a string, and the lower light was being swung on it, in a slow circle.\r\n\r\ni have some training in astronomy, and i know that some satellites can be observed in daylight.  i���m also familiar with how things look when they are in low earth orbit.  this object was not in orbit.  it���s path across the sky was too slow.  it appeared to hover, and it also moved very slowly from north east to south west.  the winds aloft, judging by movement of the cloud cover, were easterly, and slow, maybe ten miles an hour, so the object was moving at almost ninety degrees to the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nafter about five minutes of observation, the object changed course.  it did not speed up, but it began to move due east, in the same direction as the wind.  it appeared to move more slowly than the wind, however; the clouds were passing it by.  the object eventually just got too far away for me to see.\r\n\r\nthe object was small, but it was not far away, being almost directly overhead when i sighted it.  it was close enough that i could see small details.  the upper portion was smooth and round.  there were no ���flight surfaces��� anywhere on it.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what this could have been.  i know that when i saw it, i was having a very pleasant moment.  it had been a relaxing day.  i���ve just moved eugene, and i was thinking what a nice place it was, and i was having one of those rare moments when there are no worries and no stress.  my mind was open and at ease.  i thought about running inside to ask someone to look at the object with me, but they are all strangers to me, and i have to admit i was embarrassed to ask a roomful of strangers to ���come look at the ufo out here.���\r\n\r\nlater in the day, i called a friend, and told her all about it.  she���s interested in ufo���s and has had a close encounter.  then my sister called.  during our conversation, i said, ���hey, i saw������ and the phone went dead at that instant.  she called back, and i did not mention the ufo further.  the phone connection was perfect for the rest of our thirty minute conversation.  this object had the ���strangeness��� that so many  people talk about when they have a sighting.  it was entirely real, and yet it also seemed to be ���not completely here��� in some way.\r\n\r\nthanks for listening.  you may contact me with questions if you like.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
