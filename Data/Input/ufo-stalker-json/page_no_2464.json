vision saw a faint light (equivalent to low magnitude star)moving across the night sky, appearing to be a satellite, although in a roughly south to north direction. my other son and myself took a few seconds to find it and then all of us observed an immediate intensification of the light to a venus or greater brightness and then after a second the light went back to the original faint point of light that it was originally. the track of the light was not straight, appearing to be curving slightly, as it was approximately 70 to 80 degrees above the horizon. after a few seconds it once again intensified in brightness, although only about half of the brightness of before. it did this one more time after another few seconds of observation, and then the really bizarre event happened - the light diminished with a distinct small single point of white light with a small red light appearing to orbit it; creating a halo effect around the white light. this all was happening while the light continued to move across the sky, and only for a second. we all saw this and watched the single white light diminsh in intensity and fade away into the night sky.","distance":"Over One

northern colorado, 2 miles west of rawhide energy plant, 2 miles east of the front mountain range. it was near midday and very clear blue skies, no wind, cool about 70 degrees f. it is a very rural area with ranches all around but miles between them.\r\n\r\nwe both stepped outside for a break and what caused us to look skyward was the enormous number of contrails at high altitude crossing the mountains. we had never seen that many commercial aircraft going both east and west. as we looked up directly overhead, we both saw a small hovering object, right above us perhaps by a few hundred feet or more, hanging motionless. it was easily seen, in broad daylight. it was a device unknown to me, as i am an ex military and ex flight school candidate and familiar with aircraft and helicopters.\r\n\r\nit was a faceted shape, very much like an old lunar lander in appearance, but with no landing legs or protrusions. on the underside, which i assume we were staring up at, were two large globes. my carpenter asked \"what is that?\" and as we both stared at it, i said i really don't know. this thing hung over us for some seconds, then a faint glow rose up in the two globes and it slowly began to move. we watched it slowly accelerate to a moderate speed and gain a little altitude as it flew north / northeast toward wyoming only 20 miles away. once it was no longer overhead i could clearly see the angular faceted shape of the body and the two globes on the underside. i estimate 1000-1200 ft altitude initially in hover, gaining up to 2000-2500 upon exiting the area north. we watched it until it was out of visual range.\r\nit made no noise at all. the overall color of the device was a very subdued dark green-grey, very much like a military aircraft color. we speculated among ourselves at the time that this could be a military surveillance probe in testing, but if so it uses a technology for flight that is not yet public knowledge, as it had no wings, no rotors, no visible means of support other than twin glowing globes on its' underside. and it was silent, transitioned smoothly from hover to level flight, accelerated very gradually, and displayed no erratic or sudden radical maneuvering. it was however not a conventional air vehicle.\r\n\r\nwithing a few days, we found a dead antelope about 50-60 yds from the southeast corner of the house. antelope are very common in large herds in this area. this however was odd as it appeared to be a fairly young healthy animal and was not attacked by predators. it was lying on its' side, quite dead, with a large round hole in it's left hindquarter, bigger than any firearm other than a 40mm grenade launcher could make. no scorching, no blood, and no exit wound. just this big perfectly round hole. within two days, coyotes reduced the carcass to clean bones and we found no trace of metallic projectiles or shot. we have no idea what killed this animal.\r\n\r\nwe do not know if there is a connection between the two events, but it is curious how close together they occurred.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

20 miles away) to draw my attention.  i always look at them  till i am convinced its a plane before i look to the next one.   i frequently look behind myself to make sure no one is walking behind me because my dog will react by running or barking unless i tell her to go farther into the field before she sees them. anyway.\r\n\r\n    i looked back behind me and noticed a light moving northwest flying faster than normal, especially for the height it seemed to be at( it was definitly higher than most of the planes that seem to be leaving or headed to dfw, but not as high as a plane flying long distance above you) and i watched it travel over me in a straight path and a steady speed until it went completly past me.  i couldnt see it from the back like a plane that had just passed, although there were very thin, fast moving clouds.  the light looked larger, and much wider than a plane's and only pointed forward. i seemed attached to the under side of something maybe twice the size of a big jet but i couldnt really make out any details.  i did hear the delayed noise like the kind that a jet makes but it was much lower, i remember it almost like a ominous sound from a movie.  once it passed i followed my dog to the back door and inside told my friend what i saw.  she looked at me like she felt sorry for me and disappointed in me at the same time.  i asked her to come outside with me and watch the sky and she said no and continued watching some reality show garbage on tv.  i went back to the side ofthe field and watch the sky for about five minuets until my neck started to hurt and went inside.  after maybe ten minuets i went on my back patio to smoke, and moved my chair and leaned it back so i could see the sky without looking up.  mostly i was just looking at all the differant stars seeing what shapes i could make.  \r\n\r\n\r\n     then, coming from the east/southeast i saw an upright clyindrical object floating through the sky.   i was shocked, i lost my breath and stood up.  it kept moving in a straight path much slower than an airplane and the closer it got the better i could see it.  it was similar to the dimensions of a waterheater like in a home except more rounded,and i remember it being slightly fatter at the bottom, like a streched out egg shape.  it moved at a steady pace far below the clouds that patched the sky, and as it moved it was slowly rotating or rocking a little around i guess its center-axis, but it always stayed upright.  when it got between me and the moon (which was very bright), the moonlight feflected of it and i

went to iranzamin high school - graduated in spring 1977.\r\n \r\nmy dad was an ex-pakistan air force officer, living and working in iran  for  iran air. he worked at the airport and when he got to the office the next morning, he also talked to many witnesses at the airport that saw the same and told me of the scrambling of the f4's and that the instrumentation was jammed.  i saw the f4 drop in the sky when it got close to the ufo.. very exciting for a 16-year old!\r\n \r\ni lived in the mid-central part of the city - about 4.5 miles east of the  commercial airport,. near 24-esfand square (the heart of the city). right next to the teheran university.  \r\n\r\ni lived in a high-rise flat with my dad and was studying at late night for school exam (between 12:30am and 1:00am) when i heard the engines of fighter airplanes (phantom(s))streak across the sky.  having been an ex-air force officer kid, i have always been fascinated by aircraft and know the distinctive sounds of fighters, i knew these were likely f4-phantoms.  i knew this as i have lived next to air bases all my life, and knew that these were phantoms and they were flying very low - too low and too fast. so, something was up! i immediately went to the rooftop of the flat and witnessed the part of the event, after the f4's (both) were in the sky. from when they tried to \"fire on the ufo, and got jammed\".\r\n\r\ni saw the light (bright, rapidly alternating glows/colors from white, to red, to blue, orange) basically 'toy' with the aircraft!  zipping left and traveled up and down the roofs of homes across the city towards the south of my vantage point (looking downhill, visibility was perfest as it was a very clear fall night and i could see for 30-40 miles for sure without obstruction because of the downhill grade of the land moving gradually away from the teheran mountain range). \r\n\r\ni watched the event for about 10 minutes towards the end i saw the smaller object exit the large craft far in the distance and go towards the ground it was in a se direction from teheran.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the craft after it deposited the smaller craft towards the ground, it traveled away from that location and then moved slowly away, then all of a sudden it zipped across the sky at a very high rate. like a fast meteor! but in reverse back up towards the sky.\r\n\r\nthere was no doubt in my mind at that time that this was a fantastic object not of this earth!    later the next day, my dad heard the rest of the facts from people at the airport as i noted above, and all the pieces then made sense.\r\n \r\ni am so glad to see this information now available to the public as i know what i saw and about 9 years ago i heard of someone on art bell talking about it and they wanted more people to verify the event.  i was unable to call in then, but i am glad this is as well documented and confirmed as i saw now - thanks to the internet for making this happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over

different formation of lights in the same area. this time there were 4 dimmer lights lined up in a strait line, but tilted at about a 45 degree angle in the sky. these lights were observed for approx: 1 minute before the lights disappeared. this time the lights went out one by one, and completely disappeared in about 5-6 seconds. at that time i looked at the clock to get a time. the clock stated it

dozen \"ships\" at dusk -- including a fiery head-on collison between a couple of the ships about 20��� east of the moon at around 7pm -- and after a huge yellow flash the larger of the two ships continued on its north east path as if it had \"absorbed\" the other ship.  also, that same evening, we witnessed a spectacular fly-over that shut my video camera down.  \r\n\r\nlast friday, 2/8, we saw one of the ships make an abrupt north to south turnaround, showing what appeared to be several windows and at least one \"winged\" craft riding on its back -- almost like an aircraft carrier.  we also saw a craft appear to completely combust only to return to its regular red, blue and white state as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nit's extremely difficult to image these objects as they skirt the roofs of houses and are almost always obscured by trees -- but i've included several photographs for your inspection.  the 2/10 triangle was taken around 8pm in the western sky.  the triangle.2.212 was also imaged in the western sky at around 7:40pm.  notice the tandem orbs at the bottom left which mark, in my opinion, the nose of the triangle, at least in this picture, though it's my belief the \"nose\" can change positions in a nano-second -- as well as the entire orientation of the \"triangle\".\r\n\r\ni believe the majority of these ships are composed of three hexagonal orbs, each possessing six secondary orbs -- allowing the ships to take on many forms from a single ball of light to a huge, brilliantly illuminated \"aircraft-like\" object.\r\n\r\ni used photoshop's \"colored pencil\" effect to bring out the light wave connections between orbs in the image, ufo.212.Warp.\r\n\r\ni never believed in ufos until they literally got in my face.  i may not know what

across the sky.  there were either three different craft or we saw one three times. i didn't get to see the shape but the red was the brightest and deepest i have ever seen. my son was looking through the binoculars and said it was triangular.  the first one which was the closest to us could very well have been a conventional aircraft i thought, except for the fact that we heard no sound and the red was like nothing i had ever seen before.  it was also out of place. also it was flying much lower than any jet i had seen in the area before, which are rarely noticed.  later, i finally witnessed one of the huge \"planets\" move significantly. it was the size of a dime and it moved noticeably fast.\r\n\r\njanuary 25th\r\nat 1:45 am this morning as i looked out our living room window i saw a white light flashing above the big mine area. i called my son to look and he got the binoculars. he said it was like a mother ship. we went out on the deck to look. sure enough, looking through the binoculars you could see it! there were red and white lights blinking all around it. red, white, red, white, red, white. it was like a strobe light and you could tell the lights were going all around it.  my son says triangular but i thought circular.  it just hovered there at the edge of and above the hill and over the lake.  i attempted to get a photo but it was just too far for my camera to pick up.  i didn't have my daughters video camera. it is really strange how we watched it for a few minutes got cold and then we both went in the house to carry on with whatever we were doing before that.  i think we have just seen so much lately. we never saw it leave.","distance":"Over One

about 1 ��� miles west-southwest of town.  he saw a group of lights and pointed them out to me.  they were moving slowly and low in the sky. i knew right away these were not planes.  there were two groups of four bright white lights, in a straight line, one larger group above the other smaller group, similar to the shape of the ship on star trek.  the entire group slowly turned to the right, then split into two separate groups, each a group of four bright white lights with a red light underneath.  the two groups slowly passed over us and continued on toward the southeast until out of sight.  there was no noise at all, completely silent.  i am sure that it was not airplanes or a blimp.  i tried to take photographs, but wasn't sure if i was getting anything because it was so dark.  when we looked at our pictures later, i was shocked to find not only the two groups i was focusing on, but three more groups of different colors in the photo as well.  in the photo they appear zig-zagging, but they did not look like this by plain eyesight. i was amazed, excited, and nervous. i could not believe what i was seeing.  also, i circled three lights in the lower right hand corner of each photograph.  i don't know what these are, but they are the same in each photo.  they are not zig zagged like the others.  the photos were taken less than a minute apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nwitness 2:\r\n\r\nit was around 9:00 pm, and my girlfriend and i were on the way to my house from the high school baseball game.  we were driving north down the road and i noticed some strange lights in the sky to my left.  i told her to look and she was surprised too.  there were four white lights and a red light.  the four white lights blinked in a rolling sequence and the red light did not blink at all.  i am sure they could not have been  planes because they were too close together and were moving very slowly and i could not hear anything.  they were low enough that i should have been able to hear something.  as they moved along, it seems that the red light was moving ahead of the white lights.  i have never seen anything like this.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

12th\r\nmy husband and i went down to the landing for dinner. on our way back, as we drove by the fisheries we saw a very large glowing light at the end of the fulton lake rd. the glow was the same as what we saw above the water tower only it didn't appear to be moving.  we decided to take a drive down to see what it was. it was very dark and kind of eery driving down it. as we just about reached the end and the light was growing brighter, a coyote came running fast toward the truck. my husband tried to stop but, not in time.  the coyote ran right under the front bumper, obviously scared of something it was running from. it didn't get hurt and took off into the bush.  we parked at the end of the road facing the lake. trees were covering the area that the glow was coming from. i wanted to go down the trail to see what it was, but at the same time i was a little freaked out. we stayed for about 10 minutes waiting for the light to rise up, and it didn't.  we left the area.  i was trying to think of what it might be.  i was thinking lamp posts or something, but the light was very big and my husband said it was coming from quite a distance. in that case there would be nothing out there that could do this because it is all thick forested area and lake.\r\n\r\njanuary 13th.\r\nmy husband and i drove down to fulton during the day to see if there were any lights that would have made the huge glow. we walked down the trail and although there were two buildings close to where we parked, there were no lights that we could see on the outside of them. also, the glow would have been coming from much further down the lake.\r\n\r\njanuary 14th.\r\none of my sons friends told him that he saw a huge glow far back in the trees on his way home from his girlfriends out of town.  this was in the evening.  my son asked him if it was near fulton and looking a little suprised he said it was. \r\n\r\njanuary 15th.\r\nmy daughter and i took a drive down to the fisheries this evening and tried

morning one of our neighbours came over looking very terrified about the early early morning events he and his mother endured at approximately 3am. he wanted to see the footprints my kids had discovered the other night, so my son and daughter took him and another neighbor up to the watertower. \r\nit was still quite light out, early afternoon. as they walked up the hill and saw where the footprints were two nights before, they seemed to be missing. \r\nin the evening around 5:30-6 pm we got some video of the barge crossing the lake which would close down for the night and then one of the ufo's started up almost immediately after the barge landed. it took quite a few minutes but i finally managed to catch it on video. after a while i got the tripod set up and was able to focus in on the light. this ufo did not hover around the mountain side as usual but sat in one spot.  it looked as though the camera was being zoomed in and out when in fact noone touched the camera at all. i figure now, that the camera may have been auto focusing.  when looking through the telescope you could see that the ball of energy or light had a red saucer around it which you cannot see on the video.\r\n\r\nmy husband called after 7pm to tell me he did not want to go back to camp as he had a tall black spindly figure standing in his small room by the door at 2 am. he said he was paralized in fear.\r\n\r\ntonight my son was very irritated and upset/agitated and took off out the door saying he was going to hitchhike. i followed him in the truck and he told me to leave. i did, and went home and called my daughter. she said she would get her b/f to go look for him. my other daughter and i were talking in the kitchen and after a while i opened the kitchen door to the dining room and saw my son sitting in a chair. he was crying. i tried to talk to him about why he left and he wasn't concerned about that but was about what happened outside. he said he walked down the granisle hwy to the church and there were cricket sounding noises that got very loud in his head. he saw a very dark tall figure standing by the church. he ran. when he got close to home the noise got very loud in his head until he fell to his knees in so much pain. he was horribly upset, dizzy and somewhat disoriented when i talked to him. he began to get what felt like a migraine and was given some advil.\r\nthe b/f came to the door and i told him that my son was here so he left. my son got very frightened telling me to give the b/f a ride because something could happen to him. the b/f was already running and it was too late so i called my daughter. i told her to call me when he arrived at her place. several min. later she called.  then, within half an hour i was taking a shower, very nervous and my other daughter started knocking on the bathroom door telling me to hurry get out. i did and dressed while running out the door. she was on the phone with my other daughter who was telling her that there was something in her bathroom.\r\nshe was just telling her b/f about my sons experience when she saw a dark shadow go very quickly down her hall. then there was a green pulsating light coming from beneath the bathroom door and then a shadow moving. the b/f was getting it on video as she was talking on the phone. there was an odour of rotten eggs in the room and the cat was sniffing the air and then began to go \"crazy\"\r\nwe all jumped in the truck and got over there fast and picked them up. \r\n\r\nagain, i have video but don't know how to upload

i was talking to my husband online i received an urgent phone call around 10 pm or so. it was my mom and she says, \"get up here! it is huge!\"   \r\napparently she heard her dog vomiting outside and as she opened the door to get him, she immediately saw a huge, bright light appear and she called her husband out to see as well. she said \"at first i thought someone turned on their snowmobile light in the fog.\"  it lifted up and under it there were a bunch of white glowing smaller balls of light. by the time we (my youngest 17 year old son and my 21 year old daughter) got up there we saw a huge glow above the water tower about the size of a football field maybe bigger. it was hovering up and down. it remained there for a good half hour before it began to glide what seemed to be away from us further into the hills...I called my other daughter, wanting her video camera.  she was too late getting it to me.\r\neventually the light, which was now a blue glow in the strategically placed fog and seemed to move farther back up or around the mountain. finally the fog became a thick black cloud with a perfect glowing white outline. the cloud was lying low, covering only the area where the light was emanating from, and sometimes there appeared to be holes in the cloud straight through to the glow. that went on for about an hour longer but it slowly faded down to a dull blue glow in and the cloud wasn't as black anymore. \r\nmy two daughters, youngest son and the b/f decided to walk up to the water tower, much to my dismay. on the way up my oldest daughter and the b/f each witnessed an orb cross their path ahead, then they came across some very strange footprints (not human) in the snow, and saw a flash in the woods, at which point she began photographing and making a video of the prints. as they got closer to the water tower, they saw more flashes. they were small flashing points in the darkness between the trees, \"like someone flicking a lighter\". then they noticed a steady glowing orb higher in a tree, less than 20 feet away from where they were on the road, probably about 15-20 feet up the tree. at that point they realized that something was there looking straight at them and it was time to go home. on the way down the hill they all smelled a strong pungeant rotten egg odour.\r\nwhen we see these things i wish at the time that there were others around to see it as well. my fear is that i would run up to one of the houses and bang on the door, and drag someone out, only to find the things gone. i would feel so foolish. these things happen so fast and then you are afraid to look away incase you miss something.\r\n\r\ni haven't found out how to get the video's to you without placing them on youtube, which i don't want to do.  please let me know how if there is another way.  i am sending a photo of the prints.  i hope they won't be distributed as they belong to my daughter. they are for mufon use only please.  also, we don't know how to change the date or time on the video camera.  it was bought in october, 2007 but has the date 2000 on it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9569,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":54.8921248,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-02132008-0003","longitude":-126.203628,"occurred":1197871200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British
