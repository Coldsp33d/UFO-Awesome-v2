of questions the page disappeared.  please let me know of you recieved it.\r\n\r\nthis takes place after a week of strange occurrances in our home following our first encounter with a craft on the highway.\r\n\r\nit was very clear out. you could see all the stars. my daughter and i go for a drive. it is dark now. we go down to the lake we see this fog start up just between us and the road above us. it starts to get eery and then suddenly an orange light shoots out of the sky into the cloud. we go home to get my husband. when we get there he is standing outside with the dogs looking at the sky. after he put the dogs in the house, i pick him up and take him down to the lake. we start observing all the strange \"stars\" and \"planets\" and the sudden appearance and disappearance of the fogs. my husband kind of dismisses things so we go home.  later, as my husband is again sleeping on the couch, my son and daughter and i were keeping our eyes open. at about 2 am, my husband was asleep on the couch and my daughter and son call me to the window asking me what the light was above our neighbours roof over the lake. i said, \"let's go see.\" \r\nso we walked down toward the lake and it is as clear as a bell out. suddenly a fog appears, starting out small and growing and growing until it is like a path from where we came. then it totally circles us. we couldn't see the light on the lake anymore. i started to get really scared so we go home and get the truck. after we get back down there and sit for about 2 minutes still in the truck i see it! it appears octagon in shape and it is coming down the lake from n.W direction. it is flying low and had red and green/blue lights all around it. i said, \"oh my god, there it is, there it is!\" the kids jump out of the truck and i am freaking for them not to. then i got out too and it flew over our heads and there is a rumble like a jet very loud. my son starts flicking his lighter at it wanting it to see us! i tell him \"don't!!\" it continues on in a straight path  along the lake and finally the blinking lights couldn't be seen. all we see is what appears to be a star.  we are so excited! mistified! scared! we get back in the truck because it is cold. the strange fog appears rapidly over the lake. we ask each other if it was a jet or what? even though it had no wings.  suddently there is a huge blue flash that lights up the sky and it comes from the direction that we saw the \"jet\" go. it streaks across the sky lit up and the same shape at lightning speed and it stops right in front of us across the lake and sits there, now just looking like a star or planet. \"meteorites\" are everywhere.  when it lit up you could see the blue and red lights at the back of it as it streaked across the sky.  it was so fast it left a trail of itself behind it.\r\ni panic and drive off and the kids are complaining loudly that i am taking them away from this event that is once in a lifetime. i tell them i want their dad and i go to get him!  i wake him up and he mumbles and goes back to sleep. the kids are waiting in the truck, keeping an eye on the light that lumed there. i feel like a heel, but i am terrified at the thought of taking them back there to the unknown, but i do anyway. first i stop at my brothers, wake him up and take him with us back down to the lakeside. we park the same way facing the lake but as far back from it as possible. as we sit there, we start to see them. there are at least four maybe more. there are two hovering on the lake and one comes out from the trees on the otherside and goes straight up and hovers there. it moves up and down up and down over a little then up and down. there are more over on the other side glowing through the trees. the fog appears again. then the one on the left of us which is hovering on the lake and is a long strip of lights with what looked like a search light in the center starts to get too close. my kids are in the back of the truck and i fear for them so i start to drive off. my brother wants me to stop and look for a minute more. i do this and then leave. i dropped my brother off and we went into his place to discuss what we saw. then i go home and my husband is up. my kids continue to watch out the window and see the one on the lake which we now know was the one that lured us down there to begin with. it is glowing and from that distance you can only see the search light thing. i asked my husband to go and see with me, because i really wanted him to experience what we did. finally after about half an hour he asks if i want to go. we did. as we were heading down to the lake he saw a very large black shape (the size of our town) over the lake and then it faded out. after that he only got to see the one on the lake by the mine and the strange fog that took over the whole area immediately after we got there. we could hear what he thought was the barge starting up, which would be it heading over to the other side of the lake for the first run. after that we saw no more activity. we drove up to my moms because he thought we could get a better view from her driveway. we sat there for a few minutes when i saw in the sky above the lake what looked like red and green lights flashing. it flew from the burns lake side of the lake toward smithers but not following the lake like i saw the other lower craft. this one was much higher and sounded jetlike. suddenly the fog got huge and glowing white. it came up so fast and then it began coming toward us. we went home and in the two minutes that took, the fog totally covered our town. my kids were at the kitchen window and had just seen a light hovering above the neighbour house behind us.  they described it as a solid white orb.\r\n\r\ni am attaching a picture of the view of lake from our porch.  it is the view we saw the light that lured us to the lake.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile,

it and tried to focus on them. they didn't move. meanwhile, the object displayed a total range of motion and speed. it would make complete circles, zigzags, move up, down, left, right. at one point,

the sky at low altitude and could have hit the ground in front of us, but not so that we could see.  we were very startled, and nervously chatted along the drive.  we drove aways and there were very bright lights that appeared in front of us.  they appeared to stretch across about half the width of the highway.  they were orange/red with an orange ora all around them.  it looked as though i might run right into them and i began to come to a stop.  it then looked as though they zipped sideways and disappeared.  this road has thick trees on either side of us.  there was no pull off and no road for anything to turn down.  when i thought i had passed the spot where this occurred i wanted to turn around and look for the lights but my passengers were too frightened so we continued home.  this happened at precisely 7:00 pm.  i know that because i looked at the clock joking about being abducted. \r\n\r\nokay, now i am really wondering here.  i am trying to find a video or picture to attach in order to show you what the highway looks like that we were traveling on.  i came across a video taken last october.  my daughter had just gotten a new video camera for her birthday.  i was trying to get a picture off of the video and while trying to find the best shot without showing my cracked windshield i noticed something running across the road in front of us.  it is traveling so fast. way too fast and upright for a moose.  could you examine this?  anyway i will attempt to send this.  it is depicting the area that we travel home and although going the opposite way of our sighting it is showing you what it is like.\r\n\r\ni can't seem to upload a video.  could you let me know what to do?  i am sending  a picture of the highway and it has that creature on it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"06:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9556,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":54.8845648,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-02122008-0010","longitude":-126.207158,"occurred":1196323200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British

grandson (9).  we awoke early, having coffee on the porch at 4 am.  it was a very clear morning.  in the northeast sky, over cleburn or maybe ft.Worth, we noticed a brilliant star larger than the north star.  we had never seen a star of this magnitude in that part of the sky before.  suddenly it dropped straight down (about a quarter inch in our eyesight).  we thought we were witnessing a plane falling until it went straight back up to it's original location.  pausing for a second it went down at an angle to the right.  it was very high in the universe so it's movements had to be travelling thousands of miles per hour.  it traversed in every direction well over an hour, never leaving it's location in the sky. a couple of times, for only a second, it became solid red. it remained bright at all times.  we called our son and grandson to come quickly from their home a few hundred yards away and we all witnessed it's movements for well over an hour until the sun rose and it became invisible.  i tried to capture it with my digital night lens, but it didn't develop.  this was not a star or a plane or anything men could design that would travel at such speed.  we told our friends about the incident, but didn't report it until the happenings in stephenville, which is close by.  i'd like to say we were astounded and all the other emotions involved in spotting a ufo, but this is the second sighting for us, and far less dramatic.The other was about 40 yrs ago when we witnessed a gigantic ufo hovering closly over trees while we were driving on hwy 635 at 1 am in dallas.  it traveled at tremendous speed as it sped away. we reported it to the news, our congressman and friends, but after considerable ridicule and disbelief by everyone, we decided this time we wouldn't report this incident.  my husband and i are highly respected successful business owners in dallas.  we feel privileged to have witnessed ufos twice in our lifetime and know that whoever is sharing our hemosphere are far more advanced than we humans and are no doubt more considerate of our space than we would be of theirs given the same capabilities.

(i had seen only the bottom point light previously.) both point lights were centrally placed, the space between them being about 1/4 of the rim's width.\r\n\r\ni watched the object for another two minutes as it flew off into the far horizon and finally disappeared. the object always maintained a straight flight, its rim never tilting away from horizontal. as the object flew away i compared it with two aircraft that were visible in other areas of the sky. both appeared to be commercial airliners with familiar blinking and colored lights. while i could easily identify these airplanes, the unknown object looked like nothing i'd ever seen. however, despite its strange appearance, the object seemed rather banal and non-threatening. i had a vague feeling that it was built by humans and was being flown for mundane reasons. that was my impression of the craft at the time.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

25 feet above ground level and looked out the eastern facing window.  i could then see it was above the trees and stationary.  i waited about 30 seconds to see if it had movemant comming toward me or away - because it would not appear to be moving then.  it wasn't and suddenly flared up about 3 times and got really bright then shunk down again to its former intensity and size.  when it flared a yellowish part of the light appeared to extend downward. \r\n it was very cold and clear so i still told myself that perhaps i was seeing a helicopter just above the trees with a searchlight that was tilting around on the bottom of it an thus giving the affect. i got out my binoculars and looked at it and i could see the same thing only larger and clearer and then it pulsed again even brighter and the that lower yellow extension of light was really visable... and then another one came up along side it to my left and thus from the south.  this was not as intense and only raised to be level with it on the same plane and then stayed still.  the first pulsed again and then i new it was unidentifiable by me.  \r\n i woke my wife and brought her to the window which all took about two minutes. she tried the binoculars but has to have glasses and couldn't get them in focus.  shelooked at them with her naked eyes (with her glasses on) and she was moved to say whoa- which should somewhat support the intesity and oddness of it. i continued to watch through binoculars.  i guess about 5-8 minutes had passed, but i havn't gone through this statement to add up the time i already stated.\r\n at this point a third came above the treeline from the south and all three started to move north/northwest.  this entire 5-8 minutes the first had stayed perfectly stationaty pulsating irregularly (strong, weak, weak, weak, strong, strong, strong, strong, weak, strong...You get it) the second had stayed still and perfectly spaced to the right(south) of the first.  as soon as the third came into view it was spaced as far as the second was to the first, all three started to move...As i have stated.\r\n this was about a full minute to all happen.  \r\n  at this point my wife thought it was all over but had the same reaction of wow...And decided to return to bed.  i said goodnight 30-45 seconds, then returned to the window with the binoculars.  the first 3 were gone when a 4th came up faster than the others were moving and stopped where the first one had been.  if pulsed once.  it jumped or moved up, then down, then went very fast to the north/northwest.  this jumping up and down was not a great distance from where i was.  if i were going to plot it on my window as if this had all happened in 2 dimensions it would be less than a half inch.  but at the distance away they were - at least 5 miles it must have been great. it was a very fast up/down and then move.  that confirmed for me is was not identifiable.\r\n\r\n  i called the flying cloud airport and the helicopter place and they stated they had no activity at that time.  they are very small.\r\n\r\n i know distance is hard to gage but i think it was at least 5 miles away- just above the tree line, perhaps above lake riley.  i looked on mapquest and moved the map over eastward trying to figure out where it was and that seams to be the most likely poistion.\r\ni will watch the skies tonight to see if they or conventional aircraft do anything like this to either dispell or confirm my thought.\r\n i would like to believe it was conventional but they just didn't portray conventional behavior. \r\n give me a call if you want more.  i just hope others saw it too.   \r\n  ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9545,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.857207,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02112008-0014","longitude":-93.55783,"occurred":1202724300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1202724300000,"summary":"4 orange/yellow irregularly pulsating lights that were stationary then moved","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Chanhassen, Minnesota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:401822"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"West Point","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At the age of 16 in oct 1970 (i just remember it was fall) i and my friend were coming home from school.\r\n\r\ni stopped at the stop sign just below my friend's house. as i pulled away from the stop sign another boy who lived in the neighbor hood rode his bicycle right in front of the car. i had to hit the brakes hard to keep from hitting him. i yelled at him through the open window. \"whats wrong?\" he looked like he was about to cry. he yelled back \"flying saucer\". \r\n\r\nmy frined and i just laughed. we pulled up to my frieds house where we stood out in his front yard talking for a minute or two. we were joined by his youger sister and very young brother (they had walked down from the nearby elementry school).\r\n\r\ni was facing my frind and his brother and siter. all of a sudden i noticed they were looking up in the air, i looked up also and saw about 40 feet above my frineds house a very large metalic looking something. this thing was montionless and made absoutely no noise. i would gues it was about 50 feet long and 20 feet wide. (it was about 1 1/2 times longer than the house). the craft had what appeared to be port holes at least along the side that i could see. it looked liked the skin was made of polished aluminum. i saw no signs of construction like rivets, seams, supports, struts or anything. other than the port holes which were round and seemed to be recessed a few inches into the craft, the outside was completly smooth , no gondolas, propellers, wings, stablizers, wires, nothing. the day was clear and we got a good look at it. i saw no way to enter the craft (at least from the side i was looking at).\r\n\r\nwe all watched in silent as the craft remained motionless for about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. all of a sudden it shot up very fast (i guess it went up about another 40 feet) then it banked to the right and up at a maybe 20 degree angle and made a large \"z\" in the air. in a split second it was maybe 1,000 to 2,000 feet away. \r\n\r\nthe craft went higher and turned left, it was now over us and heading out of town. i jumped in the car and drove as fast i as could trying to keep it in sight. i kept it in sight for maybe another 3 or 4 minutes but by now it was pretty high. it slow down some but was still going very fast maybe 400 or 500 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nit may sound strange but we didn't talk about it for years and when we did we both agreed that we didn't know what we saw. now my frined and his little brother only seem to have a vague memory of \"something\" happening.I haven't talked with his sister since she lives out of town now.\r\n\r\nthe boy on the bicycle was another story. as i said i didn't talk about the event for years, i didn't want to be labeled a nut. i saw the boy on the bicyle about 10 years ago and he told me his story. he said he was riding his bike across the river bridge (it was kinda of a odd time most of the adults in west point had 9-5 jobs and school had been out a while so the roads were petty empty) anyway this craft had (according to him) come out of the water and was literally chasing him. no wonder he was so upseat. i saw him again about 3 years ago he says he still has night mares about the event. \r\n\r\nas a note the boy on the bike said he developed skin cancer, he is disabled and walks with a cane, my friend also developed skin cancer (melanomia).\r\n\r\nduring the event i was more amazed than scared, that came later.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":9544,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.8868656,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02112008-0013","longitude":-85.1760946,"occurred":25311600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":25311600000,"summary":"Metalic looking cigar with rounded ends ufo seen maybe 40 feet above my friends house, slient had portholes along side, moved very fast in z pattern","tags":["saucer"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"West Point, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:401823"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Euclid","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was laying on my living room sofa at 6:30 p.M. when an extremely super brilliant glowing neon red sphere shaped object caught my attention through my living room window.  i told my wife to look at it also.  i first thought it was an airplane on fire.  it was so bright, it was lighting up the sky around it.  it moved horizontaly in a straight line from the direction of lake erie, in euclid, ohio, southbound about a miles distance towards rt.90 at a slow rate about 500 feet above the houses.  it then seemed to lose a bit of altitude when it just vanished. it wasn't very large but the light it emmitted was something else. my wife and myself said to each other that it was the brightest red color that we have ever seen. total time seen was about one minute.","distance":"501 Feet -
