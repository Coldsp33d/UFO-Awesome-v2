chairs out in the front of the house and watched the stars in the sky we noticed a light hovering over the tree line in front of the property and it moved around there for about 20 min. it then took of and headed straight up and began to move from one side of the horizon to the other flashing colored lights like a strobe or ---- ---- from the distants it looked like a long cigar. it came close to the house and then moved in the sky for an hour giving us a show. i saw a plane moving   the in sky and it moved in toward it and flew with it for some time and then came back to our house i told linda lets try to communicate with it so i started to use the porch lite and turned it on and off two short one long two short. it did not take long for it to notice us and flew over the house as close as the lite pole was next to the house it was silent and its shape was like a triangle and black... it was so exciting. my father john l fererro was a marine and built airplanes and he also worked for nasa and built the engins on the space shuttle... so i know aircraft this was not the new stealthy plaines they have now because they dont hoover or fly with out any sound... anyway the craft flew over the property and did this for a long time i told linda i cant see our goverment using there aircraft on us and use so much fuel for so long of a time. it desided to land in the back of the house and when it did the 4 dogs we had and all the cows and other animals began to go crazy screeming about what was happening. i began to think to myself as i watched it in the back im going to have a heart attack im so scared. i assumed if whatever was flying it was comming out and trying to come to the house when we heard a gun shot and then we heard a scream that i have never heard before then it took off fast and we watched it move to a star and position itself in front of it and stayed the star pattern was shaped like a kite.. we watched the sky for an hour and noticed small orb like objects moving in formation and all over the place. when all this happended we thought to ourselfs if they had of visited we only had coffie to offer them no drug wish we were on drug so we could explain to ourselfs we were stoned out of our minds and what we saw... the next day a car pulled up and some one got out wearing a hot pink silk shirt did not stop to talk to use drove off. cowbows dont were silk hot pink silk shirts. dont know about that... only told friends about what happend not to long after that i joined the navy and moved to pensacola florida and   photography school in 74. in 2000 was again in pensacola and met the man that had taken photos of a ufo while working at the tiki house motor lodge. use to think about a friend that lived in phoinex ar a lot and the ufo lites were seen there. and now in jan 1 lost my sister she hung here self in arlington tx and heard that the ufo were seen over stevenville tx. i think about the ufo we saw all the time and think they are trying to communicate with us i use the porch lite and they noticed ... thats about all i can say that happened to use hope you can use my experience to communicte with them as i

then, \"no one is going to believe me when i tell them i saw this strange thing.\"  i really wished i had my camera with me but i didn't.  \r\n\r\ni thought at first it was a plane crashing but it was coming almost straight down with such a forceful trajectory that i thought maybe it was a comet.  so i pulled over to watch it and it came to a stop and appeared to hover and then sped down going south above the tree line along i-26 until i lost sight of it; about 3 - 4 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nit was a clear beautiful day, sunny blue skies.  what caught my eye about this thing was the \"tail\" behind it - energy trail or whatever.  it was definately not an airplane or helicopter.  it was something i've never seen before, can not describe its shape - only to say it may have been round.  it traveled very fast when it came to a horizontal point above the tree line and was out of sight in about 3 or 4 minutes as i stated above.  i felt nothing out of the ordinary during the siting - just called my best friend during it and my mom afterwards to tell them what i saw.\r\n\r\nway off in the distance, at the same time i first saw this comet like thing, i saw what looked like the contrail

the stars noticing how beautiful venus and mars look in their morning cycle. it was getting cold so just as i started to head in i gazed directly overhead noticing a rather large triangular \"something\" cruising through the sky's. it had three bright lights on each corner, and no stars were visible with in the triangle, telling me what i was seeing is a solid craft. i then quickly grabbed my camera, and as i headed back out side i saw the craft quickly jog to the north, then stop. that's when i saw a smaller triangular craft rise up from behind a hill. it trailed some kind of plasma exhaust as it rose to meet the larger craft. just then the larger craft shot a beam towards the smaller craft. this lasted about 9 seconds when the smaller craft shot off into the night

from the north at around 3-5 mph.  \r\n\r\ni was cuddling with a friend on the roof of some random strip mall in south austin staring at the stars as ussual, when i observed what first appeared to be a shooting star directly above us and a bit to the south. i've seen hundreds of shooting stars in my day, so i am fairly certain that the phenomena i observed last night was not in keeping with with anything i've witnessed previously. \r\n\r\nthe entire event lasted about two seconds, and in that time i observed changes in the velocity of the /craft/ light/ energy body/ illuminati saucer/  flying spaggheti monster/ that occured so rapidly that only a very attentive viewer would even have picked up on it. the changes in direction were more obvious: a few degrees to the north, a few degrees to the south, back towards the north, ang gone. i am not certain as to how fast the human body can travel without being damaged, but i would wager that no human body could endure such rapid changes in velocity and direction. the object did seem to slow immidiately before each turn, only to return to \"shooting star\" speed almost instantly. it all happened so quickly that i cannot be certain of this.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nprevious sightings:\r\n\r\nfebruary 2nd, 2008\r\ntoday, while lying on the rocks with some hippies in the barton creek greenbelt, i observed a very distant point of silver light hovering motionless in what i assumed to be the upper atmosphere. i immidiately turned to my friends and said, \"i think thats a u.F.O.\". they were excited, but not as surprised as i had expected. one of my friends turned to me at once and said, \" yeah, juan here's been tellin' us 'bout em'. says he's seen em flyin around on and off all day.\" (typical, huh?) juan jumped up from his crosslegged position and asked me to point it out for him. i assume that the others present were to intoxicated to make out such a small light, or perhaps they just didn't care. (i was only under the influence of the ussual nicotine buzz, and jaun quit drinking a couple of weeks ago)\r\n\r\nwe watched it for a few minutes and observed niether any change in the position nor the intensity of the light for several minutes. it appeared to be composed of a highly reflective metallic substance, but i wouldn't make a bet on that assertion. it dissapeared abruptly after about 6 minutes, and i did not see any other lights.\r\n\r\nthe sky was a deep, healthy shade of blue during the sighting, and there were no visible clouds in the vicinity. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nmarch 16, 2007\r\n\r\ni was lying alone in a field behind the barton springs pool at around 10 in the evening. the sky was clear, the moon was absent, and the stars were blazing. i noticed what appeared to be a satelite, directly above me, moving in a direct line from the east/northeast, toward the west/southwest. soon after my eyes settled on the object, the light it /reflected /produced /was composed of gradually became more intense, and within two or three seconds the object was by far the brightest object in the night sky. it was about a quarter of the size of the moon when the light reached maximum intensity. it began to dim immidiately, gradually, and it faded completely out of view within a few seconds. it moved very slowly, as if orbiting the earth. it moved at the exact speed of a sattelite. friends have conjectured that i may have seen the space station. i doubt it greatly.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nmarch 10, 2007\r\nsecond sighting.\r\n barton hills. fixed point of silver light directly above, 1pm, partly cloudy. pointed it out to a lady who was a vollunteer worker on the trails  near campbells hole in the barton creek greenbelt. she told me it was just venus. i told her to look again. she did, and was startled to find that a second stationary point of light, dimmer, had appeared about three degrees south of the first point. she then asked me what i thought they were up to. i told her i didn't know, but that i assumed they wanted us to know they were there. the lights disappearered shortly thereafter.   \r\n \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nmarch 8th, 2007\r\nfirst sighting. 10 am, barton springs pool. mostly clear sky, deep blue. fixed point of silver light. stared at it in wonder for over 20 minutes, then observed second stationary point of light appear very suddenly, directly beside the first. closed eyes, opened left, observed two lights. closed left, opened right. still two. not seeing double. excitement growing. second point disappears, reappers moments later, this time hovering around the first. i lost it, went running down the trail

attention because it was too big and was flashing different colors. it appeared to be motionless.  i watched it for a few minutes in between looking for my wife and looking back inside the building to see what time it was(my wife was late). between about 7:10 and 7:15 the light really caught my attention because it suddenly burst into motion taking off upwards and toward the e.S.E. the light became muted and solid white. it appeared to be moving at a leisurly rate of speed.  at about the time it crossed the highway, it suddenly shifted to a red color. i watched it for a few more seconds, and then i glanced around to see if there was anyone else around that i could get to verify what i was seeing.  everyone else was inside the building, so i looked back up at the object and it was just suddenly gone, like instantly.  i was still waiting on my ride and scanning the sky for another glimpse, when about 5 minutes after the object dissappeared, the sky suddenly filled up with about half a dozen fast moving aircraft. two were flying in loose formation from w to e and there were one or two more under them going e to w.  my impression was that they were searching for the thing i had

noticed it... not moving or flashing or anything. the only thing i noticed was a sort of wavy-ness of the air surrounding the object - that's probably what stuck me most, actually. it resembled kind

disc-like object in the sky.  its shape reminded me of the object featured in the close encounters movie but the one i saw was smaller and it had more red than blue.  it also did not have the height  of the fictitious one in the movie. the object i saw had a top section and a bottom level that was at least twice the diameter of the top section making it more like a two-level birthday cake except with a rounded, curved  sides. it was perhaps a mile away and so big and bright that i thought it was someone's idea of an expensive joke or perhaps some promotional scheme but as far as i could tell, there was no banner or sign anywhere close to it.  the object was entirely lit up like a christmas tree.  there was white, red, blue, yellow, green light and perhaps some other colors but it was not at all garish or tacky looking. i have to say that despite the presence of thousands of lights in so many colors, they all complemented each other and it really was the most marvelous sighting. the object remained stationary in the sky and the lights on it were twinkling, not flashing. my next reaction was to note the time.  i wished very much that i had something to capture the sighting but i had no camera or phone with me.  it was the brightest, most spectacular thing i've ever seen.  i then thought that i was going crazy and had to pinch my arm.  i was not under the influence of anything: all of my life, i've been allergic to cigarette smoke and cannot even drink alcohol or tolerate medication like ibuprofen so there was nothing impacting my visual or mental acuity at the time of the sighting.  then i wished that there was someone else around to corroborate what i was seeing.  i thought for sure that something so big and bright would be seen by many and i felt that maybe someone would have taken a picture of it by that time and i could see it again in a photo and know it was for real.  i wanted to stay in that spot and just observe what might happen next but i had a sick pet waiting for me at home and i needed to give him his medicine.  i remember continuing my drive, hoping that i wasn't making a mistake by leaving.  the whole sighting took only a few minutes (no more than five).  because i was driving away, i lost sight of it very shortly after leaving that spot. i was certain that the newspaper would report it the next day but i found absolutely nothing in the austin american statesman, austin's daily newspaper.\r\n\r\ni really haven't spoken about this incident except to one relative and two friends. i had been concerned about being an object of derision if i were to come out more openly with this information. i just wish i had some photo to prove what i had seen.  i decided to submit this report because in the last year, i've been diagnosed with a serious illness and i don't want this miraculous sighting to just die with me.  i would like to know if someone else has seen it. my profession has been in the fields of marketing research and consulting and i usually believe things when i can substantitate with numbers and fact-based research.  however, i cannot explain the presence of what i saw with empirical research nor will i try to.  there are times when i question the veracity of what i had seen but i do know what i saw.  i consider myself extremely fortunate to have seen it at all.  i only wish that i had been able to share it with someone else.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

not sure) in the southeast sky.  it passes the big star in the southeast about a quarter past it, the moving star just disappeares straight upwards, into the heavens. never to be seen by my eyes again!  very interesting event in my life!  never have i saw anything like that, ever!  i've always wished i would see a ufo in my life time.  do you guys think that's what i saw?
