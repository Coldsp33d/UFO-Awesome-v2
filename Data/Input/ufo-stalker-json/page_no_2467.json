(i don't remember when the show aired or the details)  i only know that the way the commander explained their sighting, it was as if they had seen exactly the same type of light ron and i saw.  it prompted me to call ron, who lives in florida now.  i told ron i wanted to tell him what i remembered and see if it was what he remembered.  he verified that the story pretty much summed it up.\r\n    ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":9504,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.0206274,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02082008-0015","longitude":-83.6838162,"occurred":176050800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":176050800000,"summary":"A very bright object that decended slowly at an angle then shot into space in an instant.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Flint, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:403738"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Waxahachie","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Tuesday, feb. 6th, 2008:  i first noticed bright flashes in the night sky about a mile after getting on to fm 813 traveling from waxahachie to palmer, a 9 mile stretch of fairly winding road.  at first i thought they came from a nearby tower to warn aircraft, but then realized that they were both higher, brighter and moved across the sky in a rhythmic pattern in a 1-one-thousand, 2-one-thousand, 3-one-thousand time frame.  the flashes tended to stay at the same asimuth, about 40-45 degrees up.  flash one was the brightest at 3 o'clock then slightly not as bright at 12 o'clock then less bright at about 9 o'clock.  as i traveled these became more eratic and less rhythmic.  about 3 miles outside of palmer, i caught one flash that bounced right to my left as i looked out the window and my eyes caught an entire rainbow of color.  this was the last flash.  i saw no more that night.  i got home shortly after 10 pm so this happened between 9:30 and 9:50 pm.  i am a scientist, so therefore the flashes were a curiosity to me.

nuclear reactors in the u.S.\r\n  in august of 1970 my friend tom & i spent a few weeks vacationing. days surfing and nights at a camp ground 12 miles due west of ocean city, n.J. \r\n  slightly after midnight, with a very clear sky, we sat outside our tent. a line of large, prop-driven, military cargo planes were passing directly overhead going to the north-east. they flew so low their engine's noise prevented any conversation. with the vietnam war at its height, these flights were common along the coast.\r\n  we heard the 1st plane coming minutes before it was directly overhead and the noise was intense until it moved on. the 2nd plane, which appeared to be a mile behind the 1st was no different. as it passed over and onward there was a flying disc shaped craft directly behind it by about 1/2 mile. \r\n   the disc was as wide as the plane's wings, tip to tip. it didn't wobble, made no sound, and flew in the formation at what appeared to be the same speed as the other planes.  it had a few solid red lights on each edge as if marking the four points of a compass. as it glided off, following the 2nd plane, we saw that its middle was as thick as the cargo plane and tapered toward the edges. no leading edge could be seen nor could we see any markings or windows.  \r\n   in disbelief we were questioning each other as to what we were seeing when our speech was soon overwelmed by the noise of the 3rd cargo plane now passing overhead. adding to our shock was the sight of another identical disc shaped craft tailing 1/2 mile behind it. \r\n   no more disc were seen as the remaining planes, perhaps six in all, continued out of site. \r\n   i've kept this sighting to myself and a few trusted friends for alot of years. i haven't seen any u.F.O.'s since nor has tom.

located about 4 miles north-west of dulles airport and as i walked out to my car i always look at the planes flying over head. i turned back towards the office (i was facing east) and saw a plane flying east away from me. i would say the plane was about 5000 feet up and app. 45 degrees from the horizon.\r\n\r\ntrailing behind the plane was an object. the object was approximately one-third the size of the plane, and following a plane's length behind. the plane might have been a 747 (i think i recall four engines, but on this i am not entirely certain.)\r\n\r\nthe object, which i first mistook for a puff of cloud, followed the planes' heading and velocity. after the half second of thinking it was a cloud, i then thought it was a fighter jet closely tailing the larger plane. my thought after that was, \"no, no fighter jet would trail a commercial jetliner that closely. is the plane dragging something?\"\r\n\r\ni then concentrated on the object, cause at this point i was really puzzled. this needs some set-up. the sun was setting behind me, so the jet that the object was following was lit rather bright from beneath. i could detect no markings or detail on the plane, but it was essentially a large, washed-out white jet shape. the object that was following it was darkish grey in the middle going towards lighter grey at the outside, almost like a cloud. and like a cloud, i believe that the object had indistinct edges. i am doubting myself on this point cause it seems a bit wacky, but i could not really discern a distinct shape to the object...\r\n\r\nthe object followed the jet perfectly the entire 15-20 seconds it was in view. the object did not fall behind, or change its position, behind and slightly to the right of the plane.\r\n\r\ni grabbed my cell phone, opened it, and snapped a picture. i should have taken my time, cause i only got clear blue sky. (yes, i am hating myself right now.)\r\n\r\nthere was a slight shading difference in the center of the object, so it was not a perfect oval or sphere or disk. it seemed to have a hard edge or seam down the middle.\r\n\r\nthe jet started to bank to the north, \"evasive maneuvers\" i thought, \"the plane knows its being tracked.\" and then, i lost the plane and the object behind the roof of my office building. i then ran backwards towards my car, to try and track the plane and object a little further, but i could not get them back into view.\r\n\r\nas i said before, this was literally right above dulles international airport. the air traffic in the area is extremely heavy. i cannot believe that someone else did not witness this event, either from the control tower, from other planes in the air or from elsewhere on the ground.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

overhead. as we were watching the object it slowed to a complete stop. it appeared to us that the object was at about the altitude of a jetliner but was very hard to tell.  anyway as we watched the thing, as i said earlier it made a complete stop. then proceded on after the intitial stop. the object did this three times, and in the process formed a triangle trajectory. in essence the object traveled a straight line, stopped, formed the second border of the triangle then stopped say for 30 seconds at each corner, then completed the triangular trajectory, which was straight overhead.The area covered was probably about the size of a basketball if outstretched at arms length. it did this complete manuever twice, then proceeded in a northwesterly direction at a fairly slow rate of speed

trail of any kind).The object's color was white,not blinking or flashing or giving of a coronna of any kind.The object was about as bright as venus.As the object climbed higher it accelerated more than it was when i first observed it,at about a 70%angle in relation to me i noticed a second object,identical to the first in every charactoristic follow the same path and trjectory of the first.Both objects were far away because they initiated from my apparent horizon.The first object sped up much faster at this point,faster than anyjet i ever saw and continued to accellerate skyward straight up from the 70% angle it was before and then the was a bright flash and my first impression was that it went into earth orbit because it turned n,ne and continued in that direction eventually heading east(from my 12 oclock to my 3 oclock position in an arc.The incredible thing about this was the objects speed after the flash,i observed one of the space shuttles in orbit a few years before and this object was travelling at least three times the observed orbital speed of the space shuttle i had observed before,putting this object's velocity in the 50,000mph range.At this point the second

playing golf down the road in indio at landmark golf club (now called terra lago).  we were playing the north course. we had hit our tee shots and were waiting for the group ahead to finish so we could go for the green.  i was in the fairway and my friend was off to the right about 30yds.\r\n\r\ni am a licensed private pilot as well as being a surgeon who is interested in the constellations and i'm always looking for things in the sky.  i know what routes commercial planes take out of la toward julian vor etc.  i know what a satellite looks like and the path they usually take.  while waiting i just looked up and there it was, i just looked right at it.  near as i could tell it looked spherical, it was light gray in color and it appeared judging from passing planes to be well above the 32plus thousand feet the commercial planes were at.  it had to be about 50-60 thousand or higher.  it appeared stationary and i watched it for about one minute and it did not appear to move.  it was a little north of me in direction.  then it did move at acute angles 45 degrees, 90 degrees etc, and i watched it for a few seconds doing that.  as soon as i saw it i knew it was a ufo.  \r\n\r\ni then called my friend over so he could verify i wasn't seeing things.  he saw it right away after i pointed it out.  together we saw it for another three minutes or so and we verified to each other its movements.  we hit up on the green and i tried again to find it but could not.\r\n\r\nnow one of the only things it could have been i suppose is a weather balloon.  at that altitude the wind could have appeared to move it acutely.  however,i am not aware of any regular weather balloon launches here in the valley.  i discount this because of the angles it took and because it was such a clear day what a waste a balloon would have been.  sorry i don't have any photos.  i was at 29 palms marine air ground combat center for four years as a civilian physician and during that time was not aware of regular weather balloon launching.  also, as you are aware, nellis air force base is just north of vegas as is area 51.  at the height it was you could probably see that far without difficulty.\r\n\r\nthis was really cool and i just wanted them to know that if it wasn't a balloon than someone saw the technology because there are those of us who look up and who understand what certain things look like and that they just can't hide it forever.  i would be disappointed if it was a balloon.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

+90 degrees) while facing due south when a small object, a bright white dot about the size of a ballpoint pen's head at arms length, came into my view traveling from the northeast towards the southeast. my immediate thought was that this was a satelite but as i watched it pass overhead the object's course began to slightly curve to the west-southwest. the object was moving at a very high rate of speed, taking about 4 seconds to travel from exactly overhead to an azimuth of about +40 degrees when i lost sight of it behind a tree. there was no contrail produced by the object, nor was there any sound. about 2 seconds into its passage the direction changed slightly but was noticeable (making an estimate, if the original course was 225 degrees it would be heading about 240 when i lost sight of it).\r\n\r\ni have watched multiple planes fly over since, all leave a very obvious contrails. also, i have counted how long it takes for a plane to cover the apporximate distance that i saw the object travel and have averaged about 45 seconds. i have had time to walk from my front porch to my truck, about 20 feet total, open a locked door, take my binoculars out and sight in on the aircraft and verify that it is a airliner in that time span. \r\n\r\ni knew the moment that i saw this object it was not a military aircraft, i have seen in flight the following: f-106, f-4, f-5/t-38, f-15, f-16, f-14, f/a-18, and am reasonably sure i saw an f-22. as an avid bird watcher with over 225 positive species i have seen high flying birds visable only with binoculars, these are clearly identifiable as birds you just can't tell the species. i am also a backyard astronomy buff and have seen satelites/space station/space shuttle pass overhead when they are visable but in all cases these have originated in the west side of the compass and headed in a straight line to the east, the ne to se course is what really made me wonder what i was seeing. the very high rate of speed was the second thing that confused me, the only things i have seen travel that fast are meteors but again there was no contrail and i have never seen a meteor travel essentially half way across the visable sky or change direction.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

1976 at approximately 10 pm because i remember the moon phase (full) and the approximate position in the sky. it was either a friday or saturday evening.\r\n\r\ni was 11 years old, about to turn 12. my eyeglass prescription had recently been renewed, so my eyesight was excellent. at the time, i was an aviation enthusiast. even at age 11, i would consider myself a competent observer. we lived near the flight path of hartsfield-atlanta airport, so i was exposed to many different viewings of civilian aircraft both in day and night conditions.\r\n\r\nthe sky was fully dark, except for the full moon over the southwestern horizon. there were no clouds. my grandmother and i were sitting on her porch at their home in lovejoy, georgia (south of atlanta). we were just talking about things in general, and watching light aircraft from a local airport, the now-demolished south expressway airport, travel on a standard flightpath from north to south (i always presumed from the atlanta airspace to the macon-warner robbins air hubs). as the aircraft flew past, they were close enough that we could hear their reciprocating engines and easily spot their headlights and navigation lights. the flight path would have been between the i-75 and us hwy 41 corridors as they moved south from the greater atlanta, ga area.\r\n\r\nafter viewing the civilian traffic for a while, i spotted the object i am reporting emerge from behind the roof of my grandmother's abode. it was a solid, white, luminescent oval. it was not a reflection of moonlight or other light source. i immediately noted that it was a solid light, not a combination of lights as would be expected from a normal light aircraft. i also noticed that the object emitted no discernible sound.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was following the same flight path as the civilian aircraft we had been observing, and it was traveling at the same speed (possibly trying to be inconspicuous?).\r\n\r\ni remember pointing at it and saying, \"granny, that's a ufo.\" it was obvious that it wasn't anything i had ever seen before. a moment after i pointed the object out, it proceeded to defy the known laws of physics. from my perspective, it seemed to vanish, and then instantaneously reappear about 3 degrees above and to the south of its previous position. it then immediately vanished again and reappeared on the same flight path and maintained its previous speed (i have always assumed that it was just moving so fast that my eyes could not catch it as it \"zig-zagged\", and i only saw it at one point in it's \"jump\"). needless to say, my young heart jumped when i saw the maneuver. i asked my grandmother if she saw it do that, and she replied that she had, so i knew it wasn't just a trick of my own eyes.\r\n\r\nas the ufo continued on its course, it was about to pass behind a cedar tree that was planted in my grandmother's front yard. i told her to keep an eye on it, and i jumped off the porch. i lost sight of the object as it moved behind the tree. i circled around the north side of the tree, but when i reached the other side, the ufo was gone. i asked my grandmother if she saw what happened, and she said that the ufo had emerged from behind the tree, and then suddenly shot off like a tracer bullet (she pointed in the direction of the full moon).\r\n\r\nthroughout the encounter, there was no sound whatsoever. notably, throughout sub-sonic to apparent super-(perhaps hyper-)sonic maneuvers, there was no sonic boom.\r\n\r\nconclusions/important facts/observations:\r\n\r\n- whatever the object was, it was able to instaneously accelerate to absurd speeds and decelerate/change course with no noticible necessity to obey newtonian laws concerning inertia.\r\n- it was luminescent, and a constant brightness. the outline (oval, as pharmaceutical-capsule-shaped) of the object was clear and sharp.\r\n- it made no discernible noise whatever (there was a housecat sitting on the bench with us, and it had no reaction whatever to the ufo).\r\n- it was following a civilian aircraft flight path (as a side note, where the flight path passed over there is today a county jail. this is how i calculated the approximate distance).\r\n- when my grandmother and i, ground-based observers, spotted it and reacted to its presence, it reacted as well (no way of knowing if there was a causal relationship there, could just be coincidence).\r\n- distance would have been probably about 2000 feet (less than a mile, but more than 1000 feet based on the size of the civilian aircraft we were previously observing).\r\n- the ufo was about the same size as a civilian, single-engined light aircraft.\r\n- my grandmother, the co-witness, has since passed on.\r\n\r\nthank you for giving us the venue to post this event for others to compare similarities. my perspective on the universe and our place in it has never been the same since this event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
