had gone home to paint my garage floor during lunch. after talking to my wife she went outside to play with my 2 yr old son. within a few minutes she called me and i went outside to investigate. she pointed to an object in the sky. i looked up and saw what appeared to be a well defined globular object of a whitish color with a brightish tinge of bluish purple. at first i thought it must be a high altitude balloon or maybe a satellite. it appeared very distant but sizable and at first appeared to be hardly moving. its relative position was away from the sun with a clear sky and thus could be clearly seen almost directly east to ne.\r\n\r\nat this point i ran back inside for a camera and took a picture using my personal phone camera. the object was strange enough to warrant further observation.\r\n\r\nat this point i thought i���d better get it on tape, so i scrambled to find the camcorder, at this point hoping i would be quick enough to catch it when i got back.\r\n\r\nno issue the object had planned to stick around!\r\n\r\ni began taking footage with my camcorder, and notice that other similar objects also show up on the camcorder screen besides the one that was visible with the naked eye and would appear to go from a globe shape to a diamond shape (probably artifacts i thought).\r\nat this point i wanted to know what it was so i grabbed my meade telescope. the object still stuck around, now at a position almost directly overhead but appeared to be far far away. my first observation when my telescope was focused on the object was that of what appeared to be a perfect sphere with a bluish purplish hue with what appeared to be perforations or little dots (imagine drawing a circle on paper and filling out the circle with dots). as far as i know this could have been a planet. however the telescope was removed from looking at the object and refocused several times from different positions in our backyard with the same result. \r\nwe thought, well, strange object and stopped recording, since we already had it on tape and it didn���t do anything new; but continued using the telescope.\r\nthe object then transitioned to the sse within the next 10 minutes, but now at a faster rate than it was moving previously.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwhile i was looking at the object through the telescope, i saw a bright green flash in the scope and my wife yelled that the object had separated into two, what appeared to be identical objects. when i looked up from the scope, i saw now two, what appeared to be two almost identical objects moving in unison with each other.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmy wife mentioned that during the separation there appeared to some kind of smoke trail and a long cylindrical object that fell earthwards in a wobbly pattern during the separation (i hope someone finds it, whatever it was).\r\n \r\nwhen observed again in the telescope, the initial bluish purple hue, object was still there, but now seemed to have a smaller black object in front that obscured a portion of the purplish bluish sphere. \r\n\r\n \r\nthe objects then appeared to transition together at a lower level across the sse to eastern horizon and now appeared even more distant and was no longer visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\ni am sure there is some logical explanation. one is that it may have been a weather balloon test; not to mention atmospheric turbulence and tricky sunlight.\r\n\r\ntimes we saw the objects clearly visible: 11:35 am mountain time to 12:50 pm mountain time.\r\n\r\nwish i had camera attachment on my telescope, this was the most amazing!\r\n\r\ni have regular camera pics and over 13 minutes of video.\r\n\r\nbelow are some stills from the captured video. video is too large to upload and is .Asp format and requires samsung dvc media to view.\r\n\r\nother pictures from other cameras as well but here a few available ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n

(ventura co.) by ventura rd. and w.Gonzales  rd. mothers day weekend in 1995. my friend steve and i stepped outside in the evening (10 pm) to smoke a cigarette when i thought i saw out if the northeast a white barn owl swoop from the top of our curb side tree...But it disappeared in the black sky??? puzzled and starring at the spot i saw no stars. as my eyes adjusted more to the crystal clear night sky the blank area grew in size till it filled a yard width chunk of sky? then a faint outline could be seen of this now to close (it made me reflectively duck) huge, slow moving silent boomerang shaped object. it now could be seen clearly with the stars twinkling all around it. the rear serrated edges (visually 2 inches) of this flying wing (b-2 bomber) were shaded in a lighter grayish color like cooling space shuttle tiles would look. it seemed to be moving 5 to 10 mph at 1000 ft. above the ground, heading southwest towards the ocean and the channel islands off shore. it filled the sky before us silently moving. we watched it for 5 mins. even climbing up on our second story roof top as it flew over us then over the strawberry and corn fields towards the sea. when we lost sight i immediately called pt. mugu air station knowing that it was the nearest operating radar station within 50 mile.Because i'm an ex air force air traffic radar controller once stationed 100 mile north at vandenberg afb lompoc, cal. they had seen no such contact on the radar screens. in after thought the owl i thought i saw was one of 3 advertising search light at a nearby car dealership 2 miles away and what i saw was the light hitting the curved surface (lower fuselage) under the left wing. we both went into the house and drew what we each saw without comments then compared them and i swear it looked like the b-2 bomber!!! i think it had been retrofitted with some type of alien technology to move silently and slow. also if you draw a reverse flight path from the channel islands ..Oxnard..Simi valley back you would end up at palmdale, ca and  edwards afb and if continued area 51 in nevada!","distance":"20 Feet or

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i took the dog out, i frequently look at the stars.  while in the front yard of our rural home, i noticed a very bright star at about 135 degrees (southeast) and about 20 degrees above the horizon.  sorry, my compass is malfunctioning, so my directions are approximate.  as an engineer, i'm fairly good at angles.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a star, until i saw the color changes.  then i thought it might be an aircraft with landing lights on, though it was too high in the sky to be approaching any nearby airport.  other aircraft passed in the vicinity of the light during observation, and they were obviously aircraft.\r\n\r\nthe light was slightly larger than the brightest star in the sky at the time.  it changed colors, randomly changing white, blue, and red.  while other stars \"twinkled\" in their usual way, this light was brighter, more colorful, \"flashed\" instead of \"twinkled\" and it moved.  and by \"flashed\" i mean changed colors.  it did not turn on and off.\r\n\r\nthe movement was extremely erratic, sometimes moving slowly, sometimes jumping quickly from one spot to another.  the distance it moved would probably fit into a square inch had i held a ruler up at arm's length.  four people saw it and witnessed the movement and color changes.  the movement often was a sweeping arc, sometimes a straight line.  there was no pattern to the movement.\r\n\r\nafter an hour, the light appears to be moving with the star field.  when i am almost convinced it is a star or planet, it jumps around again.  none of the other stars or constellations exhibit this kind of movement.  i confirmed the object was moving by bracing myself against the house wall and watching as the object danced back and forth behind a tree maybe 200 feet away.  the wind is calm, and the object moved behind the main trunk of the tree (and back again), so i would claim that wind is not a factor.  the movement is also quite apparent in unobstructed sky without reference objects.  i observed the object from several vantage points near our property.  there are no clouds.  temperature is 16f.  winds calm.  no moon.  we are in rural wisconsin, and there are no cities in the direction of the light, so the sky is dark except for stars in that direction.  the two nearby towns cause glowing light in the sky only 5 or 10 degrees above the horizon and are ne and nw of here.\r\n\r\ni don't have a camera sensitive enough to pick up this \"star\" and show its movement.  again, except for the movement and color changes, i would call it a star.\r\n\r\nafter referencing a star chart at skyviewcafe.Com, the light appears to be located close to a line between procyon and sirius and about a quarter of the way from procyon towards sirius.  i cannot place the light on a star chart directly.  it is not moving fast enough to be a satellite, yet seems to be moving with the starfield, so probably is not a geostationary bird.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

it looked as though it was barely going fast enough to stay in the air.  i could see it clearly as it passed almost directly overhead.  the plane appeared to be tilted back on its tail with the nose elevated and the engines sounded like they were running at an increased power level in order to maintain altitude.  it didn't look as though it was more than 800 to 1000 ft. off the ground, maybe even lower.  i remember watching it slowly continue north bound and remember looking at the rear engines and the roar from them, i could see the bright blue flame shooting from the exhaust ports.  i just sat there for a couple of minutes, wondering to myself what that was all about.  then, it came; i was still facing the same direction, south, sitting on my four wheeler.  i could see that against the star filled sky, a large area was beginning to just disappear; the stars were beginning to black out. \r\nin a huge triangular shape, with a point in the lead, the area being blacked out grew larger and larger.  blocking out over two thirds of the sky as it passed almost directly over my head.  i was stunned, to say the least.  although i look back on it now and i wonder why i wasn���t scared, but at the time i had no fear, just amazement and curiosity. \r\n  i could see, as it passed slowly overhead, the trailing edge of the huge triangular shape as the stars began to reappear.  it was so big, blocking out so much of the sky, i kept expecting to hear something, some engine sound, something, but it was totally silent.  from the overall size i knew it had to be close to the ground, it just was not reasonable for an object of that incredible size to be that close to the ground and not make any sort of noise.  not a sound of any kind, just a huge black triangular shaped object, directly overhead, moving very slowly.  no sound and no lights of any kind.  i kept thinking that i should be able to see some kind of engine exhaust, some kind of lights or sound, but nothing.  it then disappeared over the tree tops on the ridge to the north, just like the first jet.  again, i just sat there, thinking about what i had just seen.  i was going over and over it in my mind, i wanted to memorize the entire event.  i had been trained to do that in 20 years of law enforcement and i'm able to remember unusual events in most every detail possible.  then, just as suddenly as the first two objects, there appeared two more military jets, flying side by side.  they both also appeared to be a-10's.  both flying at very low altitude and very slowly, just like the first one.  they were following the exact same heading as the first jet and the black triangle shaped object.  in all three instances it took approximately 30 to 45 seconds for the objects to pass overhead.  i would estimate that the distance covered was approximately one half mile from the time they came into view until they disappeared over the ridge to the north.  \r\ni sat there for several minutes, thinking about what had just happened.  i am positive of the facts as they occurred.  i have no explanation, but there are only a couple of possible scenarios as i see it.  to me, it's obvious that the military jets were an escort, one to lead and two to follow.  were they aware of the large triangular object in the middle, yes of course they were.  i guess the obvious question would be, was the object military or from some other source?  i seriously doubt that it was ours.  it was some sort of collaboration between the military and that other source, what ever or who ever it is.  this was nothing less than an amazing event that i will never forget; i hope this account of military participation will help shed some light on other unexplained sightings similar to this one.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":9463,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5162821,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02062008-0006","longitude":-116.0417983,"occurred":1063436400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1063436400000,"summary":"A huge, totally silent, totally blacked out triangle passed directly overhead at appromimatly 500 ft. being lead and followed by three military airplanes.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":"America/Boise","timeZoneName":"America/Boise","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cascade, Idaho","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:403810"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Oceanside","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This event ocurred during a marine scout sniper training session at a night firing range on camp pendleton.  the date and time is approximate but could be confirmed exactly if government records are kept regarding training.\r\n\r\ni don't remember the size of the class but at least 20-30 people were present during the training session.  marines who were shooting at the targets using star-light scopes began commenting and became excited about a ball of light hovering on the horizon.  i looked through a scope and you could see a bright light moving over the desert at low altitude.  it  went behind a mountain/hill in the background then reappeared through the valley.  the weird thing was when you looked without a scope you could see nothing, just darkness.  through the scope you saw an obvious bright light that was moving.  the distance is unknown but could be determined because the background was a mountain range and the light went around one of the mountains or larger hills beyond the firing range.  at the end the ball of light seemed to stop moving forward, rose higher above the mountains and then streaked up into the night sky at tremendous speed then was gone.  it reminded me of a shooting star in reverse.  again, nothing could be seen with the naked eye.  there was no sound of any kind.\r\n\r\ni recall we had a gunnery sgt. from the phillipines.  he became very excited/upset and told everyone the incident would not be reported and we were not to speak about it.  he did not want to deal with the paper work. \r\n\r\ni have told many family and friends over the years about this incident and just wanted to document it here.  i can be contacted if any further information is required.

remember was i was walking to this wooded bike trail area near my home. as i crossed a little bridge i knelt down on one knee. with two hands on my bent knee i peeked threw some trees and bushes and saw a craft of some type. it was ball shaped no lights and landed under these huge power lines. i never saw the craft from the outside fly. as i looked at the craft an opening opened up and two smaller than me being came out of the craft. the next thing i remember was that i was boarding the craft. as i walked onto the craft the two beings followed me in the craft. the craft was kind of cramped and dark. it was dark but you could see like a neon kind of darkness. i then bent down and asked the being where we are going. they answered me and said they are taking me behind the moon. i then asked why? they said they couldn't be detected on earths radar from there. i said ok then we took off. i looked out of some kind of window type thing and saw us leaving the earth. we passed the moon then made a u-turn type of turn back. this took less than 10 seconds. for some reason i wasn't scared at all. i actually acted like i knew them. the next thing i recall was the only time i was really scared. i woke up again, this time naked in a funnel shaped pool filled with a greenish black gel type liquid. \r\n\r\ni documented my story on youtube.Com/ufoabductee.\r\nplease contact

i came from the woodshed with an armload of wood before bed time at about 1:00 am on a clear fall night with moon shining and snow on the ground. there was no breese blowing. i was walking across my front lawn with the wood when a flash of light caught my eye. in front of me was an object which was all dark and moving at a walking pace or a little faster. there were no lights on it, but the moon was reflecting brightly off of its upper surface. i would estimate it to be about 30 or more feet in length. it was completely silent, not even the sound of moving air. i appeared to be about 100 feet or less from me and about 40 feet above the street. this is a rural area and there are only five houses on this quarter mile long street.\r\n  my first reaction was that it was a flock of canada geese, but i should have heard honking or the sound of their wings, and they would have been moving faster. once i looked it, it immediately picked up speed and sped northward. i turned 90 degrees to my left, and it was moving away directly in front of me. it covered about one third of a mile before i lost sight of it in the night sky, it travelled that distance in about five seconds or less. as it sped away, i could see a very flat object about five times as wide as it was high.The outside edges on each side appeared to dip down slightly.\r\n   i learned a few days later that my neighbour who was working a half mile from my location had seen a silver rectangular object mooving fast far above him on two different days in the daytime. his sightings were a few days before mine.\r\n   as

60 degrees off the horizon. the other a few degrees north of due west. they which at first appeared to be stars but we noticed they were changing the color of their lights.Not much interest at this point. thinking they were planes we kept watching. the more noticeable of the pair was going dim followed by a greater intense brightness, comparable in brightness to stars in the big dipper. followed by dimness, and so forth. it's light was mostly blue and green. the other of the pair was mostly red and orange and also changing brightness. it began getting strange when the red one began moving erratically, in a squarish rising pattern towards the blue one. i figure planes cannot maneuver that quickly and change direction, yet still maintain speed. the blue one continued its dim/bright pattern. at this point i got binoculars. upon closer inspection the blue one was actually shifting between blue/green/red and the red one began moving towards us rapidly. when it was overhead i saw it clearly and it was shaped like a t, and flew overhead without sound, yet probably moving almost the speed of sound, yet compared to its earlier flight pattern i don't feel something like a harrier jet could rise so quickly, change directions and speed rapidly, then pass over without making a sound. it had flown east. after that one left we watched the blue one intently. it began going the opposite

never forgot that evening when my mother and i went for a walk. i didn't take many walks with her so this night seemed unusual already and i felt uneasy. i remember wondering why the neighborhood was so dark; it made the clear night sky seem closer since the stars were brighter but my observations were quickly interrupted when my mother grabbed my hand and pulled me toward the sumner school park, there in my hometown of claremont california. my confusion turned to fear when i saw a hovering black craft. i tried to stop my mom from taking me any further but her hand held on tight. she was very excited. she told me not to be scared. the lights of the park dimmed then flickered out completely. then i noticed three spheres of light dancing in the north-west sky. sometimes they darted, sometimes they hovered in place, one second they seemed very close while the next they seemed miles away. their size would increase or decrease depending on the directions they took. they were beautiful balls of light that would subtly change color. before i knew it, i was standing under the craft, frozen in fear and time. there was no sound... none at all... not from the craft or from the crickets we would usually hear. above me was a huge, triangular craft not unlike the f-117 stealth we have today but this craft didn't have any seams that i could tell, its corners were rounded off while the sides were straight across. it had three large, bright lights... one at each corner of its underside. the ufo just hung there at about the same height of a two-story house but it was so massive and i just a child that my size perception was no doubt off. without warning, sound, or movement of air, the ufo darted straight up then moved slowly to the west. the three spheres met up with it then together they all darted west and then north to the mountains, disappearing into the stars. i had mixed emotions standing there in shock. i don't know how long we were gone but i think it was about 15-20 minutes. our neighborhood had lost its electricity not long after we had left, my father said, and we didn't gain it back for a good 5-10 minutes after we got back home. my father, who worked for jpl at the time, told my mom and i not to repeat our story to anyone so i didn't. i don't even know if my mother remembers our encounter. though my fear went away, i continued to carry feelings of insecurity for a long time and i would have the same, strange, recurring dream, of aliens coming into my room, that still haunts me to this day. i continue to suffer from seizures, as does my father, and i still have eeg brain waves that continue to baffle neurologists. i have a bump behind my ear that doctors can't identify but have told me to leave alone saying if it's not bothering me then why bother with it. i am still searching for answers. i just want the truth whether of this world or not, and i finally  have this opportunity to tell others who might be able to piece the puzzle together.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

the car and started video taping. as i sat watching trying to figure out where the light was coming from i noticed a blue light hovering behind my car. i turned and looked and saw that the light changed its perspective of me every time i moved my head changing my perspective of it. i turned on the car and started driving franticly. i called my friends in vegas and told them of the situation.I also called 911. they had no troopers available in the area. the blue lights followed me to hoover dam. at the homeland security check-point i explained to the agent what was going on. he told me to move on.\r\n  after passing through hoover dam i saw that the cloud with the light in it was on top of the hillside. driving on i reached a town called boulder. stopped at a light i saw that the cloud was on top of the next mountain. i stepped out of my car and while talking to my mother on my cell trying to get the cloud in focus, i noticed that the lights had reappeared behind my car with two small ships. there were what seemed to be beeings in a large window moving around watching me. my camera went dead. i got back in the car drove down to vegas. approaching my exit, 75, my rear passenger side tire blew out. waiting for the police to arrive i noticed that there was a cloud directly above my car. explaining to my mother the situation as it was happening the cloud seemingly was pulsating, waiting for me to exit the car. the police arrived. i changed the tire and went to the venetian hotel. \r\n  when i got into my room, i plugged in my camera and started watching the video. immediatly there were voices that i had not previously experienced. sitting in my room, i felt as if i was not alone. i left the room and went down to the casino. my phone rang, it was a man identifying himself as marty kay with the faa. he wanted to know my story. i asked him how he got my number. he said the police had contacted him. i told the story but would not let him know where i was staying. i went and got my video camera and had it placed in a hotel safe.\r\n  i notified an agent from mufon, a mr. mark easter. he has kept in contact with me ever since. i had notified the local tv stations thinking it would be best if others saw this tape before the government made it or me disappear. i contacted friends and family all suggesting that i not let anyone touch or copy this tape. \r\n  i arrived at my final destination, huntington beach, ca. where a friend lives. the mufon people asked if they could make a copy of the tape. i had them sign a non-disclosure contract. they also took samples of my tire. it is apparent that something had scraped the outside of the tire until it blew. i kept the tire.

was walking home from a friends house, down an empty country road, in northern nsw australia. my location was approximately 1- 2km north east of a small village called the channon. i do not recall the exact date, but it was in the first quarter of 1997, i think in february or march. it was a warm night, id say no earlier than 11.30pm. there where no clouds or moon in the sky, and the full majesty of the milky way was visible.\r\n\r\nas i was walking, two bright green shining lights, which looked a pair of thin green slits, came into view from behind a hill on my left. i stopped walking and stood there watching them. when they first appeared, they looked like 2 green slits, so bright that many rays of green light emanated from them. but as i was watching them, they grew larger, in such a way that it looked two glowing green eyes opening in the dark. they remained stationary for around 20 to 30 seconds, in a position roughly 6 or 7 meters above the hill. from where i was standing, each 'eye' appeared to be around the same size and proportions as a typical flying saucer.\r\n\r\nthen, the glowing green eyes faded out of view, so i resumed my walk down the road. at no point during the observation did i hear any noise.\r\n\r\nthen, a few minutes later, from behind some tree tops to my right, appeared a brilliant white ball of light. the ufo looked like an incredibly bright star, like venus but much bigger and closer. when it first appeared, the moving star was so close, that looked almost as big as the moon. it was moving diagonally upwards and to the left, in a lazy and rough zig-zag path, quite slowly. there was still no noise (neither the green lights or the white light made any noise).\r\n\r\nwhen it reached a point that was higher, and now in front of me, it then began to move at 180 degrees to the left, at around 150km/h. it traveled to the left only for a short distance, perhaps 60m, then it began doing a super-sonic somersault. it was spinning around at such a velocity, that it actually appeared as two objects, and it looked a lot like the astrological symbol for cancer. perhaps the object did split in two? its hard to say really.\r\n\r\nthis cancer symbol had a strange flicker to it. it was like a fluorescent bulb that was not operating correctly, and had began flickering, but accelerated many, many times. it was an irregular flicker, at a very high frequency, so that cancer sign looked like a complete object, but slightly blurred from the flickering. it was like a great medallion in the sky, it was truly an awesome sight to behold.\r\n\r\nit spun and flickered as described, for around seven seconds, and then shot directly upwards. as it gained altitude it looked smaller and smaller, like a big shooting star travel straight up. it reminded me of a rocket, flying up into the sky, except much faster. as it got higher and smaller, it then looked like a star, and the only way to tell it apart from the real stars, was from the fact that it was moving.\r\n\r\nalso, as it was traveled upwards, a beam of light, much like a spot light, came out from the object, pointing straight upwards into the stars above. the stars that feel within the beam of light, seemed to be brighter than the stars around them. in the center of of the beam of light, there was a cluster of stars, which seemed to be brighter than even the other stars in the beam of light. the cluster of stars looked 3d, as if the beam of light was being used to magnify and brighten them. unfortunatley, i am unfamiliar with the constellations, so i am unable to say which cluster of stars was being highlighted.\r\n\r\nwhen it was quite high, the spot light beam switched off, and the star like object stopped moving. it was high enough now that it was the same size as a star, and as soon as at stopped moving, it was camouflaged.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Over 1
