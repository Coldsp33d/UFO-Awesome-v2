area we had always gone to. my grandpa pumped up the lantern lit it and hung it on a tree nub.Grandpa set up one fishing pole and casted it out. while attempting to set up the second pole the lantern went out. i was setting on a make shift saw horse as a stoolto watch to the pole while gramps was telling me a story.Suddenly the lantern went out and i was looking out to the bigger opening of the lake watching the water glistiining for an unknown reason or just because of the clear star filled sky i just ask my grandpa if he had ever seen a ufo. he told me he didnt like to talk about them because every time he did something seemd to happen. soon as he said that the lentern went out and allthe lake frogs and bugs crickets went silent.\r\ni then looked over at gramps trying to pump the lantern and relight it with a brown paper bag strip. but it would not relight up. grandpa said! ummm thats funny i just pumped this lantern up and it should burn for about two hours. then just about 22deg.To my right... and 45deg.From thr ground upward was 2 craft flying diagnalto each other.The front craft had a very bright buleish light at the left front corner. the light was shinning completley to the side and not in the direction the craft was traveling. all the sounds of the lake frogs and bugs went dead silent.I picked up the big flash light to shine it on the craft.\r\n\r\nbut gramps told me not to shine the light. he said we didnt know what it was and it could have been from the military. we where spooked pretty bad. just about the time to two craft went over our heads just above yree top level .. i looked in the direction where the crafts came from and another set of them went over just as the first two had done.We quickly reeled the poles in and grabed the fishing gear. and went on a fast pace home. me and my granddad never talked abut the sighting again as though it never happened. it was like we we was not supposed to remark. i never understood why.\r\n\r\nthen\" my grandmother who is still alive told me that me and grandad where down there under them lights for four hours. but i cant seem to fill in that time frame. because when we got there and granpa lit the lantern the shortly it went out. .. he said thats funny i just pumped that thing up and it should burn for two hours. and i know i was in a room whith my grandpa neather one of us had clothes. both naked. setting on a metal bench but not cold.The room was lit up but no lights. the walls where lights. grandpa looked like he was frozen in a stair dazed looking straight ahead knees togather elbows to his sides and hands in his lap. the tall living  thing was standiing to my right behind what looked like a medical table but the table was extra wide and not so long from head to toe. i was going to lay my head underneath the things coming down above the bed. but the lizerdy looking thing told me to lay the other way. once it touched me .. i was so shocked i went out. like passed out. i woke up. set up .. then stood on my feet.  i then was lead to a dark hall that bent to the right as i walked i came to a box of wiggley blue watery looking light on the floor... the creature thing just looked at it.. like i had the feeling we could just stand and look at it forever or i could step into it. so i did step into the box of blue watery light and .... bingo! every bit of that was over. just wanted to mention.. they dont speak. they comunicate through there face. and you seem to have to know whats being said. as they stare at you. i told it to do what it was needing to do and put us back. i think i have always known what they want from us. im now 45 years old. and that was not the only time this stuff has happend. i have seen the boomerang that you can see thrugh. and what looked like a chevron vee shap and a white candy corn shape craft. and some blinking transporting from one spot to another n the blink of an eye. i have removed a small object from my body dome shaped with a small coil spring like antana looking black indistructibal hair like wire. i have seen the small short cratures in my home just a few years ago... i would be williing to be hipnotized and or what ever means of info providing i could give you.. but you must know i am telling the truth. i am in sound mind.. as crazy as this may sound. you would know by profesionaly testing me. that im telling the truth. give me the chance. to prove this and i'll tell you what they want. \r\n\r\ni know alot of folks laugh at people who has incountered this stuff and thats why i have not come forward before. but\" if you want to know more.. just ask... and if not! then good enough.    the four craft where rectangle reflecting heavy bulky black hot pinkish inside lighting. on an upper area or level. the craft looked flat as to the length an width.No sharp corners. rounded. \r\n             \r\n

frightened so i went inside. then i went and got my camera to get a picture so my parents wouldnt think i was being paranoid or anything like that, but i was to nervous at that point to return outside. so i went to my bedroom and looked out my window and the object was a little ways behind and above the tree level in our front yard. so i took the camera and took 4 pictures. only one of the pictures was even remotely good enough to show to anyone because the object was so far away at this point. but when the object was over the trees while i was viewing it out my window it was not moving and i continued to watch it untill it did. and when it started moving it was gone pretty fast. i'm really not sure why or how i first noticed the object.And as far as emotional or physical reaction to the objects presence, i felt extremely hot and my skin was kinda warm and i felt shakey..... but i am assuming that was adreneline from the initial shock of seeing the object. the bottom of the object appeared smoth and black but not shiny. and in the picture you can see a hump on the top like most typical saucers, but when i saw the object it only appeared like a black hole in the sky. \r\nthe

up in the mountains west of fresno, about 45 miles away. oakhurst sits at an elevation of about 4,000 feet. anyways we were going to a super bowl party at a friends cabin. at the time we left fresno it was overcast and lightly raining, once we got into oakhurst it was partly cloudy. at about 2:30 p.M. we saw a cluster of 3 gold spheres about 300 yards from the hightes ground level. they were stationary but seemed to vibrate violently. like the way things look in a rear view mirror when you have the bass all the way up in your car. i pulled the car off the road onto a sight seeing turn out. my wife was listing to her ipod when i first saw the objects but was soon as frightened as me. we got out of the car and the objects were still vibrating. i dont know if they were vibrating but its the only word i can think of to describe the event. my wife was silent as i began to fumble through my pockets for my cell phone to take a picture. as soon as i pulled my phone out the objects vibration seemed to intensify and then all the sudden vanished. they didnt move out of sight, they just vanished like a romulen \"bird of prey\". we booth stood there for a few minutes longer in hopes of the objects re-appearing but they did not. we both got in the car my wife speechless and i blabbering on about what we just had seen. once we got to my friends cabin i told them what we had seen. my wife seemed cautious to validate what i told them. needless to say i do not drink and my wife drinks very little, we both have perfect vision. i will not speculate on what i saw as being a ufo but it was like nothing i had ever seen in real life or a movie.\r\n\r\nagain there was 3 gold shpere shaped objects, each one were equal in size. my wife and i agreed that they had the circumference of a

half-way between las vegas and santa fe, nm, i suddenly observed a stationary, dome shaped object to my left (south of the highway, and an estimated 700 to 800 yards away), in an area of low cliffs and mesas.  the object stood out, dimly lit, despite the dark night, and a wedge-shaped opening - brighter than the rest of the object -was opening slowly on the front of the dome-shaped object.  it looked very much like an observatory dome which was in the process of opening to allow use of the telescope.  i had driven this route numerous times before, and had never noticed an observatory here before, so was surprised.  by the time this all registered in my mind i was at least a quarter of a mile down the highway, and the object had disappeared from view.  i pulled over to the side of the highway to try to back up and get another look, but traffic coming from behind me, and safety concerns, prevented this.  i was in a hurry to get to santa fe, so drove on.  after checking in to a hotel in santa fe i got out a new mexico map to see if it showed an observatory in the area.  the map showed no observatory anywhere in that area, and also showed no roads in to that area.  i did not pursue it farther at the time, but a couple of weeks later, when i was driving through the area again - this time in daylight - i watched the area where i had seen the object closely as i drove east on interstate hwy 25.  i saw no sign of any buildings located in the appropriate location or area, but did notice that, in what seemed to be the location of my sighting, there was a high-tension power line running from the highway, south through a deep draw and over the mesa beyond.  although i can not swear beyond any doubt that what i saw was not something \"normal\" and explainable, i was left with the impression that i had observed a \"ufo\", and that the proximity of the power line may have some significance.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

current one first because i have times and dates that might be confirmed by someone else.  the other two were a long time ago, but are indented in my mind because i've pondered each incident many many times.  the most current incident took place while flying from seattle to palm springs on alaska air, flight 478l.  the flight left seattle at approx. 3:15pm on oct. 4th 2007.  i was sitting in row 16 at a window seat on the left side of the plane.  we were over a mountain range or higher plateau area, approx. 5:00pm.  down the side of the mountain range and into the desert valley, i was looking down at what i first thought were three large oil or water storage tanks.  i remember saying to myself, wow, those are really large tanks, and, i wonder why they're sitting out in the desert all by themselves.  they were silvery/gray in color, and appeared to be round in shape.  as i continued to stare down on the three objects, they began to move very slowly.  this startled me, and i began to wonder if they were land vehicles, but at the same time, what land vehicle is round, and second, there was no evidence of any roads.  i also questioned myself as to, would i be able to see a land vehicle at the altitude we were at.  two of the objects moved in one direction maintaining the same distance apart as they were when stationary.  the third object moved away from the other two in the opposite direction, again very slowly.  all three objects suddenly stopped moving and remained stationary.  the third object, which had moved in the opposite direction, suddenly moved back towards the other two and went between and past the other two, which remained stationary.  the single object then stopped slightly past the other two.  all three objects were now statinary again.  now i was freaked out to say the least.  unfortunatly the wing of the aircraft now blocked my view and i was unable to observe the objects from then on.\r\n\r\nthe next two sightings i would like to describe took place at separate times.  i don't have dates or even the exact year because i didn't write it down at the time unfortunately.  i think it was 1985-88.  some buddies and myself had made arrangements with a flight company in seattle called bob & pat's fun flights.  they had some kind of connection to a reno gambling casino where they would fly you there and back, a one day trip for free.  the hook was, you had to bring a minimum of $300 in cash, and you had to say and gamble in their establishment only.  if i remember correctly this casino was not in main downtown reno.  it was fairly close to the airport because they bused us in to the casino fairly quickly.  we were scheduled to leave reno around 6-7pm.  a sudden storm had come in and it started snowing around 3-4pm.  this delayed our flight and we didn't leave until around midnight.  in those days i was known as what was called a \"white knuckle\" flyer.  grab the arms of the seat and hang on tight.  at any rate, i couldn't close my eyes or sleep.  since this was a chartered flight, and free no less, it had no ammenities.  i'm not sure, but i think they had maybe two attendants, no food or beverage service and after we took off all of the lights in the plane were turned out.  i don't remember any overhead lighting being on and most, if not all, of the passangers were asleep.  we had been in the air for some time and being the \"white knuckle\" flyer i was, i stared out the window into the darkness trying to pick out any light i could find on the ground.  probably to assure myself we were still in the air and not about to crash.  so here i was, picking out of the darkness little pockets of light that i assumed were little tiny towns tucked away somewhere, watching the light disapear behind us as we flew on.  it seemed to be a long stretch without seeing anything when suddenly a round circle of light appeared on the ground below.  when i say suddenly i mean like turning on a light bulb.  i was staring into the darkness and bang, there's a circle of light like you would see on a performer on stage.  the light was very intense, very bright and the diameter of the circle i guessed to be several hundred feet.  being from seattle i would guess it was as big in diameter as the king dome if not bigger.  now i am trying to determine where the light is coming from.  i can't see anything below us that is projecting the light, like a helicopter.  the area that is being inluminated appears to forested.  the light source is moving very slowly because you can see tree tops moving into the light on one side and disapearing on the other.  i also see a speck of what i think was a farm house and barn.  i don't know what our altitude was at this time, but we could have descended from what would have been normal cruising altitude.  suddenly the light goes out and i am again staring into the dark.  no more than maybe 3-5 seconds the light is back on.  it remained on for the second time for about 5 seconds and with a blink......Off again.  now i,m starting to freak out.  i'm staring out into the dark, back into the aircraft to see if anyone else is awake, back into the dark..........When suddenly three very very tiny lights appear from the top of the window and drop stright down to the center of the window and stop.  i damn near loaded my pants, if you know what i mean.  i'm sure my heart stopped for a moment.  as i stared at the lights, there was no movement and i at this point assumed this object was the source of my circle of light.  i had seen, heard and read about ufo's and alien abductions and was sure at this very moment we were about to be a statistic.  report: aircraft disapears in the mountains between reno and seattle.  the three lights that i am now staring at, the two on outside, appeared to be 1/4\" to 1/2\" apart with the third slightly highter between the two outer lights.  the scale of measurement i'm using is in relation to the scale of the airplane window.  because i'm partially color blind, i think it's refered to as being red/green color deficient, i could'nt tell what the colors of the lights were.  i do know that the two on the outside had a stronger and equal intensity than the one in the middle.  this lead me to later think that possibly the center light was a different color.  so just as i'm now thinking we're about to be swollowed up by a gigantic ufo, the three lights appear to come together as one and then gone.  my deduction on this was that the ufo went away from us at a very high speed, thus the lights appearing to come together were actually going away.  in conclusion to this story, we landed, i went home, i didn't report the sighting or even tell any one the story for some years.  i guess it's the thought of someone looking at you like a nut case and the snickers you get from the skeptics, like you don't really believe that s--t do you?  i listened to the news and read the papers for days after hoping to see or hear of a sighting, but i didn't.  \r\n\r\nthis now leads me to the third and final sighting what occured sometime between 1976-78.  i think it was about this time period because my two children were with me at the time.  i remember they were jumping around in the back of my volkswagon bus.  i had made the back kind of large play pen so the kids wouldn't get bored on long trips we made camping or to other places.  i had taken the second seat and turned it around to face the third seat and then put in a piece of plywood covered it with a big piece of foam mattress.  my two kids, would have been 3-4 and the other 6-7 at the time.  we were in lynnwood, wa. traveling east on 196th, approching the i-5 overpass leading to our home.  it had been a very stormy day with what i perceived as very unusual cloud formations, stormy, rainy, and lightning that didn't appear to hit the ground but light up the clouds at various locations.  it was very strange to me because i have lived in the seattle area my entire life and never had seen this peticular activity before.  it was approximiatly 2-3pm in the afternoon.  as we approched the overpass i saw ahead of me, maybe a 1/2 mile, what appeared to look like a ferris wheel on the horizon.  it was a large circle with lite up spokes extending from the center, to the outside circle, which was lit up the same as the spokes.  the diameter of the circle was approximately 200-300'.  the light or lights were independent of each other, evenly spaced.  i'm not sure of the colors, because as i stated in the other sighting, i have a red/green color deficiency.  they did however appear to have different intensities.  the object turned very slowly, like a ferris wheel would, but also moved in a horzional motion, like a wheel rolling on a horzional surface, again very slowly.  because we were on the overpass, which was higher than anything around us i could see about 3/4 of the object behind the small hillside in front of us.  as we decended down the other side of the over pass, and the road also declined, the hill side in front of the object eventually blocked its view.  i was approximatly a 1/2 mile from the object and spead up to get to the top of the hill and hopefully see what i thought was to be a ufo up close.  again, unfortunately, when i got to the top of the hill the object was no where to be seen.  \r\n\r\nthis concludes my story of three sighting.  i hope they can be used and helpful in your quest for the truth.  \r\n\r\nsincerely, steve\r\n\r\n

(ie, between 11pm - 2am) it was pitch-black, no clouds, no city lights, and only stars! i remember that very well... we were probably an hour away from the any large city (lincoln, omaha).\r\n\r\ni became tired of fishing - dad, myself, and a friend of his were fishing from dad's friend's \"john\" boat - in the middle of the platte, just floating along slowly with the current. i laid down in the john boat and gazed at the sky. i was laying there for no more than a few minutes when i noticed a silver-grey tube in the sky. kind of cigar shaped. it was traveling east-west or vice versa (but was following the platte river). as i focused on it, i immediately noticed that there was a saucer/disk/circle (of different color) on one side of it, like it was escourting it. on the other side and slightly behind it was another disk/saucer/circle that was bright orange. it stayed slightly behind it but seemed to be a rear escourt (i'm using analogy for ease).\r\nas the object passed overhead, there was no noise, no wind, no anything...\r\ni thought it was bugs/birds/planes (the ne air national guard was using rf-4 phantoms at that time and they used to buzz the platte reg. - a very cool offering for kids at that time!)\r\nas i said, i dismissed it as an illusion, bugs, planes, etc...Until i saw it again! it had passed over once and then, as if in orbit or trajectory, passed over us again in the same configuration. that was several minutes later!\r\nthis time i notified my dad and his friend who both saw it. my dad immediately pulled me to him and i could tell he was a little concerned.\r\ni did not feel worried or any fear. actually, i wanted them to land so i could see them.\r\nmy dad's friend tried to tell us that it was either an old gemini capsule reentering the atmosphere or maybe a spent stage 1 from one of the apollo shots. i remember thinking/knowing that was crap since they would have made a sound or crashed! (they were far to big/close not to)\r\ni cannot nor would i suggest any size of what i saw or how fast they were traveling. but, i would guess that what i saw was at least 200 feet from the ground (probably further then that!) but i'm just guessing because the tallest trees we have around that area can be upwards of 150 feet. and i saw the ufo(s) pass to the horizon.\r\n-the best analogy i can give for what i saw that evening/morning was a silver hotdog (very shiny) with a colored disk on one side almost touching it (about midway down the hotdog) and a bright orange disk on the other side but near the 'rear' end of the hotdog and just a little bit further back. in other words the orange one wasn't as close as the first disk. i do not remember the color of the first disk but blue keeps coming to mind (note: it was many years ago and i'm sure that my memory would not be correct so i will not guess i just remember it was not orange or silver!)\r\n\r\nso in closing here is the way it unfolded:\r\n-cloudless summer night.\r\n-i was laying in a boat watching the stars.\r\n-i saw a silver cylinder with two different colored disks pass over head.\r\n-some time later i noticed that it passed over again. (same direction same orientation/configuration)\r\n-i notified my dad who seemed concerned.\r\n-friend thought it was an old gemini/apollo/ or military aircraft.\r\n-never saw it again.\r\n-years later, i ran into a person who described a similar event around the same area!

moving like strobe lights from right to left (what would be clockwise if coming from a sphere rotating in a spherical manner).  these lights followed at the same pace of my vehicle for about a mile and when the roadway turned somewhat sharply to the left the lights passed in front of me still off the road but as i came out of he turn the lights were now on my left (east) side of the road about the same 100 yards or less off the road.  at first i didn't know what it was i thought is it a train.  i couldn't conceive what it was.  i began to think it was a ufo, i slowed down, opened my window to listen but heard nothing, of course, my engine was running so that diminished the sound if there was any.  i drove like that for about a mile or more and the lights stayed with me.  then i started to leave the lights behind as it apparently stopped and i kept driving.  the lights stayed where they had stopped but kept rotating making them appear like strobe lights.  \r\n\r\nfinally, i found a dirt road to pull off to my right (west side of the road) i got out and took three digital photos of what i saw, but they only came out as a faint light in the photo - i was about a 1/3rd of a mile from it when i decided to take the pix, and all i really saw the entire time i watched it were the lights moving similar to strobe light movement.  it occurred to me that the lights i was seeing were actually the result of the spinning of the object.  it was quite large but i could only see the lights because it was a moonless night and it was pitch black in the desolate area of sw colorado.  i eliminated any possible earthly object or phenomenon, ergo, it was a ufo.  i should have investigated further but didn't - i'm an idiot!  it was right there, within reach, not out in the sky.  i'm attaching 3 photos that i took.   all it shows is a light left of the mile marker that is prominent in the pix.  the reflective nature of the mile marker responded to the flash.  i was hoping that even though i could not see the object except for the lights, that maybe some photo expert could determine the object that the lights were coming from.  the distance was about 1/3 mile away from where i photoed it.  it was late and i had a long drive back to palm springs, so i just drove away with the lights still visible in the same place where it stopped.   \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

and was living with my mother and brother. our hotel room had a small balconly that faced the pacific ocean. i remember waking up late at night and walking outside onto the balconey where my brother was already siting in a beach chair facing the ocean, there was no noise and no wind, when i looked down to see the beach there where strang human shaped figures glowing red walking along the beach. the red glow looked like when you take a flashlight and put it against your hand the othere side of your hand glows red. i then noticed a large odd shaped gray/black cube ufo with yellow lights moving very slow between two large hotels that were to the right of our hotel. my brother was awake but dazed. i don't remember anything else about the night but what i did remember of the night stuck with me. a few years later when i was 9 or 10 my brother and i were on a trip with our father it was really late at night and i can't remember what started the conversation but my brother was telling me about what he thought was a very vivid dream. he saw the same thing that i saw but from his prospective in the beach chair on the balconey. he does not remember me standing to his left on the balconey but he does remember the human shaped figures on the beach and the odd cubed shaped ufo slowly moving between the hotels. it really scared me that i was not the only one with the exact memory. i have not seen anything like it since and i am now 23 years old. i believe we both witnessed a ufo and some form of alien life forms. my brother was 11 or 12 years old at the time. i have always wonderd if anyone else has reported a simalure sighting around the same dates and place as we did. i now it was 1991 but i am not sure of the month. i remember the year because hurican andrew hit in feb/1992 and

town for some fast food. i was driving in my car down route 91 heading from putney vermont to brattleboro, the nearest city. i go to college nearby. as i drove i noticed a set of blinking lights at 10 o'clock high in my windshield. at first i assumed they were running lights from a helicopter or a prop driven plane. \r\n     the object remained in my field of view for about a minute and a half when i took notice of it's oddly behaving running lights, they were blinking very rapidly, far faster than any running lights i have ever seen. they were also more numerous, at least eight. my father flew helicopters for the army and i was intent upon getting a pilots license for many years. i am somewhat familiar with running lights.The object moved in a slow circle, never altering its angle or appearance. the lights kept flashing in random colors, reds, greens, blues, and inbetween colors such as orange, purple, yellow, and it simply hung around in the night sky. \r\n     i thought that it may have been something in my car that was flashing, so i waved my hand over the dashboard while i drove. then i shut off my instrument panel, and even briefly killed my headlights, there was enough moonlight for me to navigate briefly without them on. which was a stupid and illegal thing to do, but i wanted to make sure that i saw what i saw.\r\n     the object, whatever it was disappeared behind the tree line as i took a curve. i thought i had lost it, but it reappeared approximately 15 seconds later, circling back overhead. \r\n     i reached brattleboro exit #3 off of route 91 at between two or three minutes of spotting the object, the object never got any closer to my vehicle, either by descending or ascending. nor did it appear to get any closer to my vehilce than when i first noticed it. i pulled off of the exit and ran over the entire event again in my head. \r\n\r\n     as for feelings and emotions, i was confused when i noticed the lights, they didn't seem to match anything i had ever seen. i was curious, but the object never acted in a manner that would make me feel threatened or nervous. i wasn't in awe because at the time i was just a little unsure of what i was seeing. after 4 days, i figured it would be at least appropriate to send in a report.

armada, mi. when,in a corn field we see a disc, dome type thing hovering over a corn field with lights surrounding the bottom of the circular shape thing. we were about 1/4mi from the corn field. the next friday, we decidied to go back to see if we were seeing things. this time, we got out of the car and stood at the edge of the corn field. this is hard write but irealyy don't remember seeing orfeeling my friends around me, but i knew they were there, because i could hear my girlfriend wimpering!!!!! we hung out together for at least an hour, and all of a sudden, this big dome shaped thing slowly came down from the sky.It seemed to be about 6ft. from the corn,and the lights went from fast to slow to faster to really slow and scared the crap out of us, but we couldn't move.  i had no perifial vision or the ability to move. then the next thing i remember is my boyfriend grabbing my hand and running and so was my friends. we got in the car and took off like bats out of hell!! i remember nothing for at least 2 days after that. i don't know how any of us got home or what we did the next day.\r\nto describe what i saw......It was about the size of a baseball diamond. and about 25-30 ft. tall. the lights seemed to be only 5 or 6 ft from the bottom of the thing.  the lights reminded me of xmas lights but very large about a foot in circumference but no real shape. and white!!\r\nand to top it off.....My girlfriends, boyfriends brother and his buddies saw the samw thing at a different time, same location. nobody believed any of us!!!! we know what we saw, we even tried to take my friends parents and they laughed.\r\nthe only reason why i'm telling my story now, is because i just 3 yrs ago started to remember eveything, and my boyfriend back then, is now talking about it in detail. which he never did for 30 some yrs. the more i talk about it, the more i remember.","distance":"101-500
