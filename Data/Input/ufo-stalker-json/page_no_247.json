highway 90 by approximately 10 miles an extremely white light caught my attention. this extremely bright light was at or near at 60 degrees above the horizon, that horizon was a desert ridge with no houses or other structures that stretches east to west north of vertical lake.\r\n\r\nthis light remained stationary in a clear blue sky for the entire thirty minutes i was able to see it. it would diminish in intensity then increase in intensity, vaguely appearing as a vertical. rectangle. when diminished it appeared that the area immediately around the light vibrated...Then the light would again increase in intensity once more.\r\n\r\nwhen it was at full intensity its \"whiteness\" was greater that the whitest of nearby clouds.\r\n\r\nat one point it was obscured by the cloud but with the passage of the small cloud it remained in the original location.\r\n\r\none small plane passed nearby flying west to east at what appeared to be a lower altitude. two commercial jets flying east from the seattle area fly over at what appeared to be a high altitude cruising height.\r\n\r\nthere were various large and small birds during the sighting. \r\n\r\nthis is an area also used for military air training but no military planes were visible during this sighting.\r\n\r\nof note....I could only see the light through my polaroid glasses. \r\n\r\nwhen i removed my glasses i could see the airplanes and the birds and even flying insects but i could not see the light. replacing my glasses allowed me once more to spot the light.\r\n\r\ni spend a lot of time outdoors and i have excellent sight. i watch the sky all the time. \r\n\r\ni was careful to observe fixed items in the near to middle ground that i could use to triangulate the location of the light. and, i can say with reasonable confidence that it did not move in 30 minutes while clouds blew by, planes flew over, birds passed by...\r\n\r\ni took photos and after an extensive search of those photos using a professional photography app [lightroom] i was able to locate against the sky a white point of light however i could not capture the pulsated brightness to dimness of the sighting nor could i see the \"zone\" of wavy lines just around/in front of the light.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":83328,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04242017-0014","longitude":null,"occurred":1492776000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,

bat, and not like a fox bat (which i looked up and saw was the biggest bat). this bat was as tall as my husband who is 6'4 or even bigger. it was solid black with eyes that seem to reflect the moonlight. this bat was blacker than the surrounding night sky and was perfectly silhouetted against the moonlit sky. this bat circled the boat three times in complete silence before heading off towards montrose. it quickly blended into the night sky and was gone in seconds.\r\n\r\nabout five minutes after seeing this bat we saw a bright green object traveling north to south at the horizon. it was not a plane as it was brilliant green and was moving slowly across the horizon. if i had to estimate, it was about 2 miles from our position. \r\n\r\nafter the object was out of sight, we sat there looking around in stunned silence. i began feeling this overwhelming sensation of dread and told my husband that i felt that it was prudent that we get off the water as quickly as possible. i tried to get a picture of the thing as it circled our boat, but all i got was black.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1

downtown atlanta.  i live in a suburban area of metro atlanta.  at this time of the morning, the traffic has slowed down somewhat.  it was a sunny morning.  as i was driving, i gazed upward to the trees then to a small group of clouds of about 45 degrees or slightly higher from the horizon.   that’s when i saw a small stationary object in the sky just below the clouds.  it didn’t appear to be a plane off in the distance.  it had no movement, and its shape and color didn’t fit that of a plane.  it almost shimmered but to more accurately describe it, it looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.  it looked like it was slightly phasing in and out.  the clouds were not obstructing my view.  they were above it.   the phasing was more like coming into focus then softly losing its integrity but not losing its outline.  it continued phasing in/out the entire time i viewed it.  the object didn’t have a solid outline like that of an airplane.  the outline was a somewhat fuzzy but i could still make out the dome shape (walnut-dome like shape with a flattened ring around the center).  the sighting lasted about 7 seconds then the object disappeared.  it didn’t fly off.  it just vanished.  a second later, i drove by some trees that blocked my view .  the road curved slightly back to the east.  i stopped at the intersection waiting for the light to change.  i looked back up to the sky but the sun was more in my line of site at this point, and i could not see as well.  i still had about a 45-minute drive to atlanta.  i continued to look for the object/craft but did not see it again.  at first i was in disbelief that i saw something that i couldn’t explain.  i immediately started taking notes of what i saw.  at each intersection that i stopped, i wrote down a few more notes.  the more i thought of it, i felt some excitement but then i started to think, ‘what else could it be?’  it didn’t have a definite shape or appearance like a drone or a plane.   what really stood out was that the object was phasing or shimmering in and out and not moving in any direction.  the rest of that morning i kept looking at the sky, hoping to see it again and maybe i’d be able to tell what it really was, maybe see something that could explain what i saw.  i was looking for evidence that it was man-made or some explanation and then i could put this to rest and not focus on it any longer.  i’ve not seen it or any other objects since then.
