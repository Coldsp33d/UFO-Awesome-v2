avenues and southwest 1st street in miami, florida.  while tossing the ball against a boarded up window of the duplex second floor across the patio from my home, i looked just a tad west of due north, east of the orange bowl stadium area, east of st. john bosco catholic church, up 13th avenue, and saw what i took for a stationary hovering helicopter's headlight.  i gave it no thought and kept playing tennis ball with my little dog woody.  a few minutes later, i glanced in the same direction and that light was still there, and i thought \"wow, that helicopter (no noise) has sure been sitting still for a long time,\" and went back to playing ball with my dog.  a few minutes later still, i looked again and that light was still there, and i thought\r\n\"what is that?\" so i gave woody the tennis ball and walked toward the north end of the patio-parking driveway, and started staring at the light.\r\nafter a few minutes, it began suddenly to \"heat up\" as if from the inside of it, and rose silently and smoothly straight up into the air.  \r\nnow, i still wasn't thinking ufo, i just kept watching it.  it began to move to the east until it was north-northeast above my home and it looked like a white, round dinnerplate against the dark night sky.\r\nthen abruptly it \"turned off,\"  the light went off, and i remember thinking what the heck??  and then it came back on, this time blue, then went off, and came back on red, went off, came back on blue, went off (i'm not sure how many times it went off and came back on, each time changing from red to blue, still utterly silent, and then it came back on white and stayed on white.  then, and again it looked about the size of a dinner plate, then smaller ones, that looked about the size of a golf-ball by comparison to a dinner plate, emerged from it and lined up one after the other in a straight line and sat there a few seconds.  then abruptly the smaller ones took off in all directions, clear across the sky in all directions, zig zagging without curving at all, and the big light kept putting out smaller ones that lined up one after the other and took off zig zagging clear across the sky.  at this moment is when i thought \"ufo\" and ran shouting into my house and got my dad (and i think my mom and sister came out too), and my grandma (who has since died - in 1994 - etc., and we stood out in the yard and watch the big one silently move around smoothly in the sky, putting out more little ones that took off zigzagging, and this must have lasted at least an hour and a half from when i first saw the light off to my north-northwest.  at some point, i went inside and called the military station (navy i think) in coconut grove and a man answered, and before i could tell him what i was seeing, he said, \"those aren't yoo-foes (((that's how he pronouced ufo's, yoo-foes))), he said, \"the're flares being shot off on key biscayne.\"  and i told him, sir, this is not a flare.  and it didn't come from key biscayne, it had been sitting in place to my north and northwest for a long time, in one place before it started moving\" ((key biscayne was just east of due-south of my location between 12th and 13th avenue and southwest 1st street near downtown miami, in \"little havana\".))\r\nthe man flat-out lied to me.  and when i told him that it came from the north-northwest, he again lyingly said that \"they are flares from key biscayne.\"  what a crock of nonsense.  there was nothing in the sky to my south or southeast before of during the entire event.  this came from the north-northwest and had sat still for about 20 minutes in the air before it ever began to move.\r\nanyway, that is what i remember.  my dad still remembers watching this, and says to this day that it was the weirdest thing he has ever seen in his life.\r\nlet me make clear:  i didn't see anything that looked like a \"space-ship\", no windows, it was a perfectly round white light that changed colors and put out smaller versions of itself that zig-zagged all over the sky without curving at all.\r\nit was a fascinating experience, and it made me know (know, not merely believe) that the ufo phenomenon is real, not imaginary.\r\nbut though it was fascinating, it was very uncanny, and\r\ni truly am not looking forward to ever seeing anything like that again.\r\nthanks for listening & god bless.\r\nd.R.\r\nnorth

high on left, low on right, then change to low on left, high on right, about every half minute. i wacthed this for at least 5 minutes untill it was too small to make out as it moved away from me to

different route than i normally take.  as we were getting off of lougheed highway and taking the slip to winston street, i saw what looked like a bright blueish-white light in the low, eye level skyline.  i thought it was a planet at first, as it wasn't bright enough to be a plane or a helicopter.  but then it started moving towards us.  i slowed the car down and asked my passengers if they saw it too, which of course they did.  the object was approximately 1000ft in the air and was below the cloud line.    it was moving towards us.  we thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but there were no accompanying lights.  as it got closer, almost above us, we noticed that it was grey or silver in colour and had no wings or rotors.  so  we were curious as to how it was flying.  it wasn't moving very fast either, so we clearly saw it and watched it for a couple of minutes before we drove off. another strange thing was that there was no sound emanating from it.   \r\n\r\na day later, one of my other friends saw it and called me, asking me about it as he was watching it in the sky near the same area.  although when he saw it, there was a red blinking light towards the back.  four days after that sighting, he saw it once more, but with no light other than the blue one.  he heard no sounds from it either and with it being so low in the sky, one would expect sound, especially with cloud cover just above it.

denver.  shortly after 4:00 pm (4:15?) a break was called (the program ran from 2pm to 6pm).  many people, including me, went outside.  it was a very nice day, mild (in the 40's), partly sunny, very light breeze.  i just looked at the sky casually, but then i noticed a lot of people were looking and pointing and yelling about something in the sky.  they were all looking north or northwest.  i asked someone to point them out to me; it took me about 30 seconds to notice them for myself.  they appeared to be white.  most people said they looked like spheres (in fact, some said they were perfect spheres) but to me they looked more flattened, like a disc would look; however, i wear glasses and my prescription is 4 years old and i know i don't have 20/20 vision with them anymore.  a few people had cameras or cell phones with cameras and were trying to take pictures.  i saw that one person has already posted their report and included 3 photos.  they do look more rounded in the photos, so it was probably my eyesight that made them look more flattened somehow.  a couple of people thought they were balloons, but i did not think so for 2 reasons.  first, they did not drift together in the same direction like balloons would be if carried by the wind.  they would change direction, go into and out of clouds, and move in opposite directions to one another and stop and hover, then move again.  there were 3 or 4 initially, then only 2, then only 1.  then i went back inside because the program was to resume.  either the other objects took off so fast i couldn't see them, or they disappeared, or went behind a cloud or two.  stan was outside for a few minutes and also saw them but said it was hard to tell whether \"they\" were there for him and the crowd, or whether it was balloons or whatever; he didn't watch them for long and went back inside.  he asked the crowd later how many people saw the objects and a lot of hands went up, probably more people saw them than didn't.  last summer at the ufo watchtower, where stan also was, there was a similar looking sighting--bright white color, very distant and high in the sky.","distance":"Over One

burnt out and i was required to stop my car, walk over to the porch area and toss the paper onto the front door area. as i was walking back to my car, the entire area suddenly became lit up in a bright blue light. i turned around and saw this sphere moving over the roof of the house, maintaining a constant distance from the roof, and emitting a very bright blue light, but making no noise nor any odors. it floated down to about 5 feet above the ground, about 10 feet in front of me. as i watched, i stood motionless and obviously totally amazed. i don't think that i had any thoughts running through my head, i was an observer in the truest sense of the word, simply watching this thing in front of me, hovering above the ground. as soon as my brain kicked in, and i started to think, \" what

kind, unoccupied (it was only as big as a medicine ball, maybe twice the size of a baskerball)and the fact that it maintained a constant distance above the roof, following the roof line, makes me think that it was measuring something, or doing some sort of investigative monitoring. i also beleive that it left the area when it sensed cognizant thought on my part, as if it wanted to remain

me and my friends have become local celebritys at our high school due to an event that has occured in 2005. \r\n  it all started may 29th 2005. around 9 pm ryan williams 8th grdae, keith poloats 8th grade, kyle collins 7th grdae, derick houser 9th grade, a black kid named tim 6th grade, and i 8th grade had been roaming the streets and causing trouble. we had finished fighting some kids we disliked, and got the bright idea to egg the kids house when it got dark. at about 9, we did. i lived in cedar terrace apartment 99 with my father at the time. currently im in 143 with my mother. we had gone back to my back porch, and was chilling out for the night. my back door faced the driveway and parking lot. i was sitting on the steps, tim in a chair, this kid derek was standing, and keith was walking on the curb in the driveway area. \r\n while i was talking to one of them, i was loudly cut off by the sound of keiths voice. as we looked at him, his finger was pointing twords the sky over my roof, and he yelled \"what the fuck is that!\". we all jumped up, as we did, we hear a simualr sound to a burning furnace. as i looked directly above my head, a ginat green and orange fireball fly over my roof, spewing forth shining gold dust like particles. it was so low to the ground, it had skimmed the top on the tree in my backyard. branches came down allright. it continued to travel about another few sconds twords the parking lot, then dissapeared. at this point we were crazy. that was the coolest thing we have ever seen. we ran to the parking lot. the black kid tim statred freaking out and punched keith in the face when he suddenly turned around in front of him. we just laughfed about it. there was this mexican family that lived there at the time that faced the parking lot. they was all out on the back porch tword the parking lot, one guy name chad was smoking a joint. as we made it to the parking lot, was shouted to them \" did u see that! blah blah  a ufo fireball blha blah\". they laughed and thought we were crazy, sarcasticaly remarking, yeah chad saw it! haha. at this point, derek, tim and kyle had gone home. \r\nme keith and ryan went into my house. we called my dad's cell phone, he had been out on a date. being the ufo and alien guy that he is, i couldnt wait to tell him the amazing story. the call didnt go well. i pictured him at a resurant, and his phone rings. he picks it up, and hear three boys screaming into the phone all at once, only making out the words ufo and aliens. that call ended with \" im glading your having fun boys, stay out of trouble\". \r\nat this point, it was about 10 when we decided to do somthing. the parking lot ends and turns into a hill. at the bottom is a huge empty lot, at the end of that is a tree line about 30 feet thick, then a huge feild on the other side. when ever i herd of any ufo storys, they always seemed to take place in feilds. so we decided to grab a flshlight, and check it out! as we aproched the woods, ryan then rufused to enter. we grabbed him and tryed to force him in. he was such a wimp, but finaly we entered the woods about 5 minutes later of fighting with him. keith was first, i was second, ryan last. keith had the light. we made it to the feild. it was extremly dark, no moon or anything. we felt black top, and relized we were standing on this rely old horse track thing. there is a horse farm right by there, must have been why it was there. keith had been tieing his shoes when i noticed somthing standing about 15 feet away. as have goose bumbs as i write this next part. ryan was bickering about how there nothing here and we should leave. thats when i wrabbed keiths wrist with the light in his hand, and directed it to the spot i had noticed a dark figure. man, if im lyin im dying. we shone the light onto the face of a reptile like creature. god its eyes were so big. it was like the same design as a fly has on its eyes, like a window screen. the were cleary oily. greens and purples and oranges mixed in, glisening in the light. the skin was white, very very white. the creature stood about 7 and a half feet tall. this wasnt a rosewell alien, this was a huge muscle bound tall ass thing that could have ripped us apart. its neck was vey long and skinny, showing its esophogus through it. we screamed like girls. the next part is truly terrifying. the creature was standing next to a bush. it was about up to his midsection. he lefted his leg up and stepped over the bush! its ankles were thin and it had long webbed feet! at this point we ran faster then ever. i felt so scared and was just screaming. we reched the trees and then, directly to our right side, stood another one. yes, this all happened, and i would swear my life on it, and ryan and keith would to. we were complelty sobre, and in solem mind. we just kept running, till we reached the lot, then the top at of the hill. i cant explain it, but we stopped right there, we just knew to, we like knew at that point we were safe. we sat there staring into the dark woods for about a half of an hour. when you see somthing that incredable, its like u cant belive it. i said aloud \" that didnt happen, its impossible, its not real\". keith had looking right into my eyes, and right there, the toughest kid in our grade, keith poloats had tears in his eyes and said to me \" you can not denie what just happened. we never told a soul. never. \r\nthe next day we drew up a picture of the thing, and wrote a story about what had happend. ever since, im a complete ufo and extra terrestrial nut. i assure you, im no ufo nerd or geeky kid that gets pushed around at school. we actualy are considered very popular and we get all the girls. this event rely did happen. i tell of it now, because its been leaked out, why not leak it out to some higher authority. ryan began telling evryone last school year. one night a i gota phone call from a girl i had dated, she called to ask me of an event that happend in 05. she said ryan had told her and evryone. my heart froze. \"great, mike grana is gonna be known as the alien freak\". well, to my luck, the exact oppisite happened. our town is so boring and lame, nothing to do but drugs, fight, start bands or have partys, and this crazy story spread like wild fire. evry kid in town ate it up. theres these partys held by a boy whos parents own the apple farm. back on his land, he throws enormous partys with bands and food and bonfires and evrything. \"the alien story\" is a now legendary tale of hiltonknights, told around the bonfires.

\"transformation\". date was some time between 1999-2001 date can be confirmed. i was driving my blue chevy cavalier  on 71 south the fastest way to make the trip. we made it probably more than halfway to columbus it was pitch black out at the time as any body who travels that stretch of 71 south knows it is quite desolate. of course at time of sighting there was no traffic on freeway. it was complete blackness behind us no car headlights could be seen and a semi truck was way way ahead of us i could barley see its tail lights,when all of a sudden i look up thru my front windshield and i point out to my friend jared \"look a shooting star\" the \"shooting star\" was traveling longitugional at a great deal of speed and i was expecting it to just disperse like shooting stars do...But it didnt it kept traveling strait across our forward point of view and going and going for @ least 45 seconds .My foot lifted of the gas a bit as we were watching in disbelief and we slowed way down and watched ,then it started taking the strange directory of a missle changing directions to head twords earth .Jared pointed out it really looked like it was a missle attack, it moved to a 90 degree angle in 3 sharp turns by the 2nd turn this thing splits in two objects and follows just a tiny bit a head of the other following the same trajectory to complete the 90 degree turn strait twords the earth this was all happening about 2 to 3  miles up in the air and at tremendous speeds, when the objects completed the 90 degree turn  about a mile or two up it headed strait tword the ground then about a mile off the ground ,it not really exploded but more like formed into a giant, giant golden (a gold ive never seen before) what i can only explain as a fire ball whith a brilliant white  giant orb in the center, it looked almost angelic in its colors, then we watched as went strait down twords the ground  behind the forest that we were travelling parralel to, to the front right in front of us about a mile back into the woods, now the really strange thing was... we were already in shock, expecting to see a huge explosion as in mushroom cloud huge  i was gripping the steering wheel expecting to make an evasive manuver but......There was nothing no explosion no noise.No lights behind the woods  no fire no vibrations nothing...Nothing but silence and the pitch blackness of central ohio there are no street lights in that section of the highway , so we where really in disbelief when were a second ago bathed in golden light then ther was nothing  but darkness besides my  dim headlights we had slowed from abut 75 mph to about 20 mph we sat there stunned there were no other cars for miles.\r\n\r\nthe duration of the event lasted about 3 to 4 minutes give or take a minute evrything seemed to slow down . i can best describe the distance this thing travelled as \"from the far left view of my wind shield ---all the way across my field of view to the right side of us and the turn occured twords the right side of my field of view and the expansion into the fire ball occured to the farthest right field of veiw from the front windshield we never had to look out the side windows, it all occured right in front and up were we had to almost lean a little forward to see it more clearly. in ohio youll see many shooting stars but in all my time of being in rual areas ive never seen this behavior in \"shotingstars they usually flash in and flashout with in seconds & move more naturally. this thing moved more mechaniclly, as if steered or directed, and it splitting in to two disticnt obejects almost racing twords there destination. \r\n\r\nwe continued our trip to columbus and made it to the party within about 45minutes to an hour we walked around in a bit of a daze telling a couple people of what we seen. but not many,it was kind of draining to be honest. another crazy thing was i met  2 girls there from our area who i ended up really connecting with for a few years. later that summer jared painted a picture of the event  that brought back really crazy feelings as if something deeper had occured. im not sure if any one even belives us . for fear of sounding crazy i rarely speak of it but think about it and actually dream about it often.","distance":"Over One

door. as i walked around the vehicle front to the passenger door i observed through a clearing in the trees across the street a very \"blue\" meteorite falling at a 45 degree angle in the north east horizon on the west range of the sandia mountains. the meteorite left a fairly long trail of blue smaller pieces. i was impressed with the vibrant blue color. i immediately marked my location according to surrounding trees in my view. excitedly i ran into my home to tell my friend and daughter what i had just seen and they followed me back out the front door within 5 seconds. \r\n\r\nwe ran to the middle of the unoccupied street (still daylight/dusk coming on in 10 minutes or so.) we watched the same area for 10 brief seconds. \r\n\r\nstill in the street, my friend said at the same i looked up, \"what's that light?\" looking directly above our heads was a very obvious stationary circular shaped blue/white extremely bright light. the altitude of the \"light\" was unknown. however, looking at approximately the altitude an airplane jet might fly, and below the scattered clouds. \r\n\r\nobserving the unmoving light for about 8-10 seconds the light keeping its circular shape began to shrink, it appeared to dim before our eyes. the light continued to shrink dimming to \"off.\" at this point my friend no longer to see the greyish dot, ran back into the house to get the camera and binoculars. i stayed outside in the street keeping my vision locked onto the \"dimming\" light which then appeared as a tiny pinhead size greyish colored \"dot\" craft barely visible. the grey dot then proceeded to slowly float a thumbs length north east, pause briefly and slowly float another thumb length still in the north east direction. the grey dot disappeared very high into the few high clouds until i lost sight of it. whether the craft actually increased its altitude or actually dimmed its lights from brilliant to dim is incredible. \r\n\r\nthis was my first sighting and i was amazed and thrilled with the experience. watching the light dim, fade, go off, was absolutely incredible. following the path of the pinhead dot as it floated until it was out of sight was a little

at around 8 pm pst. from the corner of my eye i saw an object accelerating away from me to the south. when i saw the object i immediatly clearly did not think it was an airplane,helicopter, or baloon, but something else. the object was a t-shaped object and was rectangular in shape. it seemed to be no bigger than a small house.I had a good view of the back of the object and some view of its top. i estimated that it was several hundred feet in the air. in the back it had what looked like a thruster in the center and a light on either side. there also seemed to be a light on the top of the object as well. the color of the lights/thruster was a bright blue glow. the lights were blinking and they seemed fairly small. it certainly did not sound like an airplane at all and was very quiet. it hovered for 3-5 seconds then accelerated.It was a low frequency rumble as it accelerated. it did not make any erratic motions, it continued to head south at remarkable speed and within 10-15 seconds it was gone from my viewpoint. during the encounter i was in complete amazement and awe. i stood there for the duration and just watched it. after the sighting i rushed into my mother's room and told her that i had just seen an ufo. then i ran downstairs and told my dad. i took a quick shower and i headed outside with my dad. outside in my backyard i heard a low grumbling noise and noticed a object with lights blinking about a mile away(my house over looks a large hill), it seemed close to miramar airforce base. it headed north towards a commercial center northeast of my house. it flew near/ between two tall buildings and seemed to be going in a zig-zag motion and then accelerated northward. finally after about a couple minutes i could not see the object anymore. i heard the same low grumbling noise for some time afterwards.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nthis narrative was based on my memories of my experiences of that night and my report i typed that same night on a ufo

a shinny\r\nsphere about30 degrees in front of my perpendicular  out the side of the plane. it was on the right side and about the same alitude as us.\r\nthis went on for about 10 mins.During this

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On vacation to arizona in february of 2006, i photographed a bird perched on a cactus (or other plant). i am a photographer and as i usually do - i snapped multiple shots of the same object. in this case i took 4 photos. it wasn't until i was back in minnesota looking at the images, that i noticed strange objects off in the distance in frames 2 and 4. the 4 photos are basically the same and were shot only seconds apart from the same exact spot. however the objects are not in the 1st or 3rd frames.\r\n\r\ni have put the 4 images on my web site. first they appear as the image i photographed. in this set you can see the \"trail\" left by the object to the left has a bit of a curve to it as it goes to the left. then i cropped all four images to bring the objects and the area that the objects appears in for a closer examination. in this set i cropped the photos so that the bird and it's perch are visible. in a third set i cropped even more to only view the blue sky area where the object is and isn't. then in a 4th set i am only showing the two photos where the object appears. \r\n\r\nnotice the slight difference between these two photos. the two objects that are almost \"traveling\" in a straight line are a little more off-set in the latter photo.\r\n\r\nas you can see in the time/date stamp under the photos when enlarged (by clicking on the photo) that there is only one second time elapsed between photo number 2 and 3, and again only one second between photos 3 and 4. but what happened to the objects in the 3rd photo?\r\n\r\ntake a look for yourself....  it is a mystery to me.\r\nhttp://www.Candadcamera.Com/gallery?G2_view=core.Showitem&g2_itemid=128134\r\n\r\nthese \"sets\" are not separated - you will have to just figure out the order. however, if you look at the jpg numbers that will help as they are in order: dsc_5854.Jpg,  ...5855..., ...5856..., ...5857...\r\n\r\nthe photos were taken at 2:38 pm on february 19, 2006. we were at (i believe) the saguaro park just to the west of tucson, az.\r\n\r\nthe objects look to me as though they are some sort of craft that is traveling at a high rate of speed and has separated. i am confused when i try to imagine which direction they are traveling because of the sloping \"trail\" to the left and the object to the right looks like a space shuttle entering the atmosphere and traveling to the left. then it becomes more confusing that these objects that appear to be traveling fast are basically at a stand still between the 2nd and 4th frames which is a time span of 2 seconds. it almost appears as though the bird is spitting but where did it go in the 3rd photo? and even something like \"bird spit\" (which i'm not too sure about)would travel some distance in two seconds. are we seeing a different dimension? any ideas?\r\n\r\ni obviously had no reaction or feelings at the time because i didn't know the objects were there. when i saw them, however it brought chills up and down my spine....  memories of weird things that happened around my hometown in sw minnesota around 1965. that is another story for another time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9383,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.2309529,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02012008-0002","longitude":-110.919069,"occurred":1140388680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,
