be my size.  it's head was larger than it's body with large eyes, small arms and what looked to be hands, stuped over slightly.  the most strange part about this figure was that i could see it's

to see this so i turned and ran up the basement stairs into the kitchen where my aunt was and by the time i conveniced her to go down to the garage the figure was gone. and ofcourse she told me not to

evening.  our porch faces the southern skies, and since we live on a dark street, we enjoy watching the stars, listening to crickets and enjoying the evening.  tonight tho, it was unusually quiet.  i did hear neighbors dogs barking, and my dog, a maltese was barking also.  at 9:45, my cat was at the door, wanting to go in, which is unusual for her, since she is a predominantly outdoor cat. at about 9:50pm i kept noticing an object in the sky, with red and white lights, sometimes an orange-like light would blink.  it was about 1/4 the size of a full moon, disc shaped and the lights were arround the entire object.  it was about 10x larger than the brightest biggest star in the sky, and appeared motionless for about 15 minutes.  my husband, who does not believe in ufo's stood in disbelief at what we were seeing, and ran inside to find binoculars.  i continued to watch the object, almost in a trance.  i marked a banister on my porch, to see if the object was moving at all, and after 15 minutes, it seemed to be moving in a south-southeast direction at a very slow pace.  it stopped again for about 5 minutes. i called my neighbor at 9:57pm and she came running over.  she also witnessed this and just kept saying \"that is so weird.\" she watched for about 10 minutes and went home to tell her husband.  my husband came outside, unable to find the binoculars, and saw it was still out there.  he went in to take an incoming phone call.  still watching, i observed a shooting star, just below this object, and for 2 minutes the object seemed to be blinking more.  then it disappeared.\r\n\r\ni was in complete awe of this sighting.  at first i wanted to run inside and watch from inside, but i was almost in a trance, watching, in disbelief.  i knew from the first

stationary for a very long time.  \r\n\r\ni wish i had a camera with a high zoom, so i could have proof of my sighting.  i did send an email to ireport@cnn.Com, but received no response.

returning from work and bringing in some firewood. so i watched it for a good min or so. before deciding it was not any celestial body i was familiar with and seemed too deliberate in it's \"twinkle\". the object was obviously high above the earth and did not appear to be  moving from it's general position. which was not far above the tree line and to the se of my position when first noticed it.\r\n  \r\n  i went and grabbed my astronomical binoculars and returned with it not having appeared to move. i focused on the craft and clearly made out intense bright lights which varied in pattern and color. the colors appeared to be red, green and white. the white light seemed particularly intense. there was a variation in speed of color change and pattern change. as well as varied patterns. though hard to be certain it did appear to be a circle perhaps a sphere? but due to some of the patterns and the manner they appeared it seemed a circle. honestly hard to be sure of a dark shape against a dark sky. \r\n \r\n the lights however were very visible and easy to make out as well as certain patterns. for example a circle of light alone made up of lights appearing to be on the edge of the craft. as well as patterns appearing on what appeared to be the bottom and a mixture of the two. it did seem to move but not in a rotational \"flying\" manner. it seemed to only move across the sky very slow as though stationary. as it was first noticed from the front walk and was followed over the hours to the side and back. \r\n \r\n  there was another witness whom i called out to confirm what i was seeing and followed it off and on for the duration as well. they too used astronomical binoculars and actually were kind of startled. they could make out the lights and the changing of patterns and intensity as well. though never under the impression that it was the iss as i have observed it. we confirmed the iss was not in the area. further when it is it does not exactly linger. likewise with satellites which it could not be for several reasons. nor was it any type of airplane or helicopter. first it was far too high and second i live near an airport. i know what a plane and a chopper in the sky look like. not to mention both actually went by as well in the course of the night and the difference was glaring to say the least.\r\n \r\n  the sighting actually continues as i write this. this is now 1-30-08. it appeared in the same place and followed the same path tonight. i would imagine it could have been there last night too. it was overcast so i

fireworks display we had attended in st. paul, mn.\r\n\r\nas i started down the approach to the bridge which crosses the st. croix river into wi i noticed a bright light just above the bluff on the wi side.\r\ni drove this highway every day, as i worked in st. paul, but had never seen a light that bright there before.\r\n\r\ni nugged my wife and ask her if she had ever seen a light there before and she was as surpised as i was when she then spotted it.\r\n\r\nwe were crossing the bridge now and when we were about 3/4 of the way across the light started to move from its position northeast of us, moving in a southwesterly direction. it was moving in a direction that would take it right over the top of us. by this time i was almost at a dead stop on the bridge.\r\n\r\nas it got close we were able to clearly see that it was a large craft, triangular in shape, not a sharply angled triangle, but rounded on the nose. the size appeared to be about the length of a dc10, and the width about the wingspan of a dc10\r\n\r\nthe lights from the bridge lit up the belly of the craft. it was metalic in color. my wife ask me what all those things on the belly were. instead of a simple smooth surface it had all kinds of structure on the belly, some like barrels, some like piping, and other unknown structure.\r\n\r\nthe craft made absolutely no noise. it was moving at about 10 mph. it was approximately 250-300 feet above us. i feel pretty comfortable with the altitude as that is approximatly the hieght of the bluff it was hovered initially over.\r\n\r\nwe watched it for about 20 seconds. i then took off for a wayside stop on the top of the bluff on the wi side. i pulled into the wayside, took out the binoculars i had with me, and watched the craft continue to travel on a strait line. it did not change altitude. on the rear of the craft i could see two red glows, not like lights. my impression is that they were some sort of propulsion. the did not emit any vapor or other material but appear to be pulsing. the craft just faded away in the dark.\r\n\r\ni would estimate that the total elapsed time from first spotting it to termination at about 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nall five of us saw the object. none of us had ever seen anything before that we thought was a ufo. this object was definately not an aircraft, not a blimp or ballon, or any kind of glider.\r\n\r\ni guess we all had a sense of bewelderment, knowing we had seen something that no of us could expain, yet knowing full well that we did see it and that it was real.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9361,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.9837996,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01302008-0012","longitude":-92.7523403,"occurred":520844400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":520844400000,"summary":"Ufo

movie, i noticed a blimp like shape in the sky.  thinking it was an advertisement from the blimp from the old albertsons store (park and n.W. highway), we drove to check it out thinking how cool it was that is was all lit up.  once we got to that location, there was no blimp to be found.  however, the blimp like object was still visible.  it appeared to have very bright lights all around it and lights going through the center.  i remember them being more green neon color in the center and white everywhere else. it pretty much stayed in the same location while we were looking at it.   i kept trying to figure out if it said something. never could figure it out. it was so large that i thought that some place locally  was advertising. we  were only there for maybe 5 minutes. not putting much more thought into it, my husband and i went off to see our movie which started at 7:05 pm.  it took us about 20-25 minutes to get to the movies. so i would say that we saw the blimp like object around 6:40 pm.\r\n\r\nthe next day we  heard about the ufo sighting in stephenville and realized that what we saw must have been the ufo.  the lights were too bright for it to be an airplane of any kind.  we looked stephenville up on the map and sure enough it was that exact direction that we were looking when we saw the blimp like object the night before. it's to coincidental that we saw something within the same time and same direction that the residents of stephenville did.  a ufo never even entered our minds at the time.  but, i am a firm believer that what we saw was the same thing that was seen in stephenville 100 miles away.\r\n\r\ni used to not think anything about ufo's.  i really didn't believe in them.  now after that experience on january 8th, 2008 i am a believer that there are ufo's.  not necessarily extra-terrestrial, but something.\r\n\r\nglenn\r\ni confirm everything that carolyn said above and i wanted to add that i was driving and did not get to look at the object the entire time. i did get a good look at it when we arrived at the albertsons parking lot. we live by dfw airport and are very used to seeing aircraft of all kinds (every 5 mins or so). i was a redeye gunner while in the u.S. army and received aircraft recognition training. this was in no way any aircraft i have ever seen. the entire time i saw the object it did not move, completely stationary.\r\ni have included a photoshop drawing of what we both agree we

bigger than the jets.  the jets lights in the sky are about half the size of a pencil eraser, this thing was the size of a big pink school eraser.  it was quiet the only thing you could hear was all the jets zooming around this object.  it turned south and then all that you could see is 4 lights, two at each end of the object.  the center was dark.  it slowly moved south, and i lost sight of it because of my neighbors truck.  i had called my husband and daughter out, he saw the object and my daughter saw it after it turned.  most of the jets followed the object, but i watched 2 jets circle
