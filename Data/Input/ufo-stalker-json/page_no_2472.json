had a small area of sight from my front room and parking area that i know was over the anchorage international airport because i lived there for 7 years (that address - 30 yrs total in ak) and i know the flight pattern over the airport, the whole town knows the flight pattern. anyway, it was evening, must have been between 5 and 7 pm  \r\nand it was dark so it was winter time. i had been home a short time from work when i looked out my window and saw something odd looking. it was fairly high in the air and appeared to be orangeish color with some red and seemed to be very hot, i went outside to get a better view, my brother was with me during all this and i pointed it out to him and he couldn't figure what it was but we both watched this thing and as we watched, it seemed to be like a hot molten or burning object, i say this because that is how it acted and while watching this it \"dripped\" off a piece from the bottom which seemed to drop or drip like something very hot - like hot metal would burn or boil and drip \"molten like\" all this time i am thinking \"my god, i hope that's not a small plane burning in the air\" (i mention this because next to the int'l ariport is lake hood, a busy small plane and floatplane base) i was waiting for the thing to just drop out of the sky but during this whole time it stayed in one place. it didn't fall, or move up or down or explode, it didn't move right or left - it just stayed where it was. the part that dripped off didn't drop far before dissapearing, with-in approx 4 to 6 min the whole thing just \"dissapeared\"!. i was so sure that something was happening that i was sure i would see it on the news, or a special report coming on tv. i was so sure that i called everyone i could think of, the local news stations, the radio stations, the police department, the faa, and i called the tower at the airport! no one saw anything!. i described what i saw and it seems that only myself and my brother and my landlady saw it. she has passed. i don't remember the exact date - but i rememeber exactly what i saw. just wanted to pass this on - have you ever had a similar report?Would appreciate your reply. thank you for your

( i did this to make sure it was not one of those stars, cause it was burning as bright as one )when that was all done, i directed their attention eastward and asked them what they saw. at first the answer was a distant plane. then i told them to look again. it was not a plane. we observed every star that night in the cold atmosphere and they all displayed the same characteristics. blue hue, with a white star. this one was different. it was out there all by itself. at times it would fade out almost to nothing, then come back more intense than ever. at a point, we could not tell if our eyes were playing tricks on us, but 2 of us thought we saw at the same time something faint fly around the object in a circular motion. i called a friend who lives on the other side of town, and told him to do the same thing i did to everyone else, and the then tell me what he saw to the left of the moon.  he told me he saw 2 objects that looked like stars almost on top of each other. we know he had the right star, but we could not see that from our vantage point. so since it was freezing cold and we were already outside for 2 hours and the thing got no closer, we went in to see what the net had to say about the nights sky. the only thing on the net was something about a comet hitting mars.\r\n\r\nwell that was saturday. so last night, (monday) we decide to look to the sky. there is nothing in the sky where we saw the object a 2 nights before. so i take a ride down to my buddys house on the other end of town, and as soon as i pull up his street, there it  is. except this time i can see the two lights. we watched it for a minute and then drove back to my house to get the telescope. when we got to my house there was nothing in the sky. can anyone tell me what was suppost to be in the in the eastern hemisphere over the weekend, parallel to the moon to the left, glowing unlike any star in the sky?\r\n\r\nthe reason why i am writing this is because i would like to know what was out there, and because i live in a town with no ufo reports ever. ironically friday night, there were 2 calls to the falls police station about a ufo being over an old restruant in the area. how weird is that?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":9340,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2126916,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01292008-0006","longitude":-77.1906847,"occurred":1201420800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,  Oval,  Sphere,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1201420800000,"summary":"To the left of the moon","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/9340_submitter_file1__100_8893.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/9340_submitter_file2__100_8891.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:406786"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Atlanta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A few weeks before the picture was taken i had heard that there was supposed to be a semi eclipse happening that day. around the time that the eclipse was due to happen i had my camera on me so that i could get a picture of this event. i was in the car driving around trying to find the most strategic spot to get a picture but the eclipse never happened. due to this disappointment i began taking pictures of the sky because the colors just looked bright an fluidlike. after taking a few pictures i went home and uploaded the pictures onto my laptop. after uploading i realized that the pictures that i took of the same part of the sky had a spot that looked as if something was there but wasnt.  i can see the shape of some type of ship though when i took the photo all i saw was sky. the photo i uploaded has not been altered in anyways. i do not know what quite to make of the picture that i took but i do believe in a part of me that it is an invisible to the naked eye ship that was coasting through the atmosphere. please contact me if you also see the same ship that i see in the photos because i am very interested in your thoughts on the photo.

cold, slightly windy, and dark. finally a night to relax; i decided to set up my telescope in my back yard. facing south and looking up at the sky, viewing conditions were terrible; a very heavy cloud cover blanket with an over glow of city lights. i figured what the hell, i lit a cigarette, and decided to wait for a cloud break. i just wanted to zoom on to one star, get my fix, and head back into the warmth of my house!  while gazing up (not through the telescope) within the sky something very unusual happened. i observed what looked like an over-sized star. almost directly above my head, at 500 hundred feet up in the sky (?Estimated?)...I said to myself, \"oh wow, what a big star...\" chills went up my spine at that very second, because i realized it was not a star. due to its altitude, brightness, and size. it appeared to be a super star and it quickly, incrementally, gained an incredible amount of brightness, and peaked its brightness. it lit up so bright white i was frozen stiff. and then it simply vanished...I was honestly scared. i am no scientist, just a space gazer, but i know what i witnessed. it's fair to say that a natural weather phenomenon could be excluded as far as an explanation for what i observed. furthermore, the star-like object did not move, it took on an incredible brightening, and did not make any noise at all. it remained in the same position for the duration of no longer than six seconds. i also observed some aircraft in the sky a later that very night, and there can be no comparison at all. it was just so strange that it shocked me, and i could not resolve this occurrence with any rational explanation at the moment, or now. so i ran inside to tell my wife what happened. she didn't seem to take me seriously so, i returned a few minutes later to catch some stars on the telescope. nothing else strange happened that night, but it is definitely worth being documented here. i feel better sharing my experience here.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

currently pursuing a masters in counseling psychology. anything that sounds like a definitive conclusion that i may mention i stress is purely speculative on my part. i'd like to think my background is fairly based in scientific observation.\r\n\r\nthis occurred at 6:25 pm on friday, january 11, 2008. i was in my car in lake charles, la. i had turned off 5th avenue onto prien lake rd., headed east-bound towards the onramp onto interstate 2-10 west (where i was going to merge). there is a fairly short distance between that corner and the onramp, perhaps a half mile. i noticed up to my left something that i hadn't seen before. i assumed it was a tower; lake charles is a fairly large town so it didn't surprise me that i had missed seeing it before. the reason i thought it was a tower was because it appeared almost stationary, and was about the height of a tower top. there was three white lights in a triangular formation, and along the back base was a blinking red light. i thought for sure it was a tower top, yet when i kept trying to locate the actual tower itself, i couldn't see it. it was dark, so i assumed that it was just obscured. then i realized it was moving.\r\n\r\nat that point my onramp was coming up, so instead of pulling over and risk not being able to get a good shot of this thing, i merged onto 2-10 west-bound and grabbed my 5 megapixel digital camera out of my tech bag (i keep my psp, ds, and cam in there when i spend a couple days away from my apartment). the thing was moving slow still, from north to southwest. i took an initial picture with the flash on, which looked like crap because of the glare of my dirty windshield. i turned the flash off and took several more photos. the thing disappeared over the southwest horizon just before i hit the 2-10 bridge of the calcasieu ship channel.\r\n\r\ni wouldn't have given this a second thought if the thing hadn't just *sat* in place while i passed it, and like i said, it seemed somewhat low over the oak park area of lake charles. my camera picked up little more than taillights and darkness, except for one picture. i had to adjust the brightness on it to see anything, but i believe i may have gotten it on the right side of the frame.\r\n\r\ni've been monitoring local media to see if anyone else saw it, but i've heard nothing yet. traffic was fairly busy, too, at that time. i will say this, too: i've been to long island, ny, so i know what real air traffic looks like. we don't get that here, but as soon as this thing was out of sight, lots of planes with blinkblink-pause, blinkblink-pause white running lights started popping up all over. i'm not saying they were chasing anything, just that they were there in stronger numbers than i remember seeing before.\r\n\r\ni've attached the single photo that looks like it might show anything, and boxed out where i think the object is.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ball like object which appeared to be moving slowly passing in and out of the cloud cover to the south.  object was oriented nearly parallel to my direction of travel at an angular elevation of 15 to 25 degrees above the visual horizon directly in front of my vehicle.  this sighting was not particularly extraordinary when compared to a similar sighting i had about 4 1/2 years ago in late september or early october of 2003.  i was traveling the same route home at approximately the same time of day which means it was still daylight rather than dark as it was during this most recent event.  a bit different scenario as several deep orange balls suddenly appeared (in turn) in the sky directly in front of my vehicle at a similar angular elevation.  this time the sky was virtually cloudless and the balls remained visible for the duration of the trip home.  the total number was difficult to ascertain as they would extinguish and a different one would suddenly bloom into view.  i live on an old farm with no close neighbors (approximately 2000 feet on either side none front and rear.  orange balls were plainly visible when i arrived home so i got out a set of binoculars (12x50) and resting my elbows on the hand rails of my steps proceeded to view them at length trough the binoculars.  balls of orange (roughly the color of setting sun) continued to extinguish and bloom.  direction from my farm south/south east.  since it appeared that this was going to be a prolonged visual i decided to call my nearest neighbors from whom i had purchased the farm.  at first they did not see them apparently because they were looking too high in the sky.  when they did the husband stated \"must be something down at drum\".  they were not particularly intrigued by the display and quickly lost interest since they were convince that the objects had something to do with nearby fort drum, ny.  i continued to view the object through my binoculars attempting to observe any effects that would convince me that they were military flares of some sort.  as the evening wore on and the light faded i convinced myself that i was observing some type of military flare because it appeared that there a dark vertical column of perhaps smoke rising from the orange balls.  this dark column appeared to be at most 10% of the diameter of the balls extending upward about 10 diameters of the balls.  interesting i could see no evidence of a parachute above the hovering balls.  individual balls did not noticeably descend however they were randomly staggered in a gaggle vertically and horizontally.  about 2130 having watched them for about 3 hours and convinced they were some sort of goings on at fort drum i abandoned my vigil.  i continued to glance toward them occasionally throughout the evening and about 2300 they were no longer visible.  \r\n\r\nsubsequent to this event i began to rethink some of the events and my concussions. it is about 15 miles to the nearest boundary of fort drum from  my farm.  if these were some sort of training activity the likelihood is that it would not be conducted directly on the border of the base and the public property.  assuming 20 miles to the activity flat earth 20 degree elevation angle the flares would have been approximately 7.25 miles agl (20*tan20).  drum is an army base their flying machines are helicopters i don't think there are any helicopters that can operate at 35000+ feet.  the usaf illumination flares i am familiar with from the 60's and 70's burned with a brilliant white light since they used a magnesium compound as a fuel.  the parachute was an integral portion of the system as it reflected some of the light back toward the ground.  my recollection is they were deployed below 10000 feet (probably below 5000 feet) and they steadily descended unlike the orange balls.  why orange?  ecm flares have no chutes and burn for a relatively short time, additionally they free fall and would normally have horizontal velocity components.  i did a google search for orange flares to no avail.  \r\n\r\ni am a 65 yo retired dod engineer with 10 years active duty usaf about 18 years dod.  have had at least two and more than likely three other probable ufo incidents.  i would be interested if any military or dod know of any orange flares that would be used by the military and why they would be deploy at such an extreme altitude.  the orange balls appeared to be of a size such that i would estimate it would have taken 3 to 4 of them inline to go from edge to edge of the moon.  my guesstimate is that the largest number of balls in view at any one time was 10 to 12.  episode started with a single ball appearing in front of my windshield as if it had been uncovered; continued with them appearing and disappearing suddenly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":9325,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5050607,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01282008-0015","longitude":-75.273822,"occurred":1201141800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
