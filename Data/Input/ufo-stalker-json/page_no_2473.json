airlines and we were heading to miami. our port of entrance.\r\ni was travelling with my wife, my daughter (4 years old) and my son (20 months old). we were sitting in the right side of the plane. i don't remember well but i think it happened in the sky above massashussets according to the on-board map navigation that has that plane to each passenger seat. just when i wake up from a long  sleep, i check the young kid if he is ok because he was sleeping in the hand of his mother, then later on i look outside trough the window and, for a while i admire the clouds. then i saw a kind point coming very fast. first i tought it was a bird or a plane, but speed with which it was coming left me wonder. suddenly i saw it stop to a distance of about half a km, but the clouds were at its right side and the left side was clear. i remained admiringit for a while. it was that kind of ufo that we have seen in documentary then i tried to wake up my wife because she was sleeping. when she wake up i tried to show it to her but it was not there anymore. i tried to explain to her what i've seen, but she could not understand what is really an ufo (ovni in french).\r\nit did not impressed me to much because i was thinking that it was american made aircraft copying ufo. but what happened later on is what made me wonder all the time what i've seen in the sky of massachussets:\r\n\r\ni cannot remember the date but i think it one week or ten days after my arrival in las vegas, one congolese had shown to me an african market where i could get some food imported from africa. the market was situated on west charleston, and i was in the rtnc bus sitting with a certain man. he was tall and not fat. he asked me if i was which part in africa and when i've arrived in las vegas. i explained to him. he was talking to me in english while my mind was somewhere else. so, he was a kind of talkative and, to discourage him talking to me, i was answering whatever he said with a hmmm! all the time then speak to me surprisingly asking me if i saw it then i realize that he notice that i was not paying attention to what he was telling me. i asked him what does he want, then he asked if i didn't see an ufo when i was un the plane. i ask him what is an ufo, he explained to me it is. then he asked me again if i've seen it. i told him no. then i started thinking why he was talking to me wearing sun glasses, then he did like he read my mind. he took off he sun glasses and look at me and repeat the same question asking if i've seen the ufo. i said no but with the feeling of fear because he was black and his eyes were like pure white and ovale without the black color that we usually have (really very strange). he told me that he doesn't understand that i didn't se it and many people report seeing it in the sky. i fell unconfortable to sit with him but by chance the bus reached my stage of exit (charleston & mayland pkwy). \r\n\r\nback home i explained to my wife what happened, but i'm still wondering how he knew that i've seen it because i didn't tell anybody about it.\r\nwhat i've seen in the sky was for me just a kind of american super power man made aircraft. if it so, please, let me know.\r\n\r\ncontact me any time you want but please, i want to be anonymous","distance":"501 Feet - 1

were going north on the 57 freeway towards brea, and the traffic started to slow down significantly. i looked ahead, and then a big light (close to the apparent size of the moon) appeared high up in the sky. it looked as though it had a trail of sparks behind it, and it was very slow in its descent.\r\n\r\nthen, it went out, but another one appeared, just like the first. it seemed to veer off to the right, in a twirling motion. it went out again, and there was a pause, for about 3-5 seconds during which i couldn't see any. then two more appeared, and a third, and they continued to do the same things. one went out, and another two appeared. at this time there were about four or five in the sky at once, all doing the exact same things, except at progressively lower heights. as they got lower, the impression that they were trailing sparks became much more distinct.\r\n\r\ntowards the end of (what i saw of) the event, there was one which seemed to be very close to the ground - not so close as i would think it a few feet from the ground, but close enough that i grew the genuine concern that it might hit our car, or hit the freeway close enough to cause a crash that would cause damage to us as a result.\r\n\r\nhowever, this, too, disappeared from sight, as though it had burnt out and lost its light.\r\n\r\nat first, i thought it was pieces of a satellite, as the trails of sparks that gave them their fiery looks seemed to suggest, and it's far too slow to be a meteor, at least any meteor i've seen. i would think that such a case would involve the objects falling faster, though, so i do have some questions surrounding this idea.\r\n\r\ni felt pretty neutral beforehand, and was pretty shaken up during it, mostly relieved afterward that it hadn't caused us harm, whatever it was. i still don't know, don't think this is an extraterrestrial-controlled thing, but it is certainly very unusual (first thing i've seen like it, compared to any ufos, stars, planets, meteors, satellites that i have seen), and i wouldn't rule this possibility out, particularly as i lack a better explanation as of this point.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

little ways out on a mesa where you could see up over them. it was fall 2001, approximately 4:00pm, the sun was low in the sky, less than an hour from droping behind the mountains. i was driving due west when i noticed something in the sky hovering over the foothills through some tree branches. at first i did not pay it any attention, but as i continued to drive i noticed it was extremely out of place just as my friend in the car noticed it as well. it was so akward and strange that i pulled my truck over and we climbed on top with a pair of binocular i always carried with me (not a camera unfortunately). the object was of an elongated teardrop shape, with the tapered end (spike) pointing into the sky, this protrusion was slightly curved to the right from our angle, as well it had two smaller, inwardly curved spikes proturding from the top of the main section of the objet, directly on either side of the larger spike. it was dirt brown, and i could see the sun reflecting off the bottom, so it was obviously a solid object. given the distance and how large it still looked, i would say it was between 40 to 100 feet tall, but that is a very rough estimate, it was fairly large though. the other witness and i took turns looking at it through my binoculars for about four minutes, it looked smooth to me, i could not discern and feature on its surface. it hovered motionless for this time then began to move slowly north and west for a short distace, at this time my friend and i gave eachother a very startled look, but when we glaced back, it was gone, i really wish i had not looked away. this was not some fleeting glance of a strage light in the night, we saw a solid, very oddly shaped craft of some sort hovering motionless in broad daylight through binoculars. i don't

patterns over northern san antonio. i began noticing a strong light in the evening hours which i dismissed for venus. somedays it was visible in the same area of sky and the next it was not. i am a religious person and would pray outside a prayer that i do not know where i learned it from or why i started doing it with my other regular prayers, but since then these visitations had become more frequent, until i stopped praying this prayer recently. i do not claim that this prayer is bringing them around, just the oddness of it happening when it was said. \r\nthe lights would change color just like when you look at a satellite at night and i again thought maybe this was the case until it started moving in patterns not typical of helicopters,planes or balloons. at about the size of a peanut from arms length it is nuetral for about one minute, then it descends to about the size of a watermelon at arms length. it then makes what i can only call \"shots\" across the sky in various directions for about another minute, then the color patterns begin again of amber,green,blue and red rotating in different areas of a circle pattern. \r\ni managed to on my last day of doing this prayer to capture it coming down very low almost like it was scanning or wanted a closer look at me and am submitting it here for anyone to look at. it is not common aircraft nor weather balloon, i have seen plenty of those to be able to know the difference. the other thing is there is no sound unless it comes down close like the one in these pictures, then it has a bumblebee sound but very airy to it. i had been having trouble sleeping when all this started staying awake till 3 or 4 in the morning as if someone was in my house. but since stopping that prayer it has quieted down extremely. i will not repeat the prayer nor wish these feelings on anyone else so i am not including it here. i do not expect anyone to believe me nor do i care, i just had to get this off my chest once and for all.

them to come outside too.  i do not remember how it got there, but the next thing i do remember is seeing this medium-large sized thing floating in the air.  our house is 3 stories and our main floor is the second story, which is where our deck is.  my mom's room was downstairs below the main floor.  the ufo was not even close to a mile or even a half mile wide.  it was about as large as a small plane.  it was shaped like a planet with rings, but it was like all one shape, the top, middle and bottom flowed together smoothly but it was not round or oval.  it was covered all over in multi-colored lights.  i don't think there was a spot on it that could fit another light.  the colored lights were not in any particular pattern, it looked like a billion christmas lights but all the colors were shades that were not normal everyday colors...Not any colors i have seen lights or lightbulbs be.  it was hovering between this tree, that was about 20 feet from the deck, and the deck.  it was right about level with the top of the tree and about 15-20 feet above the deck and me.  there was no sound, it was very silent and quiet.  i just remember being in shock and standing there staring at it.  i don't even know how long i was out there because i did not look at a clock before or after it happened.  the next thing i remember is running in the house scared out of my mind, screaming for my mom and step-dad to come upstaris and screaming about a ufo and freaking out.  i was running all over the house locking the doors and windows...I was terrified!  my mom of course told me that i was making up things and to go back outside.  i started crying and begged her not to make me go out there again alone...But she made me anyways.  so i went back out there...Still terrified not knowing if it was still out there or not.  when i got outside, i looked up at the stars and over at the mountain that was to the left of me.  i saw, what i assume was the ufo i had just witnessed, hovering above the top of the mountain, then i saw a light coming from the bottom of it, shining down at the ground.  it then slowly lowered to the ground...Then all the lights disappeared and i never saw it again.","distance":"20 Feet or

in movie in merced, near castle a.F base. i saw a group of about 5 or 6 large,shimering gold colored spheres, about a mile high. they were moving about at incredible speeds, making stops and reversing or changing course in an instant. nearly all of the many occupants in the cars in line got out to witness this. this went on for about 10 minutes, then they formed into one large sphere and continued moving about. they seemed to resist all rules of gravity and inertia, and centered their activity pretty much around the a.F. base perimeter. about 5 or so minutes later, the large sphere started moving upward and eastward at a rapid speed, and then moved so fast that it became a pin point in about 3 seconds. i was 19 at the time. about 25 or 30 years later, i saw a video on tv of the exact same phenomenon over mexico city, (i think that was the site). and a few years later, i saw another tv video of the same thing, over brazil. within that same year, my dad, his partner and i were headed east, just past castle a.F. base, to go fishing at night. something very large arose behind us, apparently out of the a.F. base, hovered over us, killed our motor, then sped off at nearly the speed of light. our car's motor re-stated on its own. about 30 years after the merced incidents, i was the ceo of the hospital in big bear,san bernadino county. i hired a fundraiser who, as it turns out, was a retired a.F.Lt., and had been on project blue book. he had covered castle a.F.Base many times, he said. when i shared the above experiences, he ordered a few drinks, then started crying. he had investigated the globes, and a secret visit president eisnhower had made to one of the hangers about the same time. he said that the president was there to view wreckage remains of a ufo, and alien bodies, and he started crying. he would not discuss the matter any further, and went back to his

western sky through the window and we both got up and went outside to investigate.  she thought at first that it was several helicopters and then quickly decided that wasn't the case.  what i saw was a very bright oval or saucer-shaped thing, yellow-white, moving slowly in a north or northwest direction while a small private or commuter plane apparently circled above the object as though it were watching it from above.  about 5 degrees north of the bright oval i saw what appeared as a meteor-like trail against the black cloudy sky in the shape of a tight oval or circle.  this was when i knew something extraordinary was going on.  and then i saw the bright saucer-shaped oval emit a similar \"ring of fire\" like light about its outer edges.  the whole thing was incredible.  as i watch, the bright oval emitted this weird ring of fire twice and then i ran inside to get my digital slr because i knew i could photograph it.  however, by the time i returned and had the lens cap off and the camera up to my eye the object passed behind trees in the distance and was lost from view.  i should state the the object appeared to be growing lower in the sky the further north it moved.  i detected no noise of any kind from the object, and the only noise from the sky was that of the engines of the plane which circled above.  the plane continued to circle for a few minutes after we lost sight of the object and then it turned and flew off into the southeast.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
