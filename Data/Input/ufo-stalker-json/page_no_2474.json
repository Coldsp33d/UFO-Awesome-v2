crossed the hwy and my headlights were no longer able to light the object. i was very curious about it and tried to speed towards it as fast as i could. but could not get close enough fast enough to get a better view. almost looked like the bottom half of a 747 jet liner. after the object was out of sight was when reality hit me and i did get very frightened of what i saw. i proceeded east to the

\"lights\" turned into a huge metallic blue \"saucer\" shaped craft with large rectangular windows. i was shocked, stunned and  fasinated all at the same time. the craft just sat above my home and my neighbor's home for 20 minutes.  i was sitting on the commode and thought to myself, \"if i can make out the color, shape of windows, etc. so clearly of them i wonder if they can see me and i became scared for the first time and i hid behind the window shutter in my bathroom. from each window a huge white beam of light shone except for the end window which had either a red or blue beam from it.  i followed one beam from the craft's window with my eyes and it fell about 3 feet short of the grass near my lilac bush in my back yard.  the craft made absolutely no noise and hovered...Literally sat in the sky above my home and my neighbor's home for 20 minutes. then it flew off into the western sky and \"sat\"....If i had not seen it do what it just did, i would think i was looking at a star in

saw the rapidly moving darting lights and was stunned and said out loud, \"they're back!!!\" (they never came close enough to turn into a shape).   after july 15th in 2005, i saw the same saucer-shaped craft flying very low going west to east towards mountville... after july 15th in 2006 i saw a huge rectangle of light whizzing past my house going from west to east towards mountville.

from the philadelphia airport and was on back roads near reading, pa when she drove under a huge triangle ship with purple lights.  there were 2 other cars on the back roads with her. it was hovering

partner and i observed a orange ball of light in the sky on a moonless night at around 3am over chesapeak bay.It looked like the sun but seemed transparent at times.We had finished our security checks and went to park near the water on spesutie island.After sitting in our patrol car for a short time i saw the light of the object thru the windshild,above us.We both got out of the carand looked up at it.It was difficult to tell how far away it was but i would guess about 500yrds.After a few min the object moved swifty to our right,and then back in front/above us.It then shot srtait up.From the time i saw the object thru the windshild of our car to the time the ufo left i dont remember saying a word to my partner or he to me.It caught us both speachless.I also remember there was no clouds in the sky,a perfect clear night.After it left my partner and i talked about what we both saw.I called the mp station and told them what had happened.We were told to return to the station to fill out a report and statements.Phillips airfied was called to see if they had anything on radar during the time in question.Nothing was sighted on radar.The object gave you a strange feeling inside.Somehow i new i wasnt just looking at a light in sky but something intellegent.Back at the mp station we all kind of made light of it but i knew something just wasnt right with it.The more i thought about it the more it seemed like the orange vapor was conceiling something within itself.I dont know.This was a long time ago but i have always rememberd that night in aberdeen.I have often wondered if anyone else saw this.No one officially has  ever talked to me about this.

left.  i looked at the ground again the light was still gone.  i looked at the sky again and it was clear with a tiny trail of smoke, then in an instance the smoke trail was gone. but, my friend was

edge; and, rising for a total approximate height of 10';and, being 25-30' in width.                                     \r\n2.  color grayish black / compare same to todays stealh fighter.\r\n3.  appears metalic but the component manufacture is something else.\r\n4.  the object has a low pitched repetive sound going in pitch from low to a higher audible *(similar to an air conditioner in volume and pitch)\r\n5.  the base of the object has circular lights that upon entry and departure are bright white light(s)*the lights intensity is such that the same object appeared as one bright light from a distance. \r\n6.  objects bottom has round lights that are equally spaced and follow the oval completing a circle.\r\n7.  the object when hovering changed its light configuration from white lights to multi colored lights.\r\n8. when hovering each light pulsates off and on with a colored light in sequence with the pitch and/or whiring sound of the object *this is to say the audible pitch from low to high generates a pulsation with light.The colored lights also change their positions, where one was blue on the begining sequence the same light could next be red and so on.The lights on and off sequnce follows the oval of the object and takes approximately 5-6 seconds to complete the circle. \r\n9.  the multi color lights are for that time the most fantastic colors i have ever observed and today i know them as mauve colors and/or similar. 10. object changes light configuaration back to white lights and begins to rise vertically until reaching an approximate height of 400'. the object  then accelerates heading north at a spead that would be comparable to a falling star and disapears.\r\n\r\nnote: initial witnesses approx.100 people / remaining for the entirety of

every minute spread across speraticly in straight lines and triangles formations some were mimiking each others movements these obcts were very high or small in size color of lights that were high in the sky were red and white at about 4:45 to5:15 my wife was looking south and i was looking north and at the same time exactly. 2 objects went through the sky that looked like comets almost ghostly (transparent/almost cloudy)very low no more than 1000ft heading east -west for a couple of minutes we thought we saw the same object then she told me she was looking south.We were shrimping so we had very bright lights in the water within 30 seconds of these things went over my lights surged and my battery running the lights got very low powererd my battery wasalmost completly drained.Until sun rise these things were all over the sky most of them moving slowly not in one any direction but short and very irradicke movements. at about 6:00 one object suddenly appeared right above the tree line south of our dirrection and hoverred in the general assembly building area moving side to side back &forth up and down it had three different colored lights that would glow white and red,red and green, but never white and green this object would hover and all of asudden it would dissappear and reappear within seconds.We looked up and saw 2-4 very bright lights moving north to south there was no real formation to the grouping at very high speeds very high altitude we watched the lower object for almost 1hour as the sun came up the object would slowly creaete disstance from were it was. we thought it was very strange that we did\"nt see any airplanes in the sky for the entire time we watched after the last one dissappeared within 10 minutes air traffic started back.And alot of traffic started heading into nasa's property.Aircraft started flying and leaving alot of very low smoke. while the one hovered i shined my flash light at it blinking and it would change colors and distance away from us.I felt very nervous and currious when we saw these things esspecially when the one appeared very close to us ;i don;t hear anything from the object even the wildlife in the area went dead silence and then it slowly got higher in the sky stopping for a couple of minutes and then go a little higher and kept doing this until it vanished and one by one the others that were very hyigh would

and just happened to look out the window to the west.  i noticed a bright white object in the sky just over the trees and the horizen.  i was expecting as it came closer to start blinking red lights or white to show that it was a plane or helicopter.  as it approached i never saw any blinking lights whatsover.  it was like no plane or object that i'd ever seen before.  i ran in to get my video camera, cause i knew that no one would believe me, and i wanted proof for myself to study later.  after i grabbed the camera i went out onto my deck for a better view and turned on the video recorder.  i was having trouble picking up the object on video.  but i could see it clearly with the naked eye as it was moving overhead from west to east.  it was moving at what seemed like about 3 to 4 times the speed of normal jet planes moving from west to east out of kci airport in kc.  the object faded or disappeared twice, the second time it disappeared was just before it passed by the west side of my house, when it reappeared it was a very bright white light, still no sound.  upon the closest view, from my vanage point, it appeared to be like one larger white glow to the front of the object, a smaller, line like light leading from the front light to another large white glowing light on the back side of the object.  the front white glow, was slightly larger on the front than that on the back of the object.  to me, for it to be moving that fast across the entire sky, it had to be close to the ground, but i never heard a sound from it, which i always hear the jets, helicopters, and sometimes military aircraft that fly overhead.  it seemed up in the sky quite a way, maybe a little bit lower than the jets normally fly in this area.  was much larger than a passenger jet or helicopter.  i couldn't make out a definate shape to the vehicle. just that the glow was larger in the front, light was spherical on front and back, and a white light in a line between the front and back lights.  i only captured about 6 or 7 seconds of video of the object.  i looked at it over and over but didn't get much from the video.  i was holding the camera in my hand, so it's shaky, but it does show a white glowing ball towards the front, and another smaller, glowing white ball to the back of the object.  it moved across the sky in a fluid motion like that of normal aircraft, but seemed to be going much faster.  it took the object approximately 2 minutes to move from just this side of the horizen in the west, to the horizen in the east and then out of site.  no sound at all, no flashing lights at all.  this is what really puzzled me the most.   for what it's worth, i said earlier that day the following, \"ok, i want to finally see a ufo.\"  kind of strange, that i asked to see one earlier that day, and then it happened.  a couple of months ago i noticed, out this same window, what looked like a glowing ball, very large, maybe half the size of the full moon in the sky.  it was dark orange in color.  i noticed it out of the corner of my eye.  i looked directly at it, as i did it looked like a dark light or door or something came around from behind the light from right to left and closed off the orange glow and then i couldn't see it anymore.   it was there in my vision of sight for approx 2-3 seconds.  i immediately looked to the tv to see if it was a reflection, it was far from the reflecting light of the tv. no other lights were on in the house, except for the light coming from the tv.  we have a dvr, i replayed the show on the the dvr, to see if there were any objects that could have put off that reflection, even though it was far away from the reflection of the tv, and there was nothing that could have reflected anything close to orange or spherical or ball shaped.   no explantation for what either object was, so i guess they are unidentified.     my feelings during the sighting were pretty much that i was expecting something to happen that would prove that it is just a plane or helicopter, but it wasn't.  after the sighting, i was trying to come up with a logical explanation for what i had just seen.  all i can say is, i'd never seen anything like it before.  if it was a u.S. air force aircraft it was completely silent and extremely fast.  i keep replaying it in my mind.  but can come up with no explanation, either a ufo or some new air force aircraft with serious technology.  the object either just went far enough from site that i couldn't see the light from it anymore or it disappeared.

( i cant take the lies anymore) before i start i want to say something to you first . you dont want to see a space craft !. it's just not worth the many lonely nights of siliently weeping and wondering to myself because the goverment wont confirm what i know to be true . it was back in 2001 mid summer 10:35pm . i was outside in my back yard. having a cigerette . the night sky was very beautiful and cloudless. a huge white oval bright shaped flying object, soundless with large lights surounding it's middle that did not blink or pulsate came into view from behind my neighbours maple tree (i should mention my house is bordering a large park with a school ) i also want to mention the differant colours red, blue, green and yellow (i think the colours are important for us understanding how this object flys) anyways .....It wafted very slowly and very level across to the middle of the field i was dumbfounded ! i concidered hopping the fence to run closer and stand underneath it but for reasons i still cant get a grip on i remained stationary (and calm). it took about 5 minutes to reach the middle of the field then just like someone hitting a light switch .It just just vanished i thought to myself this secret military craft is awesome .. while i was searching the skys for it .....It freaking reappeared ! (i'am crying again) over my neighbours house and continued to slowly move again in a northly direction (i estimate it flew to the soccer, baseball fields that are about 3-4 minute walk from me and then shot and i mean shot because it took off like a bullet to a spot in the sky that it is our true north . ......I lost sight of it within i mean under 1.5 seconds . i returned into the house in a state of disbelief and went upstairs and just stared out the window to where it shot off to and began thinking who do i call (police , airport, military, my local goverment representitive ?????).......I want to know what you would do ......But anyways heres what i did .....Because i'am just a mere mortal man i forced myself to believe it was just some army / airforce navy boy getting into trouble by taking out the latest invention out for a tour .So i cowarded into nonaction anyways 20 minutes later while i'am still staring out the window .......The military jets could be heard doing flyovers (twice or two planes) then the helicopters flew by.....It took me over 2 years to mention it publicaly and this is my first and only time to report this online.....Ladies and gentlemen this thing was in my estimation 200-300 feet wide by 100-125 feet in hieght and i dont believe any military craft like this is possible by even the best tech we have availabe here on earth ...I have now studied the history of ufo via my computer andi'am left weeping and wondering if this is god ?............One more thing it flew only 100 feet above the ground and at it's furthest point to me was only 150 feet away (identifiable) i did not see a strange light in the sky ......Ps if the goverment did finaly announce the existance of such things i can honestly say my emotional state would greatly improve . please feel free to show my story to your goverment .....Thank you and please have a happy new year........Ps 2 nights ago i got incontact with stanton friedman .And i'am taking his advice ... so be prepared for a ufo story comming soon out of thornhill ont (on the border with toronto canada) because it was to huge for me to be the only witness and now the us goverments denial was the straw that broke the camels back for me it's now time to talk out loud !","distance":"101-500

second star the star i was looking at began to moved notherly at the  distance was a high rate of speed (i could tell by the stars around it that it was covering at large distance ) almost like a meteorite. but, it kept a straght parallel course across the horizon. at this time i realized this was something different. i called everyone over to where i was ( about 50ft  away ), by the time they came to my position the object was glowing intermitantly. it finally began to glow so bright that it looked like it would explode but did not. it simply shot off in a completely different direction. as it did this, it seemed to be traveling away at an intense rate of speed. the very same occurance happened to me in martha's vinyard years before, which, to me is puzzling. years ago, i also had what, i guess is called sleep paralysis, for a short lenght of time after both incidents had occured. i could not move and it made me vey afraid to sleep for a long time. i was having nightmares frequently. they have since gone away but the fear that they will return haunts me. this may sound like another hypocondriac but it's the truth. there was another sighting back when i was younger on halloween at a haunted house in the town of coventry ( next door to my town, which also had a nike  ( missles )sight at the time. taht one was a light show of different lights flashing on a foggy night. about 50 to 75 people wathed that display with no noise at all right over everyone's head. my father and i were in shock. he is a military veteran and had no idea what it was. no one could make out any details of the object, so it remained a mystery. things seem to add up over the years. i, myself, think something is happening that we all should be aware of.
