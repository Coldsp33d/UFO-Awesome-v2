daughter heard a strange dull humming noise coming from above a neighbors house to the northeast. both of them looked up to see an object which they described as missle like with 8 wings flying very rapidly from northeast to southwest with no visible landing gear or propellers. this was approximately 5pm on the 8th of january 2008. they describe the object as being metallic silver with 8 wings and a thin black line running the bottom length of the craft. they stated they saw the object for approx. 15 to 20 seconds as it flew just behind our house. since we live in the flight path of the local airport ( ft. worth spinks) i asked them at what altitude they thought it was ie if it were flying as high as the general aviation aircraft in the pattern and they said it was flying at or above that altitude which i believe is between 1000 to 1500ft agl. they described the craft as being bigger than a cessena but smaller than a airliner,which also fly over our house towards the dfw airport area. they were both excited and my oldest daughter came in to tell me that they had seen something out of the ordinary fly over. i personally didn't think much of it until my daughter drew a picture of it for me and explained the event in greater detail. i asked them both independently what they had seen and they both described the object in the exact same way. i,being an aircraft mechanic by trade,was curious to see if they had seen a kit aircraft such as a long e z which i showed them a picture of and they both said that it wasn't the same craft they had witnessed. they said the craft surface was very smooth with no indentions or bumps. i have no explanation of what they saw and am very curious if anyone else in this area has seen anything of this nature.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

daughter off at ballet when i saw this object. i can tell you this much, it was not a plane at all. if it was a plane, it's a new type that can hover for long periods of time. i noticed it because the sky was so bleak and gray looking and a winter storm watch was in effect for our county. few folks were even out on the roads. our house is located in a wide open area...All you see out here is sky.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was that is was some type of helicopter but with a very unusual golden light array. it was just sitting there. from where i was on the road, the object looked like it was hovering somewhere between my house and the next small town called, josephine.\r\n\r\ni was also on my radio 570 am. this station is always clear but it went fuzzy and there was a bleeping sound using a short/long type tone much like you'd hear in the old morse code or old sci fi movies...I could still hear the speaker but with a lot of static and cross channels.\r\n\r\ni tried to call my husband to see if he could go out side to take a look but before he answered the phone, the object darkened to an amber/brownish color and it looked like it was turning and then...It was just a spot...It was gone that fast, just a small spot. that was the most unusual thing..It was just a dot in a matter of seconds...My clock in the car hadn't even turned to the next min before it was out of sight completely.\r\n\r\ni am not saying what it was...I do not contend it was from outer space or anything like that. it was not a usual object in our wide open night sky. my daughter and i are star watchers and she is studying astronomy. i have never seen something move like that did.\r\n\r\nwe do live near greenville tx. were the l3 plant is located. we also live near a private caddo airport...It could have been anything...But the lights were very different. we see helicopters, small planes, gliders, crop dusters and all sorts of small craft around here all of the time. i have never seen that color or arrangement of lights on a craft before.\r\n\r\nalso, i found out today that a young friend of my daughters, who lives 10 miles from us, has been seeing a \"golden egg\" shape out of bedroom window for about two weeks now. i never spoke to her about this and never knew she'd been seeing \"lights\". her mother confided it to me today after i told her of the weird looking lights i saw. the mother saw this object one day when her daughter called her to see it. they tried to get a camera but it was gone. a sighting outside of her daughters window would place the \"light\" in the same vicinity as the lighted object i saw last night.\r\n\r\nthat is all i know.\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

there was a blanket of very white clouds under us. it was pretty solid. it was just before sunset time. the sun was in front of the plane and i was looking out at the beautiful white blanket of clouds. the form here makes you pick a state and county. since i am not sure where we were in the flight, i chose the destination state and county, but this is not where it took place. it was in flight.\r\n\r\ni was looking out of the window pretty much most of the trip, wondering why i we don't see many planes usually in such a vast space when flying that high. during this trip however, i looked up and saw a plane, or maybe even a comet? it was so high and moving at a very fast speed. i started seeing other planes as well. i saw what looked like two private jets fly just below us at what seemed like a pretty close distance. \r\n\r\nthen looked back kind of behind to the left of our plane and saw a ufo. it was black and too far to be as big as it appeared to be a plane. it kind of stayed in the same place for a few minutes then it started changing shapes to a larger mass and it looked like it was coming towards us. i asked my business partner and friend to look out and asked if he could see it. he said yes and said what is it? he could not see very well though because he was having to lean forward and in order for him to see i had to move my head out of the way and could not view it at the same time that he was. since he was struggling to see, i decided to look again thus not enabling him to see. \r\n\r\ni watched it for what seemed like a few minutes, then it seemed to change shapes into like a cigar shape and it started descending into the clouds. i watched as long as i could just to see if maybe it would appear again, but it did not. \r\n\r\nit was not a plane. it was too big and it was black. it was not a cloud as i could see it move as it went through the other clouds. it was descending. it also seemed to change directions and shape unlike a plane would be able to. i am sure i saw something unusual and not human. \r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

when i approached the traffic lights at n. first street. \r\ni noticed a dimly light object the size of a small winnebago camper was about 20 over the roof of a house on right-hand side of e. johnson between north 1st and north 2nd street about 100 yards from where i was stopped at the light.  it was evenly and dimly lit to a nondescript gray especially on its belly and was slowly moving down the row of houses traveling toward me to the south.  \r\ni watched it while i approached and subsequently waited for the light to change.  i thought maybe the police had a helicopter out looking for a burglary suspect that someone reported.  \r\nthings didn't add up.  there was no spotlight scan the bushes below for a bandit.  there was no other lighting on it; frankly i couldn't tell where the top of it was.  most helicopters have lighting on or about the base at the center of the rotating the blades.  there were no lights to indicate a cockpit.  and there was no noise.  i shut the heater off in the car and listened - it was silent.\r\nit had since left the row of rooftops and had slowly started to make its way across johnson street, heading toward the southern portion of the old mautz paint factory.  the light changed to green and i started to pull away from the stop light toward it.\r\nwhen the object was over the boulevard my theory that it was a helicopter pretty much failed.  for one thing, if it was helicopter, being that low to the ground its downdraft should have kicked up some of the snow and buffeted the small shrubs - neither one happened.  and if it was helicopter i certainly should have heard it now as i was approaching it and soon to be practically underneath it. \r\nas i went to pass under it i noticed a large seam on its belly that looked like a \"t\" with the horizontal portion of the \"t\" being at the end of the object that appeared to be the \"front\" (as defined by the direction it was moving).  about the time i realized it wasn't normal i was just about to pass under it and sure enough i did.  while briefly passing underneath, i remember feeling odd, almost like i had an overwhelming urge to fidget and i did awkwardly rumpled myself in my seat.  \r\ni was slowly starting to freak out and question my sanity at the same time as i continued driving north when i noticed another car.  it was traveling south and approaching the boulevard.  i remember the car being a tan 4 door and most of all i remember the guy was driving with his face practically against the windshield and craning his neck to look up.  he saw it. from the street light i could tell he had short brown hair and was caucasian.\r\nwhen i got home i was completely activated.  i wanted to wake up everybody in the house and tell them what i saw, but didn't.  the next morning the news had a report of a ufo over by milwaukee street that had all but landed in the street while a police officer looked on.  but it was earlier in the day.\r\nand so, i guess i'm nuts too.  whatever,��� it was what it was and i���d give anything to talk to that guy in the other car.\r\n","distance":"21-100

beside the small trailer court we lived in, i was 9 years old at the time our ages ranged from 7-12 years of age. as we gathered im assuming trying to decide what to do with ourselves, and were conversing... i was in mid sentance when i began to notice what i can only describe as an oscillating drone a sort of low humming similar to high voltage power lines. i continued talking but was scaning around in the direction this odd noise was comming from as i did so i seen a miniscule blip of pulsating white light moving at what i know now as a very high rate of speed... my right arm shot out at it and i pointed right at it and exclaimed i see you! i recall in my peripherial my friends look of horror as they moved behind me i was fixated and did not take my eyes from it. it was like it seen and heard me also...There was a very sharp crack i would not compare this to a sonic boom at all...Followed by the most beautiful sound i have ever heard i can only try to explain as the sound of crystals smashing and a modulated sound similar to a trumpet blast which to me was like the feeling of glory (hard to explain) this had moved the tiny blip in an instant to what was now a massive glass object mostly looking like a mirror all over the surface but with multitudes of color shimmering throughout it, sort of a diamond shape but was also like natural crystaline structure no light sources on it at all, i recall thinking the top section looked like a magnificent city of glass sky scrapers, behind me i heard the chaos of my friends one of them shouting look at that witch on that shed! followed by numerous swear words 8) they were after it! i knew this but still i was fixated and by now this thing was in my mind speaking to me... i recall how the sky had changed the clouds seemed to be moving throughout the sky at an extremly excellerated rate but everything else seemed so slow and calm there was no wind that day the clouds before were not really moving and although there was no wind the wheat field still miles bellow this magnificent object was gently swaying back and forth like small waves on the water... i wish, i really want to remeber all this thing was telling me but i recall only a few things i remember thinking it was god but this was almost a shock to them they assured me they were not the creator as i sensed it was many now but one of mind if that makes any sense to whoever is reading this. i remember asking how they flew so different from planes i recall them saying we use everything and anything with electro magnetic pulse propulsion this particular craft was made from the sands of the moon.When i say they used anything and everything that means the fuel they used was whatever substance they were in. the craft it self needed no fuel inside it. ��� also remeber almost bieng scolded by them and warned of something that i had to change or do something by a certain time or it would be to late. i need to know what this is. i also assumed at that time everyone in my city if not the whole world was going to know about what i was looking at.Unfortunately this was not the case... i believe i have a wealth of information from them that needs to be unlocked... my strange story is not finished i recall bieng in a white room with only a chair which i was in looking at pictures that i know now would be called holograms which were suspended before me.. some where like blueprints infact thier background was a deep blue the drawings where bright white of structures all i can recall of them though. i was not in the presence of what ppl call greys i was alone in this room but they were still in my mind...I do remember looking at a fantastic 3 dimensional image complete with the sounds and smells of 2 animals not from this earth i said animals they were alien but it is my feeling these were animals and nothing more. but for some reason i also felt like they are animals we have here now but this is what they will one day become... oh yes in this room there was only one thing besides the chair on the wall in front of me a light blue glowing symbol with 3 golden stars in a diagonal line. the symbol was like a letter from some ancient scripts i have since seen... im going to stop at that for the room... the length of the field i was in spans a half mile easy on the other side of the rode was a massive dirt hill from what was then a new sub division under  development which we had made into a dirt track for our bmx bikes... anyway when this all started i was at the midway point of this field with my bike on the ground close by. i found myself awakening from laying on my back with a slight headache a fuzzy feeling in my mouth and bieng rather disoriented and groogy as i stood up and gathered myself i saw my bike on the other side of the road which i was now very close to i had moved a distance of a quarter of a mile say with no memory of moving, my hutch (bmx) was laying on the oppisite side of the rode now half way up the closet jump to me... this may sound contradictory  but i have been piecing this together for quite some time now as i am now 37 years old after i got my bike which really took quite some time and quite an effort due to the way i felt my bike was aprox 70 yards away from me...Anyway i did have full recollection of everything i have told you except the white room..Which came to me days later... however my friends were nowhere near me by this time i had to find them to talk about what we all had just seen... i know they saw it too,but when i found them playing football in the park they had no idea what i was talking about... when i asked my closet friend of this group what about the witch you guys went after he smiled at me and laughed his nervious high pitched laugh i remeber him looking rather pale all i could get from him is she just sat upon the roof staring at us... that was all he said and would never say more nevr to this day... i have no idea what they saw as i dont remember taking my eyes off the object till the time i awoke when i woke up i didnt see the thing leaving or anything like that at all bieng a kid not wearing a watch or even caring about time have no idea how much had passed but i do know the sun had moved a great deal i would guess atleast 2 hours time had past...Anyway this is the first time i have ever tried to explain this experience in written form i have talked to friends about it only close ones and i can tell they think im lying or perhaps even crazy...I assure you i am not so... nor would i wish to waste your time or the time it has taking me to write this or the countless hours i have spent pondering this over the years... most do not believe in ufos some believe i know and truth is most certainly stranger then fiction. your brother in christ our lord.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

several large picture windows. it was a very clear moonlit night, very cold and the moon lit up the entire valley below our house.  i could see for what seemed miles in the eastern direction. i happened to look up and saw this large light pulsating different colors.  i cannot remember the sequence of the colors but it would blink like red for a few seconds, the yellow, then green and so forth. i watched it in awe and called my friend to see it. it was about the position of 2 oclock. the colors were very clear and it stayed in the same place. at first i thought it was an airplane but the colors were much to vivid and it was stationary.  we watched it for about five minutes, just sitting there pulsating these colors all the while. then, in two rows from the bottom of it came first yellow lights, much smaller in size, then red ones with the yellow ones still visable, then green ones with the red and yellow ones still visable. (the color sequence cannot be remembered.). the row on the left whisked away toward the left and disappeared and the row on the right whisked away to the right and disappeared. the main large object stayed in the same place and the colors kept on flashing.  in about what seemed like four or five minutes the smaller ones came back and entered into the larger one in the same fashion as they had left.\r\n\r\n                              o\r\n                             . .\r\n                             . .\r\n             went to left    . .  went to right\r\n\r\nwe continued to watch as the smaller ones had apparently gone inside the larger one and then after another few minutes the large one disappeared.\r\nwe were in amazement and could not believe what we had seen and discussed it with each other. i know what i saw and have now decided to let someone know. for reasons private i do not want any exposure from this report.\r\nthank you.","distance":"501 Feet -

(my car's clock's time), just after i had turned north onto michigan road/u.S. 421 from 146th street (c.R. 300 s), in my peripheral vision above me i saw two bright orange-yellow lights, exactly like the ones i had seen in march 2005, up in the sky, only seemingly higher this time, because they were not quite as big.  the two lights were also much closer than when i had seen them in march 2005.  i would judge that the lights, when i saw them this time, were over eagletown and, as before, they were moving slowly in a northerly direction.  doing my best to watch the road while watching the lights, what i saw, over the span of about 20 seconds, was both lights on, then the right one dimmed over about three seconds and went out, but came back on about three seconds later.  then the left one dimmed over about three seconds and went out.  about five seconds later, the right one dimmed over about three seconds and then went out.  when the left one dimmed and just before it went out, i thought i could vaguely make out a shape that appeared similar to the canopy of a small helicopter, but i couldn't be certain.  the sky was crystal clear, though, and i have 20/12.5 vision, and i'm pretty confident i saw some shape in the shadow of the dimming light.\r\n\r\nhoping to see the lights again - and over a longer period of time - i turned into 156th street, where it is really dark once you get away from michigan road.  i stood outside for about 10 minutes (it was about minus 10 with the wind chill), but never saw the lights again, so i went home.
