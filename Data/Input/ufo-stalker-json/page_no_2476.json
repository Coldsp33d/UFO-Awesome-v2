(see attached map for our position in association of other friendly troop formations).\r\ndue to mechanical difficulties (engine replacement) we were stuck in maintainance area (see circle near hill on map) until nearly midnight on the first night.  typically, only one or two scouts will try to penetrate the area at this time.  as we finally began to roll east just after midnight, we had to move extremely slow as there was no moonlight and our night vision had to rely on starlight for magnification purposes.  the driver has one set of night vision goggles, and the tank commander \"mario\" had the other pair.  both myself and the tank commander were standing out the open hatches on top of the tank to help guide the driver forward to our position.\r\nabout two kilometers into our trip (see first tick mark on our path), i noticed a fairly bright light well ahead of us along the horizon (due east).  assuming it was just a bright star, or even a planet i kept it to myself for several minutes as we continued to trudge along at only a couple of mile per hour.  as i continued to observe (with the naked eye), the object appeared to slowly be rising from the horizon, as if coming towards us, yet still at a great distance...  a few minutes later (see second tick mark), i tapped the tank commander who had the night vision goggles and pointed to the object.  he too noticed and both of us began to study the light as it slowly appeared to approach us.  several minutes later, we realized the object was going to be fairly close as it passed by the right side (south) of us.  without telling the driver what was going on (he was a young private, and we didn't want to look like weirdo's) we instructed him to stop the tank and shut down the engine so we could listen.  in the absolute silence of the desert in the early am, we were unable to hear any sound whatsoever as the object continued to approach.  we passed the night vision goggles back & fourth in complete disbelief (and a bit of fear i may add) as the object passed within a few hundred yards of our vehicle.  it was only about 30-40 feet off the ground, disk shapped, and through the night vision goggles, you could see a beam circulating beneath the object shining at the ground as it went by.\r\nknowing that there weren't supposed to be any aircraft in the area and seeing that we couldn't identify what we saw, we hesitated to break radio silence for sake of not being taken seriously.\r\nhowever a few minutes later several other units farther back in the formation reported \"blue-air\" (code name for blue forces aircraft).  but, quickly they realized it wasn't a helicopter or airplane.  at this time, object was no longer in our field of view, but other units reported loosing sight of object.  nobody indicated seeing it shoot off or anything... it just seemed to vanish.  ??\r\nneither tank commander or myself were able to sleep that night.  we didn't even move the tank after that point.  we simply parked out in the open (on tank trail) and kept our eyes peeled until sunrise.  nothing else was seen.\r\nthere was lots of talk about it at refuelling/breakfast the next morning, but nobody ever figured out what it was, or could have been.  only thing like it i have ever seen.\r\nas for the object itself... as i meantioned, it appeared disk shapped, yet it was very very dark out and whatever light we had seen in the distance that was so bright was no longer visible as it closed on us.  i don't remember seeing it turn off, but as it got closer, we could only see it through night vision via the beam coming out the bottom.  absolutely silent!  based on the rotating light beam, the object had to be at least 20-30 feet wide, but may have been larger.  it passed between us and the mountain range we call the south wall which wasn't more than a kilometer and a half away.  this was absolutely not something in the sky per say.  it was very low.  you could see the light beam hitting the ground beneath it which is why i say it was only 200-300 meters from us.  beam may have been infrared since it couldn't be seen with naked eye.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

walked to the end of my little courtyard and turned to the left to go out the gate when i saw a very large v shape of lights moving from the west to the east.  directly over my house.  there were numerous clusters of lights in various colors, mostly white and red, but also a strange hint of a green color as well.  i watched it fly over my head at an altitude unknown to me, but it appeard to be very high up.  i noticed a couple of things while i watched it completely cross the sky above me.  \r\n\r\n1) it was very big and although it wasnt making any type of manuvers (just flying in a straight path across the sky) it seemed to move effortlessly.\r\n\r\n2) none of the lights blinked on it, and the lights themselves were large.  they were glowing more than anything.\r\n\r\n3) it was very loud, and was a strange sound, different than anything i had heard before..\r\n\r\n4) im not sure but i believe it had one lone light trailing in the distance, as if it could actually have been a diamond shape.  if it was actually shaped like a diamond, and the trailing light was attached to the large v cluster in the front, its big...\r\n\r\ni watched as it faded away in the eastern distance, while still able to hear it i could no longer see it and i ran in the house to tell my wife what i had seen.\r\n\r\ni wasnt sure what i had seen but i knew it was something i had never seen before.\r\n\r\nthe next night nothing happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe night after, at 10:00 approximately, i heard it from inside my house and ran out to look.  it was the same basic craft on the same exact path at what appeared to be the same altitude as the previous flight..\r\n\r\neverything was the exact same, accept the clusters of lights were not as dense, or there werent as many lights on?  \r\n\r\ni watched it fly over and went inside to tell me wife what i had seen.  she informed me that she had heard it from bed and that it was really loud inside the house..\r\n\r\nnothing happened for several nights...\r\n\r\n\r\nthen at around 10:00 pm a few nights after the last sighting, i heard it from my living room again.  \r\n\r\ni ran to the door and looked up and saw something different..\r\n\r\nit was a perfect triangle.  1 huge white light at each corner and a equally large glowing, pulsing, red light in the middle...\r\n\r\nit was on the same path as the previous two

saw it, it appeard to be heading for barksdale airforce base in shreveport, louisiana. i dont think its necessarilly an alien craft, i think its man made.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and as we got out of the car i noticed out in the south-western sky 3 round orb-like objects coming toward us. the sky was clear; no fog, the visibility was excellent. the objects were approx. 1/4 mile from us when they stopped; one object started rising and was dropping what looked like molten metal until it was out of sight. the next object shot straight up at a terrific speed and was gone in approx. 10 seconds. the next object came straight over our heads and stopped; this being only 75 feet over us; as a reference there is a power pole right where it stopped and it was only a few feet over that. by this time my wife's mother stated(she was about 70 years old at the time) that she is going into the house because she is \"scared and does'nt know what to do if this thing lands\"!!! my wife and i are still watching this thing and we notice that on the top of this craft there is a radar-like looking object turning around; kind of what one might see at an airport. this was the only sound we could hear coming from the object. it then started rising very slowly until it was gone. at this time we were saying to each other that no one will ever beleive what we just saw when another object shaped like a hexagon and being the size of a jumbo-jet pass right in front of us at approx. 500ft. no sound what-so-ever!!!It appeared to be tumbling in a clock-wise movement from south to north. i was so rattled by this event that the next day i went to the sheriff's office and told a deputy what we had seen. he asked if i would draw the objects we saw and to my astonishiment left and came back into the room and showed me 3 drawings of exactly the same things!! he said at that time that he would inquire to a few agency's about this and thats the last i heard about it. it's been

while i was on vacation visiting my parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni was walking on the beach in oceanside, california, sunday, september. it was around 4:45 pm. my then four year old son garreth was with me. we were at the water's edge. the sun was starting to get closer to the horizon. i happened to look back towards the cliff area. i saw this oval object that was over the row of a-frame cottages, yet it was below the cliff line and other houses behind it. if you do a google earth search for the area where the flying object sat, it would be latitude: 33���11'53.93\"n and longitude:117���23'14.72\"w. where i was standing on the water's edge was latitude: 33���11'55.62\"n and longitude:117���23'20.90\"w.\r\n\r\nwhat attracted me to the object was a glimmer of light as if reflecting the sun's light into a mirror and then moving the mirror so that it would pulse. like using a mirror to send morse code. we walked closer to the object walking away from the water's edge. the object did not move. the light coming from it did all the moving. i could see the color of the light which to make a basic description, looked like gold spray paint sprayed onto water and then sloshed so that the gold \"paint\" would circle around inside the oval shape. gold spray paint has dark components in it especially if it is sprayed too thick ss this is as close to an example that i can offer.  imagine an oval tank filled with water, with underwater bright white lights inside the tank submerged and the thick gold \"paint\" material swirling around on top of the water as it won't mix with the water. there would be times when the \"paint\" was not too thick which allowed the light behind it to shine through making it brighter and darker as the \"paint\" material swirled around. the tank is on its side in this instance like a large picture frame. there was no pattern to the movement of the material inside the oval. random swirls as if stirred with a large spoon and then reversed its direction at will. very random. the object was the size of a large van. it was a windy day, there were seagulls flying a few yards from the object at palm tree level, and they were having a hard time negotiating the wind. the object was dead still. i at first thought it was a gag blimp or some type of kite. i looked for wires, there were none.  nothing short of billboard scaffolding could have suspended that large object over the cottage roofing to keep it from moving in the wind. there was no scaffolding. nothing extended from the a-frame cottages and nothing connected to the houses on the cliff above the object. still not wanting to believe this object was hanging there by itself, motionless, i moved closer. it was the same thing. no wires, no poles no metal trusses, not even an electric wire to supply power for the light effects. the object was facing the sun which was setting in a northwest position over the horizon. i moved closer to the object and noticed that behind the oval that was displaying the liquid light show, there was a turbine. yes a turbine that spun counterclockwise. looked like what you would see on a jet liner. there were light blue and pink lights coming out of the turbine as it spun. no specific light receptacles, just a flood of pastel colored lights coming out of the the area of the spinning vanes.  but there was no noise at all. i could not understand how light could be coming out of the turbine as there were no bulbs, reflectors, etc. it was mystical to say the least. there were other people at the beach picnic tables across the cottages, gathered around, at about 10 feet away from where i stood, and i looked at them to see if they had noticed the object. they never glanced at it. not even once as long as i stood there. made me think, is this a gag, and everybody else has already seen it and grown tired of it? a young boy crossed in front of my son and me as we stood across the row of cottages and i looked at him to see if he was viewing what we saw trying to get him to look up at the object. he looked at me and wondered why i was looking at him. he never looked up at the object. my son and i looked at the object for a good 30 minutes, the sun was still brightly shining. i had to leave to get the car home in time for my parents to go to 5 p.M. religious services. i was late. our car was parked on the street at the cliff line south of the cottages, quite a ways away from the oceanside amphitheater and from where the object hung in the air. we started to head towards the car but i kept looking back at the object and it was still there in the same position. i reluctantly got into the car and drove home. i usually have a video camera with me. i'm a recording artist with music videos on mtv asia. that day my brother had taken the video camera with him. of all the times to be without a camera. and to think my rock video garden of eden that aired all over asia on mtv asia and channel v from 1996 on, had famous pictures and video of \"ufos\" in it. i can still remember the object. i did not see any windows, any beings looking out, any doors, wings, tires. above all no motion and no noise whatsoever. no smell of fuel, aviation or otherwise, no fumes, no exhaust heat mirages, no heat. \r\nthe gulls were the loudest thing at the scene. the turbine was molded onto the oval light frame. if i had not stepped to one side i would not have noticed the turbine. it had dimension. it was a solid object. whatever it was seemed to only be seen by myself and my son. this object was at rooftop of the one story cottages. the red cottages are still there on the beach access road at oceanside beach, and can be seen on google earth. it was not a misty hazy apparition. it was well defined, unmistakably within close reach and in more than  enough broad daylight to tell it was hanging there. it was definitely a flying machine. i have no idea where it came from. it had no letters, graphics, markings at all. i did not see it leave as i left before it did. i went back the next day and it was gone. i wish i had stayed till the object disappeared. i wish i had video footage of it. i wonder why it showed itself to me and not to the others on the beach. \r\n\r\ni have included a crude rendering of the object to at least give a visual of what we saw and in case someone else has seen this same object and reports or has reported it, for posterity.\r\n\r\nthe side of the flashing \"blimp\" side is not exactly the way i saw it but the white and black and gold \"liquid\" lines are there to give an idea of what it was doing as it pulsed which was swirling in random waves. the color of the pulsing blimp was less intense as the rendering suggests and almost going towards a black and white version or as if the color had been dialed down to just a hint of color. the rendering is not really accurate. the turbine is as close as i could come up with using infini_d in which i'm not really proficient. the overall look of the object is similar to as rendered. if i had access to a real artist, perhaps a closer picture of the object could be achieved. i'm wanting to fill in the portion of the blimp that connects to the turbine to give it a molded look as the blimp molds into the turbine.The turbine had a housing that extended to the rear as it sat alongside the blimp part of the object but i could not draw it into the rendering and would then be construed as a cigar shaped part as regards the turbine. since the object  as you can see this is an usual looking object. i wish i had thought to go around the rear of the object but i was pressed for time. if i have already reported this incident to your group, then here it is with a rendering.. with regards to the total number of witnesses it should read 7 to 10 people including my son and myslef but since i did not sense they were looking at the object i have to report two witnesses as myself and my son. i know it's strange but that's what happened that day while viewing the object.","distance":"20 Feet or

southern sky.  it would go very fast and make right angle turns, and go up and down.  i said, \"it must be an airplane of some sort.\" my friend with me said, \"when have you ever seen an airplane do that?\"  it had no other lights on it, like red and green port and starboard lights on an airplane.  it was just a brassy redish colored light.  it flew very fast in the northern sky, and started coming towards us, hovering, no noise.  my friend got scared and wanted to go, she said, \"that thing is looking at us!\"  i felt the same way.  it was maybe two or three hundred yards from us.  was hard to tell.  we got in the car to take off, and the light went north at a high rate of speed. we didn't see it after that.  it really left an impression on us.  this happened some time in the summer of 1975 to the best of my recollection.  we didn't know who to report this to.  i come foward now because of the sightings in stephenville.  i would like to know if there were other sightings here in

walking up to the club house on the highest point in sound beach the highest point in the area on the north shore of long island.\r\n i was 15 at the time (too young to drive)when i became aware of a diamond formation of what appeared to be 4 bright stars(brighter than the background) in a diamond formation with a brighter star dead center of the formation.\r\n i was an aviation buff and had some experience with aircraft performance.\r\n i called attention to the phenomenon and we all watched the motionless formation for several minutes.\r\n suddenly, the four bright points forming the perimeter of the diamond accelerated, linearly, to the four points of the compass, while the brightest,center point disappeared to what appeared to be straight up.\r\n shortly, the sound of a fighter jet became evident. the sound appeared to come from the direction(south) of the(then) west hampton beach afb.\r\n the aircraft showed no nav. lights, circled several times, then exited the area to the south.\r\n shortly thereafter the five point formation reappeared from the direction to which the had exited.\r\n unfortunately i do not remember how much longer they lingered.\r\nsecond sighting:\r\n same summer possibly two weeks later, two of us sitting on the cliffs overlooking long island sound when two what appeared to be bright stars appeared from over the horizon over the connecticut shore heading straight at us south/south, east at a very rapid rate of speed.( the vehicle on the right was leading the one on the left)\r\n when the objects appeared to be over mid long island sound they
