to see them again.\r\n\r\ni must also note that the area has an extreme amount of both red and white blinking radio/microwave antennas. also, seeing lights through the trees around here will give the illusion of blinking. there also is a fair concentration of oil & gas drilling rigs in the area. the following were not antennas nor was i observing them through trees... and i know for sure these werent drilling rigs. these objects look like planes at first, but under observation move and blink in an irregular fashion, unlike a plane. whatever they are, they scare the crap out of me. i am sure they will be up there again. but im not sticking around to get em on tape.\r\n\r\njanuary 19th incident - roughly 8:30 pm\r\ndriving into mcalester, eastbound on 270\r\nvery high in the sky above mcalester i saw something streak across the sky at a high rate of speed. i grew up next to an airport, and this was too high to be traveling that fast. much too high. an airplane has lights flashing at a normal pulsing rate. this thing had both red and white blinking lights pulsing in a most irregular fashion. whatever it was, it was traveling north to south. the event took place in about 5-10 seconds total.\r\n\r\njanuary 20th incident - roughly 9:00 pm\r\ntraveling eastbound on 270, between stuart and arpelar.\r\nvery high in the sky to the north, saw the same style of blinking red & white lights. the white lights seemed to blink in an irregular pulse in a circular pattern around the red light. the lights would disappear, and then reappear in the same spot in the sky. i put the pedal to the floor and did not look back or up.\r\n\r\njanuary 22nd incident - roughly 9:00 to 9:40 pm\r\ntraveling from south of stuart, through stuart, and then eastbound through arpelar, then to mcalester.\r\nwas travelling north to stuart, ok. observed the same odd blinking irregular lights but much closer and much brighter, to the north. whatever was emitting them seemed to be on the ground to the north and west of stuart & 270 on top of a hill. if you were not observing it from on top of a hill, you would not of seen it from the highway. i was on a road south of the highway. also, to the south and west of stuart, for a brief moment there were the same type of lights observed just behind a hill there. i tried to get into the small town of stuart as fast as possible. once i got near stuart, i could no longer view either of these objects. i then turned east toward mcalester on 270. i looked up to the north, and noticed something moving in the sky. it kept its distance, but it looked like it moved faster almost to keep pace with me. this really scared me as i felt like i was under the objects observation. i was traveling the speed limit at 65 mph. i kept the object under my observation for roughly 15 miles. it just stayed in the same position in relation to my point of view. meaning, where i went, it went and stayed at a static distance from me. the lights blinked all kinds of weird directions. changing white to red to sometimes orange. also, the object moved vertically up and down whilst traveling horizontally. it would speed up and slow down. i can honestly say, i never wanted to see something like that and i hope i never see it again. once i made it into mcalester, i exited my vehicle and blinking lights caught my eye once again. just above the treetops, to the nne at a distance i can not discern, there appeared whitish orangish lights again. blinking strangely this time back and forth, back and forth. i observed this object for approximately 3 minutes before i had enough and locked myself inside.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9186,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0088719,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01232008-0014","longitude":-97.089067,"occurred":1200988800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1200988800000,"summary":"Strange

overlooked the road and a large flat field (larger than a football field and similarly shaped) across the road. one night when i was 9 or 10 years old i was looking out the window and saw two lights in the field. at first i thought people must be out there with lanterns on foot because the lights were moving a bit and were close to the ground. i watched them because i had never seen anyone in that field before, not even during the day. they started to move (independently) and i thought they were headlights of motorcycles. but then they moved impossibly fast all the way to the other side of the field. i think they were joined by a third and possibly fourth light. they seemed to be checking out the field and the perimeter of it. i believe they stayed close to the ground the entire time.\r\n\r\ntheir speed is why i remember this at all, because i couldn't understand what could possibly move that fast, especially since there were no roads there or anything.\r\n\r\ni went to get my parents to come see, but when we got back to the window, they were gone.\r\n\r\ni don't remember the time of year or exact time of night, but we only lived there less than a year i think.  we moved out on april 1, 1970. we sold the 75 acre property later that year. i don't remember the address exactly, but you could find out by town records or i could probably find it.\r\n\r\nwhen i heard last week about the sightings in texas, i was struck by the similarities.\r\n\r\nthe lights i saw were bright, white or yellowish-white lights, each like a single car headlight, though now that i think about it, from my vantage point it was hard to tell how big they were. they could have been bigger, but not a lot bigger.","distance":"101-500

us. but when the object remained with us, my wife became concerned. i wanted to stop the car and get out for a better look but my wife was too upset to allow me to stop. from park rd 15, we turned right onto county road 461. as we got close to county road 561, the object moved towards us and was directly above the car. it stayed above us for about 5 minutes. my wife thought it was about two telephone poles in height above the ground and i felt it was about 100 yards in diameter. it blocked out the stars. there were amber lights similar to a school bus around the perimeter of the circular object. underneath it were white lights that went off and on in sequence. the object appeared to be a dark metal but it was difficult to see the color of the metal at night. the object was totally

the back room of the house,which has 4 large windows,when i noticed some very bright lights shining through the lats of the blinds of one window that had the blinds pulled half way down,so i said to my husband as i approached the window,\"wow what the heck is that?\" i put my face against the blinds to see what it was,so i peeked between the lats and said to my husband,\"you should see how low this plane is!\" so i pulled the blind all the way up so we could watch it.I was a little scared because it was too low and close.Then i noticed that it wasn't moving and that it had 3 very bright lights in a triangle pattern with one red pulsating light in the center of it.I thought it looked odd,because i had never seen a plane with that pattern of lights before and there was no green light on it like most planes have.We could not hear the engines either,so we went outside to listen to it,but it was silent.That freeked me out a little so my husband said,it's probably a helicopter.I told him that it was too close for us not to hear it.It was only like 300 feet away.So then i started to think that maybe it could be a ufo,but it wasn't shaped like a disk like most people say.I had never heard of triangle ufo's before.So then i wanted to get its attention,so i started flicking the back lights on and off,like in morse code and flashing a flashlight on and off towards it,then suddenly the craft's lights started coming towards my house.It freeked me out ,so i locked the doors and pulled down the blinds.We watched it for about 20 minutes or so,and then it suddenly,very slowly started to go towards the beach,until i could no longer see it.That was the first of 4 sightings.The second was in the middle of that same week,during the daytime,and the others were in 2007.My son told me that too many people don't report it,so i did my duty and eased my conscience after 18 years and hope others will do the same,so that we get more accurate statistics on ufo

like pearls on a string and looked like bubbles with a light encased inside. they were incredibly bright...Beyond halogen color temperature. just like an arc welding strike. there was no sound and they just trailed off to the west. they were traveling  just as a plane had passed and along the same trailing heading toward the southwest. they were probably 1 minute behind the plane and seemed to be moving at about the speed of a plane. they originated in the northeast and i saw them moving to the southwest towards dublin. they were around 25-45 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nhe thought the lead plane might be a c-130 using a type of counter measure ordinance (as they use in iraq to confuse heat seeking shoulder fired rockets) but there were no point of source trails from the aircraft. they had to be at least ten miles down stream from the aircraft.\r\n\r\na week later on jan.15 or 16 at the same location, he saw two military jets flying in the same approximate path as the orbs that he had seen on jan. 8th.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

traveling very fast in a se to nw trajectory.  the time was approximately 4 pm and the sky clear and bright.  we noticed the objects about half way across the sky or directly overhead and by the time i ran to get my camera, they had moved across most of the remaining sky and were approaching the horizon.  eventually we lost sight at what i guestimate might have been several hundred miles out (i have no idea how far one can actually see on a clear day with an object that high in the atmosphere).  i'm guessing that the objects crossed the entire visible sky in 5-6 minutes or less.  while the four objects were traveling at approximately the same speed and in the same direction, there were some wild variations in flight.  the objects looked to be almost tumbling as they swerved back and forth, nearly impacting one another.  all four of the objects left a vapor trail and i have several pictures if anyone would like to take a look.  i have contacted nasa, local news agencies, local astronomy clubs, and an outfit called space-track.Org.  i have had no interest in the pictures and have been unable to find anything to suggest what it was we might have witnessed.  i originally thought that the objects might have been the breakup of a satellite or something along that line, but the space track page that claims to track all such occurances did not even show any items in a low decay orbit within days of our sighting.  the odd thing is that it appears that my freind and me may have been the only ones in our community who saw these objects.  i have two clean pictures if anyone would be interested.  they are fairly high resolution digital and you can zoom in for decent detail.  i would just like to know what it was that we saw.  \r\n\r\nif web based gps visualizer is correct, the sighting was at approximately:\r\nlatitude 43.578595 \r\nlongitude -116.493492 \r\n\r\ncoordinates are:\r\nn43���34.7157, w116���29.60952\r\n\r\ni might be able to figure an approximate heading for the objects if that would be of use.\r\ni am glad to share the pictures, but i retain right of ownership.","distance":"Over One

yes.\r\n\r\nit went from a ever intensifying light into a suddenly present object.  i concluded that it had come from a great distance to nearby and that was accounting for its growing

white light to several concentric circles of changing lights.  maybe three or four rows.  the lights changed colors from red to yellow and the object was having a visibly difficult time hovering in

pulled up behind us and the driver had exited his vehicle.  i looked at him and said \"do you see that?\" and he looked at at me and said yes as well as nodding.  i looked inside my car at the

was just trying to see whatever it was.\r\n\r\ni couldn't stand my girlfriends crying and began to think its time to get out of here. i got into the car and drove off while looking in the rearview

and beyond were the everglades, on the other side of a canal and a chain link fence.\r\n\r\nwe pulled to the side of the road to observe a bright light that was approachng silently from the wnw.  it was very, very bright.  it finally came to a stop and hovered over the farm house.  with a sharp hissing noise, a beam of light shone directly on the roof of the house for a few seconds, and then disappeared.  at this point, once our eyes had adjusted to the intense glare, we could se black spots (maybe windows?) along the widest point of the oval.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, there was a strange distortion developing in the sky over the house as the object became darker and appeared to shrink in on itself.  it was a kind of swirling distortion that appeared to increase in size and seemed even to distort the sunlight and clouds as it did, and the object became even darker and smaller.  then there was an audible, low-pitched popping sound, almost like one can make by pulling a finger out of one's puckered mouth, and the object disappeared altogether.  the distortion effect subsided, and then disappeared after a few seconds more.\r\n\r\nwe approached the house by passing through the gate and going up the driveway, and detected the strong smell of ozone, like from a stong electrical gadget, as well as an organic kind of repugnant stink.  we looked up at one of the windows and saw a grayish reptilian being staring at us.  we were so frightened, that we tore a u-turn right through a flower bed and drove away as fast as we could.\r\n\r\nmy wife begged me never to tell anyone about

friend and i drove to ottawa the summer of 1972 or 73 for a weekend, looking for girls.  we ended up without any, sleeping in my car on the side of a highway.  we were awoken when a trooper stopped to check us out. when he left, we sat in the car eating some leftover bread.  the terrain was very flat with a mountainous area ahead in the distance.  we observed a disc-shaped object slowly moving across the flat field to our right, gradually approaching us.  it made no sound and came to a stop about 50 feet in the air and perhaps 200 feet in front of us over the highway.  it hovered there for around 10 minutes (i guess). i said to dave \"you know what that is, right?\" and he said \"yup\". no other words were spoken until the object was gone. there were colored lights that would appear across the side of the object and move along the surface. i wish i had had my camera along, for those would have been among the best photos ever taken.  the object then gradually moved directly away from us at an upward angle toward the mountain range then picked up speed rapidly until it was just a light in the sky, and made an instantaeous 90 degree turn to the left and zipped out of sight.\r\n\r\nlater that morning, when the radio stations began broadcasting, all they talked about were the hundreds of ufo sightings reported along the entire eastern seaboard from canada down through maine and into new england.  the official air force explanation reported about what we saw was \"luminous gas from a factory\". i know what i saw clearly that night, and it was a solid craft of some sort, not \"luminous gas\".\r\n\r\nalthough i did not experience any fear during the event, i had recurring nightmares involving ufos and burning rays being shot from them (very thatrical) for many years, always the same helpless feeling.  i haven't had those dreams for decades now, but i think of the event often.  i located the friend who was with me about 20 years ago just to ask him if

when pulling out onto 9w the car is inclined up so you are looking straight out the front windshield over the building on the other side of the road, the prentice hall building. there was a row of bright large rectangular windows with about a 2:1 hight to width ratio. at this time i was finishing my studies in aircraft design, so i tried to think of what it was that i saw. the only thing that came into mind was the gondola of a blimp. i don't recall why we couldn't see the shape, but i couldn't and was most fixed on the windows. we lowered the windows to see if we could hear the engines, but it was dead silent. we also could not determine as how far it was from us, so i drove the car across the highway to the left side of the prentice hall building while sticking our heads out and looking up to see if it would pass over us. it had been moving to the north an a crawling speed. we didn't see it pass over us and when we got into the prentice hall parking lot we got out of the car and looked in every direction and there was no sight of it. when i went to school, i asked a professor if blimps fly at night, and he said: no! when i got home, i called langley fields in nj where the blimps are, and they also told me the same thing. i've always wondered what we saw that night and when i came across this web site i started checking it out and found several similar reports in this area over the last 30+ years and one only a few blocks away on the same highway, and one a few miles away near the gw bridge.","distance":"101-500

the incident was somewhat disturbing to me and i kind of wanted to keep it to myself.  it happen in mcalister park san antonio on date a time noted on this form. resent incident in texas and san antonio have convinced me to share this story. i also view your organization as a creditable to properly investigate this base on resent news stories.I would like to retain my anonymity for now but will corporate with any investigate.\r\n\r\ni was in my favorite park today and i went to look for the black stone i had thrown away there. when i reached the spot were i recalled throwing it i realized that the brush there was pretty thick. yet i had a strong urge to negotiate the brush and fine the stone. so i assumed the stone was calling me. as i found my way deep into the brush to the spot i felt i was being called to i began to look on the ground. i glanced up for a second a noticed what seemed to be an insect made purely of light. it flew directly in front of my face and paused as though it was trying to give me a better look.  i looked harder. ���jesus, jesus, jesus!!��� i said out loud. ���what is that?!��� i continued. then it suddenly occurred to me to ask it. ���what are you?��� i asked the little light thingy. ���i am a fairy,��� it replied telepathically. my thoughts and feelings where in an uproar. the thing began to fill my head with wisdom and information which at the time was clear but now seems vague. ���why are these things happening to me? i done completely lost my mind this time.  no one will ever believe this one.��� just then the light thingy spoke again, ���take a picture��� it said. as a pulled out my camera phone to take the picture it flew right up to the lens.  just then i saw that there were two of these things. as i watched the one on the right the other one flew off two the left. the one on the right disappeared. i looked to my left to see if the other one had disappeared also. it was no where to be found. ���here i am��� it said. i looked at a leaf on a tree and there it was. it looked like a small piece of lint or something so i blew on it. i didn���t move. i blew on it again. it didn���t move again. ���take another picture if you���d like��� it said. i did. i was about to place the leaf with the light thingy back in the tree when it said, ���i want to go with you���.  i switched the leaf with the fairy on it to my other hand in order to reach in my pocket to clear a space to carry it. my intention was to put this thing under a microscope and do a complete investigation. all on the sudden i felt a burning sensation on my hand with the leaf in it. the fairy had crawled on to my hand and it was burning me. my reflexes took control and tried to brush it away. i smashed it and it was spread across the palm of my hand. i had i feeling of great sadness come over me and was begging for forgiveness and understanding. the area on my hand where to thing was smashed was still burning. as i reached to wipe it off on my pants,��� it said, ���rub me on your skin around your heart���.  after i complied with its instructions it said, ���now you can take me with you���. \r\n\r\nupdate:  since this incident i have been compelled to pick up trash on the ground. i even pulled my car over one time and cleaned up the garbage that was thrown in a wooded area. today at the post office i picked up all the trash out front. i was just there to mail a letter.  i���m also finding the information given to me at the time can be recalled if i am asked the correct question.\r\ni did not included this in the story but when you look at the picture please note that the dead leaf began to come to life as the being crawled up the leaf.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

awakened @ approximately 3am while sleeping on tv room couch by our television and lights acting eratically.  there was a strange hum coming from the plasma television...Far louder than usual start-up hum you would associate with that kind of electronics.  \r\n\r\ngot up and started upstairs to get a flashlight, because i believed we were having electrical issues and the power was about to go out.  upon reaching the top of the stairs i was greeted by a strange green-blue light that was flashing outside.   it looked to be originating to the south of us (the windows i was looking out were on the north side) and in the general direction of fredericton, but the flash covered the entire sky for about 4 seconds and only slowly oscillated in color and intensity.  it was at this time that our house lights flickered and dimmed and then went out...While our neighbors lights across the street and to each side of us, stayed on.  strange.  i'd place the time of this happening no later than 3:05 atlantic.\r\n\r\nby this time, the wife was up, asking if i'd seen what she had from the bedroom and we both commented on the strange quality of the light and the strange effects (apparent electrical interference, etc).  our lights came back on after a couple of minutes and i walked outside to see if anything had happened to our power line coming off the local pole or at its contact point at the side of the house.  no issues.  there was a moderately high wind, but none of the lines were moving more than normal and no trees or branches are close to our lines.\r\n\r\ni'd place the time by now at 3:15-3:18.  the power now went off along the entire block.  looking across the ridge from our location we could tell that the entire area was impacted.  by 3:20-ish i noted the sound of a large 4 engined aircraft orbiting above the cloud cover and believe it was a c-130 hercules dispatched out of cfb gagetown, a relatively short distance away. large aircraft are not known to transit over our area, much less linger.  puddle jumpers yes, large multi-engines are rare.  another 'out of the ordinary' for this early morning.  thinking that we may have had a tree across the lines, i got in the truck to find the location so we could report it to nb power.  no sooner had i gotten to the bottom of the hill (about 3:35 am) than i came face to face with an nb power panel truck sitting by the side of the road.  my first thought was 'wow, that's extreemly fast reaction to trouble calls'...My second thought was 'there was no way anyone could have reacted that fast to a recent call.'  regardless, he was johnny on the spot with his trucks yellow light flashing, parked at the intersection of mccleod hill rd and hillview dr.  \r\n\r\nas it was still dark and there was someone on the scene, i went back home and waited for daybreak to see what was what.  a trouble call put into nb power was answered by the automated system and gave 3:18 as the most recent other call in the area...Problem unknown.  a later call @ 5:00 am gave the most recent report as 4:20 with the explaination 'trees down on lines' and an estimated time of repair, which i fail to recall.  \r\n\r\njust after 7:30 am there was enough light to begin poking around and so i did.  the two breaks in the power lines closest to us were at the corner of mccleod hill rd and hillview dr. and about 1/4 of a mile to the nnw on mccleod hill rd.  at both locations the only line impacted was the center line of three power lines, and the break of line occured dead center between power poles.  the areas where the breaks occured were well cut back at one location, with no evidence of live or dead fall in the area of the break - and cut well below the level of the power lines in the other break area...Again with no branches or trees down.  as stated, only the center lines were impacted and were spliced/bridged in short order.\r\n\r\nmore than that cannot be relayed, due to cloud cover.  it should be mentioned that no local transformers were tripped during the incident and no lightning was reported that night.  furthermore, it was strange in that most of our neighbors were awakened by the light and that it was a strange enough occurence to merit discussion across the community about our 'little green visitors'.  evidently, few others thought it was lightning.\r\n\r\nshortly after the incident occured, nb power took down 3 complete grids, affecting more than 1100 homes in the area, on the pretext that there was only a single power control point to deactivate in order to facilitate repairs...And this long before any crews would have responded.  and no trees across the lines (at least in our area).  curious and leaves me wishing it was a clear night!\r\n\r\nphotos were taken of the repair areas, showing the splices done by the crews and the ground under and around the breaks.  they can be provided, but do not show the crews in action, or any great detail.  the only thing they show is no material of any sort impacting the lines.  \r\n\r\nfinally, being ex-military, i am well aware that there is powerful aew equipment on modified hercules and other large aircraft that can easily disrupt local power if 'lit-off' by accident. however, i'd be inclined to think that any kind of surge from that equipment would have messed with transformers as well... \r\n\r\nthat's all i have to report.  come to your own conclusions, and if you're a 'local' you can now rest assured that 'yes...Someone else saw what you saw.'

taken a silver dollar at arms length to cover the object from fore to aft. it was traveling s. to n. at what appeared, from my perspective, a slow rate of flight. i first observed it at about the 10:00 position off the southern horizon and observed it to approx. the 2:00 position. total elapse time was approx. 45 seconds. i took my eyes off just long enough to shush the barking dog and when i
