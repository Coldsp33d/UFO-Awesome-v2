in stephenville.  i can't believe people are just noticing these objects in the sky. back in july of last year '07, my brother came home shaken up because he and my sister in law, and her brother, saw numerous flying objects hovering the sky.  they all said they looked like hundreds of little lights zig zagging around so fast there was no way it could be man operated. i believed him, so for the next two days i took my son's telescope and started looking at the sky around sunset time.  the second evening in july,sure enough, my son and i spotted these objects just like my brother described...Right over plano!  i also noticed what looked like air force jets coming from different directions as if trying to surround these objects one by one.  everytime the jets got close to one, the objects sped off behind a cloud and disappeared. i finally figured it must have been the air force practicing manuevers up there, and that's exactly what i told my son.  \r\n \r\ni haven't told anyone about this, being that people just don't talk about these things or they may think i'm making it up-it's best to forget about it.    \r\n \r\nthis is because of another personal account, back in my hometown in midland, texas.  we lived on a 4 acres of farming land. i was only about 10 yrs old, my sister, 7.  this was 29 years ago.  today's my b-day. therefore, this was back in 1979. my sister and i actually saw one of these actually land on our property about 10 feet from our window!  \r\n \r\nit was dark outside, and i remember these bright lights coming into our room from the window, sort of like when a police car has their patrol lights on, but much brighter.  we both opened the curtain we just sat there and stared at it in shock, like in a trance.  to tell the truth, i don't recall how long we stared at it but this thing was was about 12' x 12' and looked just like the typical saucer-shaped ufo that i later learned has been described in sightings. it was round disk-like, grey  and had like christmas colored lights rotating around it, which were blinking at the same time as they were rotating around its mid-circumference.  then it moved straight up and jetted off so fast into the sky it was as if it disappeared right before our eyes.  my sister and i finally screamed and our mom came to find out what the heck was going on, but when we told her she told us to quit making stuff up, and that it must have been our imagination, and go to sleep. my sister was still crying so i told her it must have been her imagination and that i didn't see anything. after all these years, we finally talked about it and she said she saw a red glowing ball come to the window, hover, then head out toward the 'caliche pits' which is a place we kids were prohibited from going to. if i recall correctly this is a highly radioactive dumping ground, at least that's what the sign said. anyway, i asked her if she saw the christmas lights blinking around it, and she said she only saw a bright red glowing ball.  i don't understand why she saw one thing and i saw another.  \r\n \r\nthe next day, out of curiousity, i went to the spot where it had landed and noticed the ground being like very dry powder (reminded me of ground cinnamon) and it was in the shape of a big round circle!  also out of curiousity,  i took a water hose and sprayed it, and the water only floated on top of the powdered ground, it would never soak it up like normal dirt. another strange thing is that two of my pet cats and other animals from my dad's farm turned up missing.  my dad said it must have been the neighborhood dogs who ate them or something. it took me and my sister about 3 years to quit talking about it, but eventually we did.  we just talked about it one more time about 3 days ago. \r\n \r\nto this day, this is the first time i tell anyone about that experience as an adult.  i don't want my testimony getting around either.  i've come to realize this was a personal experience and not to really be shared with anyone-it's also best to forget about it. \r\n \r\nanyway, thank you for reading my story and i hope you continue your efforts in catching one.  although i know it will be impossible because of their velocity of speed. besides, they are millions of light years more intelligent than we are.  they are just curious about us, just like i was when i was a kid and checking out their landing spot. \r\n\r\ncrisann garcia \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Patterned

front of me after i ordered.Something dark in the sky floating in front of where i was sitting caught my attention.I first thought \"what is that?Black balloons floating in a cluster?\" then it started slowly turning in a circular motion,so my next thought to myself was to wonder if it was  black trash bags.(and there was no sound or smoke trail of any kind)but i could tell after it spun a couple times it was boomerang shaped because there was a big space in the middle.I know it was not a stealth because i use to do security at a military airport where they use to test unmanned airplanes,and they had a stealth flying there one time.After i could'nt figure out what it was,i pulled out my cell phone and called my mom and told her to go outside to see if she could see it to figure out what it was because it was slowly going towards the direction of our houses.I got my food from the drive thru,drove off,and did'nt see the object again for about 5 minutes.I had pulled into my drive way,took my baby in the house,then came back to the car for my food.I looked up again and there it was going towards the freeway,(going towards vegas)but it looked higher up in the sky this time. then while watching it,it looked like it split into aty least five round objects, and then went back together into one.Then i went in the house because it was gettiing a bit farther away from me caring to stand out in the cold. i tried to call my mom again to see if she had seen it,and she did'nt because she had a house full of kids distracting her.This is something i would'nt have seen in the first place if it had not been directly in front of me at the time.I was not scared when i saw it because i did'nt know what it was,and could'nt figure out was it was.\r\n","distance":"101-500

just dropped a friend off on the road behind his house on boston st. after dropping him off on the corner, i had decided to go to little caesars to grab a pizza to take home. i only drove about a block when i saw 2 headlights flying close over the trees to my right. my first thought was boy that plane is pretty low. then i noticed it stopped and turned, when it did this.. it exposed the whole underbelly of the craft. other then the 2 headlight that were on the side of the craft as you could see from the side.. from the bottom i saw 1 white light at each point and a big round red dome light directly in the center of the craft. so i rolled my window down and turned of my heater. so, i could hear for any engine.. but, there was no noise from this thing. then it sorta glided like a air hockey puck away from me, then it stopped again, glided a little bit and stopped again.. by this time i had turned my jeep around and started chasing it i got to a stop sign and was there for no more then 4 seconds and lost the craft behind a tree and when i turned the corner it was no longer insight.. i lost it. i went home and called up a friend to come over i had something i had to tell him. when he got there about 40 min. later.. i took him to where i had seen it and explained to him everything that happened. we both saw it again, off in the distance near the riverside jail, it was above the woods that; fort lee owns in front of the jail.. when we saw it. i knew exactly what it was so i told him to catch up to it. we got on the main road and was pacing it. when we saw a stoplight up ahead... we sped up just a little to hit the light and make a left on miles ave. to go toward the craft but, the craft never made it to the stoplight. so it had to have change direction again...We lost it. it's still hard for me to believe that i have now seen 2 ufos' in pretty much the exact same spot with in the last 8 years.\r\n     i reported the last 1 to mufon as well. boy.. i sure hope you guys take this as serious as i have because i am pretty damn scared at this point. i went snooping for insight at the airport in richmond besides getting the run around and being laughed at. i did learn that what i had seen, most likely did not show up on radar ..At least thats what i have been told.                                                              p.S. i do not think it was alien, i do think it was military.

road in north wales, pa, 19454, towards the montgomeryville mall when we observed what we at first believed to be a stationary object hovering over a field on the southern side of the road. thinking it was a helicopter we paid it no attention until we noticed that it was moving in a trajectory parallel to ours, directly above the treeline and clearing the uppermost branches by no more than 20 feet. we slowed down in order to see if we might get a closer look at what this 'helicopter' was investigating, only to discover that its appearance was unlike any conventional aircraft. it was comprised of a triangular array of 3 deep blue lights with a white central light; the white light came from a circular 'panel' maybe six or more feet in diameter. there were no flashing navigation lights. eventually we slowed down until we could see the silhouette of the craft against the skyglow behind - a perfect equilateral triangle. by this time the object was about 150 to 300 feet away, maybe 60 or 80 feet from point to point, and probably matching our speed (considering its position relative to the car was unchanged during our deceleration and subsequent acceleration). in 1997 i was 12 years old, and after several minutes of watching this vessel appear to 'shadow' our car i began to grow very afraid and asked my mother to speed up and leave. she told me that we were probably seeing nothing more than an ordinary helicopter, and rolled down her window to prove her point. upon hearing nothing, she slowed the car to a crawl, but there was no sound of rotors; the air was perfectly calm and the object was still silently floating along the treeline. the appearance of the craft and its failure to produce any noticeable sound despite its proximity soon convinced my mother and i that we were not looking at anything we could easily explain, and we entertained a number of frightening ideas as to its origins (one obvious explanation standing out above the rest) before becoming too frightened to continue watching. we accelerated, the object apparently matching our speed before it disappeared, although neither of us can remember seeing it move off. most likely it stopped following the treeline and was obscured by the forest as the trees neared the road. 40 14 20 n, 75 12 w.

appeared to orbit in two loose (think constellation-sized) formations moving from the eastern horizon to the west. there is significant light pollution in tyler, and the satellites were visible between the clouds. there were so many objects that i initially thought the objects were stars and that the clouds were moving instead of the objects. one formation appeared to be in a roughly triangular configuration, and the other looked like what i'm calling a \"medium\" dipper. they were not terribly far apart, and could actually have both been small parts of an even larger formation. i call the objects satellites because that is what they most closely resemble: small, steady points of light, moving silently across the sky a few hours before dawn. i was able to confirm the objects' motion against background stars, and if i recall correctly, stars were visible between individual objects. according to heavens-above.Com, there was to be \"nothing\" brighter than a +4.5 magnitude satellite (i understand that their listing is incomplete, without many classified satellites as well as boosters, etc., but chances are, if you can see a satellite in urban skies, it's listed.) going in that direction in that part of the sky. the dimmest objects had to have been a +2 magnitude to be visible at all in the cloudy, light-polluted sky.  they were over our heads and behind us in a matter of minutes. following closely behind the cluster was a much brighter object that had an orange tint to it (think lacrosse). this could be a manmade debris field in a low orbit, but from what? an nro satellite was launched a little more than a week before the date of this sighting. please let me know your thoughts, and thank you for taking a look at my

hovered in one place for a long time over the golf course, hundreds of feet in the air and about 400 yards away from my home. it was quiet outside and i heard no sounds of an airplane engine or helicopter. it was just baffling to me what it was! it was too high in the sky to be a crane or man made device, but it was also close enough to me that i should have been able to hear it, if it was indeed, a helicopter. it was simply a bright, clearly circular, white light that simply would not move from its position. it just stayed still. \r\n\r\ni showed it to my wife and to both of my kid's and even filmed it, but later on i could not see on the film much more than i saw up close, as the lens went in and out of focus and it was dark outside. after awhile, i went inside, as it was cold and i had been outside for about 30 minutes watching it. i came out about an hour later, but this time the light had shifted about a half mile southeast of its earlier location. it was no longer over the golf course, but had moved to what seemed like it was over the main street of our town. again, it would not move and just hovered still. i called the moorestown police and i asked if anyone else had reported seeing anything in the sky over moorestown. the operator told me \"no\", and i asked her to have someone check it out. i never heard back from the police and i never heard of anyone else reporting what i had seen either.\r\n\r\nfor years, i did not know who to report it to and i always thought that if it were a real ufo certainly many people would have noticed it that night. however, not many people are out on cold, dark winter nights and they usually would not be paying attention to the sky. perhaps i was the only one who did notice it that night.\r\n\r\nin any case, i am glad to finally tell somebody about this incident.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9130,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9777117,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212008-0028","longitude":-74.947486,"occurred":915161400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

possibly 11 years old.  here is why i know my age, keep in mind that i was born in 1953.\r\n\r\ni'm 54 now, so you can see it's been a long time ago. i wasn't\r\nthe only one who saw them. my mother saw them also, who passed away in 1976. the only reason that i can tell you a time frame since it's been so many years ago is because we went to the drive-in movie in south fort worth called the southside drive-in, with our good friends.  i remember the movie that was showing was \"tom jones,\" which is dated 1963. i remember this because i hated it and my mother hated it. i was too young to be interested in it back then. i was sitting next to her in the back seat of a large station wagon that our friends had.  \r\n\r\nboth my mother and i saw the two ufos around the same exact time. i'll never forget that. needless to say that was a whole lot more interesting than the movie!\r\n\r\nwhy do i think they were ufos? it's weird that i can still visualize this,\r\nbut i can see them clearly. we were looking at the drive-in screen and to\r\nthe upper left of the screen in the sky, one oval-shaped ufo came up of\r\nwhat appeared to be several inches above the movie screen. of course, it\r\nwas probably a good distance. then, directly to the left of that one,\r\nanother one came up, same shape and everything, but they were not quite even in their hovering.  both were exactly the same appearance, oval-shaped, luminous objects, no other colors at all, just light-colored luminous objects. they hovered there for several minutes. it was one of those type of things that you cannot take your eyes off of and you're actually speechless. \r\n\r\nthen, the first one that came, went up and a little bit to the right, although upwards, and took off so quickly, then the other one did the same thing, both flying off together. it was almost simultaneous, but yet a little variance between the two. it happened so quickly. from what i am remember, they came from the east.\r\ni looked at my mother and said, did you see that, mama?\r\nshe replied, yes, do not say anything!  and that was in a very low voice but emphatic.\r\nit really did scare her. i wasn't scared, and i wanted to talk about it.\r\nwe talked about it when we got home, but she made me promise to never mention it to anyone. i'm sure she thought they'd think that we were crazy. however, i did mention it to my daddy, who just listened intently.  i don't feel that he thought that at all.  he just knew that we both saw something extremely unusual, and i think that he wished that he could have seen it too!\r\napparently, our friends that we were with didn't see it. my mom's\r\nlady friend was in the front seat watching the movie all the time.  since one rolled up on a little hill to park your car to watch a movie (remember, it's a drive-in), i still don't know if she could have seen it, honestly, unless she was looking in that direction and bending her neck down.  i had wished my mother would have said something anyway.  it's possible that others at the drive-in or anywhere else saw it, though.  that's the only reason that i'm posting this incidence. \r\ni can never forget this, but i don't talk about it much. i've told my husband, who himself thinks that he's seen a ufo also in his teenage years.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

the distance i thought i heard the banging of native drums.  i thought it was an aircraft from the nearby airforce base, but it wasn't shaped like a regular plane.  it was ovular and massive.  after seeing the object, i stopped riding.  off in the distance over the soccer fields, i noticed that it stopped moving.  then a light shone down onto the snowy field, and vaporized all the snow.  i contacted the airforce base in chickopee to ask if there was a large object in the area.  they responded by saying there was not.

 it had lights running, maybe out little windows at the top. you could not see the bottom of this craft because it was sitting just 3 ft or so above water.  so there were no visible doors or windows except what the light was coming from, which was not normal. the fact that nothing was in between the huge heavy craft which was quite tall and rounded but we did not see all around it and sitting abbove water seemed impossible. it was silent but running because of the lights moving. we thought of everything it could possibly be in minutes and narrowed it down very quickly to a ufo fueling up on the electricity from the currents down in the water. i wondered why we saw no one.  even the plant looked vacant and no one was looking out that one window.  the view would have drawn a crowd.  i would say in about 5 minutes we figured out we were in front of a huge ufo and we had to get away fast.  my curfew was 11 pm that night.  i got home approx 10:20 or 10:30 because my mother commented she didn't expect to see me early.  i told her what i saw and why.  she sort of acted like she believed me.  i never spoke to the boyfriend again after that, but i'm sure he must remember the last time we were together to this day.  this is the absolute truth and if anyone has had any experience similar to mine in that area i want to hear about it.  i went on about life, but anytime there was any ufo reported, i would know i was not the only one who believes and will to the day i die.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9126,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.812315,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212008-0024","longitude":-96.761003,"occurred":115628400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":115628400000,"summary":"Mt crk lake - dallas tx 1973","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Dallas, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:413589"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2478}
