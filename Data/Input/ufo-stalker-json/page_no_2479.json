and a half into our flight when, as we flew north (i was piloting the aircraft and tom was tending to the navigation)we began to encounter some clouding conditions and zero visibility. i immediatly changed our heading 180 degrees. a moment later ( or so it seemed ) tom said to me \" what time have you got?\" i immediatly felt as though i had just been awoken. i was trying to gather my thoughts when tom said \" hey, your watch is stopped\" i looked at my wrist watch and it was stopped at 7:25 , which alarmed me as i had used it earlier to check our departure time. i looked at all of our

beautiful day in july of 1979.  i was driving my dad's car to a nearby town.  my 4 year old son was in the back seat.  he was sitting right behind me.  as we drove along a short stretch of straight road that had few houses, mostly fields, he kept asking me \"mommy what's that?\"  i looked in my rear view mirror and noticed that he was looking up out of his window.  without looking where he was looking i just answered \"a bird\", \"a phone wire\".  he asked me again \"mommy what's that?\"  this time i looked out of my window and looked up.  to my amazement i saw a chrome silver coloured object in the sky hovering above us.  i can remember how beautiful the blue sky was against this object.  it was barbell shaped\r\n(cylinder shaped body with round balls at each end of the cylinder).  i watched it as i drove.  we had to drive about a quarter mile before i could stop.  it followed us around a bend and over a bridge.  when i pulled the car over and got out it started rising straight up until it was out of sight.  it made no noise.  \r\n\r\ni tried to make sense of what it could have been at the time when my son asked me \"mommy what's that?\"  i do remember being very excited.

recorded the date as 4/19/07 and the time as 2:03pm.  the date is correct, and the time is at least approximately correct.  the location is county road 308 in blanco county, texas.  the approximate direction of the road is north.\r\n\r\nthe photographer used the viewfinder to compose a scenic picture consisting of the dirt road, the bluebonnets, the tree & the clouds above the road.  she was unaware of the image above the tree on the extreme right.\r\n\r\nour pictures were downloaded from the camera to our computer shortly after our return home.  a few days later, we were viewing the pictures on our computer monitor for the purpose of culling and editing them.  only then did we notice the image above the tree in the picture.  when we zoomed in, we realized that it had a very defined shape, with clear, sharp edges.\r\n\r\nour first thought was that this could be glare or reflection on the camera lens.  closer examination showed that there were clouds between the camera and the image, which seems to disprove that idea.  i refer to ���image��� instead of ���object��� because the sheer size seems to rule out anything capable of flying.\r\n\r\nthe only other explanation we could think of was that this could be the shadow of a conventional aircraft between the sun and the top of the clouds, but the clouds in that area of the sky are not solid enough to allow such a smooth & well-defined shadow.  also, a shadow should be black; and an aircraft would have to be huge for a shadow that size.\r\n\r\nalthough i have made references to the enormous size of the image, we have no way to make any kind of estimate.  the angle between the camera and the image indicates considerable horizontal distance, and its location above the clouds indicates considerable vertical distance; yet the image is very prominent in the picture.  we have nothing which would indicate speed or direction of travel, if any.  it was a very bright day, so automatic exposure time would be nil.\r\n\r\nthere is a white or light-colored streak running diagonally across the image and extending down into the area behind the treetop.  it looks very much like a thin tornado.  we originally could only imagine a nose-down delta wing aircraft shape.  after much review, there seems to be no reason to assume that the dark object extends down behind the white streak, which allows the concept of a different shape.  the streak does not appear to be a cloud.\r\n\r\nwe made 85 pictures in that general area (texas hill country) on that day, but none of the others include that image.  had we known it was there, we would have dozens of pictures!\r\n\r\nthe attachments are as follows:  \r\n(1)   exact copy of original;\r\n(2)   cropped portion of original;\r\n(3)   cropped portion with gamma adjustment to enhance detail.\t\t\r\n\r\nwe make no claims as to the nature of the image; only that these pictures are not posed and are not ���doctored��� in any way except as noted above.  we are interested in finding a reasonable explanation.  these pictures were shown to a camera shop owner in tyler, who did not believe the image could be a problem with the camera.  they were also shown to the kltv weatherman in tyler, who did not think it was a weather phenomena.  neither could offer a suggestion as to the nature of the image.\r\n\r\n\t","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9117,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.5817446,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212008-0015","longitude":-98.2651803,"occurred":1177016580000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1177016580000,"summary":"Picture

and fishing and leisure community, is located between odense and mainland denmark, far south, near the german border.  there are few modern conveniences, and 95% of the buildings on the entire island (which i was able to bike in a few days) are 19th century or earlier, and many farmsteads.  the island had one unique modern convenience, windmills.  sleek, tall, white, and more or less randomly scattered around the island.  there have been people on the island for centuries, and there are several viking sites scattered around as well.\r\n\r\nour experience occurred early to mid morning.  i cannot recall the exact date and time of the event.  there were six people who witnessed the event, including myself, who set out for an extended bike ride around the island.  we left the main hub town, where a ferry ports from the mainland, and headed along a rural bike path, near the water (which was never that far away).  we ended up making some wrong turn and stopped to consult a map.  at this moment one of the members of the group directed our attention, and eyes, to a strange cloud formation maybe a mile away, asking ���what is that?��� the cloud, dark and heavy like a rain cloud, was over a field of wheat or some grain.  the cloud was at a normal height and unremarkable size, and was comparable to other clouds we had seen on the island, and presently near it.  the cloud itself was not that unusual.  what was unusual was a long cylindrical ���tube��� that came down towards the ground.  the tube did not taper like a tornado, but was consistent in diameter, like a hose.  the weather conditions were fair, maybe a bit windy being a sparsely treed island, but nothing near a storm.  it came down quite a ways and appeared near the ground, maybe several hundred feet above-hard to measure.  what was strange is that the tube didn���t appear affected by the wind around us, or near the trees on the edges of the field we noticed it above.  also, when the tube began to move, it seemed to have an independent motion and speed than the surrounding environment.  it almost looked alive. \r\n\r\nno one in the group (aged 21 to mid 50���s) had every seen anything like this.  the moment was a stand still, we were all dumfounded.  as we watched the tube in disbelief it began to ���recoil��� in much the same way a snails eye retracts into the head of the snail, kind of whipping about like a hose, but slower.  at this point we took some pictures, as it neared the mass of cloud.  in one picture you can clearly see a circle of cloud, this was a ���cross section��� of the tube, as it recoiled and the ���opening��� at the bottom of the tube faced our direction, right before it was engulfed into the cloud.  \r\nafter a period of possibly 3 to 10 minutes (very hard to tell how long) the cloud returned to normal, leaving no signs of unusual activity.  \r\nthere was a range of emotional reactions to the event.  the older people felt like not discussing the event, or offering any type of speculation as to what had happened.  the younger 20 years olds, myself in this category, were quick to assume some ufo related event.  it certainly was an electric sensation, the sensation of seeing something totally new and otherworldly that was undeniable happening in front of you.\r\n\r\nwe never saw any ���ufo��� during this part of the event.  only when i zoomed in to the pictures later that evening did i notice an ���orb��� an only after getting the images onto a computer did i notice the second ���orb���.  \r\nno one in the village town that we talked to had any similar experiences.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i read about the ufo event in stephenville, tx, i thought it was the right time in my life to report my own ufo encounter i've kept quiet about for almost 35 years. i'm thankful mufon exists, and i'm not alone in the world as a credible witness to such amazing events.\r\n\r\ni recall my age as about 12 or 13, so it must have been about 1972 or 1973.  it was a pleasant and clear-sky spring or summer day, i believe, and mid- to late afternoon.  memory a bit hazy on this.\r\n\r\ni was sitting on the ground in the middle of a large green space made up of at least three or four contiguous baseball fields. at the time, these fields were located between brentwood shopping center on winton road, and the intersection of winton and galbraith roads, in finneytown, ohio���a northern suburb of cincinnati, ohio. the field was next door to my home.\r\nso, there i was, in this field, reading a book.  reading was and is my passion, and i often visited this area to do this. at the time, i was on the only person present in this vast expanse of grass.\r\n\r\nwhile engaged in reading, for some reason i felt compelled to suddenly look in the sky. i think it must have been the flashing lights i saw when i did so. seems that in this clear sky i saw a bright blue or red light with a ghostly gray object somehow behind it; no defined shape to it as it must have been too high in the sky. but it was blinking or flshing rapidly. then another light joined it in the sky. and they were moving about above and in front of me; as if their lights were for me to see. \r\n\r\nat one point, both lights were to the left; then suddenly, they ���jumped��� to the right side of the sky as if they were instantly transported to that point in space, or had travelled at speed of light and then somehow put on super-brakes once they reached their destination in the sky. i did not have to move my head to watch them move back and forth; and somehow this fact made me think that they were very close to me. they'd also appear close together in front of me in the sky.\r\n\r\nthey made no sound. i remember that detail very well.\r\n\r\nmy first thought upon seeing all this was curiosity; then i was just caught up with the strangeness of the sight for a few minutes without a sense of fear.  but as my mind began to grasp the reality of the situation, i became fearful without hysterics. i couldn���t believe what i was seeing, and knew that i had to get someone else to confirm that this strange event was really happening���and to get somewhere safe. i believed i was seeing ufos, and there was a pattern of intelligence in the movements.\r\n\r\nso after at least 10 minutes of watching what i believe were up to three ufos, i ran back to my home. it took less then 5 minutes to get to my front door. upon entering my home i quickly and earnestly shared what had happened with my mother. \r\n\r\ni led my mom to the back bedroom on the second floor, which had a window facing the baseball fields and another window a few feet away on the adjacent wall. together the windows gave us a good view of the outside.\r\nright away, from that vantage point, mother and i both saw one cigar-shaped, matte-gray (not shiny) flying object come into view directly in our line of sight on our same plane. it was very close, and not blurry to our eyes at all. none of the others was seen.\r\n\r\ni do recall it had a few rapidly blinking lights (i think they were blue) arranged in a straight, vertical line. it was difficult to determine its size; but if i had to guess i���d say about 20 feet long.  relatedly, it was difficult to tell how far away it was from us; perhaps at least 50 to 70 feet.  it was very close to the second-floor bedroom window; and stayed still for at least 10 seconds in plain sight; just hovering, as if it knew ���i��� was in there. (at least that���s how i felt!)  then it slowly moved away then shot off as if into nothingness.\r\n\r\nwe continued to watch the sky but did not see any more flying objects after this one took off.\r\n\r\nmy mother had the presence of mind to call the university of cincinnati to find out if there had been reports of any ufo sightings. i don���t recall which department she called; neither does she; but it would make sense that she might have contacted a scientist at this large institution. \r\n\r\nanyhow, surprisingly, she was told by a gentleman at the school that they had received many reports of ufo sightings that day from throughout the city! we were not alone in this experience apparently. no further contact was ever made by the school to us, or vice versa. this was the only organization we contacted; no police were involved in making a report as i think mom didn���t want us to be seen as being delusional or crazy citizens.\r\n\r\nmy mother did not get hysterical during this entire episode, but she was excited.  when i talked to her last week about it, she did say she remembered seeing a ufo but did not recall the details like i did. she did say she thought it was cigar shaped, though. (back then she was about 40 years old and is now in her 70s and in good health.)\r\n\r\ni was sad to see that there were no reports of ufo sightings in our local daily paper, the cincinnati enquirer; at least i didn���t see any. nor did view any stories on tv news or radio programs. looking back, i���m not sure if people just didn���t contact the media���or they did, and the media decided to not cover the sightings.\r\n\r\nafter this amazing encounter, i took out every ufo book i could find from the bookmobile. i recall reading about project blue book in particular. (side  note: can't believe all official govt. investigations are closed.)  by reading such materials i thought i would validate what we had encountered and give us some sort of answers to questions that were understandably gnawing at us.  at the very least, again, i discovered that we weren���t the only people to see similar ships, and that the details of these sightings had some commonalities with other sightings. \r\n\r\nas i grew up, i discovered a new attraction towards sci-fi novels and any type of space exploration tv shows. today, i am an ardent fan of the sci-fi channel, and very open to the idea that we���ve probably been contacted by other-worldly civilizations���but our government is mum about such activities. that���s my take on the matter. i'm also a catholic, but do not know how to integrate this experience into my faith life.\r\n\r\nmom and i share a high level of esp ability, and later i found out i qualified for mensa. i do wonder if those were factors in us being \"chosen\" to see them--or was it all chance?\r\n\r\nthank you for the opportunity to share my story. it���s not as thrilling or mind-boggling as many of your reports for ohio, but in some small way i hope it encourages others to come forward to tell others about their experiences. i still do fear ridicule for telling the truth.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":9110,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1092582,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212008-0008","longitude":-84.5090196,"occurred":76143600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,  Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":76143600000,"summary":"Multiple ufos with strobe lights zipping overhead me  in cincinnati baseball fields, hovering above in formation. witnessed by teen & her mother.","tags":["ufo","lights","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Mexico_City","timeZoneName":"America/Mexico_City","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cincinnati, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:413636"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Lakeland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on my way home from sarasota around 7 pm last night. i was late getting out of sarasota so i exited i-75 at the brandon mall exit (highway 60)to save time. my mind was on getting home and not getting a ticket and listening to a cool cd that i had gotten yesterday afternoon. as i was driving, i remember thinking that i must tell a friend of mine that \"they\" are here and that \"they've\" been here for a very, very long time (from reading zecharia sitchin's books about the nefilim). then no sooner did i think that thought that i then looked up in the sky ahead of me between brandon and lakeland and all of a sudden something caught my eye and i thought \"boy that's weird, i've never seen an airplane with all of those colors.\" i kept watching it expecting that as i got closer that i would recognize that it was an airplane. then the next thing i thought was \"oh, my god... it's a ufo!\" my next thought as i tried to talk myself out of it was... \"that can't be a plane. i've never seen a plane shaped like that.\" then the colors all along the bottom started to spin around and around in a band all around the bottom of the craft with regulated intermittent black outs (like morse code only with colors that moved around the craft but they didn't blink). it looked oval or round in shape with a round domed top. the light band was all along the bottom occupying approximately 1/4 of the craft. the colors moved from left to right. there was some sort of dim light on the top but the bottom perimeter spun round and round with the blocks of color. then i thought again... \"oh, my god it is a ufo... why aren't people pulling off the highway? why aren't other people seeing this?\" i watched it up in the sky ahead of me until i had to turn off of highway 60 to reach my home in south lakeland. this is my account of my experience last night while driving between brandon and lakeland, florida on highway 60 at approximately 7:00.

the time in the mid 1980's and i can say it was around 1984 or 1985. i don't recall the exact month either. when this happened i sort of just dismissed it and put in the back of my head.\r\ni did not record any data.\r\n\r\ni lived in an area called 'top of the hill' in daly city, california. it's just next to san francisco, literally just a few blocks, but it belongs to the adjacent san mateo county. this area has a small hill facing east, to the north is san francisco and the open pacific ocean to the exact west, which i had a clear view to from my backyard.\r\n\r\ni used to practice an exercise routine on my backyard on the weekday evenings so it could have been a tuesday-friday. the weather was a little foggy , which is typical of this area in the spring, summer,and fall; with a light breeze and pleasant. the fog was not too low but high around 2000 feet...The night was quiet with only a few neighborhood sounds on the background. \r\n\r\ni don't know what made me turn around and look east towards the top of the hill, but there appeared a black triangle shaped object flying by. the triangle was metallic dark with a green glow around the edges and spinning in the most 'subtle' way, a slow spin while it flew overhead. there was absolutely no sound at all. just the spinning and flying-floating away. it was the size of a small house, 100 feet each side in the triangle.\r\n\r\nthe whole experience lasted only a few seconds..? it transversed from the east 'top of the hill' and headed west towards the pacific ocean until it disappeared into the horizon and fog. the speed was low as to float on air then it sped up into the ocean.\r\n\r\nit left me puzzled for a few minutes and then i tried to explain and use the laws of physics to categorize. it was not an airplane. not a helicopter. not a blimp. all the aircraft i have seen to date do not compare a bit. not even the 'new' stealth bombers that exist today and this was the mid 1980's. characteristics that stand out were: floating and spinning slowly as it flew overhead and total silence. not a buzz or engine, not even with wind changes to take into consideration. \r\n\r\ni was dumbfounded for a few minutes after. i told my brother about the incident at that time but left it there as a big question mark. the years have gone by and it's not until these days of internet that i was made aware that other people have seen similar objects. i don't know if others saw what i experienced then. i haven't found any information online. \r\ni am still curious what that was and if i was the only person looking up at that point. in a city like san francisco with the bay area having 5 million people i wonder how that went 'unnoticed'? is there more information?\r\ni wonder.

were coming.I never told my parents because they never listened to me.The night of the incident after midnight i quietly got my kodak brownie camera and my bike,and left the house.We lived at 4338 merrell rd.In dallas,texas.I waited at sexton and crestline on my bike for what was to come,i did not know what a ufo was.After an hour or so i saw a dark collaseum like object high in the sky with red lights come closer and hover over midway rd. and sexton ln.It had a loud circling sound,as it hovered it shot out a spotlight along the ground as if searching then it shot out rays of light blowing holes into the asphalt.People started to look out windows and come outside as i rolled my bike closer.A womans voice yelled out something from the ship then the spotlight found me.A strong force and a heavy sound without a light pulled me on the bike into the air.People were screaming as the force carried me high into the air until it ditched me in mexico.Then i saw the ship land so i walked a good distance to it.I took a picture of it with my camera.I walked up the platform ramp and went inside where i saw this very big woman and the aliens with big black eyes,long fingers,with skin like the texture of a whale or shark but not wet.They were the same size i was and seemed to have animal instincts like that of a cat. i became scared when they pushed me to a table where they opened my skin with their fingers it didn't hurt but it wasn't understandable.They stopped being forceful with me when i calmed down and they sensed that i wasn't afraid.They stopped looking at me and one of them took me to the center of the ship that was a crystal like opened area that flashed lights back and forth and hummed and then got louder.There was a small window where i literally saw the earth disappear into a tiny sphere then it was gone.The ship moved so fast it's hard to say.There were others of all ages on the ship that had been there a long time,some were scared of the woman others of the aliens.I got into a small circular ship with one of the aliens it had windows all around.It flew into a galaxy that had two suns and we landed on the planet that was a botanical nightmare. the plants moved and were dangerously grand.The alien became scared so we left. i'm trying to remember everything with time i will.The bigger ship landed back in the jungle so i walked out on the ramp where u.S. government men were yelling then one grabbed me and as the aliens came out they began rapid fire killing the aliens.They put me in a jeep with gov't guys that drove me through a thicket of jungle every now and then they had to stop and cut the path.They said the neighbors reported my abduction and they had several witnesses in mexico as to the location. i later learned they had tracked the ufo from airplanes and the radio.The woman was able to send radio contact from the ship.Of course they confiscated my camera and i've never seen the photos i took but they would have been great.They put me in a van with two guys from the c.I.A. that drove me back to dallas from mexico.They dropped me off at love field airport where i called my parents.They were furious since they thought i had ran away it seemed like i had been gone a few days when in fact it was more like a month.A few days later the guys came by the house with my bike and told my parents that i had been abducted. the neighborhood was in a frenzy so the gov't hauled me in and told me that i have to say that yes there was a ufo but to not give out other details. i had to talk to the media to as they say \"calm the people down\".I learned that as the force drew me up with the ship it had also pulled people out of they're beds onto the ceiling.One man held onto the side of his rooftop to keep from getting pulled up.The gov't moved alot of them out of their houses.Later i only saw one of the neighbors in high school\"ann\".I had many people stand by me that i had the experience other's like carl sagan badgered me to no end and called me a liar.I stood my ground then as well as now with people trying to hide behind their fears.You haven't seen it all until you've seen the earth disappear in the window. there's so much more missing that having a therapist would greatly help.Over the years i have said nothing to anyone,because i have not been able to remember.","distance":"101-500

pitch blackness of the night wondering just where my location could be if i was 10 minutes from houston. suddenly, a bright circle of light (like a headlight from a car) started falling straight down from the sky with extreme speed. my first impression was, \"where did this bright moon come from\". i quickly realized it was too bright and it was quickly falling straight down. i elbowed my wife and she saw a few seconds of the light falling. as i was watching the light, the wing of the 737 got in the way of my view. i thought to myself... \" i'll just wait until it reapears again under the wing\". to my surprise it did reapear for a second or two, but then, without slowing its' speed, it suddenly sped to the left (towards the back of the plane). the pattern was a perfect \"l\" (but backward). my wife looked at me and asked,\" what was that?\" i was shocked and spooked because i could not believe what i had just seen. i even forgot to mention it to the flight attendent or the pilots. i am pretty sure the pilot saw something also because it happened towards his frontal left side of his seat. needless to say, i was not able to sleep much that night just thinking over and

more than 20 years later. i had a nissan sentra that you could fold the back seat down and i had made that into a bed with foam pads (i'm small). i had just settled down, head to back of car, hatch up, was looking at sky through hatch window, looking generally east, when i noticed maybe six to ten white pts of light moving very strangely in relationship to each other. they were already there when i noticed them, so i don't know how long they had been there. i was extremely tired, was at that time a reporter and had just put in a 10 hour day getting the paper out. also, now know i was very ill with undiagnosed lyme disease. i know it sounds strange, but because of those things i could not stay awake and i went to sleep watching them. \r\n\r\ni first noticed the objects because of their number and the strange movement. i don't know how to describe it, i could make the motion with my hands for you if you were here. they were dancing with each other. in twos, but they'd change partners every so often. it was sort of like a swarm of gnats, but much more mechanical and regular. it was sort of like a couple of kids at camp with flashlights, playing tag with their lights on a wall, but again much more rhythmic and regular. very rhythmic. if you imagine two planets orbiting an unseen sun in same orbit, equidistant from each other, but they both reverse direction at each halfway point, that's as close as i can get to it. it was very hypnotic, as well, which might also explain how i could possible fall asleep watching them. \r\n\r\nmy first thought when i saw them was i was seeing insects very close to me, illuminated by the car's interior light. but then i turned the light off and saw that they were distant, over the hill line about 1/2 mile away. the hill line 1/2 mile away, the lights were clearly way up in the sky. i lost sight of the objects when i went to sleep. when i woke up next day, no sign of anything

from briceland ca. we had a house on a 40 acre parcel, no one else closer than that. we slept in the summer in an outside bed next to house, 360 degree view of sky, watched sky every night going to bed (so i'm very familiar with normal phenomena in the sky). one night, my husband was already asleep, but i was still watching stars, glasses on, extremely clear night, absolutely no chance of optical illusion. \r\n\r\ni noticed coming from the nnw, a red point of light. if it had not been moving, i would have thought it was a star. i knew it was not an airplane (moving too fast, no sound), a meteor (i've seen those, no tail), a shooting star (came steadily in an arc, not falling, maintained constant elevation, but was about as fast as a falling star) or the satillite we saw every now and then (faster, red, satillite is white). i drew an imaginary line in the sky, projecting its path to go right between the gap in the milky way. it did that, just after passing thru the gap, it made a rt angle turn more or less westerly and then disappeared in an instant. it all happened so fast i couldn't think to wake my husband to see it. \r\n\r\nwhat made me first notice the object was its motion. i would have looked at an airplane as well, but then i was riveted by how fast it was going.\r\nwhen i first noticed it i knew immediately it was nothing i'd ever seen before. could not see any particulars of it, no shape, pt of light only, bright red, redder than mars. constant motion until it turned.\r\n\r\ni did not have time to react before it was gone, but the instant it disappeared, my heart gave a huge jump, adrenalin shot all thru me, fight or flight reaction, knees weak. i grabbed my husband and shook him awake and was so excited i could barely tell him what happened. it took me hours to get to sleep and i've been avid about ufos ever since. i saw them again 20 years later, i assume you want me to file that separatley and i will right
