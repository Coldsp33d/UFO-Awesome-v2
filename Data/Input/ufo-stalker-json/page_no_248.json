outside my window. now in my neighborhood it isn't uncommon to hear a gunshot or two from week to week, maybe even the occasional car accident. but when i heard this, well i thought it was at my next door neighbors house so i had the concern for my neighbors safety. i quickly retrieved my pistol and placed it up on my fiances book shelf in the living room. i went outside leaving my daughter inside with the screen closed. i looked around the side of my house where the noise had originated from, nothing. i waited about 5 seconds and listened to see if there was any yelling or screaming, or anything of that manner. nothing. so i started to head inside but only managed to take a couple of steps when out of the corner of my eye i saw a bright purple light, then a loud bang followed. my neighbors from down the block were shooting off fire works and i put two and two together and once again started to head back inside. now i don't know what made me look up at that exact moment, but i did, just over the tree line of the house across the street from me. and there it was. at first i thought it was a plane but then i quickly realized that it was much to large for a plane. there are two airports in my city, so i'm used to seeing aircraft operate during the day and night hours. the lights glowing on this object were also way too bright to be traditional aircraft. it would be an obvious distraction to the pilots, having something this bright on an aircraft and trying to fly it during the night. but also there was no light around the light. i know that may sound weird and not make sense, but when you look at a bright light at night, like a searchlight for instance. there is the powerful bright light that emits straight from the source, then there is like a secondary light that almost radiates off the main light. this objects lights weren't doing that. now the lights were lighting up left to right. then they would dim to nothing in the same fashion. and then they would repeat the process in what i would say would be 2-3 second intervals. then the craft appeared to me to start turning left. the light on the right would be smaller than the one on the left which led me to think that this was a glider of some sort. but when the craft completed this turn or it appeared to be a turn, it was gone. it became a star. a star. let me remind you this object was pretty large. it quietly shrunk to a star. i was dumbfounded. i stood there for about five minutes trying to figure out what i saw. it was over and done with in about 10-15 seconds. it all happened fast. as i stood there. the only thing that made sense to me was my neighbors were shooting fireworks at this thing. now i live in california, and here fireworks of all kinds are illegal year round, with the exception of 4th of july of course. but any firework that flies in the air is extremely illegal no matter what day it is here. but still, they were shooting these fire works in the general vicinity of this craft. i was really hesitant about reporting this, but i feel confident that i'm not crazy.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

we were freaked out. \r\n\r\nit took another half hour before i was comfortable enough to climb back down to my bed and go back to sleep. \r\n\r\nin the morning we reported the incident to our counselor. he told us it was probably porcupines. of course we knew it was not a porcupine or any animal, but you can imagine he did not pay any attention to us. \r\n\r\nthe clincher to this incident is that a week later i received a letter in my camper mailbox from my father. this was way before email or cell phones, i had no daily communication with my father. in the letter he had enclosed an article he had cut-out from a newspaper (boston globe?). the headline was something like: hundreds spot ufo's over small new hampshire town. (hillsborough). it had occurred the same night as our incident. \r\n\r\ni tried once in recent years to find the article in the boston globe microfishe at the boston public library but i couldn't find

towards me. i looked up to see a triangle shaped object in the air about 15 to 20 feet above me and 5 to 10 feet away from me (ground distance). it had a smooth, solid, and black surface with yellow-white lights at the two bottom points of the triangle and one red light at the tip. it seemed to quickly appear out of nowhere and i stopped in my tracks because i could not immediately identify it. i stared at it in awe and felt slightly startled because i did not know what it was or what it would do next. it was so close and low in the sky i knew it was definitely not any type of aircraft i have seen before. it moved with a strange grace and ease that seemed unlike any modern aircraft. it was very silent except for a soft whirring sound like a fan. i observed it from underneath as it unexpectedly made a zig-zag movement in a straight, horizontal line. i felt scared because i have never seen anything do that motion before. in a way, it reminded me of the repulsion of two magnets when they are brought near each other. suddenly, it dropped a few feet very abruptly and i was worried it would get closer. however, immediately after it flew back into the sky at such an incredible speed i could barely comprehend it.  it seemed to vanish in a way that reminded me of a star trek ship moving at warp-speed into space. it was faster than what i would believe any military jet could be capable of. it seemed strange to me that it could silently hover above me, then suddenly take off so fast i could not see it. as quickly as it came, it disappeared.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

slight shadow overhead almost directly above me!  i am sure most people could not see it driving by in their car.  it was about 2 in the afternoon and in fact most of my neighborhood is at work.  the children are at school.  what was so obvious was that there was a beautiful and large white/blue cloud overhead.  and when i think about it it was the same kind of cloud on many different days.  i first noticed it in year 2001.  but if one were to actually stare at this cumulous cloud carefully, a very large triangle with very sharply defined edges was there!  it was silent.  i had other things to do so i went on with my life.  this repeated over and over i would see it for weeks in the afternoon,it would stay there all afternoon long and i would not see it at allup until the fall of the year 2014.  then i joined on facebook, the global chem trail watch group. one day, about two years ago, some one was monitering me and noticed that i was on facebook.  they typed in a personal message to just me!!!! the message read below the small photo they sent to me: \"can you see what is behind the cloud?  did you see this?!!!!!!?!!!!!!?????? and it was a photo from somewhere in florida of this same blue triangle.  how did \"they\" know me????  and i have never told this story to any one nor thought about taking photos of it.  \"did you see this!\" was the question from out of nowhere!  i have not seen it since the fall of 2014 when my 97 year old father passed away. so these records are on facebook, if you know how to get them, or if they are censored in some way i do not know.

dusk around 8pm. it had a most unusual color. it appeared to be goldish green and very dull.  i first thought it was a blimp. but,then i realized that it was the edge of a ufo. as i studied the ship that had rested just above the tree tops of the little miami river i noticed there were cables that crossed from top to bottom and what appeared to be a ladder on the side. when the driver took notice he became so terrified that he stopped driving. i then became afraid because wooster pike is typically a very busy street. but, as i looked around i noticed just one car coming from mariemont towne square and two cars coming from terrace park. they too were slowing and i wondered where everybody was. it appeared as though we were all suspended in time and i began to pray... the next memory i had was a feeling of g-force... you know like the toy cars when you rake them across the floor a few times and then let them go... i felt that i had been let go into a speeding car. my friend was jerking the steering wheel hard left and hard right while looking upward through the window and the windshield saying \"where are we and where is that thing. i said what thing and he said \"you know that spaceship we've been chasing.\" i said oh yeah, yet, i didn't remember chasing the spaceship at all. up ahead, i noticed a marquis with bright lights and as we approached it i realized that even though i had no clue how we got there... we were at sycamore high school 25 minutes away. and, the clock read 10:20 pm. then i looked around for the spaceship and i noticed it in the left rear window. as we were driving the ship flew over top of the car. it had come from behind. the bottom of the spaceship appeared to be flat but was sectioned off in large sections of panels shaped into x's with metal footers or beams. each of those sections contained smaller sections in panels of x's and all of the sections were lit with violet and amber lights protruding through round rings about the size of traffic lights. the lighted sections differed in array of the two color combinations. the ship was to large to take it all in so i studied just one large x section and the smaller x panel with lights. the spaceship had a static sound coming from the lights which gave me a headache at the bridge of my nose just to look up at them. i also heard the engines whine down as it flew over and stopped adjacent to the right of the car and i then heard the engines do a reversal as they started back up and i watched the ufo begin to move again. the ufo sort of fished tailed and went straight ahead very quietly and slowly in front of us until it disappeared out of sight. i remember watching it leave and saying \"there it goes...It's gone now.\" we never spoke of the incident but several hours of our lives were unaccounted for. the ship itself was so large and soo beautiful that i remembered feeling kind of sad to see it go and i also felt as though they were looking back at us wanting to make sure that we were ok before they left us behind.
