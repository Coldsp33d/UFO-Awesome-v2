though, i believe it was a summer evening in 1975 after dark, which would make it after 9:00 pm edt.  i am estimating the time based the fact that some of the neighbors who were there moved to a different neighborhood in 1976, and i don't think i had started first grade yet, which i did in september 1975.  i put it in summer, because i don't think i would have been out riding bikes in the dark during school, but it could have been spring and maybe earlier in the evening, but it was definitely after dinner.  it could have been 1974, and i have seen similar reports from that year, but for some reason i think it was later.\r\n\r\ni was out riding bikes with my brother and some neighbors in newnan, georgia.  in the summer of 1975, i was 5 years old and my brother was 8. there were 5 or 6 of us all gathered at the end of the driveway of the kid across the street from my house.  we were in a subdivision off roscoe road, and during the event we were facing due north. most of the land in that direction for about a quarter mile was undeveloped forest, but there were houses on the gravel back road and pasture beyond some of the woods.  right next to my house was a clearing that at one time was going to be a short road, and the neighbor���s driveway was directly across the street from it.\r\n\r\nwhat caught our eye was a huge, glowing, orangey-yellowy circle or sphere that flew in from the west and hovered near the center of that clearing, not too far over the tree line.  we all stood and watched it hover for a moment, then it split in half vertically and fire shot up out of the middle. i don���t remember an actual fireball being released, just an explosion of fire.  then the two halves came back together and the sphere flew back off to the west and below the horizon.   i seem to remember it went up a little before it went west and down.  all the movements ��� appearing, disappearing, splitting, and rejoining ��� were calm, smooth and controlled, like gliding. from what i remember, it didn���t make any sound. i don't recall it illuminating anything. it seemed to be close, maybe a quarter to a half mile away, but there is no way really tell how far away it was or how large. the width of the clearing was standard two-lane road length, about 20 feet, and the object appeared to take up about the same amount of space in width from our perspective. it may have been a little narrower or wider than the clearing, but not much.  the entire event was brief, probably under a minute.\r\n\r\ni haven't seen those neighbors in a long time, but my brother and i still talk about it from time to time.  my sister had gone in for a minute and missed it, but she remembers us telling her about it. i have never seen any mention of it anywhere by anyone else and don't recall anything at the time.  i come to sites like this occasionally to search for a description of anything similar around the same time. not knowing where the object really was means, of course, that anyone for many, many miles could have seen it.  i���ve found a few similar stories from around ga around that time, but the only one that mentions fire at all reported a fireball from a rectangle.\r\n\r\na couple of years ago, i met some folks in athens, ga who knew two guys that i knew in high school in newnan.  they told me that in the mid-to-late 1980s, two of them were in one of their backyards lying on a trampoline and saw some type of event which they described as a ufo that totally freaked them out.  i don't recall all the details of their experience, but i do know it was different from mine.  i think they saw a line or other formation of several lights.  at any rate, i got very excited when the people started to tell me about it, because i thought it may have been around the same time as my sighting.  after i found out it was a good 10-13 years later and different, i still remained quite excited about it, because that particular guy lived about 2 miles north of my house in the macedonia road area. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

about 5 mile ese from valley mills, and about 20 miles wnw from waco. it being warmer in the ranch house than in the yard, the adults were sitting in the yard visiting and waiting on my brother and his family to arrive. the group consisted of my mother, step-father, sister and her husband and my wife and myself. suddenly, someone noticed this large object hovering, slowly rotating above us at an altitude of about 1000 ft. it was shaped like a toy spinning-top, had lighted ports about its perimeter and appeared to be some 200-to-300 feet in diameter. as we were marveling and commenting, an airplane began approaching from a southerly direction and made a turn toward the object. quickly, the object departed easterly at a very high speed and disappeared over the horizon in less than 10 seconds. when my brother arrived, he laughed heartily at our description. as an aeronautical engineer for general dynamics in ft. worth, he did not believe in flying saucers. about ten days later, i received from him a copy of the gd internal newspaper. it turned out that the airplane we had seen was a gd plane flying from san antonio to ft. worth, and the description from the pilots matched exactly our own observations. i am a mechanical engineering graduate from texas a&m and a retired cororate officer. i can see the events of that night of more than 50 years ago almost as clearly as i did then. there is no doubt in my mind that we saw a very real ufo in the form of a \"flying saucer.\" \r\n\r\nnone of the persons who winessed this occurrence with me are still alive, unless it be the pilots or a pilot of the gd airplane. while i have described this even to numerous people over the years, i did not know until recently about your organization.","distance":"101-500

around 5:30 pm i was out shooting photos of the sunset near my home.  there was a line of clouds which obscured the sunset and this wasn���t a spectacular sunset as i had expected. the clouds were very thick and high. air traffic from charlotte international airport (clt) was passing directly over head and you could see the aircraft above and through the cloud deck. i was trying a variety of shutter speeds to try to get some decent images. when i got home and down loaded the photos to my computer (from a nikon d80).  i glanced through them quickly and was about to delete the entire set of images because i was not really happy with them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthen in image 0056, i noticed a dark shape below an opening in the cloud deck. the opening was white and contrasted the entire image. when i loaded the photo in photoshop and did some standard adjustments for level, color and contrast, a dark triangular shape appeared clearly. enlarging the image and enhancing it come more showed a definite black triangle. i looked at the image before (0055) and after (0057) and the shape does not appear in either photo. the time between image 0055 and 0056 where the shape appeared was 24 seconds. the time between image 0056 (image of triangle) and 0057(object does not appear) was 17 seconds. all the shooting data for each image is shown in the image i put together.  i did not notice anything unusual or out of the ordinary while taking the photos. there was no air traffic from ctl at the time the images were taken.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwhen i enlarged and enhanced the triangle in image 0056 and applied sharpening in photoshop, you start to see some edge structure of the triangle. this is not visible in the image which i put together. but there appears to be a sharp edge line on the leading edge of the triangle. it almost looks like when it passed under the cloud opening, the bottom is in shadow (black) and the front edges show a faint straight edge. also you will note a light spot appearing in center of the shape.  if you compare the before and after images (055 and 057), there is no trace of the object, nor is there any unusual change in the cloud pattern. the texture does not match the bottom of the cloud deck in any manner as far as color or hue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nif anyone has any idea of what it was i photographed i would like to hear from them. i have been doing photography for a long time and am familiar with aircraft. this does not fit into what i have observed over the years. it might be a cloud effect, but i don���t think so. any thoughts to what it might be? i decided to keep all the images for the fun of it now.\r\n\r\n\r\nlocation:  fort mill, sc\r\n\r\nnote: this is a screen shot of the original pdf image. original images were shot at fine resolution and imported into adobe illustrator from photoshop. original size of document is 23 mb. the bit map image is not of the same quality, but shows the object in question. anyone interested in the original images should contact  me.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

track.  i was looking up at the sky when i noticed a series of round, reddish-orange lights that were too big to be from an airplane.  it started out as one light, then two, then three, then four, then five.  when all five lights were on, the fifth went out, then the fourth, the third, and so on.  the lights were in a horizontal row, and this pattern repeated itself several times over the course of 2-5 minutes before disappearing.  i could not see the actual object because it was dark and the lights were very bright.  i continued to look for the object that night and many nights afterward, but i never saw it again.  i have never seen anything like this object before or since.  i could not tell exactly how far away it was, but i could tell that it was extremely large and moving very quickly.  the object seemed to be quite far away, but was certainly flying lower than an airplane would be.  i knew immediately that this was something unusual.  my father is a pilot, and i have seen many different types of aircraft, and nothing i've seen remotely matches the description of this object.  i never reported this incident, but after the recent sightings in erath county, i wanted to share my experience.","distance":"Over One

light flicker as if on a metalic surface. it was several miles away, and around 1,500ft to 3,000ft? (or maybe higher) in the sky. i have no way of describing just how large the light was, but i am guessing sizeable. it moved in the same general direction, but not necessarily in a straight line. there were no flashing aircraft lights, only the amber flicker. it moved slowly, before stopping in mid air. suddenly it gained several thousand feet in altitude (almost straight up) in a matter of seconds, before turning bright (almost stoplight red) as if on fire, and then vanishing. \r\n\r\ni was unable to take photos, or video. \r\n\r\nthe exact duration of time wasn't very long. but i know it was no plane.
