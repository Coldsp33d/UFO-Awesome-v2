who worked for the same company, in different locations, who also saw the lights.\r\none night last spring, at exactly (i looked at my watch) 10:20pm, i was driving south on u.S. 287 just south of alvord, texas when out of the corner of my left eye i saw a flash due east and assumed it was lightning. after radioing the dispatch and being told that there were no storms on radar in that area, i figured it was a small thunderhead and continued to drive. the flashes continued, but became even brighter, too bright for lightning, and after the second flash, another driver closer to the area also radioed that he had also been seeing the lights for some time, but there were no clouds in the area and he didnt want to say anything about the lights. he then  became very shaken as he described the lights as being multi-colored and couldnt even describe the shades of the colors. he also said he thought it was a ufo, though he (nor any of us) actually saw any type of craft, structure or anything else other than the flashes.\r\nthe flashes continued as i was now driving east on highway 380 from decatur toward denton, and i could now see that the lights were actually coming from the ground, so i now assumed it might be an oilfield crew's lights flickering, or someone welding. but they were so very bright now and seemed to be moving northwest. while the other drivers in different areas all had different views and we all disagreed even on the exact location of the lights. the flashes would last in sporatic sessions from between 45 seconds to over a minute, and then at times for only 3-6 seconds at a time, with unusual and irregular pauses in between. it really did resemble an arc welder's flash. these lights continued to move northwest until disappearing into a real thunderhead over oklahoma due north of the forestburg texas area.\r\nnow, the only reason i am reporting this now is because one witness to the stephenville sighting had described the lights as resembling 'welder's torch' and i remembered stating how they looked like an arc welder reflecting light in the air, but maybe 100 times brighter. i only saw the lights as a light blue tint, though, but the other drivers seemed to see different colors. we all agreed to watch the news and see if there was some simple explanation the next day, but there was never any mention. this continued until around 2:45am.\r\ni also saw them again in the same area the following night, but only for a period of about 90 minutes that time.\r\ni wanted to report this as it might be helpful information in the ongoing stephenville sighting, and thank you for your work also.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

and i were met with less than a positive reactions when mentioned it at the time. but it has bothered me a great deal ever since. i am a retired chef, at the time of this incident i was driving a cab do to medical problems that would not allow me to continue in my field. i received a call to go to the butte, a small subsection of palmer alaska, to pick up a regular customer. i won't reveal her name as i haven't spoken to her in years and i'm not sure if she would approve. both of us were in our fifty's so we were not young impressionable kids nor were we drinking. { as a cab driver drinking and driving is considered bad form, not to mention against the law.} i was to take my passenger from the butte to a friends home in wassilla, they play cards twice a week, and i chose to go by way of the palmer/wassilla hy. it is the shortest route. the entire trip should take no longer than twenty mins. it's only about 16 miles. i am sorry about the time and date as its been a while, how ever it was winter and it was just shortly after the a-wac's plane crashed on take off from fort rich. a bit of research should narrow down the time frame. we were enjoying a mild \" warm spell \" [ in alaska thats relative.} the sky's were clear except for some high thin clouds scudding along at a good clip, the moon i believe had set. i was cruising along at about 45 mph and chatting, i knew my passenger well as palmer is a small town and we swapped news of friends and local politics. we had just passed the seward meridian rd. when i saw a very large triangle hanging in the air just off the palmer wassilla hwy. a spot where the terrain slops down into a valley. { to the left, we were going west/north west.} it { the object} was lower than the mountains to the right of us and absolutely motionless. it made no sound what ever and i rolled down the window just to see if i could hear it. i slowed the cab down to about 25 mph and bent over the wheel to get a better look at it with out wrecking the cab. i called my passengers attention to it. hey, ------, do you see that? oh my god! she replied, aliens are beaming up the palmer dump. she said. i chuckled.  but, then it got a bit stranger, i had a 4 million candle power spot on the front seat and was going to stop and shine it up at the thing, partly to see if it would reflect the light and partly hoping it would get a response. i don't know how to explain this. i kept thinking, i'll pull over here and get out, but my mind kept saying, nooo, thats really not a good idea doc. the slower i drove the cab the more insistent the feeling that it wouldn't be \" a good  idea \" became. my passenger was also experiencing the same type of feelings. the feelings were so strong that i never did come to a complete stop, but pulled  over to the shoulder and kept moving at about 5 mph. the object it's self, besides being very big, was triangular in shape but with volume, [ it was not razor thin. ] the tips at the three axis points glowed brightly, one white one green and one red. [since it was not moving it could not be determined which end/tip was the leading edge.] the reason i mention the lights is that each tip glowed it's own color in a perfect triangle of it's own, there were no discernible rivets,welds or seams, it was as if the material the thing was made of just glowed from within. the rest of the \"ship\" was a silvery metal like substance, not polished brightly but clearly metallic. the overall impression was of great subtle beauty, the lines flowed with a grace that was very pleasing to the eye, simple but eloquent in it's design. a true work of art. it also was not very reflective, you could see the lights of some of the homes and street lamps reflected in the surface but they were not like in a mirror. we could judge the size pretty well as the hwy. we were on runs along on the top of a moraine and the next hwy. over is clearly visible from there and only 4 miles away and it was not at a very high altitude. [ as mentioned earlier, the mountains to the north are only about 8 miles away and are under 3,000 ft.] the object was at a lower altitude than the mts. it, was large enough to put the wassilla hi school foot ball field and it's parking lot on top of and have enough room left over for a mini market, this thing was big. i have seen a few other pictures of triangle shaped objects but most show a large circular lighted area on the bottom center, this one did not have that feature, the bottom was not lighted just the tips. we could even see a bit of the top where it curved up from the sides so it had to be fairly low. we had it in view for about 15-20 mins. first out of the windshield then out the left side windows before the \" assault \" on our minds became to much for my passenger and i reluctantly drove off to take her to her card party.I have to admit that i broke the law by going over the speed limit by a good bit, [about 65 mph] to get her there and a bit faster going back to see if it was still visible. but it was gone by the time i got back to where i could see past the intervening terrain and trees. i called it in to dispatch, boy was that a mistake, i got the old, \"uh huh\" are you sure your ok to drive bit. i am 62 years old now and the shear size and simple beauty of the thing still haunts me. we have nothing of that size that can, fly, much less hover motionless and silent then disappear with out a trace, [ no fading lites in the sky.] in less than the twelve mins. it took me to get back. and the mind thing, it was as if someone was in my head whispering, no that wouldn't be a good idea, no you really don't want to do that do you? very gentle but effective. [ i didn't stop all the way after all, nor shine my spot light on it.] i am not prone to telling tall tales, [unless i tell you first it's a tall tale.] i am not interested in public attention, on the contrary, i am, like most alaskans a very private person and shun any such thing. but, i would like to know if anyone else has seen  a thing like this and if they too were affected in a similar manner. it is also hoped that telling some body of this experience will put it to rest for me. thank you for listening.      doc smith   \r\n         ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":9062,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":61.5813889,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01192008-0031","longitude":-149.4394444,"occurred":985334400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alaska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":985334400000,"summary":"A large triangeler object w/the tips lighted.

distance and time) to the stephenville, texas, sightings.\r\n\r\ni was driving east on the main street in breckenridge with a clear view to the eastern sky.  i noticed a 'reddish star' that was much brighter than the others nearby--i first thought to myself, \"wow! mars is bright tonight!\"  as i was looking at the light, it intensified to become even brighter.  i then thought that i was looking at the landing lights of an airplane that had turned towards me, thus causing the intensification.  however, there were no other signal lights which would have been easily visible from an airplane.  also, there was no motion to the light over time that i was observing it; it was stationary in the sky, even as i moved east.  after a short time, the light returned to the previous intensity---still standing out among the stars.\r\n\r\nas i continued home, i turned on a residential street to the south.  when i went through the next three intersections, i used the lack of obstructions to look back east and confirm that the light was still present, bright, and motionless.  i turned again to the east, then back to the south through a tree-filled residential neighborhood before turning back east on my street where i would again have a view after about a minute without being able to see the light.  it was then that i noticed that the light was either gone or the light had diminished to a point where it no longer stood out in the sky.\r\n\r\ni stood outside for a few minutes, trying to understand what i had seen.  i am a stargazer; i took astronomy classes in college and have always had an affinity for the sky.  i am also trained as a meteorologist and have studied aviation.  i scanned my brain to find some atmospheric or astronomic explanation to no avail.  i am also a skeptic about ufos.  i do believe that other civilizations exist in the universe, but i doubt they are visiting us.  so i remained dumbfounded.  i came inside and promptly described the event to my wife.  i was confused and wanted to let her know what happened \"just in case something like a supernova made it on the news\" and she would know that i saw it, too.\r\n\r\nwhile i never saw any news of strange astronomical phenomena, soon afterwards the news was filled with stephenville residents' sightings of ufos.  stephenville is located about 65 miles southeast of breckenridge, so hearing of the

dinner when we noticed an extremely bright object just above the tree line to the north east of the camp house. thinking it was mars as it had a definate reddish tinge we soon realized it was in the wrong position to be mars or some other star.\r\nthe time was approximately 9:30pm . being familiar with the night sky in this area, it was easy to rule out any form of aircraft as it is normal to see commercial jet traffic at high altitudes traversing from east to west or vise versa.  i went inside and got a pair of nikon 10x30 binoculars which we used to observe the object. the object/objects has no disernable movement so i thought they might be a heliocopter, but i did not see any nav lights . i also noticed one dimmer light directly obove the light and 4 more strung out horizontally to the left of the bright light. the lights were equidistant apart, a very strange configuration for possible stars i thought.  again this object was very low to the horizon and in an area where no starts or such are normally observed and was the britest visable object in the sky. after five minutes or so the lights dimmed to the point that they were not visible. they then came back on. this occured several times over the next 20 minutes until the light abruptly shut of not to be seen again. ther was no disernable movement of the lights. the night sky was partly cloudy with stars  and commercial

observe this.  i continued driving north and had to alternate my focus on the road to the north, but i mostly continued monitoring the object off to the west.  i briefly took my eyes off it about 5 times to check the road north of me, but the object was continually there in about the same position in the sky each time i resumed monitoring it.   the final time i took my eyes off it to check the road, it had completely vanished when i looked back at it.   the event totaled about 20 seconds.   the sky was mostly clear, and the object was very metallic and bright, apparently from the setting sun shining off it.   it may have been moving the whole time but seemeed stationary until suddenly vanishing.  it could not possibly have been an airliner, a weather balloon, etc. i'm very skeptical of ufo sightings, so my very first thought was that even though it certainly seemed like a \"flying saucer,\" it surely must be something else, like a weather balloon.   i literally was trying to identify it as something else the whole time, but this was not possible.   it wasn't scary ... just awesome and very curious.  i hope to hear a reasonable explanantion but simply can't imagine what that may be.  very interested to know if the haskell pd officer saw it too.

 i assume that it must have been something the military has been testing seeing how i had heard that area 51 testing moved from south nevada to north nevada at the falien airforce base, about 45 minutes from the 'moon rocks' where we were camping.  that being said, extraterrestrial or not, what i am certain of is that three adults witnessed something so amazing that it caused us to run out of a warm trailer into the freezing night and stand there shaking while admiring a piece of technology so advanced that it left us in awe.  as i said, it was a very large, as wide as a jumbo jet from wing to wing, smooth, dark, had the ability to hover and fly silently and accelerate at high speeds.  without a doubt in my mind i know that what we saw was real and not any kind of optical illusion or anything of that sort.  either it was extraterrestrial or the us military has technology more advanced then we could ever imagine.  i speculate its the later.  its not much of a story and i have never written about it until now, four years later, but i am clear on what i saw even though sometimes i think it was to unbelievable myself.  for people who are pessimistic, ufos exists from one origin or another and i would be happy to clearly and as detailed as i can explain my store even under the scrutiny of a lie detector or anything else.  i wish i had more to tell but it was as simple as this and although the three of us know we just witnesses something incredible, later we just went back into the trailer, laughed at what we saw, and went to sleep knowing that we will probably never see anything like it again and that no one would believe our store.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":9051,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5389329,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01192008-0021","longitude":-119.8040327,"occurred":1066633200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Teardrop,  Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1066633200000,"summary":"Large, dark, some lights","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Reno, Nevada","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:414679"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Houston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband, daughter and i were\r\n> driving home from dinner, and i had already seen what looked like a plane\r\n> outside my window. we are in the iah far nw corridor.  my husband\r\n> slowed down and said do y'all see that?

as usual and enjoying the serenity of the night. i saw an object suddenly appear. it was like an elongated egg shape without a defined middle section. it was totally black in color. on top was one steady bright light. on the bottom was one light that seemed to flash every few seconds. in the center (where i would calculate the center to be) were several 2-3 lights that remained on and looked as though they may have changed colors from white, to blue to red. the object remained in one place, as in hovering. there was no sound at all, no sound of jets or engines. it just appeared without an entrance trail or other announcement and disappeared in about 1-1/2 minutes the same way. it was just visable, and then invisable in a very short time. the object was absolutely huge. many times larger than any aircraft i have seen.  i can certainly understand now how these crafts can appear and disappear without many people seeing them.  they are very quiet and unless you are looking exactly where they appear, you will definitely miss it.  there was no time for me to contact anyone to tell them to take a look at it.  it seemed that the craft came in just to view the area for a little

have cell phones with cameras, i wondered why more pictures weren't available. i don't have access to such a phone, but even if i did, it was too dark to take a photo that would be worth anything. so, i won't say anything to anyone about this as they may think i am crazy. but, i do know what i saw and do believe it was an ufo. i was not afraid of the ufo as much as i was about what other people

then closer, then disappearing i woke up at 4:50 am this morning and looked out the window to see three \"pulsating red and blue\" \"start\" hovering lower than the real stars in the dark, crystal clear sky. the real stars are mostly higher in the sky and stationary the whole time. these three \"pulsating, hovering lower stars\" are about parallel to each other, one to the left and one to the right (about nine feet ground distance measurement, and the third \"pulsating star\" is about 3/4 the distance, between the two others, closer to the one on the right. but the \"center\" one is larger and brighter because i believe it is actually closer to me. about 20 minutes later i look again....The larger, center \"star\" is gone. the two others are still in the same position, one left (south) and one right (more west). at about 5:50 am i look again, and just then i see the one on the left, above a garden center building here, start to \"disappear.\" it happens in a second, but suddenly gets very, very tiny and \"the light goes out!!\" it's gone!! it either just \"disappeared\" or it moved swiftly in a paralell (not up or down direction...And disappeared)  all the other real stars are still very bright, same position, no cloud cover!! the \"pulsating star\" on the right is still about the same postion, about the same distance and size. at about 5:50 am i started watching the last \"star\" on the right because it was about the same spot the \"star\" yesterday was positioned in the sky when i saw it move straight up!\" from 5:50 am until about 6:45 am i watched this one from inside and outside. it is about 9 degrees out this morning!! at about 6:00 am i noticed this one started to move \"inches down first, then up, then about 6:15 am it moved parallel...But away from me toward the west. at that time an airplane moved across the sky from north going south, between my view and the object. about fifteen minutes later, the \"star\" moved again closer toward my direction, got larger, still moving parallel, not up or down. then it moved \"inches up and down,\" because the view was obscured by the trees, so i had to go outside to see it was still there. then about 6:35 am it began to move westerly, and \"disappeared,\" just as the second one to the left, over the garden center building had done. just sort of becomes quickly \"like a little dot, then lights out!!\" \r\n      from new york.....My sister called my time 6:10 pm (here time 7:10 pm to tell me she just had \"another encounter\" with this time a \"bright white object with crystal like lights all around it, and beams of light from it\" on the same road by my parent's house that we had the \"close encounter\" with the \"spaceship with red and blue flashing lights\" on july 11, 2007. she saw it over a friend's house, in the distance in the sky, about a mile up the road, and about a mile from our house. as she continued to drive she noticed \"it was not over her, but was traveling parallel with her up the road.\"  at one point just before getting to the house, \"a light, like moonlight came into her vehicle through the moonroof on her car.\"  at first when she called she sounded more \"excited\" than scared to me and i was surprized, after the terrifying experience in july. later when i spoke to her she said she felt \"energized\" and perhaps it was from the adrenelin from being scared. now talking about it, she was really scared again. she is moving very soon, but i don't think she is moving far enough away. honestly, with seeing these things out here also, i don't know where you can \"move to!\" we are hoping they are some sort of our military or government \"top secret\" security efforts. i wish they would tell us. this is a little scarey. now i have to

2007,my wife and i were traveling east between jonesboro and gatesville, coryell county, texas, through sparsely settled open ranch country, on hwy 36 in our dodge ram 3500 truck to meet some friends for dinner when my wife, who was looking out the right hand window saw an extremely bright object coming from the west which she initially thought might be a falling star, as it was streaking somewhat like ones she had seen.  when she realized it was larger than any shooting star she had ever seen, getting brighter, and much lower in the sky she called out for me to slow down and take a look at this thing, which i did.  i first saw it as it passed by her passenger window on our south side and then got a good look at it through our front window.  what i saw was an extremely large, bright white lighted object streaking through the sky at a rapid rate of speed faster than any plane i have ever seen, and i fly a lot, making no sound or sonic wave. not only was it very, very bright, but it's extreme speed seemed to make light bend around it and stream from it so as to make it's actual shape hard to make out. i saw what i thought were small specks of blueish light, which were fast and blurred also embedded in and streaking along the side of this thing as it passed in front of us.  when we first saw it this object was coming across the sky at a slight angle but then it appeared to level off a bit and disappeared suddenly as it neared some hills east of gatesville, just like a shooting star does when it flares out.  when we arrived at our destination dinner party we were quite excited at what we had seen, never having seen anything like it before, and told some folks about it, none of whom appeared much interested.  about that time a couple who had arrived a couple of minutes ahead of us spoke up and said they, too, had seen this thing from another angle at the same time as they were coming into gatesville on a parallel route, hwy 84, from out towards evant, texas. again, however, no one seemed too much interested and the group moved on to dinner.  although we will probably never know exactly what we saw, we saw what we saw, it was what it was, and we enjoyed the show, however short, while it lasted.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

like a stingray in water, it was like a rolling flap motion. it was so silent, and moved so fast, then it was gone. one thing i noticed it had no bright lights, it was so cameoflauged, and silent. as
