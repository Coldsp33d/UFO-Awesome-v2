larry king live, it made me think of this incident.  after watching the program on tv and visiting stanton friedman's web site, i feel inclined to tell my story.  i have kept it to myself all these years, because when i tried to share it, most people thought i was crazy.  also, i had some fear of becoming a target for someone or something, i didn't know what.  since i am 66, i feel that i don't really have that much to loose. so i have decided to share it with the world.\r\n  \r\ni was coming home with a friend to study for a test one night.  we had been at her house studying after school, and we were coming to my house for supper and then study afterward at my house. as we were walking up the steps to my porch, i heard something that sounded like bird wings fluttering, but much louder.  as i swatted my ears i turned to see a circular object hovering over me.  it appeared to be rotating slowly and had flashing red, white, and blue lights all the way around its perimeter.  i first thought that it was small and within arms reach.  then after about five seconds it began to move and i could see that it was much bigger and at a greater distance from me.  it moved slowly at first then zoomed off straight away from me and was completely out of sight in about two seconds. it made very little sound in its flight.\r\n\r\nmy friend and i ran inside and began to share our story with my parents and my sisters.  we immediately realized that we had lost about two hours.  we completely missed supper and the clean up following supper.  my family did not believe us.  they thought we were making up the story to excuse ourselves for being late.  \r\n\r\ni also discovered that if i tried to tell the story to anyone, they would think i was crazy.  my plans were to attend university of florida and live at home.  someone recommended me to the u s naval school of music in washington dc.  and i ended up living in washington, dc for about six years.  i began to feel paranoid about that and developed a fear that some power greater that i, had planned my life to include washington, dc.\r\n\r\ni've have never really thought that much about for many years, but this story and the experience remains vivid in my mind.  i hope someone can benefit from my decision to make it public.\r\n\r\npaul

stood there staring as it hovered over our heads, next thing i knew it was getting dark we were walking home.  my sister and i didn't discuss it, we were very calm, as if nothing happened at all.  we

just left. it was pretty close to 11:00 p.M.  this is primarily pasture and grazing land area, just a few scattered ranch houses at the time this happened.  i was headed on a straight stretch of road and it had a long shallow dip in the road ahead.  i traveled this way all the time, day and night.  when off to the right of the road up in the sky i saw an object that had lights on the side of it. round lights from the look of brightness.  the lights were on the side of the aircraft. (if i had to estimate how far away off the road ahead to the right of me it was, maybe a football field?  at first i thought it was a helicopter from the airforce base north of us.  but then as it got closer and also since i was moving forward down the road, we were coming to a point of were it was going to be directly over my right side at the rate of speed i was going.  i am kinda hunkered down looking out my right windshield and the right passenger window when all of a sudden the lights that had been directly on the side of the aircraft,(sorry i forgot to give total discription) object was disc shape and estimated (this is the hard part to really describe maybe around 150 ft. wide, ) anyway the lights that had been directly on the side pointing towards the road, and it by the way is still over pasture land, heading towards the road,slowly. the lights just like all of a sudden point to the ground, either they were directed from the sides of the object or other ones were turned on and the side ones off, i have no idea.  but at split second the ground became daylight.  and i mean daylight. i could see the mesquite trees just like the sun was on them.  that is when i became unbelievably scared. even while i am writing this i can still feel the tightening in my chest. and this is the first time i have ever written this down.  at that moment when the lights came down, i reached over and just rolled down the window just a few inches to listen, my mind i can only remember it was racing do i hear something?  i wanted to hear the helicopter noise, and i didn't hear a thing, just the wind noise of the car going down the road. i am heading for the shallow long dip in the road and all i can think is stupidly by the time i reach that dip it will be over my car and it will see me, how stupid is that...It could see my anyway because of my lights...I just kept thinking the lights will hit right on top of my car , do i stop or do i go faster to get past that part of the road so it lights won't be right on top of me.  at the time this was all i could think, it sounds so stupid, but that was what i could only think.  so i floored it.  i buried the speedometer.  the next think i remember is looking back in my review and seeing the objects lights hit the road were i had been and making it just like daylight.  i did not slow down and kept watching in my review and side view until it was off the road into the other side of pasture some several yards then the lights went off.  i was approx. less than 5 miles from my home. i remember beating on the front door, my mother answered. i was extremely upset, my mother can attest to the way i was.  i am still very unclear about the after i got home part, but the occurence of this has been with me for years, i have told very few about it.  my mother called the airforce base the next day and asked about any manuevers that were going on,etc. etc. they said there were none.  anyway i know what i saw and what happened so close to me was nothing that i have seen again except on other pictures of sightings from other people on t.V. or paper.  there is also something that has disturbed me and also my mom.  i don't like to think about this part at all.  it was a little before 11:00 when this happened, and i was about 7 miles out from home.  my mother swears it was after 12:00 midnight when i was beating on the door.  that really bothers me. there are things about me medically i have wondered about, no not weird scars or things like that, but women problems, ammunity, other things that makes me question every once in awhile, i think about but i do not dwell on.  i just know i saw the object, and i really hope that is all that happened.  thank you for your time, and if you wondered why i decided after all these years to put this out now, i have been following the texas sightings on t.V. and it prompted me to tell my story.  feels good to do so, but sitting here typing this i swear my heart is racing, it still makes me very uncomfortable, the fear that was involved with it.\r\nthank you again.   d/ in texas","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":9027,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.8173224,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01182008-0035","longitude":-98.1953221,"occurred":252403200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":252403200000,"summary":"Lights hitting the ground making it look like daylight, all i could think..It's going to be right on top of me...","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Henrietta, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:284"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Wichita","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While attending wichita high school southeast,(1960) i, donald molzen, and mike greshiam belonged to nasa (as a volunteers). we tracked satellite launches from cape canaveral. on an evening in the winter of 1960 a lady named, barbra battie,(part of our team)sighted an object, which was also verified in australia that same night. this object was seen for several nights around the world. it was called batties moon by nasa. i doubt if you will find any documentation on this. we documented the sighting and nasa confirmed it. this object from the magnitude of brilliance and orbit was believed to be 3 miles in diameter. that���s a big object to come and go?

the intersection i looked to see were the other two went thats when i seen airplane or jet they had regular strobes. the craft then flew next to the car, right next to me i was the passenger in the car, ther was no doubt about it was a flying thing it made no noise it darted away from me and back so fast it looked like it would get smaller as it went away and when it came back within range i swear i could of reached out the window and touched it.By this time we were approaching the traffic light it then flew in front of the car and was close to traffic light it started changing colors but not like it had lights on it but like the air around it was changing colors. we had the red light and ther was another car at the cross street their light was green but they did not move they had to be seeing what i was seeing, when i ask my wife are you seeing this she acted as though she was in a trance and said with out looking that it was a jet.Her son was sitting on my lap as it flew next to the car he was five at the time and he was stairing at it the whole time, so i know i seen what i seen,and that was weird to becouse we have always strapped our kids into the car seat.After the light changed we turned left the craft then went from right above us to a small white light it stayed visible only getting smaller the closer we got to home, we lived next to the defense electronics supply command. that was it for that night on the following day i took my wife back to work we took the same way on turning on to the road i noticed some men by the area were the craft was zooming away from the car and back again they were as intereated in me as much as i was of them, they were in unmarked trucks they did not have kettering or beavercreek logos. when inoticed them like i said they looked real hard at me creepy. that night i was kind of scared to go pick ruth up from work for one i was alone little ronnie was at his dads for the weekend anyway as i turned the corner to go past that field up in sky was one single amber colored light like the night before as soon as i seen it i thout to my self oh man i dont need this and it disappeared.Alot of other things happened after that for years some things im scared to mention on the internet plus as you can see im not much of a typist. i have had two sons of my own since then and here lately they have been seeing lights flying funny zig zag paterns around in the mornings on thier way to bus stop. i know what i saw and so does the goverment like i said weird things like helicoptors flying up from behind buildings follwing me my boy when he was two drew stange alien faces and craft i was scared for my kids as im starting to again. ihave seen cigar shaped craft in 1998 with a coworker and again it responded when i thought to my self if you can hear me stop and go in reverse and it did and the coworker seenit do this we both got scared and left in a hurry he was so scared he didnt want to talk about it.After the sightings

slow. at that point, i thought ufo. it was irratic, it was just flying slow and straight. it was very quiet, almost a hum sound and i only heard that after it had passed my house. so, i knew it wasn't an airplane. as i watched the object, it has several lights which were very bright. there were red lights that were blinking and one side it had very bright lights which reminded me of head lights and as it passed it had the same bright lights which would make me think of the back. i don't remember any green lights like airplanes have that also made me think it wasn't an airplane. the object flew very close to the ground. i waited and watched wondering if the craft was going to crash because it was so low to the ground. looking at the lights, the object looked very big and maybe round could be round and long but i do know it was very big, much too big for an airplane. as i stood there, i remember thinking if it was an ufo, they could have taken me at anytime. i remember just standing there

saw. i didn't say anything at first because i didn't know what i had just seen in the sky. my best friend called me from arizona and asked if i had heard about the ufo sightings in stephenville, texas where i had attended tarleton a few years ago and is located about an hour away. i said no, so i looked up the article from their local paper and the descriptions given sounded just like the same object i saw, that's when i really began to think about what i saw. my friend called and told me about the trucker who saw something over cisco and said i needed to report my sighting. i believe without a doubt what i saw is an ufo. not an airplane, not a helicopter, not a commercial plane. if a commercial plane was flying this low, they need to rethink their flying. thank you for your time.

car, ther was no doubt about it was a flying thing it made no noise it darted away from me and back so fast it looked like it would get smaller as it went away and when it came back within range i swear i could of reached out the window and touched it.By this time we were approaching the traffic light it then flew in front of the car and was close to traffic light it started changing colors but not like it had lights on it but like the air around it was changing colors. we had the red light and ther was another car at the cross street their light was green but they did not move they had to be seeing what i was seeing, when i ask my wife are you seeing this she acted as though she was in a trance and said with out looking that it was a jet.Her son was sitting on my lap as it flew next to the car he was five at the time and he was stairing at it the whole time, so i know i seen what i seen,and that was weird to becouse we have always strapped our kids into the car seat.After the light changed we turned left the craft then went from right above us to a small white light it stayed visible only getting smaller the closer we got to home, we lived next to the defense electronics supply

decided i wanted my husband to see this too.  i quickly drove to the gym, parked and got out of the car as quickly as i could.  my husband met me in the parking lot and i told him to \"look at the sky.\"  he just stopped and said, \"wow.\"  there were hundreds of flashing white/yellowish round lights.  it looked like a swarm. it didn't look like a meteor shower at all.  the lights were all strobing on and off.  they were in the eastern part of the sky. there was no sound coming from them. it was so bright and so amazing. we watched for about 5 minutes until they faded away. i don't know how we could be the only ones that saw it. i have never seen anything like it before.  i don't know what we were looking at.  it definitely was not helicopters or a military craft.
