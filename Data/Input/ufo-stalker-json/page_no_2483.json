and wildlife preserve just down the road from my house that i take my 4x4 truck to play (and relax).  the field also has a good amount of wildlife that i will sometimes just park and watch for.  it is sloped somewhat and the east side has a good view of the field and a pretty wide view of the skyline.\r\n\r\ni had played in the field for most of the day-nobody else down there at that time-and decided to park up on the east edge and just watch for the hawks and other wildlife.\r\n\r\nas i was looking out across the field, i noticed what i thought was a blimp off to the west(ish).  it had a metallic cast to it, meaning i could see that the surface was reflective.  it had a texture in the reflection which made me feel like there were uneven surfaces reflecting light differently.\r\n\r\ni assumed it was a blimp and went back to watching the field.\r\ni glanced back at it several moments later and noticed that it wasn't moving, relative to my position-which i thought was strange.  usually, a blimp is going somewhere.  i figured the blimp to be about 2 or so miles from me, based on the size that i assumed a blimp would be.  it appeared to be about 300 or so feet above the ground, based on its size, its angle to the horizon, and how far away i thought it was.\r\n\r\nthere were several power lines across the field, a mile or so away, and i moved my position slightly in the front seat of my truck to align the object over one of the poles so i could see if it was moving.  it appeared to be drifting slightly to my right.  it didn't appear to get bigger or smaller so i assumed it was moving left to right very slowly.\r\n\r\ni called my wife on my cell phone and said \"i'm watching something very interesting in the sky\" and went on to tell her what i was seeing.  she made a joke about it being a ufo.  i spoke with her for a moment or so, during which time the object had moved only slightly.\r\n\r\ni thought, since it wasn't really moving, i'd drive down to centerville rd. (which is around where i thought it would be) and see what it was doing.  i left my location and lost sight of the object at that point.  when i got to where i thought it would be, it wasn't there.  i did not go back to the field to see if i could still see it because i still believed it was a blimp.\r\n\r\ni heard on the news reports the next day about the sightings in stephenville and figured this may be related...Or it may just be a blimp.  one thing i thought of in retrospect (other than kicking myself for not taking a picture of it with my cell phone camera) is the fact that i was able to align it with one of the power pole with only a slight shift of my position in my truck leads me to believe the object was much further away than i originally thought.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

actually, in late june 2007 just before visiting my sister in new york state, i observed a large brilliant white \"star\" in the sky, and a \"pulsating blue/green smaller \"star\" about six inches below the large \"white star.\" i remember thinking it was a little strange, but really thought not too much of it. my first real observation was while in new york state visiting my sister in the catskills.(it is in the area of pine bush, new york...Which is know for about 20 years now as \"the ufo sighting capital of the us,\" as i later found out after my own \"close encounter\" while there.)  not only are there the \"bright white starlike objects,\" but smaller blue and red pulsating \"stars\" both seen in new york and here. usually there is a larger \"bright white starlike object,\" and then several \"pulsating red and blue or green\" object around the larger \"white star like object.\"  my sister seemed to be absolutely \"terrified\" by the low hovering red/blue pulsating \"stars\" as we passed near a radio tower on her road. she just would stare at them and say....\"and they are not stars!!\"  well, a few days later we found out for sure \"they were not just stars!!\"  on july 11, 2007 at around 9:45 pm we had the most terrifying \"close encounter\" with one of the objects!!! we thought we were really going to die!! but we managed to what we now joking call \"two blondes out manouvering a ufo!\" but it was not at all funny! it was terrifying!! the craft actually was hovering in the tree tops to the left of the rural road we were traveling on to go to her house. we stopped the car!! it moved into position about 40 feet in front of us, about 40 feet above us, then lowered itself in the center of the road, a craft about 30 feet wide, sauser shaped, blue and red pulsating lights on the perimeter, flashing...And a wide as the road blue/grey beam of light coming below it onto the road in front of us!! she wanted to turn around the car and go back towards town!!! all i knew was \"don't get under the blue beam of light!! i told her to go to the right into our upper driveway and get into the house!! we actually were at a \"standoff\" with this craft...Waiting to see who would make the next move...Then we actually had to go toward the craft to get to the upper driveway!!! oh, my god!! we were terrified!!!! but we did it, and swerved to the right just as the thing was coming toward us, we at it!! we knew the thing was over our heads, my sister got out the driver's side door...Running towards the house. i got out the passenger side, was going around the back of the vehicle, when she says \"and it's not a helicopter...It makes no noise!!' with that i lifted my head just level...And there it was hovering about 10 feet off the ground between the garage and our house!!! and it made a little whisper of sort of an \"electrical\" sound. very, very, very faint for a 30 foot craft. there was just a blue/grey sort of misty light around it at this time. then it hovered, then very, very, very slowly lifted up and hovered over the treetops just about 50 feet from me. then slowly took off toward the road again. we ran into the house terrified!!\r\nwe would not go out after dark for the three months i stayed there after that. i came back to missouri the end of september, only to find \"they are here also!!\" \r\n            anyway, since coming back to missouri i have been watching these blue/green and red pulsating \"stars\" constantly \"hovering\" low in the sky....Almost any given night!!! and the \"bright white stars\" there also!! i have told others about them, but they don't seem to see them. i see them all the time! well, this morning at about 6:30 am i was getting up for work, and looked outside. there was one \"hovering\" low in the sky. the only \"star\" out in the sky this morning!!! nothing else!! i went to get dressed, looked out the window again and said to myself upon seeing the \"bright white star\" in the sky, just hovering low again....\"angel transport.\" (i told someone about these objects in the sky, and he told me, like he really knew, \"they are angel transports.\") as soon as i said that....I noticed the object was disappearing from my view....Vertically!!\r\nit was moving out of my sight from the window, slowly, slowly upwards!! i ran outside...And it was moving, silently, slowly, slowly straight up!! and there were no other lights on the object...Only a bright, brilliant white light, slowly to me moving straight up!! then it, without any sort of position change, started moving to the east, until it went over my building and getting very small and out of sight. i came upstairs to the highway level of the building....And there it is!! big and bright and very low, hovering again right close up there in the sky again!! i came in to email a friend about it, excited!! i had never seen one move around like this!!! now it's about 7:15 am and it is just staying there, but then a few minutes later it has moved east far away. and now it is gone!!\r\nthat was absolutely amazing!! i don't know what they are, who they are, but this one i waved \"goodbye\" to this morning! i don't know if these are connected, but they seem to be all over. not just here. and i don't know if other \"spiritual\" things happening in my life, as well as my sister's life, for the past twelve years are realated, but somehow i believe it may be so also. something is definately happening here. now talking to others here, many people tell me stories of \"strange sightings\" here too. time will tell. and sharing these experiences and sighting can only help to figure out exactly what is happening, and who and what these things are. i hope you will not only find this information \"interesting,\" but helpful in accomplishing this goal. i will \"keep watching!!\"

there were trails laid down in hooked patterns, crisscross patterns or lines that stayed for hours spreading and changing into cloud formations. i have taken photographs and shared them with others. most days the trails can be seen being laid down west of where we live and then they blew over our area with the normal westerly winds on the strait of juan de fuca. i have seen them laid down during the day and at night with moonlight. i was out walking on a cloudy day when i heard an airplane and looked up to see a circular patch of blue sky with a thick jet trail being laid down behind a plane overhead heading in a northwestly direction towards vancouver island, canada. i then saw a bright sphere east of the trail that was not moving. initially i thought i was viewing a planet or star in broad daylight, but after a while it moved slowly at a perpendicular angle over the top of the chemtrail in a westerly direction until it slowly disappeared behind cloud cover. in reading about chemtrails i had seen other reports of these bright spheres or silver orbs, but they typically moved quickly in the reports. i thought if they were some known type of aircraft or weather balloon maybe they would be identified by now since they have been reported before. the movement suggests this would have been moving against the wind that day if it was a balloon and it would have to be fairly large in proportion to an airplane since it was above the plane's trail. i looked closely for evidence of wings thinking the reflection might be hiding wings, but i only saw a sphere.  i did not have

one light and it disappered and we were all standing there like we were really scared because it felt like if we were there but really not. pretty powerful to explain. i also saw something in the sky when i was moving from gorman to cisco. i saw somthing in the sky that made me pull off the side of the road because there was a very large cigar shaped something in front of me and i really could not move or take a breath so i had to pull over and my mom was behind me and came up to my car to see what was the matter and i told her and she said she say it also. we were driving in the middle of the day and i am still freaked about that one. i will never forget.

drive in san diego. we were traveling on the road just before the store at the following approximate coordinates: 32���50'19.89\"n, 117��� 9'41.68\". as we were driving i looked out over the military airport adjacent to us and towards the two mountains in the distance, this was in the northeast direction. in the sky about 200-300 feet off the ground and several miles away  past the airfield was a craft hovering in place with an intensely bright white-blue light that flashed with a period of about one second. the light was unbelievably bright considering there was still daylight and the sun had not completely set. the light flashed bright a dim several times as both i and my friend watched in complete disbelief. we pulled over and watched the flashing until it abruptly stopped all light discharge altogether. as i watched, i noticed a strangely shaped, powder gray structure visible when the light dimmed and did not obscure the craft. it had a flat bottom and three large ridges on the top and was extremely large considering it's distance. i would say it would have to be at least a mile wide. we pulled into the parking lot of the rei store and stood on top of the car in order to see the location better in hopes to re locate the object. just as we exited the car a flight of 3 f-18 hornet fighter jets in a triangular formation flew overhead at a low altitude to the exact point that the light was seen. they created much noise and seemed to come from the coast as if they were deployed from an aircraft carrier. we went into the store for about 20 minutes to complete our business and then we left and upon leaving it was starting to get dark. while in the store we heard the noise of many jets and when we exited and looked into the sky there were over 25 military aircraft of all types in the area. both my friend and i had never seen so many aircraft deployed at such a low altitude in our entire lives, the sound of jet engine was eveywhere, there were aircraft of all types blanketing the area and they were not taking off from the adjacent airbase. as we drove we felt very apprehensive and worried about what we had just saw, we traveled down copley park place headed due east. this road is only a slight distance form the previous coordinates. as we drove, far in the distance we both observed a very sharp point of bluish light traveling at a slight downward angle at an extremely high speed. it was moving faster than the military aircraft that were around it and undoubtedly observing it. the number of aircraft that were in the sky at this point is unfathomable, more than i or my friend had ever seen at one time. as we continued driving, i'm not sure of the exact location we both saw a small, dim, but visible light at a very high altitude. the light was flashing with a period of many one millisecond like a strobe very high in the sky. i know of no aircraft that would bear such a light. by this time many of the people in cars that i saw were perplexed by the many jets in the air and helicopters had at this time also entered the area. i want to stress the sheer number of aircraft that were deployed and the fact that they flew in from multiple locations with bright green underwing lights on, suggesting that they had used the lights to aid in equipping underwing weaponry. it was about an hour before the fighter activity subsided. i would like to be further interviewed and would be happy to send pictures i have

sky and i saw a very bright light.  at first, i thought it was just a star,but then it moved very slowly forward and from side to side, but not far in distance.  i called my wife out to see what she thought and she could see what i was seeing.  i went back in and got my bicolucors and look at the object.  it was still moving very slowily in a small area and i could not see any shape to it.  it had a very bright light with very small lights around it.  i came to the conclusion, that it was just a hot air baloon.  it was not an airplane, as i know about the blinking safety lights on an airplane.  i started to call the police station to she if anyone ele was watching, but, thought better of it, as that would just say some crazy old man is seeing things.\r\nmy daughter came out on the porch and could see what we were seeing.  \r\nso. we just forgot about it, untill alot of people in our area saw something also.  i have a very goog camera, but took no thought to trying to take a photo of what we were seeing, because we thought it was just an hot air baloon.  thanks bill

the blimp size craft fist came from over my left shoulder.I was at a the stop sign on hideaway bay and meander. i watched it and thought that it was too low for a commercial airline. so i thought it was military and it was going to land in fort worth. the large craft was not to loud maybe a hum like a generator. it looked like there was to jets following it on both sides at the rear.I can not recall how may lights, but i belive there were a red lights rear and front. not too bright but blinking. then when i was on fm hwy 4 it was in front of me. now the the jets that look like it was following the large plane (about the size of a military bommer,i think from pictures i have seen ),look more like big turbines(jet engines) you see on planes. only one on each side but large. it moved slow,low and steady , heading southeast from granbury, tx. i just lost interest. did not think anything about it. till i heard there were other sightings. and the military denies any activity that night. please let me know if there is an explaination to this.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

stopped at a stop light, when i had a clear view up the western sky. the sun had long gone down by now and the stars were visable. as i sat at a stop light, i viewed west and saw what appeared to be a \"shooting star\", but there was something odd about this. it did remain in sight about as long as a shooting star, about 1 second, but it was really bright; a distinct white streak, as long as it remained in sight. the tracjectory was in a 90 degree angle going from top down. and also, it was unusually close to the ground. which lead me to speculate what it was. if it was a shooting star that was visable, it would have been overhead and fade in color. this was about 2-3 inches from the crest of the earth. if a shooting star was that far away to be that close to the horizon, it would be too far away to actually see. and especially too far away to be that bright and defined.  \r\n\r\ni shrugged this off as a non-event, until the next day when im on the way to work and the radio is talking about a major sighting in stevenville, texas which is 1 1/2 west of keller, and about the same time i saw the
