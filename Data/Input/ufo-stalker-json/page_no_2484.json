my eye. it was the coolest falling star i'd ever seen because it didn't burn up within a nano second of my spotting it. after another second or two i started to realize what i was looking at wasn't typical at all. it was burning, but not burning up and it was getting bigger. turns out it wasn't falling, but traversing the sky. i have no idea how big it was because i don't know how high it was in the sky. it traversed the sky to the point of disappearing in about 12-15 seconds. it normally takes a jet that is moving to the point of disappearing at least a couple of minutes if not more (i should point out that they are either landing at msp or leaving msp).\r\n\r\ni haven't told many people about this. it's pretty clear to me what it was not. what exactly it was, i don't know. it was

in the sky that were square looking. i thought it was an airplane at an odd angle. it looked square at first. then,after a few seconds, it never morphed into something familiar, so i kept my eyes on it. i told my daughter to look at it. she too thought it looked very odd. then i noticed that it was not square, nor was it high up like an airplane should be. it was lower. like a little over 10 stories up. (the hospital i work at is ten stories, so i thought of that as a comparison) it was a definate boomerang shaped. my daughter said it looked like a plane with really bent wings. overall it was a v-shape. it had red and yellow lights. not blinking. it was moving slower than a plane or a remote-control plane would move. (i actually thought it might be a remote control plane at first, when i decided it was way too low to be a real plane), but then it was just too big to be anything like any remote control plane that i had ever seen. plus... it was silent. i had slowed down, and was literally hanging out my rolled down window looking up at it. it was traveling perpindicular to the road that i was on.  the car behnd me was honking it 's horn... obviuosly not noticing it. i wanted to chase it, but could not turn around to do so because of the traffic. the entire encouter lasted only seconds, but what i noticed was that it was low-flying, and silent. there was no sound. i am familiar with helicopters... sometimes they are landing at the hospital where i work, and even with my windows shut, i can hear them well when they are that high up in the air. this object made no noise. it was traveling at the speed of a car, not an aircraft. it was more like it was floating than flying. the craft was dark against the sky, it was v-shaped, with red and yellow lights all around the perimeter. it was the size of a very small car. larger than a golf cart, but smaller than any small plane. it was something that i could not explain. i've never seen anything in my life that i couldn't put into some kind of category in my mind. this was different. i did notice that the near-by military base was firing off flares that night. they often do that, and i am very familiar with flares and what they look like. this looked like a man-made craft, flying very slow, low, and silent through the night. i wondered if it was some military craft or something. it was flying in a direction away from the base. probably too low to be on any radar. (i think). the object was not doing any fancy maneuvering, it was just flying/floating in a straight line, silently, and i lost site of it, when it went behind my field of vision, over the road. i couldn't turn around. or look at it as it was directly overhead and behind me. then it was lost behind a tree line. \r\nmy feelings during the whole encouter were matter of fact. i was honestly trying to fit it into some file in my mind, it was only a few minutes later that it kind of struck me as really strange because there was no where to file this event. i've never seen anything to compare.

low cloud foggy night which the fog was above me over head some 200 feet or so a black triangle craft crossed across hwy 377 towards the bourland field runway going south. it turned above the runway looking as though it was going to land heading north but when it rreached the end of the runway it turned 90 degrees  left to the west but then turned abruptly 180 degrees back to the east all in near one move.It sat in place just over the landing beacon next to the first east most house in the division. i had stopped and got out of my car in the turn lane adjacent to the beacon and stood and watched the triangle for over three minutes as it sat in air making no sound whatsoever.Along with the nose and wing type lights it had a muted white light dead center underneath the craft. i was about 60 or 70 yards away from the craft and it was about 100 feet or less in the air.I could see it clearly it had no tail section it had no engine flame or propeller visible .It was a narrow tapered triangle .The light on the bottom i at first thought it must of been for landing gear but no doors were open that i could see.\r\nothers seen it as cars were passing behind me but no one else stopped. i was in no hurry as it takes me a hour and a half to get home anyway.\r\nthis is the 3rd such siting i've had in the last three years.The first was around 2 years ago in the spring and on my way home i seen a giant triangle that was at least a mile across in each direction hovering in place more than a mile up in the air on a moonlite (3/4) semi-cloudy night.It was april or may in 2006 over the town of glen rose,texas. it had no lights that i could see but stood out more because no light was reflecting off of it like it was on the clouds.This thing was a monster.\r\ni told my co-workers the next day at work about the latest siting and they kidded me about little green men and flying saucers etc..Un til one of my other co-workers said that she too had seen it but thought it was some nasa drone (as she does still to this day) ownly when the news in the past few days has been up in arms about ufo's in stephenville texas has anyone thought me as crazy .So i've been vendicated and i'm only slightly old aged crazed now. that's my story .The 3rd sighting was also on hwy 377 just out of benbrook texas where one trianle(again) split off into 3 pieces the outer two flew up into the sky

outside cisco, i told my husband to look at the sky again.  there were some more lights.  this time there were just 3 huge bright lights in a line across the sky.  they seemed to be darting back and forth.  the only other way to explain it was maybe there were more lights and they flashed off and on and just looked to be darting.....Then all of them faded.  i had never seen anything like this

arkansas. facing east at canoe outfitters camp site. a large sphere shaped object, maybe 75-100 feet across, colored orange similar to a pumkin rose above the ridge that borders the river about .5 to 1 mile away. the object \"pulsated\" in color, radiating different shades of the orange color like it was \"reving up its engines\". no noise during the entire time. it then progressed due west towards us until it reached the river a block or so to our south. it then made a hard, sharp right turn at the same altitude, maybe 500 to 1,000 feet up, to the south. the object flew south for about 1/2 mile and then made a sharp/hard turn to the west and accelerated speed while rising in altitude at an angle of maybe ten degrees for about a mile or so. it then \"cloaked\" itself within a second or two, so it was no longer visible. completely silent the entire time. \r\n\r\nat 9:15 the scene repeated itself exactly as before. the object rose and transversed the identical path in the same manner as the first one. two other campers a short distance to our north, heard us calling and came to join us. so eight people witnessed the event and all saw exactly the same thing to our wonder and amazement.\r\n\r\nat 9:30 a slightly larger object rose and proceeded to do the same type of \"pulsating\" in color. we called the larger one the \"mother ship\". the big difference in this occurance was the appearance of four silver colored cigar shaped objects rose vertically from behind the ridge about 1/4 mile to our north. these objects hovered for a short time and then flew south directly into the large orange object, one after the other. the larger object the transversed the identical path in the same manner as the first two, and disappeared. \r\n\r\nat aprox. 10:30 a small single engine plane could be seen flying a grid pattern over the general area. the plane appeared to be a little to the north and east of where the occurance was. this went on for 15-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nthe canoe outfitter reacted strangely to the story the next morning, smiling, and said \"...He sure had not seen anything like that...\" from his back deck that faced the ridge, but he had been inside watching tv all night.\r\n\r\nour group's collective opinion was that the object were in fact \"other worldly\" and no us technology of that time was involved in these feats. the appearance of a search plane backs up this opinion, since these were truly ufos and were being searched for my someone.\r\n\r\nend of story\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

dublin i noticed very large orange \"circle\" just to the right of the road but way up in the sky. it was a bit cloudy that night so i thought nothing of it, i thought that it was probably the moon just trying to peak threw the clouds. but after we drove about 5 miles my son and i noticed that it was moving. not moving fast but moving in differant directions. when i first noticed it, it was to the right of the road and by the time i got to the county line of erath and comanche it was slightly to my left. now i know the road does curve just a tad at the county line but not that much. i called a friend that lives in dublin to tell her to go look outside and see if she could see anything. she couldnt due to trees but she reminded me to take a picture. i grabbed my camera and took a couple of pictures but most of them didnt turn out ( blank pictures). as we drove on further, closer to home, we had to made a complete 90 degree turn in proctor, so the orange light was behind us.Note that my 9 year old was watching this light the whole time. he kept saying \"it's a ufo mom!\" and i would just tell him its the moon.  about 2 miles down that road the orange light was in front of us again just to our left! by the time i turned down our county road we had lost track of it due to tall trees. but after all this talk about seeing lights in the sky in dublin and stephenville, i honestly think this was something other than the moon. oh and as for the pictures, about a week after this happened, i was going to through the pictures on my digital camera, and thought \"what do i need this for\" and deleted it. it wasn't a close up picture because of how high it was and because it was so cloudy, but it was have been interesting to share. anyways, i was

constantly sprayed here lately to hide the consistant movements and patterns of these extra-dimensional objects.Objects lately have included huge rectangular crafts 350 feet long and 80 feet wide moving north-east  to south-west.Also a huge cylinder craft moving basically north-east to south-west also.Does this have any correlation to the many sitings as of late in texas?Investigation will be necessary soon.I will buy and begin filming soon  with an above average camcorder.Thank you for your time!
