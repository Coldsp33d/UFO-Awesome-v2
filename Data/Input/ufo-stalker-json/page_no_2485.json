round, seemingly-flat disc, face-on, silvery-white, a bit whiter than the moving clouds behind it.   it didn't seem to reflect light.  it didn't move.  its very stillness was part of what made it noticeable.  one of my first fleeting thoughts was that it looked like a coin blank.  most first thought fragments had to do with what it was doing there.  i had the feeling it was watching.  as i drove, i tried to watch it and at the same time find a place i could stop safely to watch it.  it never moved.   i finally turned off on a side street in order to park, -- but it was gone.  i didn't see it move or disappear, nor was i able to find it anywhere else in the sky.  ever since, i scan the sky all the time.  my son in mn says he has seen such discs over

occured whilst i had gone up from the path next to the serpentine onto the road bridge crossing it.\r\n\r\nthe day was a very hot indian summer's afternoon with a mainly clear blue sky.\r\n\r\ni noticed the object climbing upwards at a sharp angle as if travelling from the earth into space.\r\n\r\nwhat was most astonishing a t first was that i noticed the airliners were placed beneath the object which already suggested by its form that it was large. if the planes were under and set against the ufo, then it must have been enormous. the question of its size actually made me question what i saw over and over again; and question less the apparent composition of the ufo.\r\n\r\ni had the distinct impression that i was watching something that was not a machine in ordinary terms, at least.\r\nthe shape of the ufo seemed to be ovoid though i wondered if it might not be circular or even a sphere if looked at from another angle.\r\n\r\naround the edge of the ufo was what appeared to be dark red flame, a bit like rocket exhaust. the interior seemed very dark and very intense with energy. i felt that i was watching something organic with its own will reaching for space.\r\n\r\nduring my sighting(i was leaning against the stonework of the bridge, with cars and pedestrians passing, it was a very fine afternoon) i happened to look down from the bridge atthe narrow pedestrian path which goes underneath it. a couple, who i ascertained to be francophone, were watching it as well. the man shouted up. he told me that he had seen something similar.....In switzerland...I seem to remember.\r\n\r\nalso a woman who was passing with her family, and who had noticed me looking up had also noticed the ufo. she asked me what it was to which i replied that i didn't know.\r\n\r\nthe ufo climbed the sky, its size diminishing as it gained height. i eventually left the bridge and continued to walk though i glanced up noticing the ufo was still present for a very long time though it was becoming very small in relation to the earth.\r\n\r\nlater i looked up a ufo society based in the uk and sent a report. i did not hear anything back. this phenomenon has kept on recurring in my thoughts for years now, and i feel the need to report it again.\r\n\r\ni have already seen apparent ufos when i was a teenager stargazing in my back garden. small star shaped  lights that would move at strange angles. stop. then move off at very sharp angles.\r\n\r\nrecently an area near my childhood home (stirling, scotland) has become known for its sightings of ufos (bonnybridge  (triangle))\r\n\r\ni also know of sightings by family members. one of them lived in rhodesia/zimbabwe in the 1950s.\r\n\r\ni should probably add that i have experienced parapsychological phenomena at certain moments in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat i found most incredible, in both senses of the word, about the ufo\r\nsighting was a) its apparent immensity\r\n\r\nb) the nature of its force. it gave me the impression being extrememly concentrated.\r\n\r\nc) about a year later i took a walk across hyde park following roughly the same route to bayswater obviously with the sighting in mind. what i remembered then was that the afternoon of sighting appeared to occur, in terms of motion and atmosphere, in slow motion. i had a definite sense of the dreamlike about the day though i testify that it did occur as i state it.\r\n\r\ncoincidentally, i happened to flick my tv over one evening, about three months, to a programme i rarely watch, richard and judy, a popular early evening chat programme on channel 4. i was about to flick over again when i heard the word 'ufo' which immediately grabbed my attention.\r\n\r\nan airline pilot was being interviewed about his sighting from his plane of a huge ufo he reckoned to be about a mile long.\r\n\r\nthe recent sighting in texas which, via the net, led me to your organisation, suggested a ufo a mile

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The exact date is unsure,but i believe it was june, 1976.  i had just left from visiting my great uncles house, and while driven north on 4th street, just past limit street, i noticed a bright low flying light to the east through the tree line.  i thought is was too bright and too low, and too slow to be a helicopter, and as i continued, i could still see it over the next several miles and i drove, tracking along the missouri river, along the tree line.  long story short, i turned east on cherokee and couldn't see it any more.  i rush home, jumped out of the car and told my mom and dad about the strange lights.  they kinda humored me.  i went outside, climbed a tree just next to our house, and continued to watch out for the light in the east. after 15 minutes or so, i saw the light again, this time much higher, and the craft was a mile or more away - and made a big circle clockwise to the tree i was in -but still no closer than a mile.  i watched it do this twice in a thirty minute time span as it disappeared in the east.  the 3rd time it came around, i ran in the house and convinced my mom and dad to come out, and my sister and older brother did as well.   and what a surprise we had in store.    this time, as the craft made the same circular clockwise journey as it got directly to the north of us (and to the north standing on our doorstep, we can see the dome of the federal penitentiary so we had good lighting and a good reference point), the craft came directly toward us.  it was low this time, about 200 feet in the air, flying at about 5 mph, and the sound i'll never forget - hardly loud enough to be considered a whisper.  while it was still  less than a block away my mother ran into the house to grab a polaroid camera (that was the best we had back them), and a bank of flash bulbs and came back outside.  she was so nervous she couldn't manage to get the bulbs into the camera.  it flew over our heads heading south very slow - 5mph.  the sound was a soft \"swoosh\", and as it went past us and over the house, it banked to the southeast and we didn't see it anymore.  the craft was about 20 ft in diameter, had white and green lights in the front and a red light on the back.  my dad called in a police report, the police came about 20 minutes later.  my dad sat outside in the police car and filed the report.  there were several reports in the paper (leavenworth times) the following day of ufo sightings , casually dismissed as likely being military related craft (but no craft were confirmed in the area and no comment from the military) since we are so close to ft leavenworth base. i'm an ex-army officer, and even to this day, i've never seen anything like what i saw then.  my father passed away several years ago, but even to this day, i ask my family if that really happened, and mom, my brother and sister (and dad until he passed continually confirm it.  i've often wanted to have the leavenworth police department provide me with a copy of the police report, but i just never did.  maybe mufon will.  i remember drawing what we saw several times, and i believe i gave a copy to the policeman as well after my father explained the story to the policeman, but i'm not really sure of that.  i am sure that it no one in my family to this day believes we saw anything conventional.  for credibility, purposes, i was a captain in the army before i got out, and both of my brothers recently retired from the army as lieutenant colonels. my mother still lives at the same house on the corner where all this happen (14th and delaware).  the tree i climbed was cut down a few years ago, but everything else is pretty much unchanged in the landscape.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

it's only gone out during storms before.  \r\n\r\nit first went out right at 8pm, seconds after \"comanche moon\" started.  after finding the signal again, it came on for a few minutes then went out again.  after about the third time i thought about something blocking the signal.  thinking of the stephenville incident, i went outside to see if that ufo was was out there.  i didn't see anything, but while i was out there the naval air station (the old carswell afb) sent up 3 to 5 jets that came south from the base and then turned to the west southwest.  i'm about ten miles south of the base and the dublin/stephenville area is about 50 miles to the wsw. \r\n\r\nafter about the third outage i called direct tv tech help and got no one, holding for what seemed like over ten minutes.  after about the fifth time i called again, holding again and never speaking to anyone, but this time the phone was filled with so much static it was unbearable, and i hung up.  the phone was land line, not

unexplainable(at least to me).Every night i go out on the balcony of my appartment as a way to calm myself by breathing some fresh air and gazing at the stars.But as i was sitting on my chair i suddenly saw to the west (wich at that time was almost always a flight path for many jets and aircraft) some kind of aircraft i suppose wich had the distinct look of a red star.I dont know the approximate distance from me and the object since i have no idea how large this object was.But i believe it could have been roughly 5-8km.\r\ni didnt believe it was a regular aircraft nor a passanger jet of some kind,since the object was at first stationary,it showed no movement,but after about 5 seconds after i saw it it started moving in clockwise direction around me,i had my binoculars for such exact curious events by my side but i was too shocked to even move and i just kept observing its every move.The \"object\" was glowing a bright redish glow with a clear sphere-like shape altough i cant be certain.If the distance to the object was 5-8km then the object must have been hovering at 1km above the ground\r\nroughly calculated that is.Tough the best describtion for this \"aircraft\" is a red star appearence and a prefect oval red glow around it.As i was sayingit started moving perfectly smooth towards the northeast in a clockwise direction around me,with possibly 800km/h altough it looked relatively slow it steadily went behind the next building and i lost sight of it for about a minute,then it reapeared again with the same flightpath and unchanged route still moving steadily in a wide circle around me(altough i didnt realise this at first).After about 5 minutes it was exactly on the clear horizon to the north of me.At that point for 5 whole minutes i did nothing but gaze at the object and try to figure out what it was,and strangely enough i felt nothing as if it calmed me to watch it(or it could have been the shock of something so significant) \r\nwhen the object reached north it continued to hover and move steadily across again a clear flightpath now towards the east and thensouth east and then (clockwise).After another 5 minutes of staring at the objecs slow movement it reached a spot wich for my view was blocked by several tall trees,i could still see the glow tough(barely)and at that point it stopped moving after completing a perfect 180 degree (half circle) around me after waiting for any signals of lights or any more strange behaviour from the object for about 10 seconds it just stood still and in an instant bolted through the sky and i lost sight of it.I still havent seen this odd object,aircraft again to this day...\r\n\r\ni hope that someone could shed light on what i saw or at least share some similar sighting to help me understand

off-campus apt., which was a large complex of 2 story apt. buildings. i was in the living room listening to an album, and he was standing outside on his 2nd floor balcony. he started laughing, and called for me to come look at something. when i when out on the balcony, he pointed up to a spot that was across the parking lot, to the edge of the property that was bordered with very tall trees (pine?), maybe 75 yards away, and hovering some seemingly close distance above these very tall trees was a bright ball of sparkly light, about the size (not shape) of a small car. what i have always remembered about that moment was that it reminded me of a hand held sparkler (like at a 4th of july celebration), that kind of bright, intense light.  we were both in complete amazement. as we watched it for maybe 20-30 seconds, it seemed to remain stationary. on a side note, i rememberd how odd it was to see a guy walking across the parking lot in the distance, carrying a case of beer, and he had no idea about what was occuring above his head.\r\nso my friend and i decide to run down stairs, across the parking lot to get a closer look. once we got downstairs and started running towards this object, it now seemed to be a little further away, and a little higher up, than it first appeared. so since his car was close by, we got in and headed off down the street to get a closer look. well this turned out to be quite a ride. it was still light out when we first saw this object. as we left the street that the apt. was on, we headed onto a main highway, now heading south for a few miles. then we headed west as the object seemed to be getting further and higher away with each passing minute. we continued west until we reached the outskirts of town, and now we had to go north to keep tracking it. i remember that it was now getting dark as we were heading north, leaving the city limits. by now this ball was starting to look  more like the brightest star in what was a very clear, full moon (or close to it) night, becoming smaller as it got further away. \r\nfinally, we were a few miles beyond the city, out in a rural area, where we stopped on a two lane, just before this road crossed over interstate 4. we got out and just stood quietly looking up at this incredible night sky, filled with stars, but the one we had been chasing was the brightest. it was up in the northwest sky, at about 10 o'clock. it seemed to be staionary, and so we both started just gazing around at all of the sky, and our surrondings. we were probably looking around for a few minutes when nicky yelled to me, \"look\"...I spun around and looked up to where this object had been, and it was now moving very fast across the sky,towards the east, (from a 10 o'clock position to a 2 o'clock position)where it suddenly stopped as it \"appeared\" to meet another star. after a few seconds, it took off again in the direction of the moon, and as it lined up between us and the moons brightness, it seemed to disappear. \r\n\r\nalthough  i have recounted this story over the past 34 years to probably a dozen people, i've always wanted to share it with someone who really understands this reality. and now that i've just shared this most personal and amazing experience with a complete stranger, i'm hoping that you will reply with maybe a confirmation of this sighting from your records, but more importantly, some general information regarding our experience, in terms of this type of ufo experience.  \r\n\r\nalso, i really can't remember the exact month, but it was certainly summer. and it was at, or around, a full moon, and it was a friday.  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am contacting you regarding what appears to be a plaster of paris mold made of an alien���s head that my brother and i currently have in our possession. my brother found it while hiking in the ���back country��� in east san diego county in 1996. he came across it while hiking in an open area/meadow and kicked it over, thinking it was some kind of whitish rock. when he did, he saw that it was hollow inside, so he took it home. we later examined its interior using a couple mirrors and lamps and saw that it was an apparently unbroken plaster mold made by ���plastering��� the large, oblong, lobed head of an alien-looking creature. \r\n\r\nalthough it is a bit difficult seeing around inside the large, heavy plaster cast, the eyes and nostrils are clearly visible by looking in at an angle through the neck opening, as well as bony-looking brow protuberances above each eye, two ���lobe��� impressions at the back of the inner scull, prominent ridges running crosswise along the length of the inside of the cranium, and many features that look like the impressions made by folds and wrinkles in the skin of the neck and so forth.\r\n\r\nwe have no idea whatsoever as to whether this is a cast of a genuine alien���s head or some simple joke, fraud, artistic endeavor, or whatnot. at the time we found it there certainly didn���t seem to have been any efforts made by anyone to exploit it in any way. it seems to us that one possible explanation is that one or more individuals came across a dead alien and buried it with its head sticking up out of the ground (or found it in that condition) and returned with plastering materials and encased the head in plaster. it would seem then that the plaster mold was never retrieved and that over time the materials composing the alien���s head simply deteriorated and were eaten away such that by the time my brother came across the plaster cast it was still intact and yet empty. when my brother found it the open, neck part was partially buried in the ground while the covering of the ���skull��� was barely visible above the surrounding grass.\r\n\r\nbut of course this is all shear speculation. at the time my brother found this oddity and brought it to my mother���s home in campo, ca, my mother was dying of cancer and we were caring for her during her final days. our mother was a very religious person (christian, protestant) and in her weakened state she imagined that the cast was an evil presence and she did not want it in or around her house. she was not satisfied until my brother had heaved it out into a field nearby our house. that was in 1996, the year our mother died. \r\n\r\nuntil two weeks ago i had assumed that strange plaster cast had been lost to us for good, but i have thought about it many times and have wished we could have had it examined by some experts. we still own my mother���s old house, although it has not been kept up or lived in a number of years. in visiting there a few times over the years i have walked the field where we through that cast, but i could never find it.\r\n\r\nover this past holiday season (christmas 2007) my brother was visiting the old house in campo when he came across something wrapped in a bundle of garbage bags in a corner of the covered carport. when he opened all the bags he found that old plaster cast we hadn���t seen in all those years. the only explanation for this i can think of is that over the months my mother was dying we had many family members coming and going and apparently one of more of them found the mold and stored it away in protective garbage bags. all i can say is good for them.\r\n\r\ni can���t say that we hold out a terribly great expectation that this is truly a cast made of an alien���s head, but we���ve just got to know ��� one way or another. i have been an avid listener of the art bell show for many years and have heard some good things about mufon ��� so i thought i would start with our local branch right here in san diego.\r\n\r\ni���m sure this is not the typical sort of case you deal with, but maybe you could steer us in the right direction in finding someone who could determine just what this thing we have is. we would appreciate any help you could give us. i have enclosed three photos with brief descriptions:\r\n\r\npict #1: photo of the face which is located inside the end of the cast with the large, protruding, frontal lobe. you can see the two eyes halfway down the photo, with the nostrils located between, a little lower than the eyes. there is some sort of brow-like protuberance above and to the inside of each eye.\r\n\r\npict #2: photo looking down into neck hole of the cast. you can some of the cranium ridges and some of the wrinkles in the neck.\r\n\r\npick #3: photo showing cast in position in which it was found ��� with neck opening on bottom. (apple added to give size perspective.) the cranial lobe to the right (the frontal lobe, containing the face) is at least twice as large as the one to the left (the back of the head). there are two small lobe (saucer-like) impressions at the back of the head inside.]\r\n\r\nthanks for the help,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narthur leach\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8916,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.6075795,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01162008-0002","longitude":-116.4697321,"occurred":840524400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":840524400000,"summary":"Found what appears to be a plaster cast of an alien head","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8916_submitter_file1__HEAD1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8916_submitter_file2__HEAD2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8916_submitter_file3__HEAD3.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"CAMPO, CA, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:416783"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Francisco","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello mufon:\r\ni am reporting a brief sighting that i experienced a few years ago. i would have emailed the details at that time, except that i only recently learned that people may report sightings to you here.\r\n\r\ni am not 100% sure about the date.\r\n\r\nthese are the details of which i am sure:\r\n\r\nit was at night, around 12 or 12:30am.  i was standing on a second floor balcony, stargazing.  i was facing north and looking at the constellations and studying the perceived colors of distinctive stars and noting the usual visible satellites and their 'flash patterns'.  i had binoculars hanging around my neck.  there were constant passersby on the street below - individuals, couples and small groups of females, males and coed groups.  it was a clear night with a clear sky.\r\n\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly - a large, dark, triangle-shaped object entered my field of vision from above and behind me (from the south).  it was unexpected as there were no sounds projected ahead of it, nor any accompanying it.  nor were there any lights or physical vibrations preceding or accompanying it.  it traveled in a straight line, following a trajectory directly through where i had been looking.\r\n\r\ni instantly realized that this object was not any type of aircraft which i had ever seen - civilian, commercial or military.  nor was it a helicopter or a dirigible/balloon.  it's lines were straight and corners sharp.  i had never seen anything like it before this moment.\r\n\r\nit had no illuminated lights on it - a basic requirement of aircraft in flight.  there were no signs of there being any sources of light on it.  in fact, there was nothing visible on the large, dark shape that i was scrutinizing and a bit stunned by.\r\n\r\nit was \"rocketing\" across the night sky above me, heading north.  i say \"rocketing\", because it was racing.  not only was its speed unusual, but so was the fact that it never made a sound.  nor did it, at any time, cause any vibrations.  i thought this odd because it was flying lower than commercial aircraft and was moving much faster than they do... and those aircraft are always accompanied by audible rumbling and, occasionally, by vibrations as they pass over.\r\n\r\nthese initial perceptions happened in seconds and i had instantly realized that what i was seeing was something unusual and unique.  i immediately reached for the binoculars hanging around my neck.  as i lifted them to my eyes, i  quickly glanced to a point ahead of where i had just seen the object - above the street in front of me and not quite halfway across the sky - so i knew where to point the binoculars... and i was stunned to find that it was already gone.  completely gone - no lights shrinking as it continued on its path - no vapor, smoke or exhaust trail left behind.  nothing.  i was amazed that it was gone - in less than 5 seconds, that there was no sign of it anywhere in the sky (it was a clear night) and that not one other person on the ground ever noticed it or looked up.\r\n\r\ni felt fortunate, like i had just seen something special. i make no assumptions about it.  i don't know what it was. the 'most-logical'(and least imaginative) assumption might be that it's something being tested by the military.  no surprise if it was.  and it wouldn't be the first time a secret(why else fly at night with no lights on?), dark, silent, swift and (unsuccessfully)stealthy object flew over my head - i tend to notice such things, even if no one else does.\r\n\r\ni have read of a number of other sightings involving triangle-shaped objects in the sky, so i thought it might be worth adding my own amazing, albeit brief, sighting.\r\n\r\nthank you for the opportunity.\r\n\r\ni'll keep looking up.\r\ni'll definitely let mufon know if(when) i have any noteworthy observation.\r\n\r\nbest regards.

looking out our office attrium which is in the middle of our office with a full opening to a view of the sky above.  i dont know the sq. ft. as i'm not good at estimating that but it's a large attrium. as my co-worker was talking my eyes wandered to the sky above and i noticed an airplane flying overhead which was not out of the ordinary since we see airplanes all the time being that lax is not far from marina del rey. most or all airplanes take off from lax going west and circle the ocean then turn to their destinations.  as i was watching this large regular size airplane, (like a 747 or similar), i noticed a shiny silver, round looking object come up fast from behind it and it started following on the lower right side of the plane.  i kept watching it as my co-worker was talking to me, as it was going faster then the plane now, and it was too high in the sky to be a helicopter, or small cessna, and traveling much to close.  even so it was round shiny and silver.  i stopped my co-worker from talking and pointed it out to him, and as i was trying to show it to him, the object sped past the airplane and took off. i'm not sure what it was,. but i know what it wasnt.  my co-worker did not see it, as he was looking farther right of the airplane then the object was. now given the speed an airplane travels, for this to out run an airplane, was not something i've seen before. i was floored, surprised and excited at the same time.\r\nagain the plane was too high for the object to be a helicopter following or a cessna, and too close even if it were, for safetey reasons.  the speed in which it traveled, and took off was to say the least pretty damn fast and too fast for it to be another aircraft to out run an airplane at that speed, height, and size. i then lost sight of it, as it took off fast, going southeast ahead of the airplane, i realized i'd just seen something i'd never seen before.  i know what helicopters look like, large passenger airplanes/jets and cessnas, as i live between marina del rey and lax, and have lived in this surrounding area my entire life, so i see all aircraft flying reguarly every day all day, so this was most definately out of the ordinary. again it was small, silver shiny, round / egg shaped, and traveled at a high rate of speed.  i dont know how long it was trailing the plane or if the plane even knew it was there.   \r\nso that's my story.  my first time seeing something in the skys that i was not sure what it was, but i know what it wasnt.  \r\nthanx for reading,\r\nmdr, ca","distance":"Over One
