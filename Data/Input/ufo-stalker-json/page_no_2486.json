work.At aprox.6.50am he turned east on sr.455 from running bear road.He saw bright white lights coming over the hill, on the opposite side of the dam.His first thought was (air craft).He had been in the navy,in the past.He is familiar with aircraft.He started looking for the red and green lights.Not only did he not see them, but it was flying very slow aprox.30 mph.30-50 yards away.It seemed to be hugging the shore line,flying at eye level.He slowed down,opened the car window,observed the craft as is went past.It made no sound at all.Black and gray in color.Delta shape.No bigger than his 1978 thunderbird. rectangular rear,with three large round openings in side.No apparent thrust.No fire, ect.The top of the craft,looked as if it had an extended canopy.Running about three quarters of the way down the fuselage.It was matalic as well.The bottom looked like it had panel lines.As i said, it had three white lights under it.Non blinking!He stopped by the house for a refill on his coffee,told my wife about it,drew a picture of the craft,and wrote down all details, then went off to work.After telling a co-worker at the shop his story,the guy told him he had seen it as well.But thinking people would think he was nuts,didnt say anything.His friend had seen it in sanger.[the town on the other side of the dam.]later the news cast,ran a story on a sighting in stevenville tx.Thay are aprox.60 mi.South of us.The object thay saw,was vary large.I see no comparison to that craft,but wonder if thay are related in some way.All i have to say is , is it one of ours?(this tecnology is out of this world)  ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with directional

saw this unearthly object shoot through the lower horizon.  it reminded me of a boat beacon in that is was cylinder shaped standing upright and glowing in two areas.  it's movement was not something familiar as it flew at a quick angle almost parallel to the land but heading down. i felt a familiarity and i really had to search deep in my brain to remember that only 8 or so months prior i had viewed something similiar (but more in number) in the exact same area.  two other folks in my car that first night also viewed the display of objects in the sky.  this area would be near or over the watershed for our region.  i had to continue to search my brain, i mean harder than normal, and i remembered that the local news broadcast that night, the first time i saw it, had reported a story of several people seeing the same lights and that is was a \"meteor shower\". the second time i saw the object (singular the second time) i felt for sure it was an ufo especially as hard as i had to try to remember the first time i had seen the objects (plural for the first time).  it was really weird how it seemed to try to be suppressed in my memory and how hard i had to try to pull it out! i shared my experience with a few of the locals in the next few days.  no one else saw it the second time that i am aware of.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

first object i followed did not have typical red or green aviation lights until it turned toward the second craft- this first object was shaped like a cross with only blue lights then turned in a way to reveal 2 red lights (no flashing) and the second craft appeared as a triangle and only had three lights that i can see. i have a picture on my phone if i could send it you could examine it. please

happened. i had stated to her that i wish i could see a ufo. that was on friday.\r\n\r\nthe next monday morning i prepared to leave for work and walked outside, down the steps and toward my car when i suddenly felt compelled to turn \r\naround and look up over my mothers house.\r\n\r\nthis thing was sitting still, silent, and it had long bands of light sequincing on the bottom of its stainless appearing shape. as one light would brighten the previous would dim out (about the color of a welders arc only not so bright) it was football shaped looking at it from directly underneath but oval disc would describe it too. it was between 300'& 400' long i would say; half that wide.\r\n\r\nas soon as i saw it, i went inside and got my mom and we watched it until our necks became sore. finally, she went inside an said \"tell me what it does!\"(in her 60's) this thing was just above the pine trees on our block\r\nand was mostly covering our short city block, and i remember thinking others\r\nwere seeing it too. it just kept sitting there.\r\n\r\nfinally, i recall saying out loud, \"what is holding it up\" \"what is powering it; that it can just sit suspended like that\" (with no noise)\r\ninstantly, a reply came, not out loud.... but just into my mind i guess\r\nlike telepathy? \"its like magnets you played with as a young person\" \"remember how the wrong ends repeled?\" yes, i answered out loud!\r\n\"it has a nuclear powered electromagnetic gyro\" came the next.... \"oh\"\r\n\r\nneedless to say, i was dumfounded! then the thought process continued\"you\r\nwere talking about seeing a ufo last week, remember?\" \"yes\" ... i shot back \"would you like to go with us?\" at that, i became somewhat frightened. i thought back that i would like to but i was frightened and \r\nwas just beginning my life etc. almost as soon as i replied in the negative, the light bands which had been slowly sequencing speeded up. \r\n\r\nafter a minute the whole base began to glow and the individual bands were\r\nless decernable. it climbed higher (it was about 100 feet at first)..Maybe it doubled its altitude and stopped again. the river is a block or two away and it probably was directly over it when it stopped. it wobbled a little on its first movement; black smoke wiffed from somewhere on top,(you couldn't see where) and came over the edge in a  \r\npuff. im still looking at the base. as it stopped, higher now, white smoke\r\nwiffed a little from somewhere on top too. then, the whole bottom began to glow, brighter and brighter then superglow..... \r\n\r\ni began moving again just slow southeast; but then it accelerated so quickly you actually couldn't see where it went! i have seen navy jets \r\nat airshows flying fast low........ the thing i saw went so quickly when in acelerated you actually couldn't follow it with your eyes. it like started southeast but then in just was gone. almost like it disapeared?\r\n\r\ni raced back inside and my mother and i called the police and tv stations\r\netc and asked if they had calls about something unusual and they had no idea what i was talking about. so, we just let it go. what do you do\r\nor who do you tell??? \r\n\r\ni got my wish though! i have sometime watched the ufo shows just to see\r\nif anyone would describe my ufo. sometimes i would hear discussion about\r\nwhat powers ufo's. i just smile because i have known that since the spring of 1968.\r\n\r\nlast year or awhile back i heard someone say they are working with\r\nelectromagnetics @ oak ridge. i guess you can imagine, that caught my ear!\r\n\r\ni also hope there might be someone out there who will read this and know\r\nit is truthful!

realized they were above the cliff and way too big for any humans to be setting up. the lights were too bright and not stationary for me to tell what was behind them. i got pretty excited and pulled my truck off the side of the road. i got out and watched. i stood there and the lights were kind of interweaving together but definately blue and green but not separate. i had a hard time with the perception to tell if it was right above the cliff or further away. if it was above the cliff then it would have been about 500 feet wide by 100 feet tall, the space the lights filled up. if it was further back it would have been massive. then as i was watching about ten minutes after i first saw it, it just zoomed up and away from me and dissappeared in about 3 seconds. completely gone . no sign of it. it looked like the lights just shrunk away into nothing. well that's it .....I was amazed and bewildered and excited all at once and sorry that no one elsewas on the road and had seen it,

gasped as i saw a ufo maybe 100ft away, hovering at maybe the height a helicopter would. it wasn't making any noise at all and just hovered. it was a disc shape, very flat, and very illuminated. i stood and walked to the closest edge of my deck, and in a blip, it was gone. i was shocked and a little scared, and my cat was still in a panic.","distance":"21-100

seemed brighter than the stars around it, and began to watch it. it started to make sharp turns and would jump forward two to three times, then it would turn in a circle i then called my wife to show her and it kept on doing the same thing. we watch it together for at least ten minutes together as it kept on doing the same thing. i would go out every ten minutes to see where it was, and it kept on moving it that way toward the western sky toward my house. i kept watching it over the next few hours checking on it every ten to fifteen minutes. when i looked out again at\r\n11pm it was gone. during this time there was another bright object in the southern sky that had bright pulsating lights that would or should i say seem to change size as its lights pulsed. both objects disappeared when i went out to check on then at 11pm. both my wife and i agreed that we are not alone, and i am certain that we do not have any kind of aircraft that can do what i say last night.

18:23 ��� 18:50\r\n\r\nthis report would made to ufosnw on january 17th 2007.\r\ni was in carrboro, nc at the exit ramp of hwy 40 and hwy 86. i was casually picking a real estate sign and looking at the clear sky.Suddenly i saw something moving at what looked like the speed of a military jet. but after it travelling about 3 inches from my view it stopped in mid air. i continued to watch it and it did not fade. instead it changed directions and started moving perpendicular, back and forth as though oscillating. it then started to make odd movements hooked shaped movements with sudden stops and  reversing, then forward movements darting the eratic movements before it went futher to the right. i tried to call several friends to see. one of the first came out of her house in durham,nc. i told her to look up and to the left of those three bright stars almost in a vertical straight line. i told her to watch that star sitting alone by itself. after a few seconds (more like 10 seconds) i asked her to tell me what she was seeing, she said the star is moving up and down. \r\n\r\nthis sighting lasted around 30 minutes before it continued to my right which i think was east. and gradually faded. my friend got frightened and went back into her house. i could not tell any shape. it just\r\nlooked like a star (dot) in the sky. it was clearly visible but not the\r\nbrightest object in the sky. in fact it passed just below the brightest \r\nobject from my perspective. i have never seen anything move as eratically not change flying directions immediately, no wide turns or anything. just go to one way and immediately retrace its direction back. then back and forth then move forward a little more make different motions and hook like motions and thenmove across the sky and start bouncing (oscillating movement) again until it went off to the east and faded. and not in its original direction, about 60 degrees to the left. i do not know what it was but i have never seen  anything move like it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
