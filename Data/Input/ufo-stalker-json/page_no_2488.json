yucatan. i and my partner had been in mexico for about three months, and we had been in the yucatan since christmas 1973. travelling with us were a friend of mine from high school and a fellow we���d met on the train from montreal to vancouver. we���d asked him if he wanted to come with us to mexico, because we were going to buy a beater in san francisco and drive across mexico, and we needed someone who could fix a car ��� often.\r\n\twe had rented a place in chelem (between progreso and chuburna puerta) for one month, and then we met a young canadian couple whose (names i remember as jerry and cathy) told us that nearby chuburna was a much cleaner, pleasanter place, and there were places to rent with bathrooms and cement ceilings (a plus if you don���t want scorpions dropping randomly from above onto you as you���re lying in your hamaca).\r\n\taround this time, we were watching for comet kahoutek (which i did see, faintly, once). jerry and cathy told us about a strange light they had seen recently several times at night looking toward the horizon across the gulf. it was a small, white, roundish-oval-shaped light that moved straight along the distant horizon and then vanished.\r\n\tone night around 3 am or so, we all went down to the beach (just a few steps away) and stood on the outside veranda of a concrete villa, someone���s empty summer home. after a while cathy pointed out to the gulf, towards the right end of the horizon, just above the ocean. there was the light they had seen before, and it was moving, not at a breakneck speed but steadily left across our field of vision. when it reached a point where it was in a straight line ahead of us, it made a 90-degree turn and became steadily larger ��� it was a making a beeline toward us.\r\n\twithin less than five minutes, this light was hovering above the beach slightly to our right, about 30 feet away, maybe 20 to 30 feet up from the ground. we were looking up at it perhaps at a 45-degree angle. it was very silent, but we could detect a faint, low steady hum quite unlike the sound of an airplane or helicopter. there were no discernible features to be seen, just a giant glowing-whitish egg shape hovering there. we felt sure something in there must have been checking us out ��� why else would they have come over here? we were absolutely aghast, blown away and disbelieving all at once. some one said ���should we try communicating with them?��� nobody did (out loud, anyway). i remember feeling very nervous and incredibly curious for maybe four or five minutes as we continued to stare in trepidation  at this ���. object. then it hovered slowly up and wafted over the palm trees of chuburna, away from the ocean. the sky was just starting to lighten, and the object vanished from sight.\r\n\ti had never seen anything like this before and have never seen anything like it since. but i have never forgotten it, even though 33 years have passed.

at the courtyard at the marriot, i said a prayer out loud requesting to see ufos. one week later on this date im brainwashed i turned the area into a nightly hotspot\r\n\r\nthe military picked up on this and ive seen strange airplanes with big satellites spinning circles around the area on a nightly basis , although lately its been quiet since new years, i think my prayer made the us government just waste probably over a million dollars in jet fuel in the last 6 months.\r\n\r\nive never seen anything like these floating orbs, its almost like starring at a ghosts orb, it has no rules of latitude or langitude \r\n\r\nive starred at these things for hours and i think that was it, i know were related to ras family, we domument these things, i think it comes from theyre heart, they love ra sungods family. i heard theyre voices in my head im not stupid.\r\n\r\nanyways the point was proven it is over, while i suffer in chicago areain poverty treating 10 dollars like it is a lot of money, the government blows over 1 million dollars in jetfuel chasing after the same lights every night, it obviously wasnt getting anywhere with these mufon morons, but i think they were trying to take pictures although i saw the us planes get only so close to them before they turned off theyre lights and scrammed.\r\n\r\nthat was the funniest thing, i knew that was a ufo and one of my friends of ra that night and this big old sattelite plane sped dreictly twrds it. i smiled as the funny light over my house everynight flipped its switches and put up theyre middle finger as the us government\r\nwhile people suffer in poverty they blow millions in jetfuel under skeptism, research of what they do not own, and untrust in our god jesus christ. as if we are not under good hands for a reason\"? in a way were not, but, it is because of thieves like these government researchers.\r\n\r\ni still dont understand why they brought the us research department to st charles illinois, they made a big out of themsevles, i watched the ufos and planes over my house everynight in poverty. i prayed with my hand together asking for this, but i didnt expect them to make a point to me that theyre acting like were not in good hands.\r\n\r\nmaybe were not in good hands because of people like those government planes, who just blew over a million dollars and attatining obviously nothing but images of a light that was too bright to get a good pictures, and yet turned off its lights and leaves every time they got too close to it.\r\n after the first week of this happening every night here, they should of learned theyre lesson perhaps in arizona, knowing that getting too close to those things only makes them flick theyre middle finger switching off the lights. im sure arizona is billions of dollars wasted under them trying to attain a ufo , while they abuse power under representation on the government military and democracy\r\n\r\ni dont think so buddy, this is ra sungods family...The

there saturday i cannot since my cocker will have her eye removed tuesday due to glaucoma. with other dogs in the house i cannot leave her home alone until the stitches come out.\r\n\r\nin-between 1995-1996 while living 13 miles from stephenville down 281 (which has selden on the way), i witnessed something similar to the latest reports. i worked nights back then but due to being sore decided i would call in sick. about 10:30 pm while i had my outside dogs food soaking they started barking like something was around (coyotes, snake) so i went outside to see what was up. they were at the end of a fence line so i went to it and looked and didn't see anything they could be barking at near the ground, but i did notice a very bright light flying low to the ground way off in the distance. i thought then maybe a helicopter with a search light and if it came closer i might hear it or a plane that was flying way too low that would need to be monitored. as i recall the moon was not out thus i thought maybe that made the light seem bigger and brighter than i though even a plane would have. i quieted the dogs down and went back in to get their food. when i went back out they were back to barking at the end of the fence so i made them come get their food. i walked to the fence line again and this bright light was a lot closer to the point i should have been hearing an engine or something. i could tell it was flying low under radar since a russian plane in germany did the same thing over our army base. not hearing any sound i decided to wait and find out what could be flying that low without hearing an engine. when it came closer i could hear a humming sound (only sound it made). it passed directly overhead blocking out all the stars above and was only about 180-240 ft above the ground (mobile home 60' wide used to estimate this). it was round with some lights on a bottom that looked metallic and i estimate that it was 3-4 acre's round (size of my place now). needless to say i was amazed and scared at the same time. i ran in and got my gun and 35mm camera and notice the tv had no interference on it while the tonight show was on. when i got back outside i realized how stupid it was to get my gun since i wouldn't shoot at it. the camera was at the end of the roll so i don't think i got a picture of it (some film i still haven't ever developed). the thing was headed in a direction that would take it directly over hwy 281 and it was moving really slow, probably about 10 mph. i went back inside and wrote down all i could think about it and then called in sick to work. i considered calling the air force, but decided against it since if no harm came to me i didn't want any harm to come to it. i doubt there is any way in this world we or any earthling could have a ship that big that they could hide much less only make a humming noise to power it. \r\n\r\ni had heard a few years earlier that people in the north had seen something the size of football fields that the government said was objects flying in formation. this was low enough to see the huge bottom was solid and it blocked out all the stars above so it wasn't several objects flying in formation. since that time i have moved back to my place which is 3 miles out of stephenville and during that move all my belongings where outside during a 6\" rain. i have never come across the information and sketch i made that night, though i haven't looked for it either. being this close to town i just considered it a once in a lifetime event that confirmed what my mother and father told me about seeing in the 50's was a lot more believable. my father was in the army 21 years and worked in radar. he told me that while firing missiles at white sands and around el paso they often tracked ufo's that sometimes had planes sent up to check it out but they never heard anything back from it. what they saw was a cigar shaped ship that was doing things none of our air craft at the time could do (he loved planes and stayed up on them). being this close to town i did not think anything like this would venture this close but last tuesday i did hear some jets fly over twice which is not a common practice for this area. since 911 i maybe only have heard them a couple of times before. also one night quite a while back i thought i heard that humming sound again, but i didn't go outside to check it out since i thought there was no way they would come this close to town. now i know different. \r\n\r\ni did not see what was recently seen, but selden is only about a 6 minute drive from the location of what i saw years ago. the very bright light and only making a humming sound with being big is similar enough to spark my interest. after getting on the internet and finding your site i did search some to see if any reports where made similar to what i saw. i don't think i ever filed a report with you though due to it being so long ago and i have never found the information i wrote that night. some papers where so soaked they did get thrown away, but i have never gone through everything yet. i am glad you are coming down to investigate their story and wish i could be there to talk to you too and hear what goes on. i don't care if the world believes, but i will eat your hat if you can prove what i saw was man made :), since i am 100% sure i wouldn't be eating your hat.\r\n\r\nas for abductions i still have doubts, but wouldn't put it past any civilization to do experiments on lower life forms just as we do. probably why i got my gun during the experience, to protect my animals if need be. another strange event happened at that location another time a few years before that may have been an encounters presence but i didn't move to find out. again it was a night when i didn't go into work, but this time i was sleeping. my yorkies where barking and growling like someone was in the room near the door to which my back was facing from a small bed in my den. then they came over and jumped up on the bed and barked and growled at something close by. i had the feeling that someone was in the mobile home and standing right next to the bed so i kept my eyes closed and didn't move. when i had the feeling they had moved away i did try to move a little and i couldn't. when the dogs ran back to the door i opened my eyes and it looked like daylight outside the window. i closed my eyes again and played like i was rolling over when i heard the dogs jumping on the door and when i opened them again i realized it was pitch dark. the kitchen was right behind me so i went there first for a knife, turned a light on and then went to a bedroom for a gun. i looked out the bay windows which faced the road and didn't see any lights or hear any cars. i went outside and waited about 10 minutes and never heard a car. that time my outside dogs had not been barking. i never heard the door open and close in that time either and it was always kept locked. my yorkies had barked at the door before, but never like that or growling while barking nor did they ever do it again. it wasn't until years later that i ever thought the 2 events there might have been connected somehow. all windows and doors in the house where locked, and when i went outside my outside dogs where there to meet me. since they didn't bark i doubt the event pertained to humans. i haven't read a lot about encounters, but from what i have heard they had not happened with animals around thus i never thought of it that way until later. i can write that off maybe as a dream waking to the dogs barking and growling at the door, but i did wake up and go outside and check all the windows the next day. the ship i saw a few years later was after i had been sleeping all day and gotten up at my normal time to feed the animals before going to work. \r\n\r\ni don't talk a lot about these events, because if i heard them from someone else they would raise doubts with me even if they came from a trusted source. i mean i loved my mother and father and trusted them to all ends, but still it wasn't until i saw something that i could really believe what they saw may have been real. unlike their event though mime was up a lot closer than what they saw since it went directly overhead. people always want proof, but even if i had it i wouldn't give it to them now. still i'm glad to know that others have maybe seen what i saw and get a laugh how the government tries to explain it all away. i remember seeing an asteroid driving home one early morning that you could still see after daylight until it really got bright. i watched the news to see if others had seen it for days. finally after 2 weeks i did hear a report that there was a near earth miss from an asteroid, but the danger was gone. so what ever the government knows they will never reveal it because they don���t want us to panic. i seriously doubt they have made contact and with as destructive as we are i think we are only being monitored to make sure we don���t pull a stunt that may upset the universe. with america���s new strike before struck motto i just hope no one gets stupid enough to try to strike them for proof. we have fought foes mightier than us before and won, but never someone so far advanced above us. \r\n\r\ni hope people will enjoy their experiences if they are lucky enough to have them, picture and report about them to this type of location, but never shoot at them or report them to someone who might.

but it was obviously much too close to be a star, and it couldnt be a plane simply because it was just floating. i watched it the whole way to the pier and when i got there i went up the stairs to these built in binoculars that can be used for 50 cents, i payed and immediately had a look at the strange ball of light. what i saw is rather difficult to explain, the binoculars not being overly powerful, but what i can describe goes like this: the craft was not any set shape, like a saucer or a sphere, it was orbish though in shape though boxy at the edges, almost squarish but with protuding objects that i couldt make out exactly. the craft was orange colored with several different colored lights on it. the objects that i mentioned before, protruded from the craft at many different angles it appeared, like beams or very large, thick antennaes. after viewing the object from the binoculars for a ittle bit, i proceeded to continue walking home, watching it the entire time. it was during this time that i noticed the objects very subtle and slow movement through the night sky, ever-so-smooth and not noticeable if you hadnt seen its original position in the sky. i saw a similar, if not the same object some weeks later, in the same part of town, which i took pictures of, though they only show the ball of light in the dark sky, however, i did also take pictures of the moon and included some sorrounding growth in the picture to have a comparison. i dont have the pictures on hand at this exact moment so i cant include them. please voice your opinion.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in size due to the distance and the movements of this was very paticular at first when i spoted it it was not moving in any direction then sudenly shoot stright up and came down on an angle and went the oposate direction similar to the number  4  then vanished it did not go out out of sight as watching a plain go out of sight it instantly vanished as for my feelings on this and what i thought this was the moment i saw it well it obvious i knew exactly what it was without a doubt it was alien i was exited and as soon as it disapered i was looking around me for other ppl who may have been looking in that direction hopeing that they seen it but did not so i was quiet about it for years until i got the internet and started reserching on it and i found out that a small town called denny

airport. these were the exact same lights as seen on december 23rd 2007, in the exact same place, over my house. lights never disperse, solid object that cannot be seen at night, but has lights on it. object flying very low at about 9 to 15 stories of an apartment building. this time i viewed the flying thing from about 2 football fields east. object moving north slowly at approx 40 miles an hour, wich is already too slow for an airplane to stay in flight, and then stops, then hovers backwards and forwards then stops (going north, stops , goes south, then north, then stops). object then hovers in place, or possibly heads west-north-west(wich means norht-west, but more west then north) wich would be directly away from us wich may be what happened. at the time we concluded that it was not a helicopter, shape of lights aswell as the absense of a helicopters noise wich would be heard from our distance, and that it was an airplane that turns over my house. but today day i've concluded, that no airplane could be going at 40 miles an hour that low, stop, and hover back and forth within 6 seconds. even if it was an airplane that was turning around in a circle, or doing a zigzag, no airplane could turn that sharp, going that slow, at that altitude, without staling. and it wouldnt be doing it at 9 stories or 100-300 feet. for an airplane to do what i saw is either extremely dangerous or impossible, most likely impossible. i did not have my glasses to see the lights in detail but the 4 others with me all saw it, and were all confused by it. one of them made a theory, wich i think is whats going on, that it is an advanced secret ufo, whatever it is, probably not extra terrestrial, flying around with airplane lights, to give the impression of an airplane. the most confusing part is that it has gone by that exact same path twice in the past 2 months. and i will be updating you on any further sightings of it.","distance":"101-500

since of my normality in hopes you will believe what i���m about to say. we as a people of this planet, are not suppose to know of celestial colonies which have been associated with this earth���s mantled core, long before it���s surface was inhabitable. i have spoken what i know to be true, and now i'm watched. web sites i set up to get this information out,  are being blocked. e-mail and

out as many as i can, in hopes some will get through.  \r\n\r\n\r\nwe have never been alone\r\nglobal warning/global warming\r\nearth's core is changing back\r\nthe design and creation of earth's core was and is more than just a random creation of nature. from the beginning earth's core was purposed for a specific celestial function, and has now begin a timely predestined shift of it's mantle plates in the gradual return back to it's original function. such regressing changes are those which has off-sit increasing earthquakes, rising surface temperature, and increasing temperature changes in ocean and sea floors which will continue unto boiling degrees and the evaporation of all such waters. know that most all historical documents pointing to the end of days, were records established for an evolving mind of people that would one day seek to understand the science as to the why and how such devastating events were to take place. the core of this planet was property of an ancient colony and their governing power source, (god head) long before it's heated mantle core fell from a hidden pocket of space to then temporarily appear as a fallen star; throughout this galaxy many such mantled cores did fall which was recorded as the era when a tenth of stars fell from heaven; long before this mantle core's ignited flames did die out, and long before changes of this rock���s surface cooled unto tolerable degrees, the core of this planet rested in a higher region of space outside this seventh universal plane of endless darkness; even long before surface life spawned and began to evolve from the blending of dust-like dehydrated plasma and the passing of a released electrically charged solar-like wind referred to as the breath of god. this mixture of complex cosmic ions had been generated from upper space during the time all planets were much closer together in this region of our solar system. most all souls now inhabiting this planet, did also hold existence outside this seventh universal plane in higher regions of space; what many have failed to understand or remember, is that during all early evolving of this global surface we now call earth, there were also the re-homesteading of many celestial tribal colonies and many advanced celestial colonies which were falling from there once held higher celestial positions on the upper side of this known universal planet. most such tribal colonies and their associated advanced colonies knew nothing of the other tribal colonies and their associated advanced colonies before this famed falling of man took place, even though many displaced colonies falling in this region of the galaxy, were of the same parenting source of power (god head) which hold many associated branched colonies and their celestial alignments in place. yet power sources associated with colonies which were falling from their once held higher position, had been cut off in order to keep from contaminating their parenting source of power, because they themselves had become contaminated by the action of one. such fallen celestial tribal colonies are different from colonies of the neanderthal man. these were spawned by the blending of the previously mentioned complex cosmic particles during the core���s early surface evolution, many eons after the famed fall of man. individual groups of the neanderthal man were nurtured in separate tribal areas, they were overseen by individually established advanced celestial colonies. till this day, developments of upper celestial colonies and all works of their advanced technology, were kept secret from surface matters of this planet. over time, individual pyramid power sources associated with those advanced colonies which had re-established their homesteading above earth within pockets of hidden space which, began to loose energy, such energy controlled the very invisible walls of their heavenly celestial worlds. even those invisible walls encircling associated tribal colonies began to dissipate. during this era, pyramids of their exotic materials falling in frequency acceleration, lowered themselves from upper positions, to settle in view atop the surface of this planet. it was during the purging of each such pyramid���s ���plasma core��� eye, that cause a back-up of associated minerals to fill every open area of the pyramid���s inner structural design. after such a purging, the actual structure of the pyramid, continuing in it���s frequency de-acceleration, did vanish from view to set in what is referred to as the first level of the eighth universal dimensional plain, some refer to this zone as the first level of hell or purgatory. as each exotic structure of each pyramid vanished from the surface of this planet, each left behind a molded cast of their inner structures, one such casting is now referred to as the sphinx. this marked the era when gods became kings, and the era when their were giants (structural hosts of ufos) in the land. now that the very foundation of celestial colonies and their lands had fallen from higher celestial place, their flying crafts became permanent resident for a selected few from each colony of advance technology. the remainder of the colony���s ���plasma filament of intelligence��� referred to as a soul, were put in the collective of ���accelerated stasis��� inside a colony���s specifically designed mirrored global dielectric sphere (ranging from seven feet in diameter to twenty feet in diameter, depending on the size of the craft). some crafts were as large as known cities. each such mirrored dielectric sphere had been referred to as the ���bosom��� of the craft. tribal colonies had similar yet larger mirrored dielectric spheres which were fifty feet in diameter. these were those associated with the eye of a colony���s pyramid power source. in this manner a specific count of the colony could live out tribal lives in their settled regions. then at the point of disembodiedment, a soul would be drawn back into, their specific dielectric sphere to find for periods of rejuvenation during accelerated stasis. this would allow a soul already in stasis to be reincarnated as a tribal member. in time, all flying crafts large and small, began to deplenish of power. some hid themselves in mountains, some in the ocean. larger crafts were dissembled and laid in different places. all were to wait for the replenishing of a specific quantity of a pure plasma compound, unmixed with the electron element referred to as the (sin product). such a plasma compound contaminated with the electron, would not be able to accelerated to a specific marc necessary to quantum leap outside this the seventh universal plain. but then came this other distant and foreign colony of advance technology, which deceived the colonies of advanced technology associated with this planet. this wicked colony portrayed to have come from outside this seventh universal plain, offering advances of their technology for the benefit of all celestial colonies associated with this planet as well as for the good benefit of surface humanity. when they actually had a very devious plan in play. offering great advantages, this wicked colony secretly engineered a power facility using an unorthodox technology for the purpose of using a much heavier accelerated hydrogen gas. one part of their power facilities was adapted to facilities already on the moon unknowingly to many humankind, the other was attached to facilities already positioned below ocean waters as to abstract hydrogen ions from the earth���s core. with all things in place a powerful traction beam was activated from this colony���s associated giant ���cathode satellite��� which had been set in outer space by these wicked celestial perpetrators, of whom most all, celestial colonies associated with earth had believed to be a representative from outside this the seventh universal plane, and associated with their original parenting source of power, one who was to return them back to their original higher positions of which they had long since fallen from. but on that day, the beam was activated, the beam was used to widen a rip in a matrix of time, in order to pull out this colony���s associated ancient pyramid power source from the back side of the universal foundation from which it had been banished long long before. but the celestial people believed that this pyramid host was their new power source in which they were to draw from, and to further fool the celestial people, a switch of it���s powerful dielectric sphere functioning as this pyramid���s eye, had already took place. such a secretive switch of such a powerful head part, caused the celestial people to believe this pyramid host was the same pyramid host which had previously been deactivated and was now rejuvenated and resurrected. for this deceitful reason as the pyramid host prepared to elevated itself, most all celestial people attuned their crafts and facilities to the reception of this particular pyramid by way of the cathode satellite, and once the pyramid initiated it���s velocity spin unto marc of quantum leap, to sit at the top of this seventh universal plane far out in space, it became king and god to the celestial people. now up until a short time ago, this cathode satellite which set far out in space appearing as a twinkling star, had continued to draw it���s power from earth���s core by means of their adapted facility positioned on earth���s moon. having altered the original power facilities on the moon and the one at earth���s core, they reversed all polarities of the energy beam which linked the moon with earth���s core (through the bermuda triangle) . this in itself not only changed the frequency of earth���s ozone layer, it also severed the original alignment of celestial colonies which had already been established. these were now lost in space and time. now earth had become linked with the aligned colonies held under bondage by these of the wicked colony, and so was then the government of the united states. there was war in heaven but the wicked colony prevailed, until now; earth core is changing, it���s mantled plates have self started in a new arrangement, which is cutting off the unorthodox usage of it���s accelerated hydrogen ions. for this reason all associated with the celestial alignment of this wicked colony will fall from it���s position.  this in itself is both good and bad for the people associated with the earth���s core.  because of this, earth as we know it, will soon be no more, but both the celestial people of earth, and the surface dwellers of earth,  will soon be free. \r\nevelyn garrett\r\n15806 winding moss-b\r\nhouston texas

crawled into my bed and sometime during the night there was a knocking on the window, which was directly behind the headboard of my bed. both my son and i got upon our knees and i opened the shade.  there was a being looking in at us. i could see only the head which came level with the bottom of the window.  it was the typical large head and large eyes.  but i've wondered all these years our reaction, we both imediately lay down and went to sleep.  the next day in our back yard was a round brown area in the lawn. my lawn was very small and i couldn't imagine how anything could fit, the yard was 50' x 30'. i don't even know if it was connected to the sighting.  the brown dried grass stayed for a very long time until we installed a pool on the spot.  what happened to us?  i've always wondered if that were the end of the experiance or more as over the years i've seen numerous sightings.  the last being while i lived in challis idaho.  around 2004 my 23 year old grandson, with his male friend, late at night were sitting out on the back patio.  my home at that time was in a canyon next to the salmon river.  a huge round object passed overhead, covering almost the entire sky.  he said it took around 20 minutes for it to move across the canyon and out of sight behind the mountain as it was moving so slowly.  his girl friend also saw it as she was driving home from work.  the next night i awoke and notice in the sky this object hovering over the mountain across the river.  there was also a smaller object just below the larger one.  i watched them for several minutes and fell asleep.  i awoke numerous times during the night and they was still in the same place.  when morning arrived they were gone. there are other instances of family members and myself having sightings.  my brother in law, who at the time was a mendocino county deputy sheriff, while out on patrol late one night saw a large cigar shaped object hovering over lake mendocino, a large pipe or beam came out of the bottom of the craft down into the lake.  he assumed it was taking water from the lake. he then chased it on hwy 20 and then into pottervalley where he lost it.

january 10, 2008 11:16 am cst\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfour area residents witness mysterious object, lights in selden sky\r\n\r\nby angelia joiner staff writer \r\n\r\nsteve allen, mike odom and lance jones were out admiring a beautiful texas sunset tuesday evening when they saw something none of them can explain.\r\n\r\nallen called it an unidentified flying object. and, because he's been a private pilot for more than 30 years, he has a little more experience judging air speeds and distances than most.\r\n\r\n���we all flipped out,��� allen said. ���i didn't sleep a wink last night.���\r\n\r\nallen was at the home of mike odom in selden about 6:15 p.M. when they suddenly noticed flashing lights about ���3,500 feet above ground level,��� he said.\r\n\r\n���the ship wasn't really visible and was totally silent, but the lights spanned about a mile long and a half mile wide,��� allen said. ���the lights went from corner to corner. it was directly above highway 67 traveling towards stephenville at a high rate of speed - about 3,000 miles per hour is what i would estimate.���\r\n\r\nallen said the lights were not those of a normal aircraft. he said they were more like strobe lights, and while they were all watching, the lights reconfigured themselves from a single horizontal line into two sets of vertical lights.\r\n\r\n���the two sets were approximately one-quarter of a mile apart,��� allen said. ���then they turned into dirty burning flames. the flames were not blue. they were white in color. about two seconds later it disappeared completely.���\r\n\r\nallen said they were all scratching their heads and talking about what it could have been, when approximately 10 minutes later, the object flew overhead again.\r\n\r\n���this time it came from the west traveling east towards glen rose,��� allen said. ���and it was about two or three miles south of 67, and two military jets, possibly f16s, were in pursuit.���\r\n\r\n���i was asking, ���are you guys seeing that?��� allen said.\r\n\r\nmike odom said he didn't have trouble sleeping but it was a ���wild experience.���\r\n\r\n���it's unexplainable,��� odom said. ���it was something not natural; it was moving way too fast.���\r\n\r\nodom said he saw one other unexplainable object in the sky in 1978 when he was in arizona.\r\n\r\n���back then something flew over with lights all around,��� odom said. ���i think this thing bothered all of us, but it probably bothered steve more because he's a pilot and he flies a lot.���\r\n\r\n���it was neat,��� lance jones said. ���it was something. i've never seen anything like it before but it didn't scare me. i just figured it was military.���\r\n\r\nodom's wife, claudette, said she was previously employed as a flight attendant.\r\n\r\n���lights were going up and down the side,��� she said. ���there was no sound, just the lights. it was moving so fast. it wasn't a plane. i know how planes move. honestly, i think it was a ufo. it was so fast you couldn't have put your finger on it and move it fast enough to follow it.���\r\n\r\nallen said he has never seen a ufo until now, but he did suspect there was something to ufo stories all along.\r\n\r\n���i was very surprised to finally get my eyes on one,��� allen said. ���if anybody else saw this and got pictures i hope they will contact me.���\r\n\r\nallen said he has already reported the sighting to washington, and is in the process of writing a report on the event.\r\n\r\nallen is the owner of l & s enterprises and texas freight in glen rose. he can be contacted at 254-898-1117.\r\n\r\nthe group plans to return to odom's house and keep an eye on the sky in the near future, hoping to see it again.\r\n\r\nangelia joiner is a staff writer for the
