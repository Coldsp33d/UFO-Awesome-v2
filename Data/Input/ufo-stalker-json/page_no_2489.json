investigator. i reported the following on 12/13/07 and have yet to hear anything on was i believe was the most incredible sighting i've ever heard. to think it happened to me boggles my mind. here we go again. i was leaving for an appointment when the sound of an aircraft caught my attention. i looked up at the aircraft and as i saw the aircraft it was headed west but had already started to make a turn north behind the aircraft were four objects which i could only describe as balloons, they were gray in color and sphere shaped. in looking back at this event i recall around the the gray area was what appeared to be a very thin black circle and then a circle of incadescent light. the sun was behind me and i'm guessing the sun was reflecting off the objects. as the aircraft continued to make its turn they stopped which really made me believe they were balloons when from above my head way up high i saw 5 more objects same grey color with the black circle around it with a sunset color surrounding it. i assumed it was reflecting the sunset from 3 hours out further west. all of a sudden the first four objects broke off into two pair and shot off at high speed catching up to the aircraft which had made its full turn north and was at least two miles ahead of these objects. they were 100-200 feetoff the wingtips in less than two seconds.Then the remaining five objects appeared to form a semi circle in the air and created a straight line next to each other and with incredible speed flew side by side to the rear of the aircraft forming a v formation.Perhap a few hundred feet behind the aircraft. i believe this aircraft had taken off from nellis airforce base perhaps at 1:58 i saw the event at 2:04.I am a veteran and have seen many aircraft these objects had no noise,no vapor trails.No emissions. no wings .Just grey circular sphere type objects .Thanks for letting me report this again.After digesting what i saw this report is in mucher greater detail

except it appeared to cross the entire panoramic sky 90 degees from direct west to direct north. and, at an upward distance appearing about the same distance as the stars, though it likely wasn't i'd guess. this took only about 40 seconds for this \"lighted object\" to cross all the way from west to north a full 90 degrees. as the night was clear as a bell, and the nearest town is a half hour drive away, let's just say there were no optical distortions in the way of viewing what we all viewed. as i appeared to notice the object first, i called everyone's attention to this bizarre sight/light and said, \"what the fuck is that\"???\r\n\r\nthe distance was obviously far too high for any satellite, plane, etc. we guessed, and the speed was simply astonishing. the meteoric speed is what caught our/my attention to the object in the first place. \r\n\r\nhowever, meteors do not come to a decidedly zig-zaggy tailed dead stop, then change direction 90 degrees to \"straight up\", then proceed to rise higher yet into the sky at astonishing (non-earthly acceleration and inertial moment of torque displayed) speed, and straight up out of complete visual sight. \r\n\r\ni have never seen anything remotely like this in my lifetime, and may never again. but you could not now tell me there are not unexplainable objects traversing our skies! as i am my own best witness, and generally believe nothing of what i hear, maybe half of what i read, and generally all of what i see with my decidedly mechanical engineering eyes, you could not convince me that any earth designed object has control of its field effects similar to the object we saw.\r\n\r\nobviously, we had wished it would have been close enough to make out any details of the object. (which we could not) basically just a bright far light from where we were. think though; at the distance this was at, and the ability to go 90 degrees in the short time elapsed, means this object at it's height of travel, had to travel likely several thousand miles to achieve the angled trajectory of 90 degree radial travel in the time/distance covered at the height observed. it would take quite a craft to achieve this. i would guess anyone with this level of technology, has the ability to control their phase relationship to eath's gravitational force and \"simply\" manipulate the phase angle and field effects to their own advantage for omnidirectional propulsion purposes. this would also explain the craft \"silence\" many seem to indicate in their respective sightings.\r\n\r\ni've never been much into scoping out any ufo possibilities, but also have no reason not to assume they are not only real, but far advanced compared to to our meager low tech existance. it would stand to reason.\r\nunless some are so indignant they believe themselves to own the universe?\r\nhardly i'd guess.\r\n\r\nour experience was the most unusual physics event i've ever witnessed personally.\r\ni don't convince easily either. had i not witnessed this myself, i simply would hold out room for another explanation. certainly not what i/we witnessed!!\r\n\r\ndan","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8801,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.4383146,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01072008-0004","longitude":-93.5813201,"occurred":1151132400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1151132400000,"summary":"Star

currently employed as a campus safety officer for a prominent university and was walking a beat on the far north end of the campus. near a scenic overlook you can look across the city and view the sky from the west(mountain range) and as far east as brighton, co. i'm currently a student pilot and aviation buff most of my life and pride myself in identifying aircraft. this airship was like nothing i had ever seen or could have ever imagined. it moved across the sky from west to northeast in a consistant, silent and extremely smooth flight path. i estimate its altitude at just below 7000 feet, and i know this because i checked the current ceiling after the event with a online aviation weather site immediately after the sighting, and it showed a ceiling of 7031 ft. the object appeared to be be skimming just underneath the ceiling. again this object was totally silent and displayed no evidence of lights or propulsion thrust what so ever. i estimated its size to be larger then a c-5a galaxy at 7000 ft. which is a extremely large military aircraft. the skin of the aircraft was a high sheen chrome which reflected the ground lights of the city as it passed over lighted landmarks. i first noticed the object somewhere near rocky flats goverment facility just south of jeffco airport. it seemed to appear out of the haze very slowly i estimate around 70 knots and as it dropped below the reported ceiling it appeared to have a very distinct dark black wing shaped outline against the haze now just above it. as it cleared the coud cover it assumed the crystal clear reflection of the early morning lighted city terrain, and only the wing portion of the object displayed this reflective ability and the rest of the object appeared to be a flat black ,non-reflective similar to our current day stealth aircraft. the design and shape of this object was very aerodynamic with no defined edges and very sleek.It remained at this altitude and never changed course through the entire 10-15 minute observation and disappeared in the haze again i estimate somewhere over brighton colorado. \r\n    a about a week later i had told my brother about the sighting and he advised me he had seen a object around the same time of morning only a week later traveling in the same direction ,silent and his description was very similar. the most consistant was the reflective ability of the wing portion of the object. i thought at first it was a stealth bomber but quickly found that not to be possible it was not like any aircraft i had ever seen before and flew and moved with silent motion. i found myself very curious after the sighting and found myself trying to justify what it was.I would be able to provide a drawing upon request  ","distance":"Over One

the vet.  i remember feeling a little shaken about what i had just dreamed because i've never experienced it before.  i dreamt that i was standing on the bottom of the ocean with 2 men who looked like normal human men.  i could'nt figure out why i could still breath air normally as if i were on land.  the men also breathed normally.  i did'nt feel the water or any pressure surrounding my body and was somewhat afraid because i know that we all need scuba gear to go into the ocean.  the man made me feel safe.  he told me with his mind that we were 4700 ft below the ocean on the floor.  it was dark except for the light that came from the immediate area where these men and myself were.  the one man handed me an almost perfect circle that was light green with an indention in the center.  it had a blue ring that hugged the circle or almost circle because it had a straight end to it.  picture the round weights used on a benchpress bar.  the weight is round but sliced off on one end. he said to me \"this is argon.  take this to your scientist.  it will provide energy to light cities for 1000 years.  the use of argon for energy will save the planets resources\".  i took the circle in my hands and began to go up but became afraid and let it go saying to the man, \"if i go up to fast i'll get the bends\".  he said to me \"don't be afraid, you will go to the surface slowly\".  when i surfaced i was i say a city with alot of industrial buildings.  i don't know how to decribe it because i felt displaced.  the surface water was dark.  i saw myself taking this object to a scientist who asked me \"where did you get this\"?  i woke up at that point.  when i got to my sons house i asked him, \"what is argon\"?  he said, \"that's a gas, why\"?  i told him about my dream and that's what he dismissed it as, a dream.  i'm not a scientist but my interest was peaked so i looked in the internet wanting to know what argon is and how it's used.  this is why i'm writing to you because there is no way i could invent this.  i'm 52 years old and this is the first time a dream has made me feel like there's hope for our planet.  thank

approached the civic center. then irealized that a large object was spanning the width of the highway which was at the time four lanes wide. traffic was balled up at the object where the cars were passing under it  itw as about 10 ft above the highway and at first i thought that it was a bridge put up over night some how.  as i got to the object irealized that iyt had a screen on arms in front of it that projected an image of the ascene behind it in effcet hiding it form view until you were riught on top of it.  the bottm of the craft was very irregular and probably the screen was pull up

and in clear daylight .  nothing was in the news.  a family friend who lived in the immediate area as a child said that at times in the night goblins would take her out of the window of her bedroom

light emitted (not blinking) was white, blue and red and it slowly rose from the top of the mountain and continued to climb slowly to a higher elevation. i used binoculars and saw a small light hovering in one area then moving slowly to a higher elevation. i took a video with a sony digital camera but was unable to view the object thru the display screen so i only got it on the very end of this video. the camera was moving not the object. the last frame shows the object on top with a small star below it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
