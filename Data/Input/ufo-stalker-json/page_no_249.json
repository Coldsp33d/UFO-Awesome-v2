States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I hesitate to claim that what i saw was a ufo, and not an airplane.  if it was an airplane, however it was far too quiet and in a place and at an altitude where it should not have been.  however, i did not really give it much thought afterwards, until i recently read the account of bruce cornet, phd, a scientist at the lamont-doherty earth observatory in palisades, new york, who apparently was followed by a mysterious, black aircraft while on his way home from work one evening.  \r\ni was sitting out in my lanai late one evening in december, 2016, around midnight, when i saw a very bright, white light rise slowly into the sky from somewhere behind my neighborâ€™s house, across the lake.  i watched it, wondering what it could possibly be.  it was absolutely silent, and i could see nothing about the object except for that single, bright, white light.  it did not appear to be moving, other than slowly rising into the sky.  but, i noticed that the higher it got, the dimmer the light became.  since my binoculars were nearby in the kitchen, i quickly ran inside to get them and then ran out front to watch the mysterious object, which by now was high enough in the sky that i could no longer see it from the lanai.  by the time i got outside the light was rising above the roof of my house.  with the added magnification of the binoculars, i could now make out the red and green navigation lights on the wingtips and a flashing, white strobe light.  an aircraft!  it was coming directly towards me, flying from north to south, which explained why it at first appeared to be moving vertically.  without the binoculars, the two bright landing lights not only obscured the navigation lights and the anti-collision strobe, but were placed close enough to each other to appear from a distance as a single light.  i still could not hear it.  it was only as it passed directly overhead that i could begin to hear a very faint, high-pitched whine, not the sound of jet engines throttled back, as i normally hear when an aircraft passes overhead in the landing pattern.  the sound of a large jet on final approach is something that i have experienced many times, since the tee for the tenth hole at airport golf course in columbus, ohio, where i used to play, is located directly under the landing approach to runway 28 left and just across the road from the runway threshold.  perhaps there was no sound because of a temperature inversion that blocked transmission of the sound to the ground.  it was warm and the weather was clear, with little or no breeze.   in any case, however, aircraft in the approach pattern to southwest florida international airport (rsw) do not fly directly over my house, as this one did.  not ever.  this plane was far too large to have been attempting a landing at page field (fmy), the local general aviation airport, but the landing pattern for that airport would take it far to the north, not over my house.  nor, are aircraft in the landing pattern for either airport ever so low this far from the runway, about 10 miles as the crow flies from my house to rsw and 7 miles to fmy.  and, the direction of travel of this aircraft would not have aligned it with a runway at either rsw or fmy.  i can see aircraft in the landing pattern to rsw in the distance, approaching from out over the gulf of mexico, far to the west.  why this particular airplane was approaching directly from the north and flying so low, i have no idea.  i estimated its altitude as it passed overhead as only about 500 feet, far below faa restrictions.  the only runway at southwest florida international airport is oriented southwest to northeast (24/6).   without the use of my binoculars, i could easily have mistaken this aircraft for a ufo, at least until it was directly overhead.  it was low enough that i soon lost sight of it behind the trees in my front yard.  another interesting aspect was that the bottom of the fuselage was coppery-colored, not aluminum, but neither did it look like paint.\r\nbut, was what i saw really an aircraft?  i am a pilot and a retired air force reserve officer.  my father was a career air force officer, and so i grew up on military bases and have been around aircraft of many types virtually all of my life.  it certainly looked like a jet airliner to me, albeit an extremely quiet one and in a location and altitude where i have never before seen any aircraft other than the sheriffâ€™s helicopter.\r\ndr. cornet reported that on the evening of 24 sep 1992, as he was driving home from work on i-87, he saw what appeared to him to be a boeing 707 jetliner flying to the right of his direction of travel, between the highway and bear mountain.  he realized that the aircraft was lower than the top of the 300 foot mountain, and thought that it may be in trouble.  it flashed its landing lights on and off, several times.  by now, it was less than one mile distant.  the time was about 1820 (6:20 pm) and the sun had not yet set, but was very low in the sky.  dr. cornet noticed that the aircraft was painted completely black, and that it had no markings of any kind whatsoever on it.  what made this aircraft really strange, however, is that dr. cornet could not see any engines mounted under the wings.  after reading dr. cornetâ€™s full account, it appears to me that what he saw that night might not have been an aircraft at all, but a ufo disguised to look like an aircraft.  i do not remember whether or not what i saw last december had engines mounted beneath the wings, or not.  if not, then it could have been a smaller, regional jet, such as a such as a dc-9 or an md-80 with the engines mounted on the fuselage, near the tail.  dr. cornetâ€™s full account can easily be found on the internet, since he has his own website. \r\nif there are any other accounts of a ufo masquerading as an airplane, i would be interested in learning of them.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

was left speechless by what i saw. the satellite has captured a real alien abduction taking place. the shocking thing about this was that it's me being abducted by a grey alien and the satellite image clearly shows me trying to fight off the grey alien by punching it in the face. looking at the image it appears that the alien has blocked my punch and has grabbed my fist and must of been able to subdue me. the strangest thing about this captured incident is that i do not remember this taking place at all. i do however remember sporadic episodes of missing time through out the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years. i do remember wearing a black baseball cap and shirt. this is definitely me on the satellite image. i also spotted three ufos that were heading in my direction. the three ufos were identical and appear to be flying in formation at different altitudes. the ufo that appears to be at the highest altitude has a green light emanating from it and appears to be leaving a faint contrail with a red glow behind it. the other two ufos are glowing white. the most interesting thing about these ufos is that they look very similar to the ufo filmed and photographed over nellis air force base at the nevada test site. how incredible is that. i think that the ufos were coming to pick me up with the grey alien. i was abducted and this satellite image is proof.

anything out of the ordinary and i had just walked around the woods when i saw some one standing there in the park. it was as i got closer that i realised that it was no man. i had the shock of my life it was a grey alien. the grey alien was just standing there blocking the way i was heading. i fumbled around with my pocket camera and quickly took a photograph before the aa batteries fell out of the the camera's batteries compartment. there was no time to pick up the batteries to take another photograph as the grey alien was now looking right at me. it had the classic looking black eye which freaked me right out. the grey alien then started floating in my direction. i jump back in fight and quickly turn around and started running like hell back through the woods. after running for miles upon miles and almost having a heart attack in the process i turn around to see if the grey alien was following me, luckily there was no sign of it, so visibly shaken and coughing up blood i made me way back home along the main road. when i made it back home i check the sd card to see what i had captured and i had managed to take one photograph of the grey alien despite the batteries falling out of my pocket camera. the grey alien big eyes can be seen in the photograph. spooky. the photograph was taken on the 10th &#8206;october &#8206;2016, &#8207;&#8206;at newton abbot devon

still chatting to my friend.\r\n\r\nwhile i was talking i was just kind of walking about near the leisure center, where my bus stops, when i looked randomly over in the direction of the river which is when i saw the three lights in a triangle pattern rotating on its axis and wobbling slightly.\r\n\r\ni knew instantly that this is not normal and as i have been interested in the subject of ufos since i was about 10 i told my mate i'd ring him back and started filming the lights with my phone. due to the street lights my camera was having a hard time focusing on the formation, so i moved closer to the river to get a better view, (in some haste since i still had to drive a bus which was going to be there at any moment) i filmed a 2min40sec odd vid, then whatsapp-ed my friend to tell him and see if he could see it over vid-call. (which he couldnt as it wouldnt let me zoom in)\r\ni then took about 7 photos in quick order and then another 41second vid to send my mate over whatsapp.\r\nit's at this point i really had to go back to the bus stop to get my bus and as i walked over 4 ppl got out of a car in the car park and i pointed out the lights to them also (to which they showed a bit of interest but not much)\r\n\r\nit was then my bus got there at 10.02pm and i showed the lights to my co-worker who tried to think of any reason they might be something other than a ufo, (drone, laser pointers etc) he went to cashin and finish and i had to drive as i was now 7 mins late lol\r\n\r\ni drove to the turn around point and back in est 8 mins and the lights were gone by the time i got back down to town, (and could not see them on the way down as i had a good view over the area due to the road i was driving)\r\n\r\nduring the event i felt elation and joy, (the only way i can describe it was the feeling mdna/ectasy gives you. it's been years since i had any but i'll never forget the feeling of pure joy. it felt exactly like that, massive endorfin rush) i was bouncing around like an excited child :p\r\n\r\nin total i talked to about 10 people who saw what i did, with one old gentelman who got on my bus who thought he'd just drunk to much.\r\n\r\nthe morning after i looked more carefully at the photos i had taken, and in one there are shapes inside the lights with two out of the three most visible and identical to the other. (image 5, had to zoom in to the image and then take a photo of it because the only imaging software i have can only brighten which clouds the image)","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:18:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":83241,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.6208807,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-04202017-0013","longitude":-3.4181527,"occurred":1492465260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1492714172000,"summary":"I was waiting for the bus while taking to a friend when i noticed 3 lights in a triangle pattern over the mouth of the river exe. took some video and pictures with my phone before the bus came and i left.","tags":["photo","video","triangle","ufo","lights"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":1492729699291,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/83241_submitter_file1__triangleufooverexmouth.mp4","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/83241_submitter_file2__Triangleufooverexmouth2.mp4"],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"ex8 1en","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Exmouth, England","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:19090"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Willowick","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in northeast ohio, i was walking around my backyard. \r\nit was bright, which called my attention to it. \r\ni just thought they were lights in the sky, it didn't look like a plane or a star or anything else i had seen in the sky before. \r\nthere was one large, red-orange light, with five smaller lights of similar shape, and color surrounding it. the object appeared to have no apparent movement. \r\nthe ufo did not affect how i felt, it did not affect the surroundings and i feel pretty much indifferent about it to this day. \r\ni went inside my house which is how i lost sight of the object. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":83240,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.640093400000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04202017-0012","longitude":-81.46093739999999,"occurred":1244235600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1492713678000,"summary":"I saw a light in the sky with five small lights around it","tags":["ufo","lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1492728499418,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":null,"maxtempi":null,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":null,"meantempi":null,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":null,"mintempi":null,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":null,"maxtempi":null,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":null,"meantempi":null,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":null,"mintempi":null,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"44095","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2875,"locationName":"Willowick, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:19091"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Omaha","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 3 a.M. on 10-11-16 i was asleep and my dog woke me for a walk.  i got dressed and went out, something told me to get my photo gear (strong feeling) so i went back in and got it.  walked over bridge and laid camera on ground facing up to randomly shoot stars.  heard plane-like sound over left shoulder-it was coming from the s.E. directly towards me.For a couple seconds thought it was a very low flying plane until it got closer - not a plane!

(i was 13 years old and he was 10) i don't remember looking back at the object. we headed to town and and our first stop was always to stop at the town store to get snacks and drinks. i also always check the clock to see what time it was. when i looked at the clock out was 2 hours later than it normally was when we would arrive. again i felt afraid because it didn't seem like we spent that much time looking at this object. i told my brother we couldn't stay long because it was almost time to head back. when we started heading back once we got closer to the farm i again had an overwhelming fear come over me. when we reached the farm the horse was laying on the ground next to the far end of the corral. when i observed it earlier during the sighting it was in the middle of the corral. i knew that the horse was in trouble. 2 days later i was going to school and asked my freind who lives on the farm if the horse was okay. he didn't know about it so asked his father later after school. next day he yells at me and wants to know how i knew about the horse so i told him what we saw. he then told his father what we said and his father told him he was not allowed to talk to its anymore.
