dates, but again it was almost a decade ago.\r\n\r\nmy friends and i were camping at the lost park campground around june or july of 1999.  as we were sitting around the campfire at approximately 1am we saw a bright reddish light in the distance that seemed to be about a 1/2 mile away from us.  the object wasn't in the sky, but closer to the ground.  wondering what the light was, two of us took a quick hike to a nearby ridge to get a better look. \r\n\r\nat first i thought that it was another campfire as the object looked like a flame, but when we got a better look it was clear that the object was floating just above the trees; and it was lighting up the ground below it. it seemed to change shape and dance, sort of like how a flame moves and changes; and its colors were a bright reddish-orange-purple.\r\n\r\nthe object moved very slow and hovered around the same spot.  it's movement seemed deliberate, yet not really precise either (hence the 'dancing' motions). i could not distinguish any solid mass or any real shapes, as it literally looked like a flame yet it wasn't made of fire.  it seemed to be a flame of light.  there was absolutely no sounds from the object. \r\n\r\nthe phenomenon lasted for what seemed like around 10 minutes; and then the object literally shot into the sky at speeds that i didn't think were possible.  the next part is was really scares me even to this day.\r\n\r\nwe went back to the campfire and started to talk about what we just saw.  i was noticeably tired at this point and when i looked at my watch it was 4am in the morning.  some how, three hours had gone by without anyone noticing - and i don't remember going anywhere except for watching the object for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nwhat was a 10 minute experience was actually 3 hours in real time.  i just can't explain it. \r\n\r\nthere is no doubt that we were all a bit 'impaired' during the sighting/experience (who camps sober?) - but there is also no doubt that we all experienced the same thing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

Barbara","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On january 1st 2008 at approximately 11 am. in santa barbara california i noticed a bright object in the sky at about 75 degrees above ground level if one were to consider 90 degrees directly overhead. weather conditions were bright and clear with blue skies and some very patchy, high, thin, hazy and mostly transparent clouds. the clouds were not as high as cirrus clouds but they appeared quite high and were much higher than what one would call coastal haze.\r\n the brightness of the object caught my attention through the window as it was quite intense somewhat like a bright star at night or the landing lights on a plane at dusk. this was however quite out of the ordinary as it was a very bright sunny day. the object also appeared to be still in the sky. after staring at it for a while and asking my friend to take a look and tell me what he thought it might be  i went outside for a better view.\r\n i was visiting my friend and asked it he had any binoculars but he didn���t so i was left to scrutinize the object with my naked eyes. i am a visual artist and an avid birder so my observation skills are fairly strong.\r\n it was to the north of my position and the sun would have been to the south east. the object was moving in a straight line from east to west very slowly. i could observe that it was traveling just beneath the high clouds as it would occasionally dip slightly into them. when i was viewing it through the some what dirty window i noticed that it would disappear and then reappear with the same intensity. i thought that perhaps it was becoming obscured by the clouds. however when seen from outside the house i could see that when it was not shining with a bluish light it would turn completely black as in pure black and not at all grayish as it might have been if there were some atmospheric interference. in it���s black phase i got the impression that it was shaped somewhat like a very shallowly curved fingernail clipping with the con caved side down, the convex side up and pointed on the ends. \r\n i am not an aviation expert but i believe i could safely say that no conventional aircraft could fly that slowly except for an ultra light and i don���t think that ultra lights fly at such high altitudes. there was an airliner flying above it and it���s rate of movement across the sky was much faster than object in question even thought the air liner was at a much higher altitude. i considered that if it were an ultra light the top side of the wing might be made of a highly reflective material such as a blue tinted mylar while the bottom was either non reflective or simply not catching the light. in that case it would have had to be changing it���s degree of tilt in relation to my point of observation in order to cause the on and off effect. however it���s trajectory looked straight, slow and steady.\r\n  when lighted it seemed to be emitting light just like a bright star but i wondered if it might not simply be reflecting the sun.\r\n as the object moved far into the west and eventually went out of sight it continued to appear as thought the light were emitted from it. im not sure if anything could change it���s position that much relative to my point of observation and still reflect the sun with the same intensity directly to my eyes. i have never seen anything like it and i���ll be watching for other reports about it.\r\n","distance":"Over One

freeway in santa maria (vandenberg air force base adjacent) every weekend (sat & sun) @ dusk & will \"interact\" with civilians whom \"greet\" it by turning a spotlight on you. but, my instinct is that it is ours!>>\r\n\r\n   i had never seen a ufo before; and not for lack of trying... i am a 32 year old commercial illustrator/storyboard artist that decided to leave hollywood & become a lawyer. so, i enrolled in law school in san luis opisbo & have classes on the weekends. i have an \"unacclimated\" new home there, but, i still come \"home\" to l.A. after class to visit with family & my girlfriend &, studies permitting, an occasional storyboard job.  \r\n   after classes on december 01, 2007 (sunday), i was 30 minutes into my commute back to l.A. when nothing special happened... literally... that is, at first... \r\nat 5:30pm, i was traveling southbound on the 101 (2 lane) freeway/highway in santa maria (southern san luis obispo county) just east of vandenberg air force base when a bright light on the horizon caught my eye. dusk had just begun.\r\nthe terrain is composed of virgin, rolling hills with golden meadows speckled with an occasional oak... nothing out there but land; few, if any, homes; some agriculture... so, when this bright light showed up i jokingly, yet lucidly and with purpose said in my mind \"hello, are you a ufo?\"  instantly, it turned one of its two, bright, spotlights on me & i took pause...  o...K...\r\n   when the light \"hit me,\" i flinched even though it was some 20 miles away! my first thought was that it was a big neptune helicopter (we just had the fires) with its \"spot\" on the distant 101 (me). it appeared to be just off the left of the road, on top of a hill, yet far away. i have an automatic apprehension when spotlights are trained on me since, growing up in la, it usually means a car chase is about to cross your path... so, in order to stay alive in koreatown, one must note these things. the light lingered on me for a couple minutes & then averted & began searching immediatly below it.\r\n   time passed, the light got dimmer since it wasn't trained on me anymore, so i could see more detail: i could see 2 distinct shafts of light (2 huge spotlights) searching around from this point on the horizon.\r\nat this point i thought that it must be an vandenberg afb security exercise: their aircraft or a landing tower/ beacon so i forgot about it....\r\n20 minutes pass, its looming ever closer.  \"whoa, thats no tower, its 2000 ft off the top of the hill,\" i said out loud to myself. it was dusk, but the sky was still bright enough to clearly see a silloutte.\r\n    it was huge. it was flying slowly.  how slow, i don't know: a) i was driving 65 mph, b) it was following the 101, but \"crawling\" north @ what seemed like 15 mph.\r\nmust be a helicopter... nope, way too big, no noise, as far as i can hear (at this point i tried to pull over, alas, there was no shoulder & no offramps for 6 or so miles... argghhh!!! figures...\r\ni slowed down to a crawl... luckily the traffic was nonexistent except for the distant lights of approaching cars from miles away; behind me and in front...\r\nmust be a blimp..A freakishly huge, flat, rounded rectangle blimp... the spotlights were off when i approached along beside it...\r\n   i really thought it was ours: its lights  seemed to be normal aircraft lights arranged in the \"cross\" formation ( a couple lite blue strobes on top): \r\n \"what the hell are you?\" i screamed out loud...\r\ninstantly (before i even finished the sentence), the huge spotlight trained on me & 2 seconds later i lost sight of it since it was directly above me...\r\nit made me so frustrated. i always wanted to see a ufo, i always thought \"if i could just see one, i'll never have doubt...\" b.S.... i saw one & i have more questions than ever...\r\ni sped ahead to the off ramp, got off & got back on racing north:\r\ni had to get a photo.\r\nwaited 2 more hours in santa maria in a field until hypothermia set in.. i got back on the road. \r\nwouldn't u know it; i saw it again but this time it was at a much higher altitude (like it was mocking me!)\r\n   about 3 weeks later, the very next time i was driving at dusk on the weekend (back to l.A.) the same thing happened. my father & i were driving together back to l.A. after seeing my new place. he was driving. in the same exact spot it did the same exact thing!\r\nit's m.O:  it slowly cruises over the 101 freeway right next to vandenberg afb & shines its spot on one, that is, if one decides to \"greet it.\" since my dad is a staunch skeptic, i kept my mouth shut for 20 minutes as we got closer.   this time , when we were about a mile away, i said, \"dad, thats a ufo...\" \r\nbefore pops could muster a \"gaffaw,\"  the a.R.V. turned its massive spotlight on us for 2 seconds & went out again (it truly was blinding) (the big lights had been off for the whole sighting thus far).  \r\ni was able to crane my head out of the passenger window long enough to really get a good long look at it from directly beneath. \r\nit was a black, rounded rectangle with detail (not smooth). to the direct aft of the ship was an illuminated area that was reminiscent of the \"aft\" hanger on a modern air craft carrier when it is open. it was hard to gauge the size of the ship since i don't know the altitude & i had no size reference...\r\nthat being said, it blocked out the cobalt skies of dusk with a massive blackness; the likes of which haven't been seen since mr.T's debut in \"a-team.\" (serioulsy though, i will take a lie detector test)... but that shant be neccessary, since i have a strong inclination that this phenomena occurs every weekend @ dusk over the 101 in santa maria next to vandenberg afb. ( it has been there the last two times i have traveled that stretch at that time...) i hope anybody near there will look for themselves...\r\nperhaps the government is trying to gauge public reaction, who knows?\r\nif piloted by \"man,\" how could it react to my thoughts:\r\ni think it has something to do with the \"trip-seat\" technology from montauk lore (\"jump-room\" technology, etc).  project camelot.Com seems to have some very good whistleblower information for those \"ready\": i.E.: henry deacon, jim spark, gordon novel, etc testimony.  anybody have any ideas how one of \"our\" \"pilots\" could \"read minds?\" \r\nplease see for yourself!!!!!! i can\"t be the only one! there were hundreds of cars that saw this!!!  \r\ni am going to be ready with a charged/cued camera next time!  i somehow \"know\" i will photograph this thing... just a matter of time. until then...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

orange colored light slowly moving toward me, coming in from over the lake and almost paralleling the highway. at first i thought it may be a jet, but then realized that it had no blinking lights, and it was not traveling on the typical jet route. seeing as i was only four blocks from home, i pulled into my driveway and continued staring at the object. as soon as i jumped out of my truck, i heard someone say, \"i am glad that i am not the only one seeing this.\" i don't think i even replied, as i was too intense,  analyzing what i was seeing. the object was flying fairly low, just above a low layer of clouds, which distorted the image from time to time. i could not see the stars. the object was about as big as a pencil eraser held out at arms length. as the object passed overhead, it was difficult to tell if what i was seeing was a ball of fire, or possibly it was crescent shaped. the clouds diffused the light it was emitting. the color was a rich orange, the color of fire, but probably even more of a dark orange-ish red. it took about two minutes for the object to fly overhead, and then another two minutes before it quickly disappeared. there was no sound from a plane, helicopter or jet. i called a relative on my cell and told him to look up as it approached his home, which was about a half mile away. he saw the same thing i saw. but when he finally saw it, from where he was, it appeared to go straight up and out of sight. from where i was it appeared to disappear going away from me and slightly up to the left into the atmosphere. i raced into my house to try to find a digital camera. when i finally returned, the object was quite a distance away, still orange, but now appearing only as large as a planet. i took a photo of the object in the dark night sky. what i captured only appears like a speck of light, and that is only after i enhanced the photo to lighten the image substantially. from where i first saw the object, it was probably two miles away, and that is being generous, from my home. i took about two minutes to fly overhead. it was not directly overhead. it was probably moving at 60 miles per hour or less. the neighbor, who i still have not identified yet, tried shooting fireworks at the object, probably to get its attention. it continued on at this slow rate of speed,until it went another two miles, when it went out of sight. during the sighting, i pretty much just concentrated on staring at the object, looking for any thing that could help describe it. from the onset, i had thought about running in to find a camera, but i did not want to miss visualizing any of the sighting. this was my first. if i am ever fortunate enough to witness another sighting, i will definitely attempt to capture the sighting on camera at the soonest possible moment. after the object disappeared, i called the relative and re-played the sighting with him. he had seen something similar about 10 years ago, and said that the color was exactly the same, the rich orange fire-like color. it was a brief incident.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

so sure, this is why i am so long to announce it.\r\n      on approx. date given i was at a neighbors ( inlaws ) house outside. this was a nice , sunny summer day. there were 4-5 people that witnessed this. two are deceased now. we were just standing outside talking by the vehicles when suddenly the area got almost completely dark. i looked up to see where the sun went and there was the biggest black triangular thing i have ever seen almost directly overhead at this point. it was so low and so large that i could barely see the edges of it. i did not see any markings or lights. it's been so long that i sort of forget any other outstanding characteristics about it, except that it was almost silent. i did hear something, almost like it was the sound of what the air would have sounded like with something this large passing through it. it was not an engine sound, just a whirring sound kink of. my first thought was that this was a stealth military jet that was gliding with engines off, but it occurred to me that maybe it was in trouble and was looking for a place to land. this being a foothills, mountainous area there were not many places something like this could land nearby, except there was a hay field a few miles away. my almost immediate reaction was to jump in the car and drive fast to this field to see it land. a few of us jumped in the car and got there in about 5 minutes. there was nothing there when we got there. i did not see this again or hear anything about it ever.....This object was going so slow i couldn't understand how it could stay in the air. all of my actions took place from the time i saw the craft to about the time it was done passing overhead. \r\n     until now this has just been a good campfire story other than i did also about 6 months ago reported  the same story to the brian vike ufo research web site. i have for just a few years now gained more interest in the ufo phenomena so i have been reading several books and looking online and have found several reports from other people that seem to be nearly identical to what i have seen. i wish i could remember the exact date so this could be traced back to the time to see if it truly was one of ours.... that's my story and i'm sticking to it. i hope no men in black will come to visit me now.","distance":"101-500

from newark, new jersey, to visit my family after my first semester away at college. i had a window seat on the left side of the plane, so i was looking at the east coast of san francisco bay. we were between 1-3 thousand feet high, so individual streetlights were becoming easier to make out. while i was looking out the window, i saw it.\r\n\r\nit appeared to me to be a pulsing white light a few feet under the surface of the water, moving slower than the plane, but still moving. it was perhaps between 10 and 30 feet across (size was constant; i'm just not that good at judging sizes from a plane). it would pulse a white light, with a slow frequency (i.E. it took about 10 seconds to cycle from bright light to pitch black to bright light again, with both dark and light times being the same length). it also gave off some kind of (for lack of a better word) whispy tail into the air that was roughly twice the width of the object in height. this \"tail\" would only appear when the light was on. i watched the object for about 5 minutes, at which time i lost sight of it because we moved beyond it. at the time i lost sight of it, though, it seemed to be doing the same thing it had been doing when i first saw it: moving slowly south along the coast and pulsing under the water.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw it, it was interesting to me. i hadn't seen any airplane or helicopter that looked like that, or any boat or sub that acted in that way, so that was the reason i watched it. i used to live on an island, so i know what boats look like, and my parents house is 5 minutes away from our county airport, so i know the patterns of lights produced by airplanes because they fly over the house all the time. this was one big pulsing white light that was under the surface, and unlike anything i'd ever seen before. it is a uso in the sense that it was submerged and i was unable to identify it.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting, i was at first curious as i was expecting, like all the other times i've seen something strange in the sky or on the ocean, to identify this object within a few seconds as a plane or boat or something else mundane. my curiosity was noticeably piqued as a result of this encounter, so i watched it intently, and after i had watched it long enough to know that it was unlike anything i had ever seen (i spent a minute or two of the sighting trying to identify it and failing), i switched into \"this is something i can't explain\" mode and started observing just as a scientist would observe an experiment; not applying any bias, or judgement; just watching. after i lost sight of it i immediately thought of how awesome it was that i'd finally seen a ufo (well, uso, but i'm not picky), and i couldn't wait to report it to mufon. \r\n\r\nthat's about the gist of my report. i know i'm not a trained observer, but i like to consider myself an amateur armchair ufologist, and this has reaffirmed my notion that there is something going on that isn't being adressed by the world at large. i hope my report helps mufon in convincing people that something is happening.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

 i could not believe anything that big and visual in such a busy place as mcknight road before christmas would not have been seen and reported by someone. mcknight road was full of traffic. but --- it was 1967. there was nothing in the paper the next day either.?? i still cannot believe it was not reported. i am wondering if the car that pulled off the road behind us ever called anyone.? what were they thinking? \r\nover the years i have told the story occasionally. there is no way anyone can ever discredit or 'take away'  what i saw. it was not one of those 'dancing, flashing lights way up in the sky that people have photographed and called a ufo . it was large, close, pulsating,  and we could see details. it's 'exit' defies words.   i have wanted to share this sighting for decades. thanks for giving me this opportunity.  it is still very visable in my mind.
