approximately 8:15 pm.  i was with my mother (passenger seat, not paying attention), brother (back right seat, asleep), and father (back left seat, asleep) and we were on our way home to the atlanta area from miami, fl.  at the point where i saw the object, the interstate was on a downward slope and my car was at the top of a hill so that i could see down pretty far.  the highway dipped down and a mile or so down the road it sloped back upward.  there were lots of trees and billboards, etc., on each side of the highway, but there were no overpasses for about 3-4 miles north from where i was.\r\nit was a cloudy night and i could see no stars.  i wasn't able to see any airplanes that night until about 9 pm.  while driving i was very alert, wide awake, and concentrating on the road ahead of me.  all of a sudden, from behind the tree-line on my left (west), a very bright, large, and extremely fast-moving star-like object appeared to come off the horizon and shoot across the interstate at approximately a 30 degree angle.  it proceeded to move at this very rapid rate until it was past the tree line on my right (east) and was out of sight.  it seemed to disappear behind the clouds, but i can't be sure.  the object looked to be about 2-3 miles down the road from me.  the diameter of the bright area was about twice as big as the diameter of the bright area of a headlight from a very close oncoming truck, except it was much farther.  the object's size and brightness remained constant throughout the entire time (about 1.5-2 seconds).\r\nmy first reaction to seeing this was complete shock.  the object's size and intensity, and the fact that it came without warning, really took me by surprise.  i immediately tried to see where it went and i slowed down to see if i could get a glimpse of it or anything unusual to the east of my location.  my brother and father were asleep in the backseat and my mother was not paying attention to anything, but i started asking, \"wow did you see that?!\"  she had her eyes closed and i was upset because i wanted someone to explain it to me.  once i realize i was alone in seeing it (in my car at least), i went back to driving.  however, i spent the rest of the drive home analyzing the situation in my mind, as the images of the event were burned into my brain.  i ruled out a car due to size, speed, point of origin, and angle.  an airplane was also ruled out for the same reasons, plus the fact that i had been unable to see any at that point due to cloud cover.  i ruled out a meteor due to size (i've never seen a shooting star anywhere near this size), point of origin (it started from ground level and ascended), angle (meteors seem to go across the sky, this went from ground up), and the fact that the object's size and brightness remained constant throughout (meteors burn up completely or hit the earth at a smaller size than when they start out).  the cloud cover would also rule out the ability to see a shooting star.  as soon as i got home (around 10 pm), i drew a rough sketch of what i saw (what i have attached is an updated, cleaner version made in ms paint).  i actually was a little frightened by the sighting for the rest of the night, and i could not stop thinking about it.\r\nalthough i am a believer, i had never seen a ufo, and even when i saw this i remained skeptical.  i have waited a few days to report it because i wanted to be completely sure that i could not find an explanation of what it was in the sky that night.","distance":"Over One

my two brothers were driving from lovington, nm to roswell, nm to visit our grandparents.  the entire drive would take about an hour and a half.  it was dusk on the lonely road and there was very little or no traffic.  at about an hour into the drive i noticed a bright object to the right of the car and mentioned it.  immediately, this object was directly above the car.  at the same time, the radio went to static and we heard the speedometer cable break, and it actually felt like the hair on my head was standing up.  there was no sound, but there was light everywhere.  the object, above, was so large that i could see it from the back seat as i looked straight ahead.  besides the extremely bright light above, i could see colored lights at the peremeter, also it seemed as though the light was coming from inside the car.  i had never been so terrified in my life and i just \"froze\" where i was.  my middle brother was climbing between the front and back seats, and my youngest brother was only three, so he didn't seem to react.  the scariest part, to me, was that i saw a huge black eye staring directly at me from the window beside me.  it seems that the eye was more in my \"minds eye\" than an actual eye.  the shape was typical of many reports.  it was a translucent black teardrop shape.  i can feel my heart beating rapidly as\r\ni recall this event, even though it has been 40 years ago.\r\n   the next time i remembered anything our car was heading toward a ditch alongside the road.  dad quickly turned the stearing wheel and kept the car on the road.  we were all so terrified that all of us were completely silent.  we soon pulled into our grandparents driveway to see the frantic looks on their faces.  my grandfather said, \"what happened i was just about to call the state police to look for you\".  my grandfather asked what took us so long.  a one and a half trip took three hours.  i don't remember almost anything of what was said, but i remember the feeling of terror that gripped us all.\r\n    i am 54 years old now and one brother is 51 and the other 44. my father is 75 years old and my mother, 72.  i have had nightmeres throughout the years although they have lessened with time. i am still very afraid of being abducted, and my heart races everytime i think about it.  recently my youngest brother and i were looking  for apache tears near gabbs, nevada and it was beginning to turn dark.  we were in the middle of nowhere and were headed toward fallon, nevade.  as we were heading back i noticed a light near the sky's horizon and i was instantly \"at the caprock again\".  i didn't say anything about it, and i prayed that it wasn't what i feared.  this time the light that looked like a star or planet was a star or planet.  i have told a few people about this event, but probably no more than 20.  strangely, almost everyone seems to believe me.  i would like to know what happened but at the same time i am too terrified to know any more.
