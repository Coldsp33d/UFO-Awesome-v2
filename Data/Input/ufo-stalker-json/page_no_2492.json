(that's what i thought as a kid.\r\n\r\nshortly after that event, i began to bleed when i had a bowel movement. my mom took me to our family doctor and he asked me \"have you been putting things in there?\" i was floored by this question, of course. my mom asked him why and he said it looked liked something had torn my colon. i thought i dreamed of being probed by these doctors with hoods on.\r\n\r\nanyway, years later, i saw the movie \"communion\" and i almost began to hyperventilate when i saw the \"creatures\" in that movie. the \"doctors\"who came to get him, were the exact guys i thought were kneeling at the foot of my bed. they were, in fact, not kneeling but very short with regular sized upper torsos.\r\n\r\nat about 16 or 17 two of my friends and i saw, what we believed was a ufo in an area called mt. airy forest, in cincinnati. we were all in art classes at our high school and we were talking about what we had seen. our art teacher seperated us and had us draw what we each had seen. the pictures were different but, when we discussed the positions we were in we actually had a full view of what we had seen from 3 different angles.\r\n\r\ni now live on the top floor of a highrise with a view of 20 miles all around. i have seen strange thing in the sky lately but nothing compared to that event in the forest.\r\n\r\n-one last note- i remember waking up after the \"guys kneeling event\" and i was freezing cold and it was mid summer and we had no air-conditioning. my mom thought i had put my hands in the freezer to trick her.\r\n\r\nhave you heard of anything similar to this?","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":8719,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1088282,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12272007-0004","longitude":-84.5092996,"occurred":-97430400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-97430400000,"summary":"Communion","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cincinnati, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:422762"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Santa Cruz","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was about 8 years old and was staying at my uncle's house in santa cruz, ca.  on a warm summer night, i was out in the front yard trying to look up at the stars and was having a hard time focusing.  about that time, i realized the reason i was having a hard time focusing on the sky was because there was a large object in front of the sky.  upon closer inspection i quickly came to realize that this object had three straight sides and was a large triangle with a ball of light on each point.  it slowly moved over my uncle's house toward the ocean and never made a sound.

here it is!\" still nothing. the other day i was watching a documentary where they talked about strange craft and mufon. they illuded to an incident in minot but didn't say what it was, only that it had happend in the 60's or some such. i decided to find your website and report what i had seen as best i possibly could. my sister and i talk about this once in a great while just to assure ourselves that we hadn't dreamed the incident or made it up in our own minds. for years after i have scanned the sky, waiting for another sighting to occur. i watched television waiting for some military secrets show to put this aircraft out there for me to see. so i would know that what i saw was of this earth. i wish i had more details about the craft and that i could have reported it that day when the information was still fresh in my mind.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":8717,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.42697,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12272007-0002","longitude":-101.3391598,"occurred":680029200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Dakota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":680029200000,"summary":"Silently spinning metallic triangle","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Minot, North Dakota","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:422764"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A big 'z' cloud formation appeared in the photo after downloading.  the 'z' cloud was not seen before the photo was taken.  no sound of any kind was heard.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8716,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.9770688,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12272007-0001","longitude":-99.8971931,"occurred":1181952000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1181952000000,"summary":"Big 'z' cloud appeared in photo after downloading","tags":["photo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8716_submitter_file1__UFOs(6).JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:422765"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Miami","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My fishing buddy and i went fishing to the seven mile bridge on the fla. keys north side, the weather was real bad, light rain and windy everybody left except my buddy a chinese couple from newyork on ther honeymoon and myself, i quit fishing because nothing was biting and turned around facing the highway and at eleven twenty exactly my buddy called me and said look at that so i did, there i was facing a fairly large disc i could see most of its underbelly it was dull orange, it stood there for exactly three minutes and then flew south stopped by the south side of the bridge and then i saw like rectangular plates coming down one on top of the other forming like a screw then again it took off south.  next morning i  was listening to the cuban radio and the govermente there were informing that their airforce was following these objects for several hours. as you know cuba is just 090 miles from the keys.

very dark (after 5 in the evening) and we were in intense storm conditions. thick sheets of rain and standing water were blowing across the road way and the winds were very high. we saw a semi tipped over by the wind further down the road. we were between towns and we saw very few other cars on this stretch of road. suddenly, out of the sky, two parallel beams of light came down directly in front of the hood of the car. they were about the same distance apart as the headlights, so the driver flipped her headlights off, then back on to make sure it wasn't the source of the odd light. the light remained constant. i peered up through the sunroof, trying to make out a source for the light in the dark, rainy sky above. i could barely make out two dimly glowing cat-eye shapes above us that the white light seemed to be emenating from. they were somewhere in or above the cloud cover and could not be clearly distinguished, but they were visable. \r\n   then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the lights vanished. they had come on and switched off, similar to how you would experience a flashlight being switched on and off. we continued to drive the whole time(about 5 minutes, maybe less). the darkness of the highway and extreme weather made it unsafe to pull off to the side or stop.\r\n   just after the lights switched off, i noticed ahead and to the right of the car, a semicircle of orange lights in the sky, close to the horizon. distance was impossible to judge in the dark and rain. but the middle light was the largest and they decreased slightly in size and radiated out in a slight bend upward in both directions from the center light, as though they were lights ringing the edge of a large disk. it stayed in sight, not moving for several seconds, then just faded out. i scanned the landscape as we drove past the area where i had seen the ring of lights to see if maybe there was a home or grain tower that they could have been ringing, but saw nothing but empty landscape.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":8712,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.7350875,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262007-0012","longitude":-116.9953151,"occurred":1131935400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

recordings made available on the web by him have really broadened my knowledge of a subject previous to the encounter i knew nothing about.\r\nwhen i first reported this,  i thought there may be some added advantage to not sharing my drawings so special thanks to kim shaffer for honoring that request.   \r\n i have decided to upload the pictures and incident recreation to share in hope this helps with an answer.   it may not, but it's all i have,  my word and the drawings, that's all i can provide you.  \r\n  these were created for my kids so that they would never forget.   i know, and they know, its real.   \r\nattached  recreation of the event, drawing of the craft we witnessed,  and recently found,  the only thing that has even come close to the craft we saw during my search for answers.    ironically,  it's a sonar image of a uso and not a ufo from a soviet sub.   or are they the same?\r\npardon the x-files theme song but i just had to do that,  ha...Ha.\r\ni provide the attached as true.\r\ngood luck to all who have seen  -  as i know its easier not to have seen and to wonder as opposed to seeing and to wonder, as there are few to relate with in the later.\r\nfinal from me, its not a military craft as i tried to originally convince myself,  its either alien or time travel, or combination there of.     i have new theories,  but those and a cup of coffee would get me classified as a nut case.   \r\nbelow is a repeat of the original i posted \r\n____________________________________________________________\r\nbelow are the original text of what happened in murfreesboro some time in the fall of 2006 sent to mr kim shaffer\r\nmufon tn state director\r\n\r\nhi kim,\r\ni don't really know if you want to hear about this as i have\r\nno actual pictures of this incident. i still am kicking myself in the seat of the pants every time i think about the fact that i did not film this incident, when right inside the house not 75 feet away, a fully charged video camera was available. this happened in late 2006, had to be in the fall, as the temp was just perfect. i got home from work and as usual went to the tv to check out today's news. shortly after that, i would say around 5:15 in the evening, i got up, went into the kitchen to just look out the window and check on both my sons age 10 years and nine years. i looked out the window both my boys were standing beside each other not even moving a muscle looking up in the air, they were both just standing there looking up. so i bent down lower so i could look out the window to see what they were looking at, wow, i thought to myself, what is that, a jump jet maybe, but hovering in our backyard, hold it, if that's a jump jet, where is the noise, there is no noise and this thing is hovering at or less than tree height. that was what was going through my mind, this house cannot possibly block the sound of a jump jet, so i immediately headed toward the back door and opened it, stepped out back, looked up, and at this point i will have to apologize to everyone in the world for not going and getting the video camera or\r\nany camera. i am so stupid for not getting a camera but you have to\r\nrealize, i am looking up at something and my mind is moving a million\r\ncalculations a second trying to figure out just how and what the hell is hovering over my back yard. my thoughts, were going crazy, looking over every square inch of this thing just amazed, amazing. i went on down the steps to where the kids were, watching this thing the whole time, its chrome color, definitely metallic, not a balloon or any lighter than aircraft, this thing was metal and large, this thing is not moving, not moving i mean not moving!!!.\r\ni was so amazed by this, i love technical things, i could not take my\r\neyes off it. one reason i could not take my eyes off it is its close enough that i know this is metal, but incredible, well, how can explain it, lets say parked. but parked in the air, that's a better\r\ndescription than hovering, no sound at all, and i am watching this thing and looking as hard as can for any movement and i mean any movement, but there is no movement what so ever. so again i am still kicking myself for not going and getting a camera, but i guess i was so amazed by what i am seeing, a metal object, almost chrome in color, the shape like an oblong cylinder, size about the size of a greyhound bus, and it is parked in mid air. and i do not know how to get this across more clearly, this thing was parked. in mid air!!!\r\nand again i think over and over and over again and apologize to everyone and anyone interested in stuff like this for not even once thinking about getting a camera while this was going on, but kim, this thing was so perfectly parked in mid air, i was just in awe of how it could do it, and i think my mind was just trying to figure out, oh, who knows what my mind was trying to figure out, i was just standing there gazing in unbelief of what i was looking at. this was like this for i guess about 4 minutes from the time i first saw it out the window, from the time it started to move. standing there so close looking at it parked in mid air, no sound, no wind, metal object not making, well, you could have heard a pin drop. no side vectoring from any secret military, this thing was right at or just below tree level and there was not a leaf one moving. then the object just all the sudden started to move. still no sound at all, this thing was just sliding along, i cannot explain how perfectly sliding through the air at a very low speed toward our back yard then at the back of the yard turned so cool, what i mean is it turned direction in such a cool way, i knew this thing was getting ready to leave here. so knowing it was getting ready to get out of here, i kept my eyes on it and started yelling for my wife to come out, the back door was open, i kept yelling at her to come out, she took her time, i still watched thing sliding through the air going toward nashville super speedway. my wife finally got outside, i got her to go around to the front of the house with me, she saw this thing leaving but the object was so far off by this time, she said what was it a plane. so she really did not see what me and my sons saw. i guess what drives me crazy now, is i wonder, as i know, or i think i know we do not possess anti gravity technology. and all the stories of people i use to think were crazy, well, i don't know now, i have to revisit every story i ever heard, and some of the stories i use to think were nuts and no way, well, not so nuts or crazy anymore. i know what i saw, and both my sons saw it too, what we saw was defying gravity, there is no other way to explain it. and i do not meaning hovering or lighter than air, i am saying this object could not have been anything less than anti gravity. the way it turned when it started moving could not have turned that way by any other force than gravity, the turn was to smooth and swift non stop and this object was then going in another direction. i cannot say this thing was from a different world or planet, and i cannot say this thing is from a different time as in time travel, i cannot tell you this was a military secret aircraft.\r\nwhat i can tell you is this thing was metal, chrome color, defied\r\ngravity and there is no doubt in my mind that this was anti gravity, and that this thing was under intelligent control, and me and my kids were so amazed watching it we could not blink, much less think about getting a camera. so, if your interested, i guess now i join the crazies, all the stories i use to hear and say man that guys lost it, well, i know i haven't lost it, and to others that think i am nuts with this story, all i can say is if you see one you will know. and if you have not seen one, yes, you will think this is nuts.\r\nwell, that's about all, if you would like to talk to me and my boys\r\nabout this sometime, that's cool, guess we could have coffee sometime\r\nand you could kick my butt for not grabbing a camera. god, if i only\r\nwould have got a camera, i would have had the best, closest, clearest\r\npictures of this craft than anyone in the world has have ever seen.\r\nbut i will have to live with my stupidity of not.\r\ni am a believer now, and so are my kids. there is some kind of anti\r\ngravity craft here on this planet, not an illusion, a controlled craft, we have seen it. who's it is, could not tell you. but it could only be anti gravity craft, there is just no other explanation, none you could convince me of that could have allowed this craft to do what we saw. well, that's it, for what its worth, that's our story and i'm sticking to it.\r\nhave a good one kim,\r\nbelow is info for you only, please do not disclose my contact info below to anyone else.\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n(after more email correspondence with kim, i sent a follow up email with some details i left out of original)\r\n\r\nquite different indeed,\r\ni am going on 47 years old, have seen ufo shows, clippings, etc..\r\nalways fascinated by these shows, but in reality, when watching, thought were just nutty people and or really good pranksters with digital media. some did fascinate me, but still had nothing but doubt every time i watched one of those shows or specials. and some of the videos i have seen over my life, i would say, bull, that's not real, but is an excellent hoax. now though, after seeing what i saw, what do i do now? i find myself revisiting some of those old stories and film clippings, some where the objects were just perfectly still in mid air and think, maybe not a hoax. or what about the guy, can't think of his name, but said he was hired to reverse engineer alien craft at roswell, i thought what a great made up story, that guys nuts, but a good cool geeky story. all those things looked and sounded like someone had lost there ever loving mind. but now after seeing what we saw, your mind starts to question, which of those many sighting, stories, pictures, are real. i know there is still allot of real nuts out there, but not all of them. as if i had grabbed a camera and actually shot video of it, it was so amazing that anyone watching would have said what i use to say, wow, that's really cool, pondered it, maybe even rewind it a few times and watch it again, but in the back of there mind they probably would have been saying how the hell did he pull off such a good video hoax. ha....Ha, reminds me of what my dad use to say, what goes around comes around. anyway, you are correct, if i have been on this earth for near 47 years, and this was first time to encounter such an amazing feet of technology that as most people know does not exist, i should just treasure the moment as if it took 47 years of my life to see it one time, odds are not very good at ever seeing something like this again in my life time. one very important thing i left out of original, as if i already in the nut club might as well tell you this part too. the object, when it was stationary, no lights nothing, but when it started to move and then made that fantastic turn at the back of the yard, just after it turned a light started flashing, now after it turned this craft was, i would say no more than 25 to 30 feet off the ground, now its going behind my trees at this altitude but while sliding along it is slowly climbing, the light was, how could i say, a real neat greenish\r\nyellow light. remember, this is in bright daylight, this thing is\r\nflashing, flashing around the same tempo as any airplane strobe would\r\nflash. that part of it has me thinking that this is some kind of\r\nsuper high tech military aircraft of some sort. but that's my brain\r\nsaying, why the hell would aliens have a strobe to warn other aircraft. (*** i remember what i told the kids when it was all over and we settled down from the experience, they asked, dad, what was that. my reply was, son, i don't know, we do not have anything known, or that i know of, or heck anyone knows of that can perform what we just saw. i will say one thing, if it is some kind of secret military craft, i sure hope its ours.***) well, you can keep me on record as reporting this, nothing else i can add, and i do not care if this info is read in discussion, radio, or net, but keep my name confidential, just replace my name with, (a man and his two sons from murfreesboro saw etc.... etc.... etc..\r\nbut for the record, wanted to go on record for whats its worth and\r\nreport this for documenting. and if ever the need arise, i swear to\r\nyou i could pass a polygraph on everything i have told you in this email and the prior email.\r\nout of curiosity, if these things are able to move about and be\r\nstationary in mid air, just how often and how many are around not even\r\nbeing seen, what i mean is, after seeing this, for the last year since\r\nseeing this, now when i am outside, driving, going to and from here to\r\nthere, i am always looking at tree top level now hoping to catch a show like that again, but then you start to realize, geesh, our line of site is not very far at all if the craft is flying at, just above and or below tree level. just an amazing memory of a once in a lifetime event now? i sure hope not, but thats probably the fact jack.\r\nthats it this time, promise, from one nut to anutter, later nutty\r\nbuddy.\r\nbelow are some interesting facts of what we saw, not all sent to kim in email.\r\n\r\nobject can remain parked in mid air with no sound at all no movement.\r\nwhen turning, the front of this object popped up slightly, i know this because the sun was behind me, and when it popped up slightly i was in a position that allowed me to see the sun reflect off the top front of this craft. before the front of the craft popped up in the front, it had already stopped at the back of the yard, so popping up had nothing to do with it stopping, so not sure at all how it even stopped. the popping up of the front was more to do with the turn and at the same time it popped up in the front, the craft also tilted to the left, and started to slide into its new trajectory loosing altitude as it did this.\r\nafter the turn and in new trajectory, a brilliant greenish yellow light started flashing located center top of the craft is the best i can remember location of light. this light and color is hard for me to explain as i have never seen anything in my life flash so bright and the color, well, greenish yellow does not give the color of the light or its intensity justice.\r\ncraft when on new trajectory is gaining altitude while maintaining level flight... meaning,, the front of the craft not pitched up at all from what i could tell but craft still slowly gaining altitude while sliding along with absolutely no sound and absolutely no indication of any power source at all. at one point i was even wondering if it was going to clear the second set of trees it was headed toward because i could see no pith in the craft to indicate a climb, but it did clear them and continue on.\r\ncolor of craft best i could descripe would be steel or stainless steel, somewhat same color as the old mig fighter jets steel. dark color steel but very polished shiny.\r\nthis was a very close encounter approximate distances while viewing, 125 feet from actual object at the most while stationary, 300 feet from object when it exited the other side of the wooded area behind my house.\r\nso anyone trying to debunk this, i ask, if you were standing 125 feet or less from a greyhound bus, could you tell if that bus had wings at this distance? i actually think at one time we, (we being both me and the boys), were less than 75 to 80 feet from this object. sorry to the debunker's, but there is know way and i mean know way you can debunk what me and my kids saw. but i can understand why you do not believe, as before me and the kids saw this, i believed you, you being the debunker's. but after seeing this craft at a close distance, i am telling you your wrong. there is something going on, and even though some can be debunked, i am here to tell you that something is going on and you cannot debunk mine, never, sorry, i was to close to this, it is real. my regret is that i did not film this as this surely would have started a serious investigation if this craft is not military.\r\ni did finally take some time to draw a series of drawings of the craft so that my kids would never forget what we saw that day. kim is holding, i asked kim to keep these drawings private as while i have been doing my own investigation of this, have found no other craft or picture of craft of what we saw. my thinking on asking kim not to show these pictures, as again, this is real, surely someone else will report this object, so told kim if these drawings were made available to the public, how would we know if the next reporting of this craft would be real. so that is why i made decision to ask kim to keep the drawings private for now. there are some other details that kim has that i have decided not to add to this report for same reason. when other people come forward and describe this object, it will not be because they have seen this craft posted somewhere else.\r\nkim has honored this request. and may i add it was a pleasure speaking with kim who takes this matter serious.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8711,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.8547213,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262007-0011","longitude":-86.38358,"occurred":1158908400000,"potentialRelations":[7596],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,  Missile,  Cigar,  Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1158908400000,"summary":"Close encounter object stationary in my back yard (follow up drawings)","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8711_submitter_file1__Craft.zip","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8711_submitter_file2__UFORECFin.MPEG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Murfreesboro, Tennessee","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:422770"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"New York","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This happened on my birthday in 1997, that's why i know it was october 15. i had lived in the early 70's in a beautiful old house on a bluff overlooking the bay in st george, staten island. i was feeling nostalgic on my birthday and took a ferry ride out there to take a look at the area. \r\nthe house, and most of the block, had been torn down in the late 70's by a developer who ran out of money and what was on the location at that point was an abandoned parking lot. however it still had a wonderful view of the bay. when i got there i just sat on a log and took in the view.\r\nto my right i noticed a commercial jet heading up the harbor, which is normally the final approach to laguardia, so it couldn't have been at more than 4000 feet. to my left i caught sight of a flock of seagulls. however right behind the seagulls was this thing that looked like a shiny pipe that seemed to be flying at the same height as the gulls. the sun was reflecting off it. i don't know how good i am with estimating size, but at the time i figured it was about 10 feet long and maybe one to 2 feet round. i do not remember seeing the \"front\", but the back of it was flat. i estimated it couldn't have been flying at more than 100 mph. it was on a steady course from bayonne across the bay towards brooklyn. it flew under the commercial jet. i watched it 'til it disappeared in the distance heading toward coney island. could not have been more than 2 minutes, possibly less.\r\nat the time i remember my first reaction was that this is interesting. at first it seemed very \"normal\". then i realized this is not normal. i wasn't afraid, just fascinated. \r\ni'd seen something 30 years earlier that i could not explain, but nothing in the intervening years and nothing since. i've carried this with me for the past 10 years and figured now was as good a time as any to try to find out what it was.\r\nall i can tell you is it seemed at first to be so everyday. i had a feeling at the time that it had a purpose and that it could have been something like a robotic carrier pidgeon?

outside of our home to \"check out\" something he saw in the sky. we are smokers (only outside as we have children) and star gaze and enjoy looking at the moon while outside smoking. \r\n\r\ni am not an astronomist and really know nothing about the stars and such so please excuse my generic explanation. \r\n\r\nmy husband first noticed this star that appeared to be moving. he pointed up for me to look. something was positioned in the sky east of us slightly to the south of the position of the moon. \r\n\r\nit was slightly \"orangish red\" tinted and at times looked as though it had a white light or like a haze around it. it shined and tinkled some as though it were a star. at first i was certain it was just a satelite mistaken for a star or planet. \r\n\r\nyet, this was different and would move in all different directions. like, say...To the left slowly.... then right and a quick circle back to what seemed to be it's original position. it also seemed to be closer or further to/from us at times. \r\n\r\nplease note we have not being drinking and are do not partake in any drugs. but while it was moving i would feel a little dizzy just looking at it. like i was moving. (if that makes sense) \r\n\r\ni began to figure it was maybe a planet or like, what ever yanno? tried to remain scientific about it. i kept my head about things and stayed calm. i mean i was certain i would never see something like a ship or whatever in my lifetime. as i figure these sightings are rare?? right? i didn't want to really think it was anything but a planet or whatever.\r\n\r\nso i called a friend who follows star and planets and things from an astrological nature. i thought maybe some strange mercury retrograde thing making me think this planet was a moving backwards. she would clear this up and i could laugh at him over the next 20 years saying \"hey honey remember when you thought jupiter was a ufo\" type thing, right?\r\n\r\nwell...She too saw it! and agreed it was moving. her boyfriend (a total skeptic also agreed this \"thing\" appeared to move) we called several other people (mom's, sister's, nephew's, friends) all agreed it wasn't a \"explanable thing\". and that it was moving in an interesting manner. \r\n\r\nit is still there in the sky at the moment i write this. as i wanted to get online someplace and see if there were sightings. so i cannot say when it left. i'm still wondering if there is some other explanation. i would like to see if there are other \"sightings\" of this and if we're just looking at something else. \r\n\r\ni did want to note (at 11:07) husband came in to report he thinks he saw a shooting star. thought this might be interesting to note. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":8700,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7628227,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12252007-0031","longitude":-86.3997167,"occurred":1198643400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1198643400000,"summary":"Moving star - shifting directions","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Indianapolis","timeZoneName":"America/Indianapolis","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8700_submitter_file1__AvonwitnessinterviewbyAliceBaker.wav","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8700_submitter_file2__AVON3.SAV","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8700_submitter_file3__Avon112_25_1800.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/8700_submitter_file4__Avon212_252300.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Avon, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:422778"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Liberty","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It happen at white water state park when i was about 5 years old.I was playing in the woods,next i was in a white light and there were other people in the light,i could not move,then everything went white,i wake up back in the woods,i ran to our family camper,i had very bad cramps,i feel that im being tracted.Before i leave this planet i wanted to tell my story  ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":8699,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.6404148,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12252007-0030","longitude":-84.925101,"occurred":-192049200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-192049200000,"summary":"I was abducted","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Indiana/Indianapolis","timeZoneName":"America/Indiana/Indianapolis","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Liberty, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:422779"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Des Moines","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I can't remember the exact year or even time of the year, it was so long ago now.  i was working as a city worker and had a partner with me.  we took a break from driving and were sitting in a van beside the k-mart, across the street from southridge mall. there was construction going on the mall and i don't remember if montgomery ward was open or being built then. would have been in the early 80's. we were sitting there and saw this ufo come down over the store and hover. we hadn't seen it coming, just dropped into sight from above. we were across the street, maybe 300 yards?
