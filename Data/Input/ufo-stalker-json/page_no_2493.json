1/2 mile or so up, the size is hard to determine, but guessing about 30 or 50 feet long at longest width span 30 feet or so. as it crusied in a straight line it seemed to be showing off ( as if telling me watch this ) as it made an unbelievable manuever an l shape turn without stopping or slowing down.  as if you were to grab a pencil and draw a vertical line and the end, draw a horizontal

the helicopter, the incident lasted about 3 or 4 minutes.  another incident occurred when i was driving down a main street in my town.  off to the left of my peripheral vision i noticed the stadium

also taxied planes to and from the hanger.Also to the runway where they then took off.One day we were walking back after taxying a plane out.It had just thunderstormed.The rain had stopped but there was bright sunlight along with clouds so i was looking up as i walked back enjoying the great view of sun hitting the clouds and a rainbow.Then out of nowhere i see the sunlight hit an object very high right above the airport.I was halfway between the runway and our building on the south side of the runway.It was very metallic pure silver the sunlight was very bright agianst it.This thin was doing unbelievable manuvers going from one end of the sky to the next then immediatly turning around like stopped on a dime and turned around.I knew this think was a ufo i am former military i know what out planes our capable of doing and they could not even come close to these manuvers.I look for about 10 minutes as i watched this thing i knew it was not a trick of light because it came lower and then went higher.They delayed a plane from touching down from this thing although they never said that we knew.The next plane was do in 10 minutes for us to turn around.It was told to us that it was delayed no reason was given but we knew why.Then the thing vanished as fast as it appeared.I dont know what it was i do know that we have no technology capable of this kind of manuvering so my personal opinion is it was a ufo. i have seen one other one in my life and have serval witness's to that one also. i lived in vernal utah for about 2 years when i was 12 and 13.Well there is an air force base there curiosly though as an adult i looked and there is no reference to it on military or civilian maps and is not registered as a base.But it is there none the less i ashure you the airmen use to drive by my house on the outskirts of town on there way to the base always waving at me and me waving back.If you took the road i lived on to where it ended it ended at the base and a guarded gate.We as kids would ride up the road to the gate and say hi to the guards who would give us candy sometimes or soda pop.Anyways one night around 1987 we were on my grandmas porch and saw 3 bright lights one on top of each other just hovering.They sat there for over a half hour they would blink dissapear and reappear.Right on top of each other 1 2 3 no sound what so ever they were so close i thought i could shoot one with my 22cal gun which dad promptly took from me and said no.Then the top one blinked dissapeared reappeared and shot straight up i mean straight up so fast that it left a streak of light as it did this.The second one did the same thing about a minute later.Then the third on dissappeared then reappeared and dropped something another light fell from the bottom of this object towards the ground and then it too shot straight up.The next day me and my dad went out in to the hills where we had seen these things.We were denied access there was a big fence that ran for miles that said goverment propety it was on the air force base.So we never found out what it was.\r\n\r\nthank you \r\ntim jacobson","distance":"501 Feet - 1

listen\" i hear a deep sound. as we stopped and listened we all heard the very deep sound. just as we all heard the sound milton said \"look\" gesturing with his hand for us to look out over the water. when i looked i became scared and excited as i saw what was making the sound. i saw an sphere sort of rounded with a roundish belly and a typical dome but a bit larger. around the object were three light colors how many lights i'm not sure but certainly 3 colors one a yellow another a sort of red and the third was sort of a cross between blue and green. about as quick as we saw and heard this craft it disappeared in a blur straight up. i was all hyped up being about 15 years of age. i picked up a stick as though i was ready to face the threat. i did not rest for some time i kept looking and looking for another view of it somewhere. ultimately i did see the craft again way up beyond the clouds, and what i saw this time intrigued me even more than the close encounter. i saw the craft project a powerful light, and then in an extremely controlled fashion take the light back in. it didn't dim as it projected and it didn't dim as it was brought back in. the light was under absolute control, as though it would be wasted if it were not collected back into the craft.\r\n   i have only talked about this to people, and have never reported it in this fashion before. i know that bob has denied seeing it in the past. i'm not sure if milton would admit seeing it. my pastor say's he believes it was of demonic origin, the supperintendant of opportunity farm whom i told of this the next day thinks it must be something the military is doing. i don't know. but the sound, speed of departure, and incredible control of it's light source, have intrigued me all of my life. i was young, had no camera or recorder and thus only have mental images of these events. it's to bad science didn't have the ability to retrieve this imagery from my mind. i think most people would be stunned as i was. when someone asks me if i believe in ufo's i tell my story. i don't know if it is was terrestrial or extra terrestrial all i know is that the technology to produce what i witnessed

were ussually found in the ignitions.  during the day it was difficult to \"sneek\" in and arround the \"junk\" yard.\r\ni crossed an old train bridge over the river to get there. i was getting out of an old car when i noticed lights which i immeadiately assumed were shinning from a distance because the river and a sharp decline to the river were in that direction. as i looked back again within secounds realizing what i was seeing could not be there.  i then noticed the lights were moving together and were within minutes of passing directly over head orat least close to me becuase they were headed in my direction. i began to try and figure out what this thing was. i thought maybe its one of those blimps but it was more round not long.  i thought maybe it was a helocopter.  but i realized there was no sound. as it got closer i began to feel fearful of it. i only had time enough to duck behind the rear fender of the old car. it was i felt, looking at the junk yard of cars. i felt that becuase it moved closer and i feared it might see me. it was only about one hundred feet from me now and it was at about 10 feet higher than eye level.  there was a sharp embankment which led to the river below and it was riding the ridge. agian when i first noticed it, it was a bit further away from he ridge and was apparently originally following the shore line of the river. but it did come closer and as i said, i presumed it was coming close to look at the junk yard of cars.\r\nafter it moved ever so slowly passed me, it changed it's course and drifted down and above the river it was headed north and was now passing within about ten feet or so above the car bridge which was parallel to the train bridge.  i was now able to see it more clearly even thought it was now many hundreds of feet from me. the lights which light up the car bridge allowed me to make out the shape more definately.  as it passed earlier it was so black of a night and the back ground was as dark and so close it was difficult to know for sure what shape it actually was . now as it became back lit i was able to see all of its shape.  also at that momment which it was passing the bridge a car was driving across the bridge and i then knew for sure that unless the driver was blind he had to have seen it.  i would estimate and did at that time estimate it was large enought to hold inside of it two of those cars. and so it was fairly large but not enormous.\r\nagian it had not one sound it moved very steadly and it seemed to be able to adjust speed and manuver> the lights dimed after it passed me and the junk yard and they brighted again when it passed over the bridge. further the lights seemed to flicker and indipendently of each other brighten and dim when they had been near the junk yard. i told no one about this becuase i was not supposed to be out at night as i had been and i decided  wait to hear about it maybe from the news or maybe from someone saying it was seen. i also felt i would be teased and not believed anyways. i find it easy to believe that there was some kind of effect on me becuase of this incident but to go into that would take away from the creditabilty of this true story.  i did not imagine this happened  i lived it and it really happened.","distance":"21-100

( (coming from east to west)  it looks like there going to crash into each other! they almost hit, but at the last moment made a sharp right-angle south. i exclaimed, \" we can't do that ! do you know what we are looking at?  these are ufos!\" (meaning et crafts) they made a plowing pattern by going straight and opposite of each other.  then they did 180 degree turns to start a new lines. i said, \" it looks like they're scanning our base!\"  as they accelerated through the turns they flared larger and brighter to about 5 times the original diameter...Which was like the head of a straight-pin at arms length. after,i guess, 8 to 10 repetitions, they accelerated in opposite directions as they brilliantly flared, then totally disappeared. there was no contrail.  we waited for 5 minutes,but head no jet sound. it was all done in silence. it took my breath away!  it was an epiphany. i asked,\" do you want to report this?\"  my friend said, \"no, we are going for our secret (electronics)

late husband and i witnessed this event in august of 2004.  i didn't report this to anyone because the sighting left us in a state of amazement/disbelief/awe for quite some time.  the only real discussion my husband and i had about it was to compare notes the next day to confirm that we had each seen the same thing and that neither of us had dreamt it.  up until his death a year ago my husband wouldn't talk about the sighting with me.  the whole experience seemed to really shock him.  i finally decided that i should tell someone about our sighting.  i reported this to tom levine's site earlier in the year and decided that mufon should also know about it.\r\n \r\nit happened on the 22nd of august, 2004, around 1 am.  we live in hague, saskatchewan, a town of 700 located about 1/2 hour north of saskatoon.  it was our habit during the summer to sit on our veranda and watch the night sky.  that particular night the sky was clear.  we were sitting facing east.  my husband noticed an orange light moving towards us in the sky and pointed it out to me.  within a minute of this the sky was totally obliterated by an enormous black triangular shape that had a light at each corner.  it moved very slowly from east to west and passed directly over our house.  it made absolutely no sound and seemed to be travelling at a very low altitude although this was rather hard to judge because of the enormous size of the object.  when it was directly overhead it blocked out most of the sky.  it appeared to be very close to the roof of our 2 1/2 storey house.  we sat in stunned silence and watched as it passed overhead.  we lost sight of it when it passed over the house.  the only comment that we made to each other at the time was \"what the hell was that\".  as i said previously we compared notes the next day to confirm that we had seen the same thing and my husband was loath to discuss it after that.  \r\n

like a disc i would take some pictures of birds to compare. i was lucky to have an eagle circling right in front of the house about 1/8 to 1/4 mile away so i took several shots of it and compared them to the disc objects. there was no similarity at all. the objects flying over the wrangell airport are not birds. the lower closer one even appears to be metallic in that on the lower right hand side

upstairs. in a partial sleep, i heard my husband clearly call my name. i quickly got out of bed and went up to check on him but he was fine and sound asleep. i came back down and as i got back into bed i saw a flashing light in the corner of the guestroom window. at first i thought it was lightning but i knew i hadn't heard any thunder and that a storm was not expected. i went to the window and pulled back the shade and stood in front of it and in the rear pasture (about 500 feet away) i saw very large flashing white lights (perhaps 4 to 6 to 8) and it seemed there were smaller lights that were trajected out from the larger lights that were flashing at a faster rate.  (from looking at photos on the internet of ufo sitings, it may been not flashing lights but a craft turning fast -- though they appeared to be flashing.)there was no sound at all. it seemed to be a craft but i couldn't see a craft -- only lights --if the lights were attached to something, it seems that the craft should have been round. i guess my first thought was that it was a helicopter but i soon knew this couldn't be the case as it was much too large and didn't make any sound at all. it moved across the pasture and closer to the house and at the end of the pasture (about 300 feet away) it appeared to come down and to try to land. it was only at this point i became frightened.  but then it quickly raised up into the air again and went off behind the house where i couldn't see it any longer. the smaller flashing faster lights continued to be on the side of the house where my window was for another 8 to 10 seconds at least. i went to the back of the house but by the time i arrived there, i could see no more lights and was too scared to go outside. the next day i went out to the pasture but saw no evidence of anything that was visible from a landing or an attempted landing. my impression was that it wanted to land, somehow detected me, and then decided not to land. perhaps an electrical or energy field that it created by being so close is what made me hear my husband's voice wake me up. it was clearly not my husband who was fast asleep upstairs and i still don't know why i woke up.  \r\n\r\nthis has affected my life as i now know that \"they\" are out there, but the feeling i have is positive and not negative. i didn't contact authorities in the area as it is rural and no one wants the local authorities to think they might be crazy. i've not been able to find any reported sightings in this area on that day other than a possible one in canada and a possible one in connecticut, but nothing nearby. and i 've not been able yet to find a description of a ufo siting that sounds like what i saw. there are not that many sitings in this area of upstate new york anyway.
