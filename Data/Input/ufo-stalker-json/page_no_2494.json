sky - asking what it was - and i looked up.\r\n\r\nwhat we saw, in the cloudless sky, was a fat ball of white smoke/cloud, seemingly quite wispy, if i recall, moving across the sky. we wouldn't have been surprised at seeing a cloud (which it first looked like), if it hadn't been moving at considerable speed. not helicopter speed, but certainly the sort of speed you would associate with a really windy day. and it wasn't windy. \r\n\r\nit also appeared to have a triangular 'tail' coming out of it  - on the right as you looked at it. afterwards, when i drew it, someone commented that it looked like an ice cream in a cone that was on its side. when we saw it, it seemed like a cloud doing an impression of a fat meteor!\r\n\r\nanother thing we should say is that it was fairly big in the sky, so it seemed to be fairly close. not like a, say, airplane would look like from the window.\r\n\r\nwe were really excited and baffled by it! we ran to the window on the adjacent side of the building as the object appeared to be moving that way. it looked fairly underwhelming from the new angle (how disappointed were we not to stay viewing it from our original vantage point!) and appeared to be disintegrating. i ran back to the original angle and could no longer see it. i then went back to the other window and it had totally disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe only explanation i could think of was that

a stop sign at county rd 450s and county road 300 west and looked northeast to see a large white light shinning down on a tree at the edge of the wooded area.  i felt something was strange about this right from the start since it immediately switched off the white beam of lihgt as soon as i stopped and watched the object. it came across the road 425 north and across the bean & corn fields and never turned on any lights and it was a cool clear night.  it appeared black and rectangular and looked like it was going to come right over me when it stopped across the road from me and hovered for a minute or so. i was scared at this point and with my window rolled down i never heard any noise such as an engine etc. i was glad it turned and went slowly about 4-5 mph over county road 300 west and county road 500 or gem road.  i was determined to get a better look so i raced to the stop at 300 & gem rd. it was turning on side lights that looked like old round automobile lights but larger that where white and blinked on and off in some kind of sequence. i could see a cloud or mist surrounding the objcet and it was circular and silver or gray in color.  it has three lights on the side that i viewed and appeared to be headed to the south towards us 52 i would guess just east of german church rd and gem road.  i watch it till it moved over the tree line and out of sight.  i would guess it to have been 30 feet across.  i went home and called my sister and told her you would never guess what i have witnessed.  i called the local authorites the next day and spoke to a marion county sheriff and was told that no other reports were called in about the object.  i was the only one on the county road at the time but there were cars that were going north on gem road when it crossed over them with the lights off.  i was determined to find out what this object was so i reported to the cia, fbi and the faa. i was told that the military could not confirm or deny any object on radar.  i believe the object flies just under the radar.  it was low just above the tree tops. i believe it used the side lights like we use our headlights on cars to keep away from power lines, etc.  i was always looking in the area to see if i seen anything else when a couple of months later i saw three orange lights in perfect distance apart just above the tree line in the same area but south of county road 300 west.  i never saw the object but i believe these lights were the same side lights i has seen on the object in april just from the spacing and the large round lights.  they were orange this time but it was arount 4:30 pm in the afternoon.  i was driving one afternoon and spotted a large reddish orange basketball size ball above the tree line in the same wooded area.  also, i was coming home on a sunday night about 8pm one evening when i saw a strange thing occur. it looked like a misty cloud over the exact tree line area i first saw the object in april. the misty cloud was like hovering over the tree line when it suddenly shot to the east up into the clouds.  it was in august i believe and was still somewhat light outside.  i have never seen any cloud look or act like this one. i have been ridiculed and laughed at by me family and oddly my friends that are close believe that i saw an object that was unconventional.  i have told people it may be something we have made but it runs off of a different propulsion system than we are familiar with today. i am concerned due to the fact that some object unfamiliar to me in flying withing 1/4 mile from my only grandson's house.  i want to know what it is and why does it act so strange.  i did have burning to my eyes and my nails on my left hand cracked and broke off.  i had a funny feeling in my body like something crawling under my skin for a couple of days.  i would not want anyone to attempt to get any closer that i did to this object and i would advise you to stay in your car or get under something if you ever encounter any object you cannot identify.  also, i have been in contact with an elderly couple who seen an object they described as cigar shaped on the ground at the edge of this woods on county road 200 west which is the next road north of where i saw the object. i believe it has a pattern and time of year it appears.  the elderly couple said they had seen the object in april, 2006 about the same time of year and the first week of april.  i will be equipped next year to get this thing on tape and pictures if i am not so amazed that if forget what to do. i have spoken to jerry sivers several times in reference to my sighting.  i will answer any questions you might have about my sighting. i can tell you i am 60 years old and i do not drink or take drugs and i don't even smoke.  i have never been treated for any mental problems and consider myself a normal average working grandma that loves her family.   i don't worry about myself but about the future generation and the security of our country.  it seems to me nobody knows what to do when someone reports something like this.  the usaf has been told to ignore and dismiss reports since project blue book was closed but our country also ignored the terriorist attact possibility that happened in new york. i hope we do not ignore signs and reports and find out too late we could and should have taken these sightings as important and significant to the security of our citizens and country.

plane) looked like it was going to land. (two headlights on front, shinning through the fog.)  we stopped the car so it could land, but it stopped in mid-air, i turned right and it turned with us.  we would go, it would go, we would stop , it would stop.\r\n\r\ni rolled down my car window, looked up and saw a triangular shaped object with pink and blue lights.( it made no sound!)  my daughter was crying for me to drive.  we got home in our house.  went to the front window.  it was sitting (hovering) in front of house and slowly starting going towards the house across the road, barely over trees over their house.  turned to right and continued back on its course. (the bottom of craft looked like the underneath of a car.)\r\n\r\ndaughter-traveling east we were turning right onto another road when we spotted the white headlights peering through the fog in front of us.  we hesitated as the object turned with us and stopped when we did and went when we did.  looking above us we saw a triangular figure with pink and blue lights (very few).  we frantically rolled down the windows to hear silence.  the object stayed stationary for an unreal amount of time.  we speeded off towards the house and the \"object\" went back to its orginal path barely making it over the 2 story farm house.\r\n\r\nwhen we first stopped it was thought to be a plane.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

lexington.We saw a very bright spot light signaling on the other side of the hill.Steven turned his head lights off,and said look its the bat signal.I laughft and said it was a air port becon ,but he said there was no airport over there.When we got over the hill we saw a huge structure.The back of it was a huge dome and in the front  was a smaller dome with a couple of rows of the spot lights we were seeing.And on the smaller dome was a golden cross that came out of the top.To the left was a vertical disk shaped object that was blue.It all was shinning like it was covered in florecent light.The domes were a redish color.The first thing i said was is this the coming of christ.We were approching this structure fast.We pulled over to the side.I dont think it knew we were there.Because of steven turning his headlight off.Then the cross started to spin really fast,and orbs started flying everywhere.Then the blue wheel started to charge and a energy field covered the object like a huge dome.You could see electric veins inside the energy field and we could feal the static.Then with out any warning it dissipeared like it changed frequencies.This happened in a feild on a horse farm there is a couple of houses around the area but no one else was around.We ran to the spot it was at and we kept saying it was right here.It took me four years to acctually start investigating ufos.I have read alot of books on the subject and have not found too much info on what we saw.I have found some clues.And i have seen two other objects in the sky that may be linked to this machine,but what we saw was on the ground and we were close enough to see it work,i strongly believe that it was a interdiminsional time machine.I hope i can get answers and and help advise anyone who would want to investigate.         ronnie kenner","distance":"101-500

across in front of me dissapearing behind the house next door.\r\nit seemed to be travelling as if it would land several miles away, i thought it could be the isle of angelsey or the irish sea.\r\ni imagine the time taken to go out of sight was approx. 4 seconds. it was hard to belive what i had just seen, i just had to assume it was a ufo.\r\ni would love to know if other people have seen anything like this, i just wish i had phoned the police or coastguard then i may have heard more about it.\r\ni just stood there amazed, excited and perplexed, i kept looking in the direction from which it had come.\r\ni could not belive it when approx 4 seconds later i saw another identical object on an identical course come over the hill at exactly the same place.\r\nyet again another 4 seconds or so later another same size object came over on the same course as the previous two.\r\nthe only difference between this object and the other two was that this one was the colour of the setting sun and a large amount of sparks where coming from the rear, the movement of it was exactly the same as the other two.\r\nthere was no sound whatsoever from any of these objects.\r\ni do not
