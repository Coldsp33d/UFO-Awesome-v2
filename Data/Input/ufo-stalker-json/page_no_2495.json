of philadelphia near the neshaminy mall in the early evening sometime mid to late september of 1974.  as i walked i noticed an unusually bright light on the southern horizon. i stopped to observe the unusual light. it appeared to vary in brightness, as if to pulse at regular but slow intervals. i continued to watch the object for several minutes and noted that the general brightness of the pulse was increasing over time.  a short later i realized that the object was not pulsing at all but actually moving north and then receding southward in a regular linear pattern all the while nudging its overall positon northward slowly and inextricably approaching my vantage point. it seemed to follow the course of rt. 1 north in the direction of trenton, nj.  at this time i noticed two other bright lights moving in and out of my peripheral field of vision positioned one on the east side of the original light and the other on the west side of the object.  these objects moved quite differently than the first.  they also were moving northward slowly following the line established by the center object but rather than moving alternately southward and northward in the fashion of the central object, they zig-zaged back and forth from west to east and alternately east to west in a pattern mirroring one another on either side of the central object but never overlapping it as if the pattern of the center object formed a demarcation or boundry that neither ancillary object crossed.  all three objects were nudging slowly northward following their perscribed patterns of movement. my impression was that they were either looking for something or surveying the area. there was nothing at all random about their movement and they were absolutely coordinated in a way that implied a centralized plan or control.  \r\n\r\nthis continued for some time. i estimate roughly ten to fifteen minutes. eventually their position against the southern horizon lowered to the point that the surrounding trees impeded my view and they disappeared ... or so i thought. i stood awed for several minutes really sad that the incident was over thinking that i wanted to get a further view of the ballet i had witnessed and actually praying that they would come back.  \r\n\r\nafter several more minutes my wishes suddenly were granted when i heard a high pitched but low volume whirring sound like a jet enigine with a huge muffler on steroids. i could not get a fix on the direction from which the sound was coming until i looked up and realized that an object was literally several hundred feet in the air and almost directly overhead. i could no longer see bright light or light at all for that matter ... only the dark underside could be seen silhoueted against the surrounding night sky.  i could not make out any of the surface details of the underside of the object. it was simply a blacker circle against a nearly black backgroud. at the same time i looked east and noticed that one of the other objects was hovering over a small copse of trees maybe two or three blocks east but making no sound at all that i could make out.  this object's outline was similar in shape to the outline of a football and my guess was that it was disc shaped although it was difficult to tell due to the darkness.  it had a row of lights that outlined the shape. they were multi-tinted with different shades of color more like tints than hard colors. i never saw what would have been the third object after that time. i believe it would have had to have been the object west of the central one.  it simply was not there anymore and i had no idea where it had moved off to.\r\n\r\nthe object making the whirring sound situated over my head was quite large and i believe it was the one positioned in the center that was moving in the linear north/south direction although it is impossible to say for sure since i had lost sight of all of the objects for several minutes when they fell below my line of sight. i estimate it to have been 100+ feet in diameter. it was dark and moving very slowly overhead at maybe 5 mph.  it was extremely disconcerting knowing that nothing that large i had ever seen could possibly remain in the sky even under power.  the object to my east over the tress did not move at all.  my impression was that they were aware they were being observed and were in fact observing me.  at that point i was fairly alarmed and wondering why the air force wasn't chasing these guys.\r\n\r\nafter minute or two both objects began moving off in a northeastery direction and though i gave chase on foot i lost sight of them very quickly.\r\n\r\nseveral impressions come to mind.  first was that they were there for a reason to perform a specific task.  second ... every motion was coordinated and the objects were communicating with one another. i was both exhilerated and frightenend at the same time. as crazy as it sounds, at times i felt that they actually knew what i was thinking and that at least in the final stages of the encounter i was being observed which made me very, very uneasy. in the end, after a couple minutes of watching me watch them i proved uninteresting to them and they went about their other business. i was astonished that no one else seemed to have had this experience or reported the lights ... but to be truthful i am not sure if others reported sightings to authorities or not.  it was about this time that police officers reported a ufo landing in the newtown industrial commons maybe 7 miles north of where i was.  i think the two are related. i refrained from reporting what i had seen because it seemed so unreal to me at the time, even though i knew i had experinced the event.  i was convinced that it was possible to have been a kind of hallucinagenic stress related fantasy because i was under a lot of stress at that time in my life ... but it appeared quite real when it happened.  i think it did happen so after all these years i want to get it on record.\r\n\r\ni have no means to do a computer aided map of the event and movements but i could draw it and send it snail mail if you requested it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

in the next town over. ( i had a sinus infection. ) my appointment was at 8:30pm. being that it was wintertime, it was already pretty dark. we left our house at 8:03pm and drove west down the road we lived on, onto a road called lehigh. on the left hand side of lehigh rd. was an un-farmed field with a small woods bordering it to the west and south west, if i have my directions straight. ( the woods are probably about 150 yards from the road. )  there are a few homes on the right side of the road. we were riding in a ford van ( like a church bus ) with windows all around. i was in the second row of back seats. i looked over toward the woods and saw a bright object over the tree- tops. it was bright yellow- almost white and although i couldn't see anything but the glow, it looked very solid. what i mean is, it was not like a reflection in the window but something really there. it was like a little disc- shaped sun. it moved back and forth over the treetops horizontally. the movement was fast but very smooth. it moved as though it could stop on a dime and instantly be moving in the opposing direction. this whole time we were still traveling down the road at about 30mph. surprisingly my mother did not appear to see it. and as we moved past it and out of view i dazedly said \" hey, stop. \" my mother kept driving to the next stop sign about 20 yards down the road. then she stopped and asked me what the matter was. i told her to go back because i saw something and she asked me what i saw. i told her to never mind, lets just go. though it was a surprise to see the object, for some reason i felt like the whole thing was nothing exciting. by the time i had gotten home from my appointment i had forgotten all about it. i remembered it later that night but it wasn't a big deal and i didn't talk about it to anyone. sometimes i wonder if my mother did see it but had the same odd \"move along, nothing to see here\" reaction that i did. it was a few years before i really took any interest in my personal experiences. this was triggered by seeing other objects in the sky and having a long rash of unsettling dreams.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

was casually scanning the night sky as i usually do, watching the aircraft coming to and from from o'hare and midway. i noticed two reddish-orange pulsating lights coming over the horizon, beyond the trees, from the northeast, that immediately struck me as unusual because they were a reddish-orange, rather than white as commercial aircraft lights usually are, but i thought perhaps they were just different colored wing tip lights, and that maybe they looked colored because of the flight path towards me. when i first noticed them, they appeared to be about a handspan apart, then, as i watched with increasing amazement, they came closer together. my next thought was i was that i was watching private aircraft that for some reason were coming dangerously close. at that point, my wife came down the street to our house, and i ran out onto to the front porch (temperature outside was about 23 degrees)and frantically waved at my wife to get out of the car (she had pulled part way into the driveway), gesticulating wildly to get to her to look up to the northeast. she joined me on the porch, as 4 more pulsating lights appeared over the horizon, again ranging from a yellowish red to a reddish orange, with three of the lights spaced equidistantly on a diagonal, with the fourth, brighter \"larger\" light at the bottom of the diagonal and an arms' length from the three.  as my wife and i watched, the three lights on the diagonal moved closer together, and then the \"top\" light began to dim, finally disappearing altogether. the other two lights dimmed, and then disappeared. however, the fourth light kept coming towards us, getting somewhat brighter. i ran back into the house and got our binoculars. my wife and i both observed the light through the binoculars, and it appeared to be a solid, glowing, reddish-orange orb. no aircraft light triangulation, no blinking lights. it moved somewhat slowly and deliberately until it appeared to  be nearly over our house, and then disappeared, in that the light dwindled in apparent size and intensity and then appeared to blink out. the skies were partly cloudy, but clear over our house, with a crescent moon to the southwest, behind us and not visible in the section of sky we were looking at. the lights all seemed to move at approximately the same speed, which made me think initially i was watching aircraft flying in formation, and strangely occupying the same airspace at the same time. my wife, who is a veteran air traveler, agreed with me that what we saw were not commercial or privaate aircraft. and we both have seen meteors (perseids) at night,which have a downward trajectory, and these lights moved too slowly and deliberately on an apparent upward trajectory, to have been a series of meteors streaking across the sky. we're hoping to hear something on the news or in the paper, and hoping to hear that others in naperville saw the same thing. i was very excited after seeing these aerial phenomena - it reminded me very much of the scene in close encounters of the third kind when the people gather on the hillside and watch the \"lights\" moving gracefully in the valley below.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

sudden, the dome of the room opened and revealed that we were drifting in space.  i could clearly see planet earth from my position.  they said that they had chosen me to be the bearer of tidings to our race, that there is another people similar to ours that have come to help us.  they said that they have been on our planet for around 10 years or so.  they are one of the few survivors of a planet thats history started around three million years before ours.  they created ships that could sustain them for many years, but also created a super weapon that detonated before most of the planets inhabitants could escape.  they are very similar to us, though they have been unable to reproduce on our planet, due to bad environmental conditions.  they also have a life span around five times longer than ours, though many of them have died as their immune system was unready for some of our diseases.  they ask that we help them find a way to seproduce in return for helping aide our politicians from making the same mistakes that cost them their planet.  i once again blacked and then found myself in my room when i regained conciousness.  i pray that we can help these peaceful

i was lounging in the pool! i was floating on mattress so at first i thought nothing of it! then it started moving in even stranger patterns! comming in closer! then going back up higher! movement was nothing! like a plane or helicopter! even considered it may be a stearman plane as we do have several local guys who fly these types! they said no! so my fiance started teasing! and it ticked me! because it would come in close when i was alone! and act weird! but not when i would call him to look at! had dogs in the yard and they would be watching it! and growling! acting weird too!I would get weird feelings of electricity when i was in the water! hair standing up!  so....That christmas we get a new video camera! and the following summer 2006! i got several different shots of it on tape! and i saw it several times through the winter months! but to cold to stand and video! i still have the tapes! i wouldn't tape over them!Soon after taping! the camera's battery started acting up!Thought i had screwed it up or something!  so i bought new battery! worked fine for a very short time! no problems! then orb came back later in the summer of 2006 taped it again! camera!~ battery would go low really fast and just shut off again!! i'd charge it again!It worked fine! when i used it to tape the dogs and granddaughter! then it came again! so i go get camera! and try to tape and again  the cam would just shut off! even when i new the battery was charged!So i went inside andthe camera would work fine! so then had some friends over!For a barbique and again there it was! so i asked them what they thought. we laughed and threw ideas around!Andthen  she said that they were coming back to abingdon from gilson, il. which is east of here! just outside knoxville!  and that when they were out side of town here just out side of tiny town call delong! that is about 4 miles from my back yard!Our house is located on the back side of abingdon, and they saw it moving strangly in the sky over abingdon! and she said she told dave that it looked like it was right over our house from where they were located in delong!!And dave said to her! i wonder if bailey can see it! and they laughed about it! but they thought that it was very strange! joking!!Not knowing that i had seen it a bunch of times! she also said that they had seen it several other times before that.When they were on the delong blacktop! so i know at least that i wasn't the only one that saw it!Don't know why it would hang around here! we are a tiny rural community! where nothing happens!But if you want to video it ! come on down! also! i still have 1 maybe 2 of the recordings that i made! it comes regular & i just stopped trying cause the camera goes dead!  i had so much photage!Didn't think i needed to keep all of them!If you would like i can send them to you! you can see what you think!Maybe you can tell me!I would explain it as a very large! shiney ballbearing!The way that it shined it looked like a silver glass  yarg globe! just like a huge ballbearing! my camera only zooms so far!And it would be very large in the camera! if it was as far up as a star! my camera couldn't zoom in on it! i am not crazy! and it comes around often! and it has been happening regular for 3 years! come on down! and check it out!Would love to know what it is!I don't have a cord that will allow me to send the

located in the city of santa rosa, in the province of laguna of the country, the philippines. the reason i was walking is to get to the nearby hobby shop to play trading cards and maybe some console games. \r\n\r\nthe sky at that moment was pretty cloudy, although patches of cloudless sky can be seen, and sun, while setting, is partially visible. i first took notice of the object while i was trying to scan my current surroundings. \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw it, i thought it was a jet aircraft, since at first it has a jet stream, and the stream it left was really visible . what baffled me is that as it flew further, the jet stream it had produced has seemingly dissipated, although it still produces it, as if it was some kind of fragment. that baffled me because, of what i know of, jet streams produced by aircraft that produce them do not dissipate in a few moments, and, it didn't seem to resemble any conventional aircraft that we have . i also thought that it was a meteor, but it didn't seem to streak rapidly like one. i also thought it was a comet, since it characteristics are somewhat near to those of comets, but there were no announcements whatsoever that a comet was passing, so i also checked that one out. \r\n\r\nthe object, seems to be round, and it gives a jet stream that dissipates rapidly, making it look like a comet or a meteor. its movement is not erratic, it only moves straight in one direction. it seems to move toward the magnetic north or northwest, although when i saw it, it was in the east because the sidewalk i was walking is facing west. although i cannot estimate how much, it was fairly high, but not high enough as it seems to pass through the clouds. \r\n\r\ni was fairly excited when i saw it, since i'm interested in ufos. i was able to take a picture of it with my cellphone, a nokia n70 with a 2 megapixel camera. it disappeared for a while due to cloud cover and the limited visibility at the sidewalk because it was near a wall. i tried chasing it by running towards the subdivision gates, as the sidewalk leads to the gates. after the sighting i showed the picture to my friends at the shop when i reached it.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object when it reached some distance, and due to the limited visiblity of the location, even when i got out of the subdivision gates and into the main street, i just lost sight of it, and i think it disappeared into the clouds.\r\n\r\nin my opinion, there is a high probability that the object i saw is identifiable, although up until now i still do not know what it is. thank you.\r\n

school) and hwy 321 which goes to dayton (about 25 miles away).  we saw a star. it got brighter and brighter until it was a triangular object over my friend's pickup.  i didn't think of ufo, or anything strange, i just said to my friend, \"damn, if that was an airplaine it would blow us off the road\" (it seemed that close overhead.)  later, i started reading articles in the houston enterprise of a family in dayton who got radiation poisoning when they had an incounter with a ufo.   unsolved mysteries did a bit on this (the tv show).  they blamed the air force and sued them.  according to unsolved mysteries, the air force tore up the road where the thing landed and hauled it away.  i have no first hand knowledge of that.  after reading the paper shortly after, i just remember thinking, \"hey, that could have been us!\"  i remember that the \"star\" first appeared in one direction, then appearred as a triangular object with different colored lights on each side, the quickly sped away, again appearing as a bright star in the direction of dayton. this was in about 1980, give or take a year.  \r\n\r\nfor some reason this part of texas is like a beakon to ufos i think, though i don't know what they are.  in the 1970s several times my grandmother while sitting on the front porch at night would tell me about \"something which looked like the full moon that lit up the whole front porch\", and my great-aunt who lived across the pasture would also confirm this.  neither of these women had probably even heard of ufos.","distance":"20 Feet or
