younger brother and our next door neighbor. i was about 14 years old at the time. it was midday with a clear blue sky with high puffy white clouds and good visibility. we all observed and object that looked almost like a piece of wood (like a 2 x 4) in color and shape. this object appeared to be about 5 to 7 feet long and it was revolving around it center axis in a horizontal plane. the revolutions were slow (maybe 8 to 10 per minute)and it was not making any sort of noise. there were no lights or any variations in it color or any sort of markings. the object appeared to be about 50 to 75 feet above the ground and well below any clouds in the sky. the object appeared without warning and moved in a straight line at a constant height above the ground. i would estimate it's speed at 10 to 12 miles per hour. we three boys found the object very strange and started to chase it to see what it might be. it it moved in a northeasterly direction and we vollowed it for several minutes until we got into some thicker woods and could no longer keep up with it's speed. we did not experience any adverse effects from this experience and there was no sense that the object detected our presence. we never heard anything more about this sighting and never saw it again. i have never talked to anyone that saw a similiar object at that time or since. i would like to know if this type of object has ever been reported by others or in the western pennsylvania region?","distance":"21-100

to establish a foundation for the ufo sighting, i would like to establish the circumstances for the sighting.  my wife and i live in the southeastern section of indianapolis.  we have a business in nashville, in, about 45 miles south of indianapolis, in.  we take the same route to and back from nashville, using highway 135.  we���ve had our business in nashville for over two years now.  \r\n\r\nduring the winter hours, some days while driving back to indianapolis, it has already turned dark, depending on when we leave nashville.  we have never before, saw or looked for, anything unusual as our minds are never focused on ufos but ordinary business concerns or listening to talk radio.  \r\n\r\nthis evening, not unlike many evenings in central indiana during the early winter, it was dark and raining.  there was a fair amount of traffic in both directions and it is a two lane highway.  as we were driving north toward indianapolis, at about 20 miles south of indianapolis, a few miles south of bargersville, off to our left, about 800 to 1000 feet west of us and about the same distance in the sky, we suddenly noticed a extremely bright, flashing strobe-like light, flashing about once a second in the dark rainy sky.  my first thought and comment to marilyn was that it must be one of those microwave towers as i knew that a few miles ahead near bargersville, they had some microwave towers that we���ve observed during the daylight hours.  \r\n\r\nas we were driving northward on h135 about 60 mph, we soon approached the east side of the flashing light which was now directly west of us about 800 to 1000 feet in the sky and probably that far west of us.  however, instead of us passing it, it appeared to start pacing us at about the same speed.  there were no colored lights, just the one rather large, extremely bright strobe-type light that was bluish-white.   it was so extra bright that when it was flashing, it lit up everything on the ground in the direction of the object.  i was driving so i could only glance at the flashing object for a split second but marilyn was able to watch it for perhaps 30 seconds or more.  as she became more excited and astonished at what she was witnessing, the flashing object suddenly turned off to the left, heading west and disappeared.  \r\n\r\nwhile we were really puzzled as to what it was, i didn���t consider stopping at the time because of the traffic behind me and no real place to pull over.  it was only after this short experience that we were forced to conclude that it may have been a ufo because of the special characteristics of object.  we have concluded that it was flying too show to be an airplane and didn���t seem to behave like a helicopter.  this will remain a mystery for us.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

'of course it was not a ufo'. we speculated that the lights were from a light aircraft as we knew that there was a grass landing strip across the mudflats and we envisioned a cessna of something having just landed or was preparing for takeoff. as it got darker and the group of lights -some flashing, some constant - looked less like an airplane as we know it and we discussed a faint dome shape slightly above the lights but apparently slightly detached from them as i remember it. we debated the possibility that it was not an aircraft. i remember saying that \"if it's an  airplane that has landed, wouldn't the pilot have switched off the lights  by now and gone home\" and \"if he was going to take off, wouldn't he have done it by now?\". there was no noise. we were also discussing three separate lights which were not visible when we first saw the first light(s). these lights were to the north of the original light and were single white lights about the same intensity as a street light (although there were no street lights around at the time - probably aren't today either). i felt that they were also about the same height as a street light would be- and they were about 700 meters away initially. my brother began to ridicule myself and my friend over our continued interest in these strange lights. but we remained curious, particularly as they  seemed more unusual as the sky grew darker. repeatedly, leaving my brother behind, we walked out onto the mudflats to get a closer look and a wider angle look  than what was available at the campfire. walking out onto the mudflats allowed us to somewhat see past a small hill at the eastern end of our beach where we had set up camp. over time we noticed that the three small   'street light like' lights were making their way towards us (via the shoreline) while the original group of lights stayed put. we also observed on our second trip out on the mudflats, that when a car went by on the quiet country road behind where the lights were, they'd all dim out to such a point that you could no longer see them unless you had never taken your eyes off them. as such a car then drew away into the distance again, the lights grew back to their original strengths. we made our way back to campfire to tell my brother of our observations. he eventually reluctantly came out onto the mudflats to get a full view. he made the observation that: yes indeed the three smaller lights were making their way towards us. we were  able to demonstrate the truth about how all lights dimmed as a car drove by than grew back to strength as the car drew away. when he saw these things for himself he had a change of tone: \"it's time to get out of here\" or similar words. we ran across the mudflats. threw sand on the fire,  grabbed our push bikes and began to run up the hill to the main track  running from east to west along preces point. our imaginations allowed us to believe that \"they\" might be able to detect metal - so we ditched our push bikes. we got to the main track and ran about 50 - 100 meters eastwards. enough  to get us to a clear view of what we'd been looking at from on the mudflats, but also a clear view of the other side of the small hill that was  just to the east of our original camp fire. from here we could see where the original light(s) were. but they were there no more. i felt the three smaller lights also should be visible, going by where they were when we decided to flee. they were not there either, at least not in the same shape. what we saw from the top of the hill and almost straight below us about 30 - 60 meters away was a large white circular light, with clearly defined edges that did not seem to illuminate anything around it. it was glowing creamy white and had a matrix pattern across the top of it. the pattern was formed by areas that were not quite so brightly illuminated as the rest of the object. overall the matrix formed diamond like shapes that were not so large at the edges of the sphere / disk as they were towards the center of it (we were looking down on it). the total area was the size of a small house. beside this, and i guess about 7 meters from the big light were two other objects. they were almost rectangular in shape and were standing vertically along their long edge. they were rectangular except that they had 45 degree features at their four corners. they also had a diamond like pattern although it was consistent in size across their entire surface. the light that they emitted was consistent in colour and character to that of the larger round disk like / sphere like light except that they were pulsating. going on and off in synchronous with one another  except that when one was on the other was off. we looked at this all   and discussed what were seeing. it seemed like we could just stay here forever  and just watch what we saw! we talked about all the detail mentioned above and we contemplated throwing a rock on the disk like object. this  idea was rejected. we eventually fled the scene holding hands. days later  we saw news of the kaikoura coast(nz)ufo sightings which i understand got 5 minutes  on cbs world news.           \r\n

at a mostly blue sky with a few thin cloud formations a few miles off to the southeast.  the cloud formation was  fairly low, perhaps 2,000 feet off the ground.  \r\n\r\ni noticed the cloud formation appeared oddly shaped.   there was a semi circle of clear blue sky cut right through the middle.  the swath of blue sky appeared to be at least 20-30 feet wide and the diameter was approximately ��� mile.  it resembled someone taking a paint brush and painting the blue sky semi-circle through the thin layer of cloud.  i was wondering what could cause it and it was a fairly windy day.\r\n\r\ni noticed what at first appeared to be a plane approximately 200 feet below the cloud layer moving steadily off to the west.  from my position it appeared somewhat large for a plane at that distant.  i mean it would have taken a softball sized object to obscure it from my view.  that would make it appear at least 4 inches long from my position.   i would estimate the object being 75-100 ft long.   \r\n\r\nsince it looked out of place/oddly shaped, i concentrated on it for a few seconds.  it was a metallic in color that shown brightly in the afternoon sun.  it gave off no noise nor did it display a vapor trail. it had what appeared to be a rudder both forward and aft.   \r\n\r\nsince it was moving steadily to the west, it was moving out of sight due to the roof overhang.  i got up from my chair and walked about 6 feet down the steps to get a more prolonged, clear, view.  there was nothing but clear blue sky in the direct the object was moving.  when i got down the steps (only about 5 seconds later) the object was gone!  i mean if it had been a plane it would surely be flying steadily west toward the afternoon sun.  \r\n\r\nwhat was real odd was the cloud with the semi-circle and the fact the object disappeared from its fairly slow flight into clear blue sky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),

a cigarette. i happened to look up as i am always aware of my surroundings, my wife and i noticed a strange object flying fairly low almost right above the tree tops it was. this object was almost gliding across the sky and as i recall it had a total of 4 visible lights on the bottom of it....3 of the lights were identical and on one was on each of the corners of the triangle they appeared to be similar to landing lights but with a strange glow to them, and were definately not flares as i was an infantryman for the us army and have extensive knowledge of flares. in the middle of this object was a sort of blueish circle/bubble and to the naked eye it seemed somewhat distorted almost a blur. the object proceeded in a straight line over the tree line, across the front yard and then over our heads and then over the house with only a faint roaring noise which could have been from commercial jets or some kind of fighter jet from lrafb, i have noticed more and more reports within the last few years from arkansas and firmly believe that it was man made and not of alien origin....My theory is and will be until proven otherwise that perhaps the 1947 case was a downed/crashed ufo from another world and was then reverse engineered by our government in secret, and i believe now that the government has at least 3 to 4 different models of these strange craft and have had since the early to mid 1950s, i was in the military as an infantryman and have worked under \"sierra\" (secret) conditions with the m1126 (stryker) in developmental stages and the land/mounted warrior program which the army claims to have killed yet my buddies in iraq are the only unit in the army that possess this technology and are actively using it? government cover ups are a real thing and always will be. i unfortunately have no photos of this object as it was a rather quick event and my wife and i just sort of couldn't take our eyes off of this magnificent object. i have chosen to remain anonymous

objects blinking lights its shape is.........Two parallel long rods are interconnected by two bridges. one rode blinking with red light and another with green. \r\nthen we all think that.. \r\n1. if

seen this in august 2007, me n my wife and suryakant were with me.\r\nnow i am doing ph.D microbiology and my wife  m.Sc microbiology, n suryakant is b.Sc math, physics chemistry.\r\nlast time we all seen that this object was flying over the forest of our village. this was the rainy season and lightining in clouds was there. in the background of lightining clouds this object was seen clearly from approx. 500-600 meter distance. shape was not so clear, but it must be an object have a size. next day it again seen 9:30 pm then it comes very close to the village and as ever wandering over the village.\r\nnow i am going to purchase a digital camera then will took some clear photographs then i will send some pictures to mufon.\r\nthanks\r\narvind","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8556,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.635308,"location":null,"logNumber":"IN-12062007-0001","longitude":77.22496,"occurred":1187926200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Delhi","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1187926200000,"summary":"A

would have. no one was around.The sky was completly silent. the orb kept its size and shape. it went up then curved forward and disappeared. i know it wasn't a firework and i have no other answer to

from deer hunting in the pierre-marquette forest.\r\nwhile traveling n. on 140th ave. approximately 1/4 mil before reaching 19 mile road.\r\ni had just crested a hill in an open area of hay fields, when i noticed  directly in front of me and about a mile away,  what could best be described as a huge strangely illuminated ,glowing, triangular object in the sky just below the cloud ceiling. the outer perimeters of which appeared to be illuminated (mixture of pale, satiny white, greyish white,  ) with the center of the object semi  transparent and the same color as the sky. it actually looked like the sky was in the center of the triangle somehow.  (like a glowing  pool ball rack)\r\n\r\nthe object was moving from west to east, and was only visible for a few seconds . i had to accelerate to get past a tree line in hopes of catching a glimpse of it again. i turned east onto 19 mile road and did not view it again until i reached an area of open power lines. at which time i only caught a glimpse of it .  i first overshot the power lines and had to brake and reverse to catch  a fleeting  glimpse as the rearmost  section of the craft  was swallowed up by the clouds. i could not hear any sounds but my truck was running at the time.\r\n\r\ni was shocked by the size of this object and my first thought was of possibly  some sort of object crashing into the earth. but quickly realized it was on a level trajectory and appeared to be under power. \r\ni must admit i was quite shocked and upset by what i had seen and tried to notify someone but kept getting recordings etc. so my brother who also had a sighting many years ago suggested i notify mufon while it was still fresh in my memory. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

grill and noticed helicopter noise to the southwest. i looked up and saw a helicopter about 1 mile away, between my home and the i-17 highway. i figured there was probably traffic or an accident and went inside to change. i went back outside with a tray of chicken and looked up at the helicopter again, except this time there was a bright triangular object hovering in the sky between the helicopter and my home. it was equal length on all sides and appeared to emit a strong yellow light. it was about the same size as the helicopter. it appeared to be at about the same altitude as the helicopter if not a bit higher. as i blinked several times to make sure i wasn't seeing things, it slowly rotated 90 degrees in place to face due west without a change in altitude. it then moved very slowly for about 2 seconds and then shot off at a rate of speed impossible to comprehend and disappeared. there was no vapor trail. there was no sound. the entire time the only sound i heard was coming from the helicopter. i have not reported this before for fear of ridicule as i am a doctor. i also know a thing or two about planes because my father used to be a pilot. i used to work just outside of luke afb and can tell you with 100% certainty that what i saw was not a military craft. it was not a plane, blimp, weather baloon, bird, hot air baloon, or helicopter. i am hoping that maybe someone else saw what i saw, maybe even the people in the helicopter, and post something regarding this incident.\r\ni felt like i was in complete disbelief when i saw the object. when it rotated in place i realized i was not looking at anything i have ever seen before and probably will never see again. i really wish someone else had been there with me to witness this phenomenon. i've told several people, mostly close friends and family, and the majority of them are fascinated by the story. but there are some who don't believe me, which i find upsetting because no reasonable, rational adult would make something like this up.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
