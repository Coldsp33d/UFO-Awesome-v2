many of you know, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the roswell ufo crash. it���s also the 30th anniversary of a lesser-known extraterrestrial encounter - between vrillon of the ashtar galactic command and television audiences throughout southern england.\r\n\r\nat 5:10pm on november 26th, 1977, the audio portion of a news broadcast was interrupted by a mysterious voice. the speaker identified himself as vrillon (or perhaps it was gillon, gramaha, or bramaha - the transmission contained static and was unclear). he claimed to represent the ashtar galactic command and he had a message for humanity.\r\nvrillon���s 5-minute message contained a plea for earthlings to lay down their weapons and live in peace with eachother and the environment, or else face certain doom. he encouraged people to seek inner truth so they could evolve spiritually. he also acknowledged that earth was being observed and visited by extraterrestrials, saying, ���we have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies. you know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your earth than your scientists admit.���\r\n\r\nvrillon���s message prompted thousands of worried calls to local television stations. according to a news report, police were called out to calm down frightened listeners, and the television network broadcasted messages of reassurance every half hour until the situation had eased.\r\n\r\nwithin days, the broadcasting authorities had released an official explanation: the transmission was a hoax carried out by students using inexpensive equipment and a car battery. vrillon���s reference to new age terminology, such as the age of aquarius, also evoked general skepticism among some listeners and investigators.\r\n\r\non the other hand, others were reluctant to discount the transmission as a youthful prank. no one ever came forward to claim responsibility for the hijacking. the authorities acknowledged that this had never happened before in great britain. independent experts concluded that five transmitters would have needed to be hijacked simultaneously to broadcast the message to such a wide audience - an incredibly complex feat to achieve in those days. a mandatory monitoring system was in place, but network engineers in two different locations failed to catch the interruption in the signal. there was also the hint of a cover-up, because the authorities would not release a tape of the full message to the public or the press (only the first 30 seconds of the message were released).\r\n\r\nufo contactees, starseeds, and new age practitioners would probably have recognized vrillon���s credentials. the ashtar command is an actual international - and, to believers, intergalactic - organization. its objective is consistent with vrillon���s message of peace and extraterrestrial assistance as we evolve spiritually.\r\n\r\nvrillon disappeared after that day and hard evidence has not materialized. a legitimate extraterrestrial message or a technically clever hoax, the broadcast hijacking incident remains a mystery to ufologists 30 years later\r\n\r\nthe tree of

getting ready to go in for the night and i notice my shadow and i turn my head to see where the lights coming from.. thought to myself, \"that's an awfully bright star i don't remember seeing one that bright before.\" so i watch it a little bit and then it begins to move south away from the lake.. by that time i knew it wasn't a star obviously so i flash my light at it. as soon as i did that it did a complete 180 and was coming my way, i said, \"oh sh*t\" what have i just done! it's approach was rather rapid and as it got close to me and i knew it wasn't going to stop until it reached me i got spooked and took six steps back. by the six step the object stopped.. it stooped as if it knew i didn't want it any closer. it was directly in front of me. during this time i noted two airlines flying way above the object and to me that confirmed this was something rather unique.\r\n\r\nthis craft had no sound to it the only things heard were the sounds of crickets and me saying, \"what in the f is this thing!\" the object was a greenish yellow color like i have never seen before. coming form the bottom were at times two to four beams of light that only went to a certain distance and stopped. at times these beams would rotate. one time they connected and the craft looked like a diamond.\r\n\r\ni moved out to the end of the dock to get a better look and as i did that the craft moved back keeping the same distance it had when i saw it from the beach area.\r\n\r\ni like that, a ufo that knows it's boundaries. kind of cool huh? :) after i got tired of looking at this from the dock. i moved to an area next door to me.. as i did that, with in 10 to 15 seconds the craft moved with me and was once again directly in front of me keeping that same distance.\r\n\r\nso i thought i'd try something. when a cloud went under it i would move again.. after the cloud past over the ufo came over to me again. keeping that same distance. the distance was just over cloud level. one time a cloud went under it and i moved and it shout out from the cloud. this thing was just wild.\r\n\r\nat one point the craft shot out this green beam of light that came down. half way between it self and the water. i took note that the beam of light did not reflect off the water. the light stayed for five seconds and then traveled back up to the craft. interestingly enough after the beam travel back up to the craft it left a kind of mist or residue i don't know what you would call it but it disappeared within seconds. this residue i speak of i just remebered it.. also i will admit i did feel slightly sick to my stomach that day. that's just something i took note of.. could be nothing but maybe something.. sick to my stomach as if i had a mild flue or you could i felt woozy or something..\r\n\r\nthis event lasted between 2.5 hours. it was daylight before it actually left.. it left after i had, had enough i guess.. i went and hid behind my neighbors house for a minute or two and when i came back it was gone.. it was like the craft was watching me as i was watching it.\r\n\r\ni have video and pictures of the craft. i'm sending you three of the pictures.. i'd like to know you think of the pictures. i want to try and enhance the others before i send anymore.. i also took video. this video seems like classic ufo footage..What i mean by that is while recording, the image in the lcd screen looks different then what i was actually seeing.. it's fuzzy or blurry i guess and it does have like a kind of black outlineing around the object.. these green beams i speak of aren't vissible in the video but they are in the pictures at times that i am glad for. i'm glad those beams are vissible in the pictures..\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this and it went for 2.5 hours. it was simply amaing. the lights it gave off i have never seen colors like that.. it was just incredible.. the video's the pictures, they don't give credit to what was seen.. but it does give a pretty good idea of it.. as they say seeing is believing...\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8542,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.4283319,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12032007-0010","longitude":-83.7338594,"occurred":1187831040000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1187831040000,"summary":"This

post this due to the improbable chance of this occurring within the short time period. however, i have.\r\n\r\nearlier in the summer or late spring, after many years of neglect, i rekindled my interest in listening to military aircraft communications. technology has brought many changes, however there is still opportunity.\r\n\r\nas i began to search for the aircraft i was listening to, i started watching the daytime skies with more frequency.\r\n\r\nearly on, quite by accident, i discovered that planets were visible during the daytime. i found this quite interesting. i have, in the past, spent much time watching the nighttime sky.\r\n\r\ni have never before seen anything terribly unusual.\r\n\r\nas the summer progressed, i spent 30-40 daytime hours with my binoculars watching aircraft. i discovered eight or so high-level flight-paths visible from my vantage point. additionally, dependent upon wind conditions, there are approach and departure paths viewable . three airports are involved for these paths.\r\n\r\nduring peak travel periods, it is not unusual to see 6-8 planes traveling at 'altitude' at any given time.\r\n\r\non this particular day, i walked to get the mail at curbside and decided to grab my binoculars from my car and spend a few minutes looking at aircraft. normally when i watch, i take a folding wooden chair out to sit in.\r\n\r\nmy observation is limited somewhat due to trees, however the nearest provides a nice shade from the sun to my south.\r\n\r\nin addition to aircraft, there are many birds-of-prey which are fascinating to watch.\r\n\r\nso, after a summer of daytime sky watching, the discovery of planets viewable and nothing else much interesting, this is what i saw.\r\n\r\n24 september 2007 nikon 10x25, 5��� binoculars no clouds were observed in the sky during the five hour period of observation. there was a light haze in the sky.\r\n\r\nobservation #1 12:30 while viewing what appeared to be a pair of dragon flies with my binoculars, i noticed an object in the background that was somewhat reflective although out of focus. i was looking directly overhead and without lowering the binoculars i immediately refocused onto the object.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared spherical, although due to the altitude, this is uncertain. the reflection on the object from the sun was not intense or bright. the reflection was more 'dull', almost a non-reflection. color was grayish.\r\n\r\ninitially, i thought that the object was stationary, however i realized that i was craning my neck further back to keep the object within view.\r\n\r\nthe object initially traveled in an east to west direction. it traveled about four inches (arms length) toward the west. the object then made a 90��� turn toward the north and i viewed it for an additional 1.5\" of travel. i moved slightly, less than one second, as the object passed behind the ac power service lines into my home. i was unable to locate the object after this.\r\n\r\ntotal viewing time was six-eight seconds.\r\n\r\ni am quite certain that i would not have been able to see this object without the use of my binoculars.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what this could have been.\r\n\r\nobservation #2 12:40 having seen the previous object 10 minutes earlier, i was focusing my attention in the same general area of the sky. that being directly overhead.\r\n\r\nwithout the use of binoculars, i noticed a brief flash or reflection of light. once again, directly overhead.\r\n\r\ni immediately brought my binoculars up and into focus and was able to follow the object as it traveled.\r\n\r\nit's path was in a north direction. it traveled about 20\" (arms length). the object was a definite cylindrical, rectangular or oblong shape. it was light in color and after the initial bright reflection overhead, it did not appear to be highly reflective.\r\n\r\nas the object traveled, it appeared to be tumbling and or rotating, not quite end-over-end. i was able to see dark areas on the rather light colored object as it 'tumbled' indicating to me that these were shadows produced by the movement.\r\n\r\ni was able to view the object's entire path which lasted six-eight seconds at which point it simply faded from view.\r\n\r\nthe diameter or width of the object appeared to be about 1/7th it's length. the length was approximately 1/3 the size of a full sized aircraft flying at a 35,000 - 38,000 foot flight level at a 45��� elevation.\r\n\r\nthese estimates are highly questionable due to the altitude and short duration of observation.\r\n\r\nmy best guess as to what the object could have been, is that it could be one of many rockets or boosters that are in a decaying orbit overhead. i am not certain if it is possible to actually see shape in these objects as they travel through the daytime sky ? an online attempt was made to determine if there were any of these rockets / boosters in orbit at the time in question, however there are so many objects that it appeared to be a futile attempt.\r\n\r\nobservation #3 13:35 again, directly overhead, an unaided observation of a flash or reflection was seen. i immediately, brought my binoculars up and into focus.\r\n\r\nthe object was traveling in a south - north direction.\r\n\r\nit seemed to have form of a typical plane or a 'plus'(+)shape. it seemed to have form on the ends of the + shape. it was far too high to be able to maintain a steady view through the binoculars. the object was not highly-reflective as it traveled. it did not spin or rotate.\r\n\r\ni was able to watch the object from it's position overhead for approximately 10 seconds. during this period, the object traveled about 30 inches (arms length) until it traveled behind a tree about 200 feet from my position. i lost sight at an elevation of about 35-45���s.\r\n\r\nin comparison, a high flight-level plane at an elevation of about 60 degrees to my north, travels about eight inches (arms length) in a period of 35 - 40 seconds. at this distance and altitude, the shape of the plane is quite discernible and not in question! this object was high and traveling very fast.\r\n\r\nafter contemplating this object for some time, it suddenly occurred to me that it was probably the iss. a quick check determined that the iss was traveling at this time over southern south america.\r\n\r\ni have no solid idea what this object was. again, i'm not certain of the ability to see form in objects that are in low earth orbit during the daytime.\r\n\r\nobservation #4 16:00 i noticed a bright point of light in the south eastern sky at about a 45 degree elevation. raising my binoculars, the object appeared to resemble a planet as viewed during the daytime with binoculars. there was some form to the object and it resembled a large balloon. it appeared that there was some sort of appendage on the lower side / bottom of the object. due to my movement however, this is uncertain.\r\n\r\nthere was a gradual movement that seemed to be toward the nne. travel was about three inches (at arms length) in a period of about four-six minutes. after this movement, the object began a gradual movement in a ese direction. object was in view for approximately an additional 15-20 minutes until it reduced to a very fine point of light and i was unable to relocate the object after taking a 'movement break' for a few seconds.\r\n\r\nat this point, depending upon actual altitude,the object would most likely have been over western central nj.\r\n\r\nalthough interesting, i assumed that due to the duration, altitude and travel of the object, that it was most likely a weather balloon. i had never seen one.\r\n\r\nnational weather service(nws)indicates that weather balloon flights are able to last in excess of two hours and travel about 125 miles. altitudes attained can reach 115,000 feet. balloon releases are normally scheduled at 00:00 and 12:00 utc with exceptions for additional releases for specific storm concerns. the diameter of the balloon at it's bursting point can be as wide as 20 feet.\r\n\r\nas a footnote to these events, at 17:15, i saw a bright lime-green balloon with a curly tail rise above the treetop about 200 feet from my location. it began it's northward travel and i watched with and without binoculars for about 12 minutes until it became non-viewable.\r\n\r\nthis added some perspective to the preceding events of the day.\r\n\r\nagain, after spending the amount of time i have this past summer watching planes, i find it improbable to have witnessed these four objects in a single day. it did none the less, happen.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8541,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.1386111,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12032007-0009","longitude":-75.1913889,"occurred":1187938800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1187938800000,"summary":"Four

were sitting in our bedroom when my girlfriend saw a blue light shine in the room, the diameter about the size of a bottlecap, we heard noises like a mechanical rumble, it didnt sound distant like a plane or helicopter, her dog was whimpering outside so i went to let her in, when i came back i heard banging and shuffling outside her basement window, my girlfriend and i looked outside assuming it was some animal, then she saw something strange in the sky, it looked like a star was changing colors, then it started to move and it seemed to turn around, then we saw it was like a short blimp shape, with what seemed to be a narrow blue light emmiting from a flexable almost elephant trunk looking hose,we were freaked out when we saw this because we saw the same light shine through our window,we then saw narrow beams of blue light shooting upwards towards the sky from this object and narrow beams of green and red flashed downwards from it, it was doing this for about 15 minutes and it was moving very quickly in circles, after that it vanished completely then reapearred as if further away several seconds later, it was not emitting any rays of light this time it stayed a solid red and white color, it stayed reapeared for only a moment, about 15 seconds before it vanished for a second time, after this we heard and saw nothing for the rest of the night, we were freaked out because i was wondering what the noises were outside her basement window, there was no way that was a sattlelite because we saw the outline and it was no more then about a football field away, it made no noise other then the mechanical rumble which lasted only a few seconds,and if it was military related, why would they send \"lasers\" upwards? and downwards? satelite signals are not visible,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The date and time are approximate.  i just remember it being winter and late at night.\r\non said night, a friend and i were driving home from a party.  i decided to let my friend drive my car on the gravels since he didn't have a license yet and needed some practice before taking the test.  we drove north out of ute and decided we had taken a wrong road.  we pulled into a cemetary lane to turn around.  when my friend place the transmission in reverse the car died.  this is something that has never happened before or after the incident.  my friend was a bit weirded out, being superstitious and the car died on him in the cemetary! he relaxed for a second then started up the car.  \r\nwe turned back to the south and at the first intersection made a right and traveled west up the road and stopped at the top of the hill.  i asked him to stop so i could get out and relieve myself.  when i got back in the car i decided to put a new tape in (i owned a car made in 1988). and thats when things got really weird.  the radio wouldnt stop scanning and there was no sound. odd. i looked over at my friend who was still in the driver's seat. \r\n i tried to open my mouth to ask 'know anything about car stereos?', but i was interrupted when he put up his hand.  he was sitting forward up against the wheel, glaring into the sky.  i looked forward, then looked up.  i couldn't beleive what i saw. something very large, low flying, and what i would call fairly slow flying began blocking out the stars and moving out in front of the car. it took up about 3/4 of my front windshield. it was flying almost due west.  we both just watched silently in total awe.  this thing was clearly not a normal aircraft.  it had an extrememly wide wingspan. i dont recall it actually having wings, just being very wide across and a bit shorter than width from forward to aft. it had several blinking lights to include red, orange, blue. no green. no beacon.  the lights flashed in a strange order. as a matter of fact i couldn't even make out a 'firing order' of the lights.  after we watched this thing move out farther west than hwy 141 (the hwy turns north for a bit just outside of ute), something green came down from it.  at first i thought, 'okay its a commercial aircraft dumping its lavatory'. but wait. it can't be that.  it's glowing in the night sky. last time i heard, that green slime in an airplane lavatory doesn't glow in the dark. the object slowly moved out of sight continuing westward. it was then that my friend finally was able to speak. 'jesus christ did you see that?' suddenly the tape i had put in began playing.  and we decided to go home.  \r\n i have since served almost 5 years in a career that deals with aircraft of all kinds.  i've seen them all at night, during the day, during twilight hours. most of the time i see them from afar approaching the runway.  i have never seen anything like what i saw that night.  the experience is something that i have been able to remember in great detail just because it was so awesome.","distance":"101-500

stationary for about 1 minute and then it dissappeared. i have seen meteors and it as not this. we were heading east and the light as to the north. it was about 30��� in the sky. please note this stayed stationary. then just winked out. mars was to the east of us slightly to the north. it was appriximately 5 to 10 times bigger than mars. also, there were no clouds in the sky (check the radar for this). i am 37 and i am a quality engineer. i spent 6 years in the army and i am not prone to \"seeing things\". i had my 14 year old son and a friend of his in the car as well. in addition, my 10 daughter was in the car. i pointed this light out to them and we all watched it! i have lived in the country and i am an amature astronomer. this as not a plane! i want to remain anonymous. however with my military training and my profession in quality, i tried to capture as much information as i could and present this to you. i hope in some small way that this helped. on another note, when my wife was driving the kids to school this morning, she and both of my children witnessed 2 white lights (in roughly the same direction as the orange light) in the sky dissappear.
