suddenly & got out of bed.  i walked over to my dresser where there were 3 white, bald humanoid creatures that were about as tall as i was.  i wasn���t scared, just curious.  the main guy was standing closest to me & the others were behind to the side him.   he motioned to the dresser where there was a large bottle of pills tipped over & spilt out onto the surface.  there was no speaking involved, but i knew he wanted me to take a pill.  i refused & he insisted again.  at this point i became very afraid & turned to open bedroom door which was a few feet to my right.  i ran toward the door, but was blocked in the doorway.  now i was so frightened, i could see the brightly lit hallway just a few feet away & the stairs.  i tried again & was still resisted.  the third time i broke through & ran downstairs to my mom.  i still remember this incident vividly & wonder what would have happed if i���d taken a pill & how did i eventually get through the door (was there something or someone protecting me).  i wondered if it had been a dream, but the fact that i ran out & downstairs & remembered going back to bed after being downstairs was unusual to me - unless i���d been dreaming & sleeping walking.  after that night i was intrigued & terrified of ufos & aliens.  i was afraid that et would come & get me & if battlestar galactica was on i���d close my eyes so i wouldn���t see the bald aliens.   i had many dreams about ufos landing in my yard & a particularly freaky dream of a typical gray peeking in my window (which has access from a rooftop).  the second part of this story came in approx. 1999, when i jokingly asked the family at thanksgiving dinner if anybody had ever seen a ufo.  my older brother, who is a big serious guy said that he had seen a ufo when he was about 15 yrs old.  he saw it out his bedroom window (which was in the front of the house, mine in the back) & it was about a block away.  i asked him if he was serious & he was - he doesn���t make things up & especially about something like this.  i had never told anyone about my incident until 2000 & never told my brother.   every night i was terrified until maybe 16 or 17 yrs old when i knew so deep within myself that i didn���t have to be afraid anymore.  i don���t believe i was ever ���abducted��� & am not sure about the whole aliens from another world concept, but do believe there are many things in this world, universe & dimensions that we don���t have a clue about.  i am a medical professional in good health & come from a loving & stable family.  i have always liked the bible verse ���he has given his angels charge over you to guard you in all your ways��� .  now that i think of it, it���s still written on the attic door that was right near my room at my parent���s house.  also, now that i remember i did have nightmares when i was young - many were about something coming out of the dark & i���m cowering in the corner of my room & trying to scream, but can���t.  but i know that nightmares are common in childhood & sleep is a strange phenomenon & can generate situations & feelings that seem real, but aren���t.  that���s why i���ll never really know if all that i went through was just in my mind or was a real, physical event with mysterious creatures.  i���m a seeing-is-believing kind of gal & super practical, but like the idea of the strange, unusual & unknown.  now, i have the x-files theme song in my mind���\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8500,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.7638081,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11292007-0003","longitude":-88.441006,"occurred":422953200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":422953200000,"summary":"An

in the marsh just across the bayou (bienvenue). i thought the marsh was on fire, but it wasn't. the glowing object rose to about 100 or so feet and hovered there for several minutes. the object had a metalic appearance in the color of silvery blue. there was no noise coming from the object. the outter rim of the disc at it's middle changed colors from a gold to blue to red at random moments. the disc stood quite motionless and never wobbled. after approximately 15 minutes, the disc sped upward and north toward lake pontchatrain which was only about 4 miles away. its' speed was incredible, something i have never seen before and it came to a standstill over the lake as quickly as it had sped away from the marsh. after a couple of minutes the disc again sped away moving upward and toward the west until it was out of sight. i have always been a skeptic of u.F.O. s and until that moment i was. there is no doubt in my mind that the disc was vehicle that was being controlled by someone or something. it was also far more advanced than anything we or any other country have. i didn't see any little green men or any other color, but i know what i saw and i know it was real. i was fully awake, sober and not in the least interested in seeing anything other than fish.\r\n\r\nthere are times when i wish i had never seeen the disc. people tend to ridicule things they don't understand or accept. there are also many times when i am grateful for the opportunity. i have become a more open minded individual, not so easy to reject what others might have knowledge of. i feel a part of a much larger universe than the one i knew before the sighting and that's a good feeling, a belonging feeling.\r\n\r\nwe have much to learn from whom ever these visitors are. i hope that one day they will share their knowledge so that perhaps my grandchildren or their children might share in the wealth they have to offer.\r\n\r\nthanks for listening\r\n","distance":"21-100

south down m100 towards the highway and traffic was very light, almost none existent going down this stretch of road. a lot of the stores opened around 4am, some midnight, so i figured i missed a majority of the shopping traffic. about a good 3 miles before the highway i see a bright, bright, bright, huge white light low in the sky towards the direction i was heading (south). it was too big to be a planet, or a star, satellite, plane, or helicopter and it just sat there in the same spot the entire 3 miles i drove to get to the highway. i mean it didn't move at all. it stayed in the same exact spot. i take this road everyday, and this light was with out a question...Out of the norm.\r\nby the time i got to the highway bridge (i 96), this thing was just a huge beacon low in the sky. there was no way anyone could miss it because not only was it huge, it was low, very, very low in the sky. there wasn't a lot of traffic in this area, but there was some, and for the life of me i couldn't figure out why nobody was stopping their cars to look at this thing. i mean it was right there as big as life just sitting there in the air behind mcdonalds in an empty farm field not moving at all. with my camera ready that i pulled out of my purse, i wasn't taking the highway, even if i was going to be late for work, instead i went up one road and took grand river heading east. i made my left turn onto grand river and since that road was empty, no traffic, i didn't pull into the mcdonalds right there because of the parking lot lights, instead i drove past it to the edge of the farm field and slowed down onto the shoulder with my camera ready to go and there it was just sitting there in mid air. it was just a big, kind of oblong, bright, bright, bright while light. i was looking out my passenger window at it and didn't even get my car to a stop and this huge object just took off and started booking east, just like that, and that's when i seen it was a triangle as it got further from me. it was now heading in the same direction i was going (east) so i pulled back onto the road and sped up to try and catch it. it wasn���t directly over the road, but moving along right next to it on my right side. this triangle was so low, and just so huge in size i was half expecting it to take a couple tree tops out. now i'm driving down grand river after this thing, watching it through my windshield, but i just wasn't fast enough to catch up to it. by the time i passed granger landfill i seen it move across grand river in front of me, still very, very low, now heading west. it dwarfed the oncoming cars headlights big time. if you were to take the flyin j���s building length wise and hang it over the road, that���s how big it was. 5 seconds later, when i got to fl yin' j's gas station it was gone. just like that it was gone. i looked everywhere, every part of the sky because it was a good clear, distance view all around. it was just gone. i just don't get why nobody else stopped? it was right there as big as life and nobody stopped. how could they have not seen it?\r\ni didn't get a picture or video. the camera was right there in my hand, but i was so busy just looking at it through my windshield and driving at the same time there just wasn't time. \r\nnote...There is a small national guard base in that area, so it may be one of their triangle craft's i seen, but then again i'm not sure if that base would even have those types of craft. \r\ni made a drawing, but it is weak in comparison to seeing the actual thing up close and personal.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

decided to head down stairs to do something else.  as i passed by the back patio window that faces north, i glanced outside.  in the northeastern sky i noticed this really brightly dual flashing object (much like the strobe light on the top of a school bus).  i watched it for several seconds to make out what it was and to determine it's flight path.  i couldn't.  it seemed to be hovering or moving directly away from me to give the appearance of hovering.  i asked my father who was still watching the wisconsin/duke game to take a look as well.  he came over and thought it was strange not to see any indication of red flashing wing tip lights like on a plane.  i stepped outside to get a better look and noticed another strange object in the sky further away that seemed to be descending rapidly from a much higher more due east position.  i almost thought this second object to be a falling star at first glance, but it didn't have a tail and didn't disappeared after several seconds. after watching it for several seconds it almost gave me the impression of a satellite, it was that dim and far away. it's trajectory was straight down.  it didn't seem to be in a free fall or burning up in the atmosphere as it descended, so my impression is that it was descending safely under it's own power.  this object had the same white flashing pattern but also had a dimmer solid white light as well.  it was the very dim solid light that reminded me of a satellite traveling across the night sky.  after several minutes, dad wanted the patio door closed so the cats wouldn't escape so i decided to come inside and get my digital camera to see if i could get some video.  when i went back outside, the objects had both disappeared.  this was approximately one to two minutes or less that i was inside.  it's a bit strange in another way because it was very clear outside and i can usually see up to 3 commercial jets at any one time using the same flight path (the same as each other, not either of the two objects) from o'hare heading east.  there was nothing else except these two objects in the sky during this time.  i went back out later and these commercial flights had again resumed at their normal (very high) altitude and flight paths.  note: dad suggested it might have been a helicopter, so this is the most likely explanation, but i thought i would pass this along and let you investigate further.  let me know your findings.  i am very curious.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

self-realization and enlightenment. i am now into\r\ntaoism & buddhism. i am also a little into remote viewing & remote\r\ninfluencing. i consider myself to be spiritual. my relationship to god\r\nis of primary importance in my life. i also have my bs degree in\r\nzoology/biology.\r\n\r\ni had a few out of body experiences while meditating many years ago.\r\n\r\nat 3:00 am on sat august 25, 2007 i had my first verifiable \"encounter\"\r\nwith something i never experienced before. while reading a book on taoism before bedtime, i was surprised that our cockatiel bird began his talking routine just before 3:00 am while in the total dark with a bed sheet over his cage like usual. he has never done this before. i thought that was odd, continued reading, then got into bed & fell asleep.\r\n\r\njust after i fell asleep i was abruptly & consciously aware of a higher pitched noise and a beam of 2 shades of green pulling what felt like only my consciousness, not my body, up and into a dimly lit domed room/place. i said to myself \"oh no, not again,\" then fought it and began to awake, it being hard to move or call my wife's name out loud. she was asleep upstairs.\r\n\r\nwhen i sat up fully awake at 3:00 am, the hairs on both arms & legs were standing up & i was pretty much in terror. i am age 50 and can't recall the last time my hair ever stood on end! my room was dark and as i sat there, i saw in 2 shades of green, what i describe as threads of green light everywhere that i looked in the room. i got out of bed, walked all over my 2 story house, didn't wake anyone up, looked out my front door, calmed down & went back to bed & fell asleep. i didn't tell my wife or daughter till that evening & believe me, that was a very difficult thing to do. it seemed so weird to even hear myself utter the description of what i went thru.\r\n\r\na few days later, my wife went next door & talked to the neighbor woman  about listing their house for sale, as the prior listing expired. she asked my wife if anything weird happened in our house at 3:00 am on 9/25. my wife said no. the neighbor then told her that at 3:00 am their home burglar alarm went off, \"went crazy,\" & a wind like a tornado rattled their windows, then the next morning, while washing their backyard patio, as they do every morning, they washed away a burnt dust, saying it was not dirt, it was some kind of weird burned dust or particles.\r\n\r\nmy wife came back & said to me \"you'll never believe what the neighbor just told me.\" my hair stood a little on end again when she told me the above. it was so cool to have my experience verified by my neighbor - that something really happened - that i wasn't dreaming or that i imagined it.\r\n\r\ni like astronomy, & star trek, but never read about abductions or ever thought much about it.\r\n\r\ni have heard weird sounds at night in bed coming from outside up above, kind of freaked me out, then feel asleep. i have no memory of anything happening. i love to take a mile walk several times a week after dark & pick out many stars by name - done that for years.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8489,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0922335,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11272007-0009","longitude":-117.435048,"occurred":1188036000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1188036000000,"summary":"Attempted

continuous nightly(after sunset)sighting experiences as of late.(1)8-10 months ago,the objects started as disc shaped it seemed.I had binoculars,but they were at such a distance,i couldn't make them out clearly enough.They had the blinking blue,red,green,yellow lights on them.I call them watcher's,as they are here practically every night at basically the same part of the sky.(2)beginning about 2 or 3 months ago,they changed to a purple gold twinkling diamond shaped objects.Directly in the center of them horizonally, is a slim black observation deck going all the way across.You can see an exact object like the one i seen on you tube by searching october 2007 ufo.Also lately,have been objects with white lights.The pattern of the white lights was: blink, blink blink blink, blink. some i have watched have dipped below tree lines slowly decending towards the ground.The other one's that travel a couple of thousand feet up in the air at one point seem to be going at a constant movement,will suddenly skip forward much quicker at intervals while it is flying.Truely,something strange is going on in the skies above us.Keep an eye out folks,we are not alone!                                                                    seen all of this with my sister most of the time on a wrap around porch of our raised house.We were ufo hunting.We still to this day keep feeling amazed to see these things continuing.My feelings are neither of fret or good.I hope they are good though.Thanks-----                            ","distance":"Over One

this is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before i start work in the area.  the sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds.  there was no wind.  the area is in the flight path of jets landing at orlando international airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south.\r\n \r\ni was staring out over the lake when i looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west.  at first i thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake.  the object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed.  as i examined it more closely, i could see that it was not a bird.  the object descended, and for a moment, i thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but i didn't see any evidence of a person beneath the object.  it stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the casselberry area.  despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight.  there are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away.  when it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - i'm not sure if the object actually changed shape as i watched it, or if i had misjudged its shape when i first noticed it.\r\n \r\na few strange things about the object:  it seemed to be flying low.  it was difficult to determine its exact shape.  it was completely silent.  it seemed big, but i was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference.  the moon was still visible in the sky - if i had to compare it to the moon, i'd say that it wasn't big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it.  also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it's possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view.\r\n \r\nmy only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon.  it seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending.  also, the shape seemed to be off.\r\n \r\ni'm wondering if anyone else saw this object today.  it flew towards a very busy road during morning rush hour traffic - highway 436 in winter park - when i lost sight of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

as to the date. the incident happened in hartwick township michigan between evart and marion. to be exact over what is now 80th ave., between hicks lake road and sunrise lake road.\r\nit was a clear, sunny, very nice day with few clouds.  i guess it was around 1600 hrs.  my dad called us older boys outside and made the little guys stay in the house.  out to the west of the house about ��� mile away or less were a couple of  saucer shaped , silver colored objects completely motionless in the sky above the tree line . i guess the altitude to be about 1,000 feet or less.  then suddenly i saw another come in from the south and join them in formation. then another . i honestly don't remember the exact number of ships total but they formed a group of several identical craft . they came in fast like a blur that became solid and visible to the eye. my guess is that they were decelerating from an extremely high speed.  \r\n\r\nmy dad handed me a pair of binoculars and i could see the craft very clearly.\r\ni remember seeing symbols and shapes on the side of one of the craft. i can remember a couple of the shapes being a triangle, a crescent, and what looked like saturn or a circle with a ring through it. the other symbols i have never seen before or since.  (i had 20/15 vision at the time). i was so fascinated with the symbols that i cant remember much more about the ships except they were metallic silver like stainless steel. i guess they were about 20-30 feet long and a smaller dome sat on the top. \r\n\r\nafter handing the binoculars back to my dad .  we watched them for a while longer and i just remember my dad muttering ���what the heck are  those?���\r\ni just thought at the time maybe we have some sort of secret weapons or something like that. then all at once they began to glow brightly the entire craft glowed like molten metal. then all at once they sped off faster than any lightning strike i had ever seen .  it was a blur going up and out  to the north. and they vanished in less than a split second. i  never told anyone about this until i became old  enough to realize that if i didn���t  tell anyone, this information would be lost forever.  \r\ni have never seen anything like this since.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Insignia","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":8484,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.8825231,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11272007-0004","longitude":-85.2308414,"occurred":77497200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":77497200000,"summary":"We saw several disk or saucer sheped craft silver metalic in color in broad daylight could  see words or symbols on sides  they were motionless then glowed like fire and sped off in a blur at extreme speeds.","tags":["saucer","triangle"],"timeZone":"America/Indianapolis","timeZoneName":"America/Indianapolis","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Marion/Evart, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:425967"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Topeka","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was waking home from work down 29th street (got off work around 9:00 p.M.  hour and a half to two hour walk). i was close to 29th and wayne walking west.  i saw the object fly above me about 50 feet up or less.  the trajectory was arched downward.  it flew in lower and disappeared behind the trees of shunga park (a large wooded park in topeka that i was walking beside)and seemed to land based upon the trajectory.  it was flying in a northernly direction.  it appeared to be approximately the length of a ford 350.  it was faintly illuminated in the center with a light that appeared to come from within and permiate it's casing.  more eye-shaped than oval.  appeared to be slightly wider than it was tall.  the prow and aft were not illuminated, nor were to port and starboard edges. just the center.  it seemed that the light was diffused by the casing.  it was a faint white light.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":8483,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0558235,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11272007-0003","longitude":-95.6890185,"occurred":1195891200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1195891200000,"summary":"Oval object that was illuminated with a faint light from within (front and back extended ends less illuminated.)","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Topeka, Kansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:425968"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2498}
