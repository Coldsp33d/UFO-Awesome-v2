(to dispute the obvious, there weren't and still aren't that many cop cars in all of ness county, and why would they be parked in a circle, off a dirt road, in a pasture?).  i observed these red flashing lights for several minutes, through the front glass of the tractor, until i came to a corner and turned east, then i observed the same thing in the same place out the side glass, as i was driving parallel to it.  it did not appear to move, other than the flashing of the lights, and i could not see any solid object, as it was nearly dark, all i could see was the lights.  i continued to watch until i went over a rise and drove out of view.  as i went around back to the north end of the field, my father was there to relieve me, and of course i told him what i had seen, and where.  we were out of view of the farmstead at this time, and i can't remember if we had to fuel the tractor or how long we were stopped there, but after some time, he took off in the tractor and i proceded to the road.  when i got to the road, i had the choice of going south and driving to within 100 yards (from the road) of what i saw, or going north and going home.....I went north, fast.  i was very frightened and feared for my life.  i asked my dad the next day if he saw anything, and the answer was no.  i never returned to the location of the lights to see if i could spot imprints, scorch marks, etc., partly out of fear, ignorance of trace evidence, and assuming that since my dad didn't see anything, it probably wasn't there anymore.\r\n   i am telling this story now, because of the program i saw about trace evidence, and maybe some of this evidence could still be there, after all these years.  i believe i can accurately estimate the location of what i saw because the trees are still there.  if you would like to persue this, or would like more information, i would be happy to help.  although i was raised in a rural setting, i have a b.S. degree in earth science and have been an air traffic controller for the past 20 years.  thank you for your time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8481,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4444607,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11272007-0001","longitude":-100.194855,"occurred":110349000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":110349000000,"summary":"Witnessed

more in a circular formation to left and 1 on the right flank between the first and second object, they looked like lightly glowing whitish grey ovals almos translucent like a jellyfish. said to my wife \"holy sh.. they are flying in formation look, look.\" there they were moving towards me in a stright line about twice as fast as a commercial jetliner from the ne to sw,  i observed them for about 6-8 seconds then i could not see them any more they were over the house. i ran downstairs and out back to the deck with the binoculars to try and track them. it took about 3 seconds to get out back, i could not see them i lost them in the moonlight, the sky was pretty clear, small puffs of clouds (clouds were travelling n the opposite direction of the objects). the moon was very bright and was in the westeern sky. there was no noise what so ever, if it was human aircraft 7 or more they would have made some kind of noise. i live a few miles from philadelphia airport and know what planes look and sound like, and where they were flying i have never seen any planes take that path and i lived here for about twelve years.\r\n\r\n1 no commercial aircraft travel in groups or formation\r\n2 there were no blinking lights or beacons\r\n3 no noise\r\n4 was not birds or geese/no wings or heads/ travelling too fast for birds and also most of the birds have already gone south for the winter and birds typically do not fly at night. \r\n5 i am an avid skywatcher every night it is clear enough i use my telescope or binoculars. i have seen other uexplainable events in the sky but nothing

and night of november 11,2007. working into the wee hours of the morning i was really tired and left my backyard office to go into the house and get some sleep. i happen to be walking into the house (roughly round 4:30 a.M.) but a light caught my attention as i stepped up on the back porch. i looked up at this light and it was very strange looking as i can���������t recall seeing anything like it before. the light was just hovering off in the distance toward the east. at first i thought it to be a star or planet or something of sorts but then i noticed even further that the entire skyline in that direction was totally blacked out. no stars, planets or moons or nothing. there appeared to be a high cloud cover which prevented all the other objects you would normally see at night to be obscured from vision. just that one light up there. so i thought to myself it���������s kinda odd that one star would show thru and not any of the others. then i happen to notice that the light i was looking at was getting brighter and then dimming again as in a pulse and it kept repeating, bright, dim, bright, dim. then i knew something wasn���������t right about this hovering object and went inside and woke up my wife. i told her about what i had seen and asked her to get the camcorder for me so i could film it. she got the camcorder for me and we both went out on the back porch to see this light. the object did not appear to move other than a slight rocking motion. but the bright, dim thing kept going. i pulled out the camcorder and shot about 4 minutes and 20 seconds of footage when i was just too tired and shaking to continue. there was no sound from the object. the only sound i recorded on video was passing cars on the hwy. i deleted the audio on my footage upload later so the file would be smaller for upload. but i went to the edge of the porch to get the best view and started video recording. my wife had seen ufo���������s before and she wasn���������t too thrilled about them so she went back into the house. this was my first encounter of a hovering, illuminating light. the skyline behind the object was completely dark. nothing else was visible in the video as a reference so i couldn���������t determine size, shape or movement. it appeared that the clouds had all reference points blocked. i couldn���������t even see the trees that were located to the left and right of the object in my line of sight. it was very dark. but i continued to record and zoomed in and out a few times to try to get a good shot of the object. i held the camera up about a 45 deg angle to record. it appeared to be hovering over a georgia power electric sub station which is just down the road from my residence. but it may have been farther away. i couldn���������t really tell without the reference points. i have no clue what the object was. i got tired of filming and went inside to go to bed. i layed down for about 20-30 minutes but couldn���������t stop thinking about it and went back to the kitchen window to check on it again. it was still there. i went to sleep and when i awoke round 12 noon on 11/12/07 it was gone. the video is posted on youtube:

falling from the sky but rather maintaining a course parallel to ours. it was fairly low in the sky, lower than a plane would fly. there is an air port pretty close to this area so out next notion was that it might be a plane in distress attempting to land at the air port. then the object passed over our car so it was now located on the right side of us, still driving north this is away from the air port and we quickly dismissed the thought that it may be a plane. now out of the trees in an more open view to our right it appeared to be just fire flying at least as fast as out car if not a little faster. there was no visible material to the object. no visible metal or rock just flames. once we go to route 70 we took a left hand turn and the object was still visible. we  took a right hand turn and parked in the parking lot of the aoh club and got out of the car and walked toward the back where the object was still visible. the object continued just past the back of the aoh and disappeared, it didn't fall or move up, it just disappeared. when we got home over the next couple of day i searched local news papers and news reports because i thought there would be some report of some sort of incident  related to this object. i found nothing, no plane crash no meteor, nothing related or indicating that anyone else had even witnessed this fire ball.

through it it was there,and no i'm not crazy,this ceiling was about 40ft above me.I could'nt help but be amazed at this and had a very calm demenore and was not scared or even felt confused.I was totally amazed and in awe of \"how was this happening\".Now since what i did after that really got me in trouble i willnot discuss this part,only in total anoninity.Then the most fasinating happened, first i looked to my right and saw the blueish almost nearly liquid type object coming from the direction of the river and got to about the end of the liquid ceiling and changed form to a flat type object and went at what looked to be a perfect 90% angle straight up.Whonce it hit the ceiling,it was very apparent that it did make a small contact and went through it and was gone,now i don;t know why,but i immedieately looked to my left and i saw the exact same thing,only it was delayed just enough so i could see the one to my right then the one to my left.I can see it right now just as clearly as i did that night about 8 weeks ago.I don't talk about it because when i did it caused me tremendious complications and have been made fun of ever since.I lost my entire reputation that night by just telling the truth.I just had to let someone know that may believe me .Thanks for listening","distance":"21-100
