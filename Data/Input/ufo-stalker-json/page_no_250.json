the sky. i recently installed two, 1080p infrared security cameras on my roof and pointed them north and south recording 24/7 as a means to settle a debate between myself and some friends regarding what is really in our skies and to prove that readily available technology can help remove a lot of the doubts people have in regards to ufo's and their presence. i immediately began gathering convincing  footage even faster than i had imagined. the first few days i pulled were orbs, some shooting disc like objects far out in space, and generally as much as i ever expected to get. but as i scanned the second round of footage a week or so after installation, i caught a very interesting encounter that occurred on april 9th, 2017 at noon. this encounter involved what seems to be some sort of robotic drone-scout that was likely sent by a larger ship, possibly cloaked in the clouds, to investigate my ir cameras (all complete conjecture on my part obviously). the object, which seems to be a small, metallic, spherical object about twice the size of a basketball, fell from an abnormal hole in the cloud cover passing overhead. the object descends to my street and sets down in a neighbors tree, that it quickly uses to slide down to the ground and disappear from camera view. i believe that at this time it continues along the ground to my house and proceeds to inspect my cameras. i say this because about 2 minutes later the foreground image in the recording starts to vibrate and shake.I have noticed this happens whenever any sort of ufo is nearby or about to pass. the trees and any other objects in the foreground begin to vibrate and shake wildly, looking as if they are detached from the landscape. it really freaks my wife out watching it. at this point, the object scales back up the tree and hops over to the light pole disappearing and reappearing in thin air mid jump (possibly just a pixel glitch??). it then seemingly \"leaps\" into the air and hovers, spinning like a spiraling football for about 5 seconds before ascending straight up about 20 feet and hovering again for a few moments. it then begins to swiftly fly to the left (west)- up out of frame without any change in bodily direction or orientation. my range of emotions has run the gamut with this recording. initially i was excited and couldn't wait to show everyone. that soon faded to cautious and at times slightly regretful as the reality set in that this thing literally flew out of a cloud and all the way to my house to inspect my set up (i think) and scope out what i was doing and i assume find out why i was watching or who i was and if i pose a threat. the clouds visible in the infrared spectrum on this day were some of the most unusual i have caught on infrared. one cloud especially jumps out that you can see in the film, dead center when the object is reappearing. since this encounter, my house has begun to be visited by much larger, saucer shaped craft which i will report and upload video of separately. the most recent lasted for almost 20 minutes.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

down the street, half a block away, and whose home backs up to the alley my property also backs up to, knows i'm interested in ufos, and so he called me on the phone to tell me he saw a ufo high up in the sky and slightly to the east.  this placed it behind my home, as my backyard faces the east.  the front of my home faces the west.  so i went into my backyard and looked up in the sky for the ufo.  i didn't see it.  so i went back inside and called my neighbor back and asked him to go outside and see if he could still see it.  if i recall correctly, i held on the phone while he did this and he returned and said it's still there.  i believe i hung up and again went outside but still couldn't see it. so i called him back again and asked him to walk over and show me where it was.  if memory serves me right he walked up the alley about a minute or so later and i met him there and he pointed it out to me.  it was very faint and just looked like a stationary star. actually it was so faint that i could barely see it.  he has excellent eyesight and i wear glasses so possibly that may have had something to do with it.  he had things to do so he went back home.  i raced inside and grabbed my panasonic pv-gs320 digital video camcorder and one of my tripods and returned to my backyard and set it up.  now i could still see the object in the sky but i could never find it in the lcd monitor of my camcorder. after a few minutes of this i then could no longer see the ufo and so i was not a happy camper that i missed it.  i grabbed my camcorder with the tripod still attached and turned and headed back to the house. i recall distinctly saying to myself something to the effect of darn i missed it.  the time was now about 7:50pm.  now i kept looking up at the sky to see if maybe the object had moved and was elsewhere in the sky and just as i got close to the eaves of my home's back wall i saw another new object that appeared up in the sky as it flew from the west over my house and came into view overhead.  the weird thing is it was as if it was aware that i was looking at it since it stopped and hovered overhead in a zig zaggy type of motion.  this gave me time to put my tripod on the ground and find this new object in the lcd monitor and so i was able to film it as it moved around overhead at approximately a 65 to 70 degree angle.  at one point in the footage you can see where what appears to be a bug fly past on the left side.  finally, after about 15 to 18 seconds of my filming it, the object appeared to fly off back to the west, in the direction from which it had originally come and disappeared beyond my roof.  i say \"appeared to fly\" because it went of so fast that i'm not 100% sure what it did.  i'll mention that the whole time it never made one sound.  as soon as i saw the object i knew it was something out of the ordinary and i suspected it might be a drone but upon further examination it doesn't look like a drone.  what was especially odd is there was some kind of appendage on the left side of the object that appeared to oscillate or flutter.  at times as i filmed it i had to move the camcorder so i could keep the object on the lcd monitor.  but it did jump (hover) around within the small region where it was.  so some of the shakiness is probably due to my movement.  i was exhilarated to have caught this new object on film.  i have had three previous sightings.  one in 1969 when i was eleven. one in 1976 when i lived in a dorm at ucla and one about 1985 in hollywood. but this time was the best as i was able to get a record of what i saw. i took a photo of the object when i looked at it on my tv and i blew it up as large as possible.  i have had a lifelong interest in ufos (since i was around 6 or 7 years of age).  i believe that

inside he told me that my fathers fire fighter crew was inside having drinks with my parents. i didnt want to go inside well i was kind of mad that they were drinking so i stayed outside. my friend stayed with me. one of the crew members came out to use the washroom. he started peeing right off the front steps so i said to him \" damn it (crew member) why cant you use the washroom like a normal person.\" he replied \" washrooms being used\" as i looked off into the distance i noticed a moving light so i said \" hey whats that?\" crew member said \"its a plain\" and went inside. i told my friend to look and it started moving faster and getting brighter and closer. with in seconds it stopped right over our fire pit that was in the middle of a tear drop shape road that leaded to our house. it hovered for i dont know how long. i told my friend \"are you seeing this\" he didn't say anything so i looked at him and he was looking at the hovering light. i looked back and just stared at it and it shot out into outer space really fast. it didn't make any noise and the light was the size of a baseball. we went inside to tell of what we saw and right away the guy that was peeing outside asked where we went. i said \" we just saw a light \" crew member said i went out to pee again and you guys were gone.\" he predeceased to accuse us of getting close to each other like going for a walk to \"be alone\" i don't remember much after that. i don't even know if i told them what we saw. i asked my friend meany days later about what happened or if he remembered and said \"yes but i don't want to talk about it can you just forget about it\". i don't know why he re fusses to talk about it, maybe he was scared i don't know. i still see him around town and we don't talk much but

said. when i try to remember every detail it seems so-real like it didn't happen but it did i remember it. till this day it still bothers me i think about it before i go to bed sometimes and try to

light black or dark gray colored hulls. we saw them for at least 2 minutes, they flew/floated/hovered right over us and then simply moved on, almost incredibly slowly it seemed. these three space crafts flew directly overhead of our position on the ground.\r\n\r\nthe crafts did not stop. we watched them float/hover off into the distance. there was a local quarry in the exact vicinity and on their course, so they were probably on an evaluation mission? that was saturday jan 11th/12th early sunday morning, 1:15 am 1992. i was with 1 other friend and his dog at the time. location acton,

the parking lot a bunch of guys (4-5 guys) were staring up at the sky. i looked up and saw the biggest freaking owl i have ever seen! i’m 6’2 and i’m guessing this thing was at least a foot taller than me. it was completely black except for it having bright yellowish/reddish eyes like a cat. it stood there for a minute or two staring at everyone before shooting up into the sky and disappearing. it made everyone feel very uneasy and only took off after some guys threw some rocks at it. it had wings on it like an owl, only bigger and you could hear it flap those wings when it took off.\r\nit made this sound as it took off and flew away that sounded like a trucks brakes when they are burned out. it flew up and flew a wide circle, making that sound once more and then flew off in the direction of the stevenson expressway. we stood around and looked for it for a few minutes but it never came back.\r\ni’m reporting this because there is no way this was an owl, it stood upright like a man, just really, really tall. i don’t want to discuss this with anyone and would prefer to remain anonymous, i don’t imagine anyone would believe me anyways. one of the guys i work with who saw

me because i believe  that as soon as i saw the ufo and began video taping it, the ufo began communicating with me telepathically. i felt it so strongly that i actually began talking to it outloud as well as mentally and it responded to everything i was thinking and saying. for example, i had to be sure of what i was looking at. the street lamps on my old street were a lot like what i was watching so i took photos of both and went inside to upload and compare. although similar it was obviously not a street lamp. i hurried back outside to make sure it was still there, and it was. so i began to think, \"ok, if you are what i think you are come closer...\" and it did. it came toward me and i instructed it not to scare me. so it reversed. we played that little game until i was convinced i was really having a real encounter. i spent quite a while filming and taking photos. i was amazed that i was able to get photos which clearly showed the shape, which was a round disc shape. it was a dull almost textured looking color and on the bottom it appeared to have either letters or a type of symbols, or possibly a door or hatch. my strongest thoughts are that it had large letters that resembled the letter 'b' and an 'h' together. it was very cold and extremely windy that night and it was difficult for me to keep the camera still as well as the video camer. the photos came out pretty sharp though. the video was more difficulot for me to hold still and the way this thing would bounce around it made me question whether it was actually darting in every direction or if it was me and my cold shaky hands. i eventually set the video camera down on a flat surface and was able to see for certain that it was indeed going in every direction. close and far, left and right, up and down, shooting out of sight and returning. it was difficult to keep the camera focused. there were other things in the sky that night too but my attention was on this ufo. i called my girlfriend who lived down the street. she and i used to spend a lot of nights observing lots of things in the night sky. she came right down and i shared what was going on with her. she took some pictures with her phone but it wasn't as obvious on her phone as it was using my video camera or my digital camera. i don't know for sure how long we watched  the object. i had another friend at my ho9use that night but he was a pretty heavy drinker and was more distracting than helpful so i sent him back inside the house so she and i could concentrate. i can't remember right now, maybe if i watch the video again i will be able to see if the object was still there when we decided to go in but it seems that it ended the communication with me and quickly disappeared into the distance heading in a northeast direction.\r\n   i was excited and couldn't stop looking at the photos i had taken and watching the video. i knew i had just experienced definite communication but at the same time i think i was trying to rule out all other explanations. the next day, (i marked it was 12 hours later because that was the highest option for me to choose in the description section of this report) i had gone to see my son for our weekly lunch visit. he was staying at a boys home for a few months for smoking weed. on my drive back home it was between 11 and 13 hours after i had seen the ufo. i had my camera with me and was taking pictures of different buildings as i was driving. i would just hold the camera and point in the direction of something and when i was stopped at a light i would try to get better shots. i took several pictures of the huge world center on alta drive. i took a couple of pictures of my right rear view mirror which was showing a bunch of colored flags lining the sidewalk in front of some apartments and then i was the first car stopped at a red light driving west on alta drive, stopped on the east side of rancho drive. on the other side of the street the city had changed the once straight road lined with the older mansion homes of celebrities and wealthy business owners and gave it a pretty curving appearance. it curved back and forth for several blocks. i was thinking how pretty it looked and held my camera outside of the car window and took several pictures. the light changed so i set my camera down and i continued driving the short distance back to my house. i got home and as usual i went to the computer and uploaded my photos. i was looking at each photo individually instead of all of them at once on one page. i mention this so you might be able to get an idea of what happened to me when i clicked 'next' and there was the first picture of the road on the other side of rancho. and i clicked 'next again and right in the center of that next photo was the same disc i had seen the night before. my heart was pounding in my chest and once again i heard them (it felt like there were more than one both times i heard the communication!)this time the message was something like...\"you definitely saw what you thought you saw last night!\" they were confirming they were real and honestly, it kind of felt like they were having fun letting me know this. i have pictures and a video that includes what i filmed that night of the very active ufo. it has other photos that i don't remember putting on there. i may have accidentally mixed things up but the footage of the ufo and the way it changes how it looks is from that video you will see how it zoomed in and out rapidly and bounces and zigzags all over the place. i don't know how to explain why i have other photos on this video but they are all pictures i've taken. sometimes i have played with the editing program to try to see an image better. i know you are only interested in the raw footage but right now i have several broken computers that are holding photos until i can figure out how to get to them. actually by trying various things in editing i have been able to see things that were otherwise not visible in the normal photo. i have to use this video for now though so you can see the ufo in action...Sorry! i am not sure how long this report can stay on here without being sent but i have to go search some of the other places i have saved photos and videos to find the ones i need for this report. i know what i saw and i know what they said to me. of course i don't know if i was abducted or not but i am interested to hear what you have to say about this report. i have a lot more things to share with you in following reports. i hope you don't have a limit on how many reports can be made!

with the older mansion homes of celebrities and wealthy business owners and gave it a pretty curving appearance. it curved back and forth for several blocks. i was thinking how pretty it looked and held my camera outside of the car window and took several pictures. the light changed so i set my camera down and i continued driving the short distance back to my house. i got home and as usual i went to the computer and uploaded my photos. i was looking at each photo individually instead of all of them at once on one page. i mention this so you might be able to get an idea of what happened to me when i clicked 'next' and there was the first picture of the road on the other side of rancho. and i clicked 'next again and right in the center of that next photo was the same disc i had seen the night before. my heart was pounding in my chest and once again i heard them (it felt like there were more than one both times i heard the communication!)this time the message was something like...\"you definitely saw what you thought you saw last night!\" they were confirming they were real and honestly, it kind of felt like they were having fun letting me know this. i have pictures and a video that includes what i filmed that night of the very active ufo. it has other photos that i don't remember putting on there. i may have accidentally mixed things up but the footage of the ufo and the way it changes how it looks is from that video you will see how it zoomed in and out rapidly and bounces and zigzags all over the place. i don't know how to explain why i have other photos on this video but they are all pictures i've taken. sometimes i have played with the editing program to try to see an image better. i know you are only interested in the raw footage but right now i have several broken computers that are holding photos until i can figure out how to get to them. actually by trying various things in editing i have been able to see things that were otherwise not visible in the normal photo. i have to use this video for now though so you can see the ufo in action...Sorry! i am not sure how long this report can stay on here without being sent but i have to go search some of the other places i have saved photos and videos to find the ones i need for this report. i know what i saw and i know what they said to me. of course i don't know if i was abducted or not but i am interested to hear what you have to say about this report. i have a lot more things to share with you in following reports. i hope you don't have a limit on how many reports can be made!
