States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Our power was out do to late payment that night. i was alone in the back patio sitting in a patio chair listening to my headphones and enjoying the cool night air, was not much else to do.\r\n  first i will tell you that i am very familure with the night sky and can tell the difference between planets, stars satalights and different aircraft. i have been through private pilot and cival air patrol ground schools and have had over 60 or so flight hours in private pilot training, and familure with what lights aircraft should and are required to be equiped with and what each lights function and meaning is etc.\r\n   on the night of my sighting the sky was clear and i was sitting back looking up at the stars while enjoying my radio station. i was facing up and out to the east.\r\n   i noticed some movement in the corner of my left eye, i faced that way and saw what looked like and moved like 4 bright white satalights moving in perfect formation across the sky at a speed a little faster than satalights move across the sky. the formation was that of a perfect triangle with the fourth light dead center. all the lights (3 points and 1 center) were identicle in size, color ( white with slightest hent of blue) and brightness.\r\n   as i have no way of knowing the size i cant make an estamate on the altitude or speed. but i got the sence it was pretty high and cruzin at a good speed, if i put my hand up to the sky the object would be equivalent in length as the width of 1 1/2 fingers.\r\n   the object had only these lights and they stayed solid. no red/green wing tip possition lights, anticollision or any other for that matter.\r\n    the object moved in a straight line to the south east crossing my view of the sky at an angle. i was very confused as to what it could be, i took out my headphones ( volume was not high so i had no ringing in ears from radio station) and listened for sounds of engines which i should have been able to hear if it was a passenger jet, prop plane or rotocraft even if distant i can always hear aircraft in the sky in this area even if distant, but heard nothing, this is also a quiet neighborhood.\r\n   i still figured that just maybe it could be a newly deployed satalight. i have seen on the nasa channel where a satalight would be deployed by  being released in a case where the case comes apart and the parts drift appart leaving the satalight. \r\n  but i was convinced it was not some kind of conventional aircraft or space junk moving in formation when after about 15 or 20 seconds the craft rotated approx 90 degrees to the right on its axis ( the center light ) over the period of about 3 seconds. at that point it stoped rotating and was still flying in the exact same line of travel and speed but now sideways. facing almost south west but traveling on to the south east.\r\n   it continued on for about 10 seconds in this configuration then just like it did before it now rotated on its axis left back to its origional configuration now facing its line of travel. \r\n    i was realy excited to see this because i knew for sure it was not any satalight or aircraft i have ever seen. i was thinking this is ither some out of this world craft (cool) or something brand new that we had (also cool), and if it is something we have it has to be using some new kind of propulsion to be able to rotate and fly sideways so smoothly like that, and if it is ours that is also very exciting to me as someone that loves aircraft and flying. \r\n     it continued on to the south east untill it was out of site.  both of the crafts rotations were the same speed (about 3 seconds) and smooth, never seeming to have an effect on its straight line of travel or speed.\r\n   the best i can compair it to would be a tank moving down the highway and the turret being able to swivel left and right without effecting the speed or course of the vehicle. only what i saw was what appeared to be an entire aircraft do the same.\r\n     in my aircraft i can do what is called a crab which is where you give full left or right rudder and opposite aileron to put the aircraft in a slightly sideways configuration, but only about 10-20 degrees or so and at the expense of speed, it creates major drag and is used sometimes to drasticly slow the aircraft, usualy for a landing where you may be coming in a little high, it allows you to loose some altitude and speed do to drag quickly.\r\n   i know of no aircraft that put itself in a sideways configuration at high speed without breaking apart. some aircraft can hover and fly sideways at very very slow speeds and some rotocraft but not at high speeds in the hundreds of miles per hour or faster.\r\n  because of the size of craft do to altitude and limited number of stars out at night in our sky arround here i did not get a chance to see it cross over a stationary star to see if it would block it out, i did watch for that but it did not cross any stars in its line of flight from my point of view. this might have helped rule out separate objects doing formation ( very impressive formation ) flying but i realy got the sence it was a single solid object.\r\n  also the lights on the craft all maintained thier brightness during the entire sighting across the sky. satalights i see will usualy blink or fade, these lights did not.\r\n   i dont know for sure what i saw that night but it was deffidently making deliberate movements making me believe it was controlled by something or someone.\r\n  also for refference the crafts line of travel was south east with the line taking it over or just slightly north of bfl meadows field, rather than right over the city of bakersfield. if anything it would have skirted the area of bakersfield on its northern edge.\r\n  i have included a picture i made on a paint program showing the crafts appearence, line of travel and movements. what i actualy seen looked a bit more distant than it appears in the pic. consider it a somewhat zoomed in look at exactly what i seen. also the possitions in the sky where the craft changed its configuration was much more distant from each other than what you see in the pic, it was about 10 seconds between the left and right rotations and the craft was seen for a total of about 50 seconds to 1 minute which covered the entire line of sight of sky i could see which was quite a bit.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

after moving together in a locked formation for around two seconds, they moved independently similar to a flock of birds. they seemed to glow a little bit like embers and faded away. i was excited at first because i thought that it was a ufo. i then thought they must be birds after they started to move independently. my wife thought they weren't birds because she said that birds sleep at night.

the countryside on a slope of a hill, surrounded by forrests and vineyards. there was a beautiful panoramic view of a big lake called, balaton. i was at this family vinyard, with my boyfriend and we were sleeping in a tent. i would like to point out also, that there was no electricity, no water, none of the comforts of the 21st century. you could only reach this part of the country if you travelled on a bad quality dirt road, and if you walked a good bit after. so there we were sleeping inside a small tent. \r\n around 3 am i walk up because of some strange, extremelly strong scanning light shone through the tent, making me feel that i was light through like in an x-ray examination. i was trying to move, but my body was strongly paralized, so for some time i was just laying there listening to the very mechanical, very loud sound, like that of an airplane turbine, but somehow softer, and i was wondering, what on earth was happening outside. i also have to state that due to my beleive in christianity at that time, i would have considered myself as a \"born-again\" christian, who doesn't beleive in that obvious hoax that extraterrestrial beings would manifest in the form of ufos. so first i thought there must be a big airplane of some sorts landed outside on the field in the night, which was quite strange at this location. so i gathered my strenght, and was trying to wake up my boyfriend who was not reacting at all. i was trying to shake him up, i was shouting at him, but nothing. also, i was still feeling strongly paralized, so this experience was turning into a nightmare. i was really afraid of some unseen force that was outside the tent. by this time i kind of crawled to the entrance of the tent, and was really struggling to open the zip, due to my lack of force. once i managed to open the tent and looked outside there was complete darkeness, like nothing have happened a few minutes ago. i clambered outside, still difficultly moving, and sat on the grass beside the tent, looking around. there was a small white holidayhouse on my right about 6-8 meters away, and as i looked at that direction, my fear suddenly reached a peakpoint. i was looking at a creature in the moonlight that was 2-3meters tall, standing on two feet, kind of dark skinned, very alongated head, but absolutely non human looking. this creature was looking at me, i was looking at the creature...And the fear i felt was so immense, that i felt an instant urge to let my bowels loose...Really crazy. i have never felt this strong fear before, an all engulfing fear shaked my body like a leaf, and i had to turn my head off this vision. the only thing my mind was constantly telling me, that it is not possible, you don't beleive in aliens!You don't beleive in ufos!\r\nthe next thing i remember i was laying in the tent silently murmoring that this is impossible...Then i fall asleep, or rather stumbeled into a comalike sleep. the next day, when we wake up, i was discussing the event with my boyfriend who saw and heard nothing, making me feel rather stupid. nonetheless we walked around looking for clues. the only thing that we found at the exact spot where i observed this being was a front leg of a small deer. it wasn't torn  offbut cut off with a sharp object, looked very fresh, but no signs of blood, or dried blood was visible, witch was quite odd. and later that day i also noticed a tiny cross-shaped scar of a cut on my skin, between the inner corner of my eye and my nose, which was reather scary. after this i was trying tu burry these traumatizing memories for years, untill now. maybe one day i will be able to find out what exactly happened wiht me and my boyfriend.","distance":"20 Feet or

report here. i am 41 years old, i am a very private person and in no way want any attention over this!\r\n\r\ni currently live in las vegas nv, my story began in lompoc california near vandenberg afb. i believe i was 8 years old because i was in the 3rd grade so this was 1974 i believe. \r\n\r\nmy oldest sister linda had recently had been married and i inherited her room, i had bunk beds in my old room but this room was bigger so my bunk beds where broke down into 2 beds one on each side of my room. i remember quite vividly the bed covers on the beds my mom made them, they had ww1 era airplanes on them. i don���t remember how long i had been in this room when i had this encounter.\r\n\r\non this particular night i slept in the bed near the window as i slept in which ever bed struck my fancy that night. i remember waking from a deep sleep in the middle of the night, i turned my head towards the window and standing there outside my window as clear as day staring me in the face is what i know now as a \"grey alien\" and mind you this is several years before close encounters of a 3rd kind was released (not that i would have been able to watch it my mom never would have let me see that kind of movie back then) i remember it as if it was yesterday it was so clear he was looking right at me in the face, i remember big black eyes with a bald brow crunched up like it had a scowl on its face, with it's head tilted to one side. i rolled out of bed crawled across my floor opened the door and ran into my parents room where i announced i would never go in my room again because there is a monster outside my window! \r\n\r\ni did not sleep in my room for weeks until my father had enough and insisted i sleep in my own room. this could be blown off as just a bad dream or an over active imagination as my parents tried to do. but i suffered from what i know now as post traumatic syndrome for several years with very livid extreme night terrors and very strange sleep walking events that lasted well into my teenage years, not to mention i did not sleep anywhere near a window until i was married when i was 21.\r\n\r\nthis event changed my life i never felt safe after this in my own room and once in awhile i will have a panic attack at night and have no idea why, i do not think more than a few days have ever past that i have not thought about that night 33 ago.\r\n\r\nthe second event happened around 10 years ago. i had recently gone through a bad divorce and had lost a house to forcloser, me and a friend where crashing at his uncles house and had just started a new job. on this particular night the old house we where staying was hot (summer in vegas with no ac on) so i elected to sleep in the back yard in a lawn chair. \r\n\r\nthis is where it gets a lil foggy i do not know if i fell asleep. but all i remember is standing in the middle of the back yard and i am looking at a glowing orange ufo disk shape (i see these described as a plasma ufo) slowly flying over my head and of to the north, it made no sound and it was only maybe 100-150 feet of the ground. i remember i was not exited it gave me a feeling of being very uneasy not exited like you would imagine i watched it slowly fly away at maybe 40 miles an hour.\r\n\r\ni went into the house and watched t.V. until my friend woke. i did not tell him for a few days, i am not sure why. \r\n\r\nthe events i have reported here are true i in no way seek anything, or any attention. both these events have rocked my very core beliefs, as i get older i for some reason have been thinking more of these events and want to know why i have seen both an alien and such a clear ufo. if you tell someone you have had more than one alien/ufo experience it completely changes the way they look at you. i no longer talk about this to my family because it upsets my oldest daughter. \r\n\r\ni have spent many years wondering about what i seen, i don���t know if they come from another planet or if that kind of travel is even possible. i am sharing these events in this forum so maybe i can understand and maybe help someone else understand what we are seeing.\r\n\r\nbest regards  steven b.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line
