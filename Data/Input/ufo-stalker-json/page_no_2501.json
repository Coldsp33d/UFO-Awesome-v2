tail and the lights didn't change color.  as it crossed my 12:00 the nearly full moon showed the wedge shape quite well.  as a retired air force member i'm quite familiar with aircraft and their flight characteristics.  the object was flying at approximately 10,000 ft and made no noise.  i waited well past it had crossed the south east horizon listening for any sound and heard none.  the object was approximately 200 ft in length and 50 ft thick with three red lights on the underside.  it appeared to be black or at least non-reflective in color and texture.  the time it took to cross

a few thousand feet. there was no visible sun.\r\n\r\ni arrived at the trailhead parking some time around 2:40pm on 11/15/07.\r\n\r\non my way up to the perimeter of the breached volcanic cone (red mountain is an old cinder cone which has an entire side of the mountain missing ��� exposing red rock surface composed of cinder) i began snapping pictures of the mountain. \r\n\r\ni continued snapping pictures through the majority of the hike ��� some as few as a couple of minutes apart ��� some as long 15 minutes between shots.\r\n\r\ni stayed at the mountain well until nightfall. with exception of a father and daughter that left the rim around 3:45pm (there name is in the log book before mine.)\r\n\r\nthe only interaction i had with other people on the mountain was with the gentleman and his daughter. we talked for a few minutes about the unique geological features of the area. they did not report anything.\r\n\r\ni myself was not looking for anything out of the ordinary. the pictures were intended for family showings.\r\n\r\nthe camera was a fuji finepix s5000. it is a 3mp camera that interpolates to 6mp. (the setting was 6mp on the photos.)\r\n\r\nthis is not the original picture ��� it is an edited pic - my intials are embedded within the trunks of a few trees for claim. the original can be rendered to investigators ��� so long as i get credited for the original picture. (no color correction was used ��� the use of color correction adds some scale and interesting detail.)\r\n\r\nthe shaded corners come from a defect of the camera ��� the shaded areas are from a screw on cylinder that comes attached to the camera. (it is supposed to reduce glare)\r\n\r\nmy gps coordinates were within 2 tenths of a mile from 35��� 32.040n and 111��� 52.105w when the picture was taken ��� on the trailhead.

in the late afternoon sky over palm springs, california. the sightings occurred at approximately 4:30 p.M. the crafts remained visible to the naked eye for about five minutes before disappearing.\r\n\r\nwe were in the downtown area of palm springs when the sighting occurred. i was the first to notice something unusual. i was looking up towards the moon (which was clearly visible to me at that hour) when i spotted an elongated boomerang, or triangular shaped craft flying in a southwest direction. at first, the object appeared to be flying in a straight line like a normal aircraft. it also seemed to be at about the same altitude that a commercial aircraft normally flies while at cruising altitude, approximately 25,000-35,000 feet. from that distance, i would estimate the size of the craft to be similar in size to a small to medium sized commercial aircraft. \r\n\r\nwhile watching the unidentified craft for a minute or so, i noticed that it started to move in ways that normal aircraft don���t. it slowly came to a stop, suspended in midair like a helicopter. that���s when i pointed it out to my partner, who saw the object as clearly as i had. the craft then moved around its location sluggishly and, in what appeared to be, a somewhat erratic fashion. all of the sudden, two other identical craft came into view in close relative proximity to the fist craft. the three objects began to slowly ���wobble��� towards a center point. for about four or five minutes they leisurely moved around and, on occasion, become completely stationary. once the objects reached their center point destination, they vanished from sight.\r\n\r\nit should be noted that the sky at that time of day was perfectly clear with exceptional visibility. each craft was identical in size and shape to one another. another unusual attribute of the crafts was that although they were shaped like a boomerang, they flew with the curvature to one side. in other words, the objects flew ���sideways���. we discussed the possibility that the objects could have been birds, but discounted that theory because of the size of the objects and the fact that they came together and disappeared.\r\n\r\nour reactions to the sighting were pretty tempered. neither of us got overly excited or anxious. after the sighting we discussed the event and came to the conclusion that what we had seen was, more than likely, three craft from another planet. \r\n\r\nabout the witnesses: i am a 47 year-old marketing executive and creative consultant to the motion picture industry. i hold a b.A. degree in radio, television, and film from a major university in southern california. i am an faa licensed pilot certified to fly single engine aircraft. my partner is also 47 years old and has post-graduate degrees in political science and art history from a prestigious and internationally recognized university. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

���phoenix lights��� for the first time last night.  to be honest my memory of this event is sketchy but i can tell you what i remember.\r\n\r\nit was either 1999 or 2000 within the first few months of the year.  i think it was february.  i was an undergraduate physics & astronomy student with central michigan university and i was with a group of two other students and our instructor.  we were taking advantage of some time with the nuro telescope on anderson mesa near flagstaff, az.  \r\n\r\none night we left our control room to go outside and look at the stars.  i don���t remember what time it was unfortunately.  as we were standing there after a few minutes we noticed a ���v��� pattern of lights  flying in a counter-clockwise circular path that took it overhead, then to the north(toward flagstaff),  toward the west at its other extent, south and then back up overhead.   this triangle was being trailed by a red light (not blinking) that was a good distance behind.  too far behind to be attached to the tail of an airplane.  this red light was noticeable when we first took note of the formation but after 2 to 3 minutes it vanished while the formation was due west of us.  the triangular pattern continued its circle.  i do not recall the color of the v pattern lights. \r\n\r\nif memory serves me correctly i counted twenty lights, ten to each leg of the ���v���.  i ran in and grabbed a pair of binoculars and upon viewing the lights while it was directly overhead  i  saw the silhouette of an airplane with wings swept back at an approximately 45 degree angle and the lights were on the leading edges of the wings.  the silhouette looked strange to me.  the wings were attached to the fuselage about 1/3 of the way forward from the tail with the ���nose��� making up the other 2/3 of the length.  while some of the details are foggy in my memory, i remember these proportions as they seemed quite atypical of any plane i���d seen.  the body was slender and the wings were slender and relatively long.  \r\n\r\ni don���t remember what ultimately became of this plane.  as to whether it flew off or the lights went out i don���t recall.  now at the time i was unfamiliar with the ���phoenix lights��� but was familiar with ufo sightings of triangular / v shaped light configurations.  my opinion at the time and even now was that this plane and its trailing light were, for whatever reason, deliberately trying to appear as such a configuration.  hearing of the phoenix lights makes it seem even more plausible.  \r\n\r\nnow it could have been an aircraft in a holding pattern around the flagstaff airport which is south of town and was to our west.  this is a possibility, however it still seems strange that it would have so many leading lights, would have a red light trailing quite far behind, and in the middle of the night would have to continually circle a small regional airport which according to my professor no longer received any commercial flights and has sparse traffic even in the daytime.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional
