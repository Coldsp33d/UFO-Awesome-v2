(i lived in the city, campbell - a suburb of san jose, and though one can see stars at night, this experience was comparable to being in the mountains with little or no city light obstructing the beauty.)\r\nvery soon after i as staring at a huge, and i mean huge ufo hovering silently overhead. the was no commotion around me, no other individuals 'responding' or 'gasping' or anything such to alert me that i was not the only individual to be seeing this thing.\r\ni lay there quiet and awe-inspired. the object (from my vantage point) was round, like a large disc. there were orange lights on the perimeter, small in nature, and on the underside, there were large lights (maybe five or six and again, orange in color) in the shape of bars. i was reminded of the simon says game where players have to depress colored bars in a sequence in response to a pattern set by the machine. the player who could follow the sequence without missing a 'note' would move on to the next round. \r\nanyway, this thing hovered there above us in complete quiet. i tried hard to focus my hearing to above me, searching for traces of any aircraft sounds. no sounds were emitted from this object. \r\nthe object seemed to be only a stone's throw above us, and had it been on the ground, i estimate that it's size would have engulfed the three tents combined.\r\ni don't remember how long i stared at this thing before it started moving to the north. there were no indications of its intentions to move. no flashes of light or other significant mechanical notifications that the object was going to move. i was lying down with my head facing west and i followed the crafts movement to the north by first moving only my eyes, but soon i had to move my head as it traveled further and further toward the mountians to the north. my internal compass may be off - i do not know if there are mountains to the north or to the east of fort ord. notwithstanding, i turned my head to the left to follow the object into the  distance.\r\nas i was watching the craft become smaller and smaller as it approached the 'horizon', i noticed stars moving far, far off in the sky, and i at first assumed a meteor shower or shooting stars. soon however i noticed a pattern to the 'stars' movements and took more concern over them. the initial craft was now becoming a bright star as the others, and when it reached the mountains (or beyond) it 'met up' with the other stars/lights/crafts and fell into formation.\r\nhere, obviously, one needs further description of the other stars/crafts.\r\nthere were five other crafts that i witnessed. three came from the western sky and two came from the eastern sky. they, all five of them, seemed to 'dance' in a formation. this dance lasted mabye half a minute, maybe more. what picqued my interest further, was that they appeared to be in a formation much like the thunderbirds would do when i went to air shows in tampa, florida. not the same formations, mind you, but the same idea. i recongized this because the two on the right were mirroring the three on the left, but, the two on the right were missing a 'third'. but for that missing third, the formations were identical - left and right/west and east. then, as the first observed craft neared, the five stopped and hung in the sky, and, when the first craft met up with them, it took its place in position with the two from the east and then, all six went into a dance, and after just a few seconds, if that long, they all sped away on different paths, in a pattern much like we depict the rays of sunshine - and furthermore, they sped away at a speed that defies measurement. i have no reference to relate the speed to.\r\nupon their exit, i let out a moan or a whoa, or something of that nature in awe of what i had just spent a good part of time witnessing. to my astonhishment, another student/memeber rotc comrade let out a moan/groan/sigh at the very same moment. we were orientated in such a way that our heads could have touched and our feet at opposite ends. much like the pages in a book and our heads situated at the spine.\r\nwe both got up on our elbows and turned to face each other and, i don't remember the exact words, but we inquired of each other, ever-so-quietly if they have just seen....Yeah, you too? yeah. i don't recall ever using the words ufo, or spacecraft or anything like that. in fact, we did not make much of a fuss about it verbally for whatever reason. i can say though, that i was not comfortable admitting this/reporting this to anyone for fear of ridicule and the fact that the other kid that witness these same events was a class clown and had i the power, i would have kicked him out of the class long ago, because i took the class seriously and with great respect and he, on the other hand, took nothing about the class seriously. it was merely a way out of pe.\r\nwe never discussed this experience with each other, and to my knowledge he has only discussed this with a very small group of people that we know. in fact, i only learned about his discussing the experience some twenty years later when i was married because i related the experience to my wife and to her astonishment, it was very similar to the experience he told her years and years earlier.\r\ni have never reported this incident, nor have i looked up anything regarding fort ord and ufos or any connection thereto. if such a report exists, i have no knowledge of it.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

brought at the whse. where i pick them up, listening to the radio and watching the incoming ups jets come in to land at standiford field which is approx. 7-8 miles nw. i always joke that i'll never see anything in the sky because every night the sky is filled with them landing and later leaving all night long over me even when i deliver my route from mt. washington through the western part of spencer co. my van was facing west and the flights as usual were stacked up 2 at a time coming in nw to the 2 main runways. i heard a helicopter coming which is not unusual as at that point we're 7-8 miles from ft. knox\r\nor standiford & ky. air national guard and stat flights pass over sometimes. i was an army brat so i've been around them all my life. what struck me was this chopper seemed a little louder than most and appeared to be dark or black but also had an intense red flasing strobe and was flying opposite the the incoming jets by going se and later south. it was flying low well underneath the jets (maybe 500'). but at one point it passed over enough lit background that i could see a trailing\r\nobject going the same speed but just a little higher. i thought it was another chopper but in that brief few seconds it appeared to be the shape of a black triangle a little bigger and a little longer than the chopper which seemed to be like but a little bigger than an apache helicopter. i did a quick doubletake because of what i was seeing but it quickly went out of view and i assumed headed south with the helicopter. there was no sound to the object, no lights, no markings and both at the cruising speed of the helicopter. i tried to reason if i was seeing things because i could not figure out why that would happen like that other than if they wanted to sneak something by, i guess that was pretty damn good, possibly below radar and flight path but high enough under those conditions not to be seen except for the spot of sky it had just passed and i saw it. there is a doppler radar site less than 4 miles east of where i was but all anyone would see was the flashing red light of the helicopter. the helicopter did return but was approx. 10 miles away west of shepherdsville and headed north towards standiford pretty much the same direction it originated from with no way to tell if the other object was with it. i've heard of these before but didn't believe it. now i know there's no telling what's up there that we just can't see them.I deliver pizzas in shepherdsville every night, take a little break, then deliver a newspaper route so i'm on the road pretty much most of the night 7 days a week from 4:00 p.M. until i get done usually by 6:30 a.M. and i probably look up as much as i do the road and normally don't see any thing but big beautifull sky (and ups flights)but this quick little happening caught me by surprise and makes me wonder if i really saw it. so if anyone else saw it or has any ideas, i'd probably feel a little more settled. otherwise i can just add this to a few other odd things i've seen on the job and consider them to be bonuses.            \r\n\r\n              regards,\r\n                       will

doze off while watching a late night horror film.\r\nanyways, at some time around 5:45 am i noticed a very bright light moving across the sky.\r\ni observed it from my bedroom window which is right next to my bed.\r\nat first i thought it was a low flying plane but as i watched it i knew this was not the case.\r\nmy window looks out into my backyard where there is a barn and beyond that is forest for about a mile or so.\r\nthere were no other blinking lights that are usually associated with regular aircraft.\r\nthe thing that made it very odd was the fact that as it moved in a north/north east direction away from my home, it seemed to float or bob like a balloon in the wind but not as violent.\r\nit seemed to be controlled but flew in a somewhat erratic motion.\r\nit did not seem to go off its straight course but only moved up and down as it went.\r\ni opened my window (it was cold out but what the heck right?) and i could hear no sounds except the wind.\r\nthe area around my home is mostly forest and if i held out my arm and was holding a shirt button, it would cover it.\r\nit seemed to slow down and speed up at times, a few times nearly coming to a stop and then it continued on as usual.\r\nit seemed to be at least as high above the trees as a low flying plane.\r\ni made sure not to jump to conclusions and rule out other possibilities.\r\nafter i lost sight of it, due to simply being out of viewing range, i realized that i had the closest encounter with a ufo in my life so far.\r\ni was excited about it and i wished i happened to have a pair of binnoculars handy or even a video camera handy.\r\nlike i said, it was a bright light and was flickering like a star.\r\nits main colors seemed to be white,yellow and orange.\r\nit did seem a little hazy around the object but the light itself was crystal clear.\r\ni have seen many planes fly over my house and i can swear on anything that this was the real thing.\r\ni tried to look as close as i could at it to see if maybe there was more to it than the light i was seeing but i could not make out any discernable details other than what i have already described.\r\nit was spherical and as bright as a star.\r\ni would judge and say that the object must have been a little more than 800 feet from my house, which would make the object somewhat smaller than a plane i suppose?\r\nit was not really big as far as i could tell.\r\nit was just a bright bobbing light that drifted past my house and was heading to who knows where?\r\nmy brothers who also live in my home have seen strange lights around 2:00 am on an almost regular basis but this is my personal first experience.\r\ni can only hope others may have spotted it and come forward as well.\r\nmy name is jason and i am 24 years old and i swear on my life that what i have written is the truth and nothing but the truth so help me god!\r\ni just recently moved to maine and i have been coming to go camping up here for years when i lived in nh.\r\nthis is one the most profound experiences of my life.\r\ni would also like to add that i was not dozing off as i had hoped i would (the film proved to be interesting) and i was not in a hypnogogic state.\r\nwhat i saw was real and not an insomnia induced illusion.\r\ni became very excited after the sighting and immediately came to mufon to write a report asap while all the details were fresh in my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:04:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

seeing a bright light in the middle of the night sky at around 5 a.M. i got out of bed and proceeded to take a look at it for myself.I was very surprised and convinced that it was a light bigger than any of the light from the city below and brighter than any of the stars around it at the tme i saw it 5:30 am the small dipper seemed to be above the bright object but the bright object seemed to be close but yet high up in the sky although it was atan easy eye glance.It gleamed a bright white color and seemed to be twinking ackwardly.\r\n\r\nthe object remained still but moved as if it were pinned to a coordenate of some sort for as the day got brighter the light moved higher up into the sky until it lost its clear apearnace and became too small to see, although it could still be noticed that it was in the sky but almost impossible to notice.\r\n\r\ni was very excited to see the object for i beleive it to be my second ufo sighting and although nothing majorly spectacular happened with the object so as to see movement or lighting effects or such, i was motivated to log on the internet immediately and try to search for some kind of online telescope if it existed, to attempt seeing it closer but i did not find any that could be on the watch for the actual look out at the sky i had above me.I searched some brief info on what to do if encountering a ufo sighting so i followed directions and began recording my observations on the brilliant object and took pictures along with it. i felt like reflecting a mirror at the light when it was still very bright and the night sky was darkbut i didnt find a smal enough mirror to carry twowards the window.\r\n\r\nhere are my recordings \r\n\r\n06:15a.M.: brilliant & twinkeling \r\n\r\n06:25 a.M:the object seems to be moving higher

road in joplin) i first noticed 4 jets with long contrails in the southern sky. this is not usual for this area and i am an aircraft enthusiast so it got my attention. i could not see the jets very well because they were so small in the sky, but i wondered why they would be moving so fast with what looked like their afterburners on full.\r\n\r\n i then turned to the left where they were headed and saw a triangular object that was at least 10 times bigger than the jets hovering in the south east sky. the object appeared to be like a pyramid on it's side, the top section or triangle was very reflective like it was made from a mirror. the other side i could see was dark gray and dull, it did not reflect very much light. when holding my arm straight out the object was the size of a dime in the sky. the point of the object was pointing south-to-south west.\r\n\r\n about 3 seconds after i saw the object it first looked like it fell down in the sky but i realized that what actually had happened was that the object moved south toward the horizon in less than half of a second. the total distance was about the length of my hand when holding my arm straight in front of me. while it moved south it also turned or rotated about 180 degrees. it was now pointing due east.\r\n\r\nabout two seconds later the object just disappeared as if it blinked out of the sky, i did not see it fly away or go in any direction. after that the aircraft continued on their course. i looked away for a second or two and when i looked back up the contrails were gone and i could not make out the jets very well because of their small size. it appeared that they slowed down or turned off their afterburners to stop making the contrails. \r\n\r\ni watched this area for about two hours after this event to see if anything further would happen. i did not see the object again, however i did see at least 4 more jet aircraft crossing the sky in various directions the whole time. at 15:15 i stopped watching and there were still 3 aircraft leaving contrails crossing the sky in this area. they seemed to be looking for something.\r\n\r\ni am a trained observer; i have worked most of my life as a paramedic, and a police officer. i am also a storm watcher for my area and an ex-pilot. i have spent a lot of time looking at the sky. i know what i saw was not a balloon, commercial or military aircraft, cloud, or anything other than what it appeared to be. it appeared to be a metallic, intelligently controlled craft that maneuvers faster than a human body could withstand in g forces.\r\n\r\ni have included a computer drawing that i created to diagram the event as closely as possible.","distance":"Over One

east window of our house at 231 ave. d, snohomish, wa. i was getting ready for school and i looked out the window to the east, toward the sky to see the weather. this was probably around 8 a.M. i am not sure of the time of year, however, i do know that on this particular day, it was already light outside and the sky was clear.\r\n\r\ni remember noticing what i thought was a bright star way up in the sky toward the s. east and wondering why there was a star shinning when the sun was already up. the object i was seeing was approximately the same size, shape and color of a bright, nighttime star, only it was not dark out at the time. i took a longer look to see exactly what this was, still thinking it had to be a star of some kind.\r\n\r\nsuddenly and with unimaginable speed, the object shot straight across the sky from its point in the s. east, to a new point in the n. east sky, stopping just as suddenly as it had taken off. after sitting perfectly still in the new location for a short while, the object once more shot at incredible speeds, straight toward a new location, this time in the s. east sky again, yet at a lower part of the sky than before. and like before, it stopped just as fast as it had shot across the sky.\r\n\r\nby this time i could not believe what i was seeing and called for my mother to come look. from what i remember, we probably watched the object together for around 20 minutes. during this time, the object would either be sitting perfectly still in the sky, or it would be zooming in a straight line at mind-boggling speeds, to stop instantly at a new location again. i remember how amazed my mother and i both were at what we were seeing. it was truly unbelivable how fast the object could go and how fast it could stop.\r\n\r\nmy mother finally had to leave for work and i started out for school. i could still see the object, but it was smaller now, like it was further up in the sky. i was hoping to show it to my science teacher when i got to school, but it vanished before i could get there.\r\n\r\ni don't know what we saw that morning in 1962-3, but i realized then that whatever it was, it absolutely went much too fast for anything on earth. if i were to see this same, or similar object, now, in 2007, i would still believe there was nothing from earth that could possibly go so unbelievably fast across so much of the sky and stop so instantly too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path then

i love going in my backyard at night because it seems as though i have a perfect view of the stars. i lit up and looked up as i usually do; the stars were brilliant last night as well. i stared above when i noticed an object, i kept my eye on it because i am, honestly, always looking for something out of the ordinary. i believed it was a plane for the first, perhaps, 7-8 seconds i had my eye on it until it dropped feverishly and then took off towards the direction it came from with unearthly speed. i was startled but it was late and believed i may have just been seeing things until i looked back up at the stars and believed that i saw stars moving. this was the second object i viewed. as i watched this object, which was not as illuminated as the other, the other came back into my eyesight. i watched it as it sped with alarming speed and dropped to a very dangerous level and flowed over towards my house. it almost glided with such ease, there was no sound, and the movements were so fluid. it almost seemed like this object was on a reconaissance mission. it had stopped on a dime right around where i was standing, only for a second or two, and then continued moving. the color emitted from this object was amazing. it was almost like the entire object was on fire, that's what the color resembled, and there was a motion to it... it seemed as though it were spinning like a top, that's my best description. at this time i became extremely alarmed, i did have my phone on me which is adapted with a camera and tried snapping a few photos but the delay really screwed me and i wound up with nothing of value. i walked into the front yard, hoenstly because i was scared. there was a pickup stopped infront of my house and i went over to it. i asked the guy driving if he saw what i did and he said yes. he then pointed out the other object, the blue one, a few hundred yards away. i started walking back to my house because i just had an uneasy feeling and the man in the pick up told me not to scream or draw any attention to myself, which i though to myself as \"yea obviously guy\" but i just said okay. i looked up as i walked back to the overhang of my garage and took a closer look at the blue object that was just kind of hanging in space. what i saw i believed to be the front of the craft, i dont know why but at the time thats what i thought. it was almost like looking at a dinner plate but flipped on its side and looking at it head on. there were three blue lights, top, middle, and bottom. the middle light was not as bright as the other two. it began moving and i watched it ascend into the night sky until it basically disappeared. there was no sight of either of the crafts again and i was feeling a little nervous/anxious and made my way back into the comfort of my home. i know it was late at night, or early morning which ever you prefer but i'd love to know if anyone else had seen the same thing i had and had any footage or photos of the event. thanks.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:07:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8365,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7195828,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11142007-0011","longitude":-73.9998531,"occurred":1195035300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

this time, central , i was outside the house, alone, having a cigarette.  i just looked up and saw three white lights. bright then any other stars i ever saw.(can't remeber if there were stars out that night) i stood quietly and noticed that all three lights were moving real, real slow, heading north, as if they were one.  i remeber thinking, this is it, this is what a ufo looks like, i gotta tell someone.  i realized then that a few minutes ago, i had saw a relative near by.  i just looked to see if the relative was seeing what i was seeing and by the time i looked back to find it, it was gone. the relative was gone too, but had just stepped back into their home and did not see what i had saw. i feel today, like it must of knew the exact time i would look away.  anyway, after it was gone, i had to second guess myself as to what i just saw, like, \"did i just see that?\" then i searched for an outline of it but couldn't tell if it was still there, the sky was too dark and plus there were street lights near by.  i've told people what i saw that night but they smile and say \"oh! yeah!\"  i just found this website and thought, why not tell.  that night i couldn't sleep in my bed, in my home, i went to the relative's house and told what i had just saw, i tried to describe it then, saying, it's a circle, no-a rectangle, no-a diamond, the finally i blurted, a triangle, then my relative says, your already lying, you can't even tell me the right shape.  so, i say 'can i sleep on the couch tonight?\"  and i did.  even today, i don't look up in the sky when i walk home.  i saw it once, don't need to see it

friends house. i was in a slightly highten and agitated state as i was about to having an important discussion with my friend. it was fairly dark on his street and i could see lights from a near by shopping center lighting up the horizon.\r\n\r\n it had been a fairly cloudy day and now the clouds were fog-like and light and stars could be seen here and there through them. i was talking to my friend in his car while standing in the driveway on the frontside of home that faces south and it seemed to be just like any other night with traffic sounds from the nearby hwy 99 and calvine rd. i took a break from talking a turned around to breath heavily and just looked up in the sky to the southwest about 2-3 miles away and notice a huey army helicopter (which seems fairly normal for this area except for the time)flying aray from me towards the southwest and a search light or lights going up from the ground. it appearred to me to be light-pollution reflecting on the low level clouds.\r\n\r\nwhen i looked in a southwestern direction towards the freeway and consumnes jr. college, i could see a typical huey army helicopter flying around just at cloud level and a seach light in the clouds coming up from the ground about 2-4 miles away. i then saw a dim siloetted black/gray arrow-head shaped object moving behind some thin low level weak clouds. it appeared that there was a large arrow-head black/gray object moving against the black sky background that caught my attention.\r\n\r\n i then notice a very large (747 sized) silent triangular \"arrow-head\" shaped craft with 3 rows of fairly large yellow lights or windows dotted around it in an arrow-head pattern flying through and among the low level clouds in a semi-circular pattern and then disappeared/vanished in the sky. the craft moved in from the southwest sky and was heading east, but turned and was pointed north towards the city of sacramento, california when it came through the clouds with the lights on it from below, and then turned towards the west and disappeared. it appeared as if the craft was circling and had turned to a new heading and left. there was no \"plane\" noise or sound except for the helicopter sound. i was stunned and turned to tell my friend who was talking in the car but it was gone before he could see it. it almost seemed like a surreal projection of an object as it was so silent, but seemed to still move through weak cloud cover. there did not appear to be any engine noise or lights from the rear of the craft but it looked like there could have been some kind of distortion formed by the cloud in the back of the arrow-head, as if the clouds were swirling around the rear. there were many lights on the craft it appears to have about 50-100 rectangular/square lights equally spaced appart without any pulse or glowing. at least through the clouds it looked like a plane with bright windows but as it broke the clouds they looked more like large yellow rectangular surface lights.\r\n\r\ni never reported or have seen a ufo. i am not sure what it was but i know it was no plane. i felt like i was watching a movie and could not believe what i had just seen or if i had just seen it.

minutes from home, traveling north, in a residential area, when i noticed a very bright light approaching from a northeasterly direction.  it caught my eye because it seemed much brighter than an airplane, and it was obviously not a planet (too big and too close).  only a minute or two later, it was suddenly on my right, moving soundlessly and very slowly, at almost eye level as i bent down slightly to watch it out of my righthand window.  it was much, much too low, and moving too slowly, to be a plane coming in for a landing; rockford's airport is on the very southern edge of town, and i was in the northern part of town.  i continued on for a few seconds before the enormity of what had happened sank in and then i pulled over, stopped and looked out my rear window to see if i could still see it, but it was gone.  it all happened very quickly, but it was unmistakably a ufo.  it was black, a triangle shape, with bright white lights on the underside.  there were no red lights or blinking lights.  my mind was very still and i experienced no fear, but afterwards i had the strange feeling that it was there at that moment on purpose, wanting me to see it.  my car experienced no electrical effects that i am aware of (i did not have my radio on) during or after the experience, but i felt a heightened sensation within myself.  my feeling is that it was very

fairly high above it to the left was what i thought was the harvest moon but quite red. it began to smoothly lower its self and shrink in diameter from the sky as we aproached  closer to town. we both were quite excited by what we were seeing. we were gonna go see this thing close. it dropped into a families back yard. at that time the verticle disc was approximately ten/twelve feet in diameter- passing between a large tree and a swingset,by a metal pool. we were climbing the exit ramp to get a better look. it became more intriuging,because the disc of light didnt break up as it passed between a tall tree on one side and a swing set on the other. i thought the light was being beamed like a flashlight and only the disc was being seen.Nope it didnt break up,nor did it emitt any light. it quickly jumped to the roof of the house and shrank again to about a foot in diameter-then traversed the ridge and the centerline of the roof(like a roofer would measure it) and took off-straight up.Things that were note worthy were as i looked at the side of the disc the side was not there- appeared two dimentional. it did not emit any light or create any shadows though it was very bright. when i say it went up- it  headed in that direction however it may have gone out too,but i suspect it went up faster than the eye mind can percieve it. \r\n\r\ntoday the closet thing i would compare the color to is a red lazor beam. and like a lazor how the disc of light is reflected off the surface of what you point to. similiar again except it would have focused in the air like on a piece of cellofane.  i saw no other object in the sky that this may have come  from or went back too. great fun! very different,and it could have detected that we were watching and it got with its business and left. \r\nagain it was the color of a red lazor and could change size,like some one focusing a beam of a flashlight. it seemed to only be in two dimentions length and width  was very brite, but
