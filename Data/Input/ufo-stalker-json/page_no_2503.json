night.\r\n\r\nhttp://img250.Imageshack.Us/img250/585/ufopsdyc2.Jpg\r\n\r\nthat is the crude drawing i made of what i saw about 10 minutes after seeing it. \r\n\r\ni was at my friend's house, a few of us got together to play some ping pong and hang out. none of us were drinking or using drugs. everyone else was inside and it was me and my friend matt outside having a smoke and talking about college football. i was standing on the ground in the yard angled toward him, he was on the back porch facing away from the house and away from what i saw. i just noticed the formation out of the corner of my eye as i was smoking a cigarette and then i turned toward it to my left. as soon as i saw it i pointed at the sky and yelled \"what the #^#$ is that dude?\" he was facing the other direction, up on a porch, and in that 1-2 second span that it took him to get down off the porch the lights got smaller until they disappeared completely. he did not get to see them. he knew that i was serious though from my tone of voice and expression when i said something like \"they were in formation!\"\r\n\r\nthe lights were not high above my head, they were well above the horizon, probably about halfway from the horizon to the top of the sky. they were small and elongated horizontally. they were not crisp edges like in my drawing, they were sort of radiating and blurred around the edges. there were 7 or 8 of them, i am not sure if there was just one light at the top of the formation. the way they disappeared was almost like a \"fizzle\". they shrank to pinpoints from their original flared appearance and then disappeared completely. i should note that unlike in my rough drawing these lights were exactly perfect in relation to one another - meaning, all distances between and across were perfectly measured. they were all exactly the same size. also, i cannot say for sure whether or not they were moving because i only viewed them for a few seconds at best. they could have been moving very slowly as i saw them. i am actually inclined to believe that they were moving very slowly. \r\n\r\ni live very close to the 45th parallel in northern michigan, near lake huron. these lights were exactly south.

was driving home, easterly, and about .5 miles from my driveway, i observed a cluster of intense lights to the nw of my position. moving to the se. thought at first it was an aircraft, but it had r/g/b lights. not the usual r/g/w of aircraft.\r\nwhen i pulled into my driveway i was going to run into the house to get my binoculars. but as soon as i got out of my car, i saw it was right behind my house, above the woods. it was moving silently to the ne at maybe 15 mph. i estimate it was no more than 100 yards away. hard to judge height because it was so dark. my guess was it was well below the 500 foot faa minimum. i observed it for approximately 20 seconds before i decided to make a dash for the binoculars. even though they were right inside my back door, when i returned with the binoculars the object was gone. the lights were in a chevron shaped configuration. instead of jumping back into the car, i ran down the road about 100 yards to see around the woods. i saw it in the distance, but it was too far away to see any detail even with the binoculars.\r\nwithin a minute i heard the sound of a jet going into re-heat to the se of me. wether it was an aircraft scrambled to intercept, or on normal maneuvers, i do not know.\r\nthey do use the area over lake huron to the east for mock combat, but in 3 years living here i never heard or saw them do it in the dark. only during daylight hours.\r\ni live in an area that is fairly unpopulated. nearest occupied home is about .5 miles from me. at the time there was no moon, but mostly clear skies. very little, if any ,ambient light in the area. it was quite black out. wind was from the sw at 10-15 mph.\r\nif the b light was in front of craft,the direction of flight,then the r/g light position were opposite of what they should be on normal aircraft. no local airports within 20 miles of my house. i am fairly sure the closest is a vfr airport with no operational night lights.\r\nafter i settled my nerves, i timed and retraced my movements to get the total time of the event. i think about 1 minute of the total time was what i spent actually looking at the object.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

were four round objects in the sky. you could see little windows in them. i dropped the laundry basket and said \"what the hell is that?\"they were flying above the tree tops, with no noise.They were

them i was reasoning that it could not be birds as the sun would not  reflect off of them.They could not be planes as they were silent and skimmed the tops of the trees.  suddenly as we were all watching them. three of them went to form a point for a triangle, the fourth one was on the side flying along. we looked back to the spot where we first spotted them and there were six more of them

we got really close we could see that it was emitting its own light and had lights around the center and was luminous.  i didn't stay to continue to watch it cause i thought we would be late.  i even had a camera and failed to take the picture.  it was quite a treat to share with my brother-in-law.  i remember frank saying that he expected as we got closer to see a string hanging from it cause he thought from a distance back on the road that it was a kite, and was really bugging out when he didn't see one and began to see the luminous lights around its center.  i don't think anyone even noticed or paid any attention to it.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\ncharlie\r\n\r\nit was over the water i would say, where shore road is near cesar's bay bazar, and we were going south on bay parkway when we saw it.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

the perseids from august. then, ahead of us and at a seemingly low altitude, and pretty close distance-wise as well, a bright green fireball entered and left our field of vision in about 3-5 seconds. it was moving quite quickly and of a distinctly spherical shape. whatever it was, it was certainly not a \"normal\" denizen of the night sky, esp. over harsh city lights.\r\n\r\nmy paint sketch

(about 8pm)i heard several aircraft flying above the dolomite mountain range (just north of roverado in piano,italy) there were three aircraft (itaf tornados, 99%sure) flying at about 12000-14000 feet. i have not witnessed any aircraft before at this time of night fling exercises. they had their anticollision lights on and were flying south easterly following another smaller white light. after about one minute one of the aircraft broke formation and flew towards the southwest in an orbit. the other two aircaft sped up to intercept the light when it changed to a much larger size/bright orange and sped way out in front of them. it almost seemed like it was trying to see their pace ability until i lost sight of them. meanwhile the other aircraft that had split off had started to follow a sperate white light in its orbit. the white light then dissapeared from the sky. a few minutes later the aircraft met up in an area southeast of where they were before. another odd thing was one of the aircraft turned on their spotlight when they rejoined the formation. most european aircraft have these spotlights on the right side of the aircraft for aircraft id. the formation then seemed to search the area of the sky then return to the south. durning my observation which lasted about 10 minutes there was a lot of afterburner noise from the aircraft. i am an experienced flyer in the military, and i have a lot of experience identifying aircraft by sound and behavior. this is the first time i have witnessed a chase event. hopefully this description is clear to all that is

hills n.M minutes after leaving loco hills husband named jose mexican asked me if something was wrong and i said no and i asked why? and he said that something is wrong with the radio because the radio started making static noises and the station went out and he was messing with the stereo he was mad and turned it off and then he started complaining that it seemed as if the truck was going by itself he said it seemed as if the motor was turning but without the truck being on and he kept steping on the gas and the truck seemed to being going at the same speed we were going at about 70 miles the truck is standard and then all a sudden he turned to me and asked me if we were in a dream and i said no (i thought he just wanted attention) all the time we were traveling i was thinking to myself that if i should have gone back to him since we were recently seperated we were on our way to pick up some furniture that i had in lovington, nm im a lovington new mexico resident born and raised there so anyways he asked me to pinch him on his hand to see if we were not dreaming (i thought now he really wants attention) and he asked me if he can pinch me on my hand and i said yeah why? before he said anything he pinched me and of course it hurt and i said ouch! and i said what is wrong? and then he said dont be afraid he said on my left side look slowly out the window and he said to me am i seeing things or whatever is out the window is it really there? and i looked and sure enough there was a silver disk floating next to us as we were traveling it seemed to be looking at us as it followed us slowly he told me as we came to a curve make sure i dont lose sight of it as he paid attention to the road it seemed to go in front of us and within seconds it disappeared and we were amazed and speechless and we said to one another i wonder what that was as we neared maljamar on top of the mountains of caprock i spoted another ship (i dont think it was the same one) a much bigger it was moving across the mountain slowly this ship seemed to have some silver purpleish color and it also disappeared after a few minutes of looking at it maybe three minutes three to five minutes (i think) after it disappeared we came upon the curve of maljamar on top of the curve of maljamar to the left side we came upon a very huge ship!!! it was a pale color lighter than gray and it was floating or suspended in the air a few feet off the ground and my husband was scared! i asked him to pull over so we can look at it and he said no he did slow down we studied the ship for a minute or two and it disappeared and we drove to lovington confused and speechless and we lost an hour of time he also was mad at me because he said that i had told him that from artesia to lovington is 65 miles and we took two hours to get there and he did not want to talk about the incident any longer and up to this day whenever i see him he does not want to talk or mension anything about it. what i saw was real my family laughs at me and makes jokes. but to me it was the most amazing thing on earth i have ever seen, for the ship was very huge! there is a little more to my story but ill leave these words for now unspoken. the unspoken words are of dreams and going into the ocean in strange ships. but this is all for now. i do plan to write a book about it, but i am not a good writer. i

az. i am still hazy on the date, but recall a well known band named rocket from the crypt was playing across town that night, so searching their tour records might shed some light on the exact date of the sighting.\r\n\r\nat approximately 7:30pm az. time, i was staring up at the beautiful night sky outside the venue before the show. my body was facing west as i could see the last traces of light from the sunset that day. out of the east, at an alarming right of speed appeared a round ball of light a little brighter than your avg. star heading west. i could tell by my field of vision that it was at least 13,000 ft high and was not a bug flying a few feet over of me. it looked very out of place in the night sky due to its immense speed and trajectory, and thats what made me take notice.\r\n\r\nit made an \"s\" like maneuver as it headed in a westerly direction until it was directly overhead at which time it stopped on a dime with almost no deceleration and made two perfect concentric circles about the size of a penny in a counter clock-wise motion. then it instantly shot out in a curve like path all the way to the western part of the sky disappearing over the horizon into the sunset.\r\n\r\nthe complete length of time it took the object to traverse the whole scope and view of the sky from horizon east to horizon west was around 3-4 seconds. one can only speculate what that rate of speed is. there were a few other people standing outside around the area at the time, but due to the rate of speed of the sighting/craft, it was apparently only witnessed by me that night.\r\n\r\ni know that the object was not a shooting star or meteor, as they do not move like that. as well, this object had no debris trail. it was not any helicopter or aircraft that i am aware of. that kind of acceleration/deceleration would kill any living being on board using our current human technology.\r\n\r\ni did not see the object for the rest of the night. i feel it was not of

id i will attempt the spelling of the lake...Please don't judge me on this.  i think it is lake ponderillie, now i will try it the way it sounds.....Ponderay,\r\n\r\ni worked on that base for a year and a half as a journeymen hvac supervisor.  i also lived in great falls mt from 1967 to 1996 and there was a lot of activity around there (malmstrom? afb. please contact me if you have anything to

way, faceing (west) to see venus.  out of the south west, traveling quickly, four, red orange bright (like (neon) orbs headed my way, northeast.  as soon as i saw them i ran and got my husband.(it took 5 seconds, to and back to lights)  we watched them fly across the sky, equal distant apart,soundless.  they were low.  we watched them till they hit the tree line,(old oak trees) and could not see them anymore.   they looked like the size of a high moon, from ground to orb. speaking of moon, sighting was during darkside of moon. the orbs, were some what in the usual fight patterns of plane travel in our area. there were no other planes in the sky. \r\nwe are baby boomers, we have seen alot of things in the sky but nothing like this.  we tried to use reason to explain what we saw to ourselfs. we thought maybe because they were in  the flight pattern, they flew in for the air show.  we wondered if they were dropping something off at argonne national lab. weather ballowns even, but how come if they were,no one reported seeing them.\r\nwe asked others in our area if anyone had seen any thing, but they only looked at us funny.  we found nothing about it in the paper or on the radio the next day. we could not beleive no one had seen it and reported it to the news, local even.  but, then again we hadn't either.  (it's not like your in the phone book.)  i tried to call w.G.N. next day, but called at the wrong time, and was not well recieved. did not call back.  people when we told them were not comfortable hearing about it.  so were are not comfortable with telling it.  i just wanted to know what it was.  but, i will say this.  i am glad i saw it. we do not feel the need to prove it to anyone, because to us, it was very cool finialy seeing something that you could say, with out a doubt, what you had seen was a ufo to you.  i am not saying they were from outer space, all were are saying is, we have never seen anyting like this in the sky before.  \r\nwe did not take pictures of it. but, when i went to the national ufo reporting web sight, the sighting seen in portland, is what we saw, only four of them and alot closer.  and that is why i am reporting this to you now.  thanks for your time.
