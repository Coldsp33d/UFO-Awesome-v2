by the river at my home, with 3 visitors, i ventured to look up and around for a peek at the stars which were fairly bright.(hoping to see satellites fly over.)\r\ni noticed a flash of light seemingly coming from an aircraft coming north, afterward realizing that this kind of flash was unreasonably bright and large for an ordinary aircraft.(nighttime photography? not likely!)\r\nit was also to far east of the flight path (victor37) that is used for north-south service by regional jets.)\r\ni looked for a few more seconds and turned away to fit back in with the visitors.\r\nthen i caught a second flash from the corner of my eye and looked up again but could not focus in time, i kept looking and then the third flash caught my eye dead on. at this point i sensed it to be more like a round ball due to the size of it and the height i estimated it to be traveling at.(i would guess maybe between 30 to 60 feet in diameter.)\r\nthe trajectory or flight path(estimated from three flashes.) was from the southern skyline(barely visible.)directly toward us at an assumed height of approximately 5000 to 20000 feet.(i have some experience with flying small aircraft but this should be construed as an educated guess.)the path north was concluded with a total of 3 flashes, after which i couldn't see anymore flashes.\r\nthe next moment, maybe 1/2 minute after the first sighting, i was searching the sky for satellites with the naked eye, to show them to my visitors, when i noticed another flash, this time in a due east direction (which is behind me, while the first three flashes were to my left,facing to the south.)at this time i had mentioned the first few flashes to my visitors of whom only one saw the last one coming north.\r\ni exclaimed \"there it goes again!\" and pointed at the direction eastward where it just flashed, when it flashed once more in the east.\r\ni continued to expect another flash and just as i had the impulse to turn my head back, ready to give up, there was another flash! but way down toward the east this time, (i estimated about at least 100 miles away.)\r\nthen maybe a 1/2 minute later as i was looking in the western sky, i caught yet another flash directly opposite in direction of the two easterly ones, and right over the hill which i faced, to the west of my property, which is close by and high, my viewing angle about 40 degrees up,(distance between the eastern and western flashes had to be at least 100 or more miles.)\r\n\r\nthat concluded the sighting of the flashes, and a short conversation ensued about possible aliens.\r\n\r\ni cannot reasonably deny the exsistence of aliens, nor do i want to, as we ourselves could very well be aliens to another species of life out there and i like to keep an open mind.(i am however quite interested in the subject and look up the sites for new information from time to time.)\r\n\r\nthe afterthoughts!\r\n\r\ni concluded quickly that the path from above the physically visible skyline to the south, to a point above me, where \"it\" seemed to have turned east, to the last flash in the eastern direction, to the last flash visible to me in the west, was too long for any aircraft (even a fighter at mach 1.)to have covered in the space of two to three minutes.(i figure about 200-250 miles total.)\r\n\r\nfurthermore; the speed at which the flashes traversed the path i described, seemed a little fast for normal travel, and besides that, there was no noise at all. \r\nthe directional change was at a perfect 90 degree angle from s-n to w-e, and one at 180 degrees from e to w to end up flashing one last time in the west.\r\nit also seemed to occur in my mind that somehow the directional change from nothbound to eastbound seemed quite quick, as the next flash i discovered was well on the way east, while i had just viewed the last flash coming north seemingly a split second ago (i had said 1/2 minute.)\r\n\r\nthe time between the last flash in the east and the flash in the west, was at an unreasonable distance apart for the speed that even fast military aircraft would fly, in my opinion.\r\nalso to fly at a speed which would break the sound barrier, a noise of some kind would have to be heard if the object was indeed a man made craft or of a solid nature, and in this case (i live in a very quiet secluded area which is always very peaceful.)there was no noises at all, including when \"it\" had to have flown over and made the 90 degree turn to head east, whereas normal flights are mostly always heard as they pass even further to the west.(in my area the usual \"overflights\" are mostly from s to n(10 miles to the west,) or from se to nw.(passing about 3 miles north east of my location.\r\n\r\nthe only military flight path which is used here is a path which comes from the se, on a radial of about 310 degrees or nw, from the direction of the trenton airbase in ontario, to north bay, and from there goes west or straight east. there is no experimental activity here at all, unless it is unpublished, which i doubt because of the aproaches to the north bay airport, and my property being just se outside the control zone for aproach.\r\nthe practice area for student flying is within our space above the house, but no after dark  flying occurs as we do not have ifr training here in this part of the zone, and the flashes were above the practice zone and outside that particular area in any case. (above 5000'agl.)\r\n\r\ni have often wondered about this situation and finally decided to write it out and send it.\r\n\r\n i would not push the point of having seen an \"alien\" craft as i simply did not see \"any\" craft at all, just the unseemingly bright(very white, like a very strong auto headlight.) and round like a transparent ball lit up from the inside.\r\nthe flashes were very quick on and off, but longer than a flash of a camera. if i had to guess at how long, i would say from .25 to .5 of a second duration.\r\ni also thought the flashshes to the east (or the west.) would not have shown if it was a landing light mounted on a wing and facing forward away from me. each flash still gave the impression of being totally round.\r\ni have not discussed this any further with anyone including the visitors of which one admitted to have seen it, but was not receptive to the idea of having seen something other than human originated light.(i understood the reason for this was a spiritual one.)\r\n\r\ni conclude with stating that i am well educated, and have reasonable enough education in aircraft systems and avionics to have graduated at 93% with honours (a&p mechanic.), and that i have an excellent aptitude for technology and science among more certificates and diplomas in the mechanical and engineering fields.\r\n\r\npersonally, i like the thought of maybe having seen something which could possibly be of an extra terrestrial nature, as i am expectant to find that such ocurrences are due and forthcoming in our own quest for knowledge of the universes.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\njohn

bronx river parkway, going south, just opposite the mt. vernon (metro-north) train station. i was driving my 1979 buick regal (with t-tops off) when i saw a boomerang shaped object going south (parallel to the parkway) over my head. i was going about 60 mph as the object passed overhead. when i got a good focus on this object i slowed down and pulled into the right hand lane, my speed was now about 5 or 10 mph as was the speed of the other cars who also saw this object. we all just crept along looking up at this object. it made no sound at all and also slowed down to match our speed. it was about as high as a 20 or 30 story building (judging by the height of the apartment buildings just to the west of the parkway which vary from 5 to 12 (aprox) stories. when it got just past the train station it stopped, as did all of the cars going south on the parkway. it paused for a few seconds and then pivoted/turned to the east and started to move again but now was going east and picked up speed to about 50 or 60 mph. as i was looking at it along with the other cars on the parkway it was clear as could be in the shape of a boomerang but huge.... similar to a very large jet airliner but no body just the wings and much larger...Maybe 3 or 4 times larger than a 747. i saw no colors, only luminous panels covering the entire bottom of the object. these panels were rectangles and some of them were emitting bright light and some were barley putting out any light at all. it continued to the east for maybe 20 seconds to the top of my view east and was above some houses and trees when it made another pivot/turn to the south this time. it started to move south for 2 or 3 seconds when it accelerated so fast that it looked like a solid white line pointing south, the object \"stretched\" to the south and then the back or the line \"caught up \" with the front of the line and it was gone. people looking at it from the parkway, all of whom had come to just about a full stop, kind of looked at each other and then resumed thier driving. nobody said a word about what had just happened, they just went about their business....This was very weird . i had a friend in the car with me but i really don't remember saying anything to him while this was happening. when the object was gone we did talk about it but , looking back now, neither of us was scared or panicked. we both told other friends about this object and even drew sketches of it...Nobody believed us! and i never read or heard about anyone else seeing this object. to this day it is as clear in my mind as the night it happened..\"\r\nthis statement was copied from \"http://www.Ufoevidence.Org/sightings/report.Asp?Id=973\" where i posted it on 1/16/2004 8:57:53 am. i have also fixed some of my spelling

and we lived at the ymca kansas city kansas that at that time rented rooms. gary said he had walked across the desert from california and was guided to kansas city kansas by a mother ship and every night gary would go to the roof and attempt to show us ufo's and gary was always dressed in a flak jacketand a crew cut that looked like he came out of world war ii. one night me and three of my friends along with gary went in my car to see if we could spot a ufo and gary kept pointing to the sky and said there is the mother ship. somehow i managed to be in the country either in western wyandotte county ks or eastern leavenworth county ks and somehow we ended up in a desolate location. i remember looking and next to my car to the left in the air was an airplane as i would describe as out of world war ii suspended in the air all lights off and the next thing i remember is that the plane(object) was to the right of my car looking directly at us in the air and then was above the car for how long i don't know as i must have lost tract of time and finally was facing us over a tree looking directly at the car and then finally was back in the same position to the left. the plane then ejected a gold/yellow ball of light from the rear of the plane and i drove off. i never had a memory of the plane going from one place to the next and somehow i must have lost time. i along with gary and three of my friends drove to the turner district in wyandotte county to the inland cold storge area(caves) next to the kansas(kaw)river. as i was driving and this had to be around 3am i looked over and saw a green paneled van and the driver was parked on the road looking toward my car as he was on side dirt or gravel road that was next to the river.I remember telling everyone in the car look at that nut as this man had on dark(black) glasses and had on black cap. as we drove past him a siren came in behind me and i stopped as it was the wyandotte county sherrif's department and they wanted to know why we were out there so late and i told one of the deputies as they checked our id that we were looking for ufo's and they told us to go home as neither deputy laughed at us or doubted our word. the next day i along with one of my friends went to gary's room and he never answered and we checked at the front desk and the clerk said he had not seen gary but would check his room as when he did gary was not in his room and whatever belongings he had were gone as we never seen gary again. a week later on saturday afternoon i was on the third floor ymca shower getting ready for my date and i remember like it happened today the outer door to the restroom opened and a young man in his teens or twenties at least six feet tall with flowing blond hair and wearing dark black glasses and some type of white clothes walked directly to the shower as by this time i went to the shower door as it had a small window as to look out and opened the door and this young man grabed my groin and yanked my penis and then turned around and left as i was stunned and shocked. i dried off and got dressed and went to the desk and ask the man at the desk if he saw anyone leave and he said no by then another man came down and said he had been taking a shower on the second floor shower and the same young man walked to the shower door opened it looked at him and left without touching him. i was dating ny future wife at the time and told her and her parents as we sort of brushed this off at the time as i never contacted the police as i was not hurt but only reported this as i said to the man at the desk who wrote an incident report.In 1968 i entered the united states army at fort leonard wood mo and during basic training i hurt my leg and went to the base hospital,and was exaimed as i hurt my femur bone during training and my leg was exrayed and on the exray it clearly showed a large object lodged on my femur bone as the doctors were not sure if it was a tumor or not and said they may need to operate as it was an unusual object.I was never operated on but have had exray's taken at different times over the years and most recent again at the va the last year as i seen that this object is still on the femur bone. i am now 61 and remember this like it was yesterday and off and on have attempted to contact mufon in kc and california and just recently in new york as i have made contact recently but have never told my story yet and i'm waiting to hear back as i need to know what happened that week and if i have an implant on my femur bone and and i along with gary and my friends taken aboard this ship and also if the young man who touched me was an alien and implanted me. i have tried piecing the puzzle together about this incident that occurred in 1967that was 40 years ago as i am now 61 but i remember this like it happened today every detail.I have more to add  but will do so

returning home after my coast guard auxiliary meeting that night.  i happened to look to my left and saw a  streak of green light in the direction of the nearby potomac river, seeminlgy over it.  if i did just not happen to look that way, i would not have seen it.  there was no sound.  it resembled the bright green light seen in fireworks.  it gave me the impression of a large firework traveling horizontally.  there are a lot of trees in that area, and it was difficult to see whether the object's track continued and that my view of it was just obscured, or whether it was just a brief glimpse, almost as if the phenomenon appeared and then disappeared, as in going in and out of dimensions or 'planes.'  there might have been a leading edge of plasma ball at the southward end, but it all happened so fast that i cannot be sure.  i have that impression in memory.  i remember feeling good about the sighting; having a feeling of elation at the time.  the light streak was bright and beautiful, and i like fireworks.  however, i was also struck that this just did not seem normal--a firework-like phenomenon traveling horizontally.  this occurred in the flyway (landing and takeoff path) of washington reagan national airport, and i had the thought that what i saw could have been a military flare of the type that i believe many nations use to dispense from aircraft as decoys to spoof anti-aircraft missiles.  after i saw the phenomenon and lost track of if, i was hoping that i would get a chance to see it again in the sky, but could not.  i was also wondering if other people in cars or observing from a stationary point on the ground had seen anything.  i felt frustrated at being around other drivers but having no way to just stop them and say, did you see what i saw?  i was wondering if the phenomenon would become stationary and then people would stop and get out of their cars to watch it, but that did not happen.  i do not know what i saw that night, but it seemed to be more of a plasma or streak of light than an object.  i would say it resembled a large, green flare, traveling horizontally.  i looked around as i got off the parkway and onto 395 south, but saw nothing more.

all the pump stations for the city was off line.I had been on the job for only 2 weeks or so.I had made a stop at one of my pump holes,(man holes).It was across the street from one of the many camper lots that were set up for the flooded out residence of the city.I got my truck set up pumping and it takes several minutes,(about 15) to load the truck.As soon as i got started i had a five gallon bucket i was using for a seat with not a lot to do but wait on my truck to load.I have always been a big time star gazer so i kinda enjoyed my chances to do just that while i waited for my truck to do its thing.Well anyway,as i was sitting there looking around somthing caught my eye coming in my direction from over the campers.At first i thought it was a plane or something but i reallized it was only about 100 feet high,(if that)and was going so slow that i could have ran and stayed under it if it had maintained the same speed and direction.I jumped up off my bucket and ran around to the other side of my truck trying to figure out what to heck it was.It kinda put me in mind of one of the stealth planes in the way it was shaped and it had maby 8 lights around the front.I have a hard time describing the color of the lights,they were all the same and i guess you could call them white but they were the coolest lights i have ever saw.The object moved straight above where i was standing in a state of awww and it turned to port with no apparent banking,it was like it was pretty much floating.The craft did have windows but i could not make out any thing of the inside nor did i see anybody.Once it made its turn it began to climb and gane speed at an incredable rate,from being straight above me to out of sight took maby 3 seconds.It was crasy!!!!Also the craft made no noise what so ever!!!!I know the government would want to tell me that i saw a swamp gas meteorite weather balloon radar deflector with dummies flying it but they can kiss my nevermind!!!!I know what i saw and nothing will ever change that.It is about time for the people that we put in to office to run this country on our behalf to stop thinking there better than the rest of the world!!!We the people are what gives them the resources to gain the information that they are keeping from us like we are all a bunch of kids or something.It is way past time for us to be given the truth about all the things going on.If you guys need any help in your research,please give me a chance.If i had access to the quality video equipment and enough funding to quit my day job i would dedicate my life to the research.Cameras pointing skyward from dusk till dawn seven nights a week and more!!!!The truth is out there and we all have the right to know what the government knows and with enough rock solid evidence they will have to come clean eventually.I have always beleaved in ufo's and that night in challmette changed my life forever.If you need someone else to help in this ongoing project,please keep me in mind.Well,good luck hunting and maby we will all know the real truth soon.I will contact you again if i get lucky enough to witness another swamp gas meteorite weather balloon radar deflector with dummies flying it.Thank you very much for your time.William wilson p.S.Watch the nasa channel when they send up the shuttle,they try to hide objects by changing camera shots but there are things zooming back and forth and up and down that aint no satalite or space junk.Once again thanks for listoning,bill","distance":"21-100

should give you a little background... it seems like for years there has been some type of ufo experiences involving my sister ever since she was a young girl... she is in her mid 50's now.... when i was younger, about 8 or 9 years old, i moved into her room just after she moved out of the house... not long after that i was awoken by a whirring sound and lights in my window overlooking our back yard.... i thought it was kinda strange because it was like 3 or 4 in the morning... anyway i thought it was a street sweeper driving through our alley.... but when i got up to take a peek, i was shocked and terrified to see that whatever it was it was in our back yard, which was impossible because we had a full 6 foot high wooden fence around our yard. thats all i could take, i was so scared i jumped back in bed and got under the covers... thats all i remember.... \r\nanyway, that was just one event that i am aware of that seemed to be some connection between my sister and mysterious ufo phenomenon.... \r\nok now to get on to this latest sighting.... my sister told me i guess it was about mid july, that one night they (her and her husband)were awakened by something strange happening outside their house... thats when they said they witnessed this ufo hovering above their house.... i can't remember a lot of the details as it was a few months ago she told me this story, but the strange thing about the story is that the next day they questioned what they had seen and thought maybe it was a dream, but then the next door neighbor kid came over and said, \"jackie, jackie, i saw a ufo over your house last night, and then he drew a picture of it, and it was exactly the same thing they had seen.... \r\nanyway that is a rough reccolection of what she told me, but if you would like maybe i can have her talk to someone from your group.... i am not a real beleiver in this kind of stuff, or should i say more specifically i beleive there is something out there, but i am a christian of strong faith and am not too concerned one way or another about ufo phenomenon... but i beleive we are being visited for some reason, good or bad.... also it is possible that my sister has some kind of implant in her leg, because some years ago she mentioned something about that to me .... \r\nanyway, some of what i mentioned here may be a bit off but to the best of my knowledge it is roughly accurate.... thanks for your kind ear and god bless....

at 0552 am on the east coast.I knew it would be difficult to find the moon so i left my house at 0525 am to get a head start.I could not loacte the moon at all and i thought this may be due to the surounding buildings and brightly lit area in which i live.I decided to walk to an area where my view wouldnt be obstructed.I found myself about a half a mile away from home and still no sight of the moon,although a bright star\r\n( at least i thought it was)caught my attention.This star like object shined very brightly almost like a diamond then dimmed dramatically,it repeated this sequence 4 or 5 times as i managed to get off 5 photos.As i was taking shots of this object i said to myself,please come closer,dont go away.No sooner than i said this the object blinked out and never returned.What i felt next was a feeling that told me to go to the park.I knew the park was at least a little over a mile and a half away but i had to be there.I thought that going to this park with a wide open space would give me a better chance to observe the luna eclipse.It was now 0600 hrs and nothing.Im in the middle of a park at 6 in the morning,what the hell am i doing here?I believed my venture to be a lost cause so i began to take pictures of the sun rise which was just begining. i took 9 photos and started back home.When i arrived home i went through the photos and almost fell out by what i saw in 1 of the 9 pics.Was this my angel?The image was not in my viewfinder or in the sky when i shot the photo.My gut reaction was that this was the most beautiful thing i have ever seen.It also tunrned out to be one great big spiritual event for me.So if you can help me find out what it means not just for myself but for the world and confirm my angel maybe we would all be better

saw on 9-11-01 looked like something from\r\nthe \"jetsons\". in that cartoon, the exhaust of their flying vehicles is portrayed as clear bubbles coming from the rear of the air craft.\r\non 9-11-01 the same \"bubbles\" could be seen.\r\nit would only make sense to patrol the skies on ensuing 9-11 anniversaries.\r\ni'm sure our gov't isn't telling us what it is.\r\ni just hope it is being used for our protection.\r\ni think we now possess in our technology a way to propel an aircraft\r\nwithout jetfuel, and i think we have the capability to use it in\r\nautomobiles. although this craft may be nuclear. that is something our gov't doesn't want us to know.\r\none day the truth will come out.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"09:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8302,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7197928,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11072007-0004","longitude":-73.9960331,"occurred":1157958000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

linked footage below i noticed something unusual. unusual in as much that, to my knowledge, there shouldn't be anything else up in the air in the vicinity of the shuttle when it lands. yet, at two distinct places in the footage, there do appear to be (technically) ufos. \r\n \r\ni found the best way to view them is to go to full screen mode. the first object appears at about 7 seconds from the right of the frame. it's in the frame for less than a second so you'll have to use the 'pause' button a lot. the second object appears from the lower left part of the screen at about 11 seconds and isn't there for very long either. \r\n \r\ni'm assuming they're not helicopters (dangerous and i thought used more for the older sea landings?), other planes (banned as far as i know), birds (too big), or balloons (danger and why??), aerial attachments to poles / pylons (no poles / pylons) visible.  \r\n \r\nmaybe there is a perfectly logical explanation (although i class ufos as buzzing shuttles logical, however... ;) ) ? have you any ideas what the objects are or might be?  \r\n \r\ni thought i'd send the footage to you before the objects get airbrushed out ;) a point worth noting

could see it very well. it was flying over the tops of the trees and flew across a feild at a very slow pace till it went over the tree lines never to be seen by us again. it was the most amazing thing we had ever seen!! it moved without sound and seemed to be just on route. i know 100% that it wasnt anything other than a ufo.It was to close and to bright not to know this.Ever since that day i

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Sometime between 6:15 and 6:30 am on 11/06/07, i witnessed two lights in the sky.  looking west from my backyard, i saw two lights moving generally from southwest to northeast (though actual movement may have been anywhere between that and true south to north).  there was a relatively larger solid white light apparently being pursued by a smaller white light.  speed was difficult to determine, but appeared to be close to that of commercial airliners.  as i watched, the smaller object drew nearer to the larger object, but never caught up by the time that they became obscured by the trees to my north.\r\n\r\ni saw no lights flashing on either object, which is what caused me to continue to watch them, since i usually see the lights of commercial airplanes flashing.  there were no major changes in speed of either object, although the smaller of the two failed to catch the larger, so i suspect one slowed down or sped up.\r\n\r\nin answer to the points to include:\r\n\r\n1)  i had just returned from filling up the family car with gas and was returning into my house from the back patio.\r\n\r\n2)  i noticed the objects because there were two of them moving in the same direction, which is unusual.  the fact that there were no flashing lights as seen on most planes also seemed unusual.  finally, the fact that they were of different sizes suggested it was not two military jets on the way to either of the bases to the east of me.\r\n\r\n3)  i first assumed the objects were planes, but as i looked closely, i could not discern an airplane shape.  i just now (5:15 pm same day) watched a commercial jet fly overhead at cruising altitude and i could make out the wings.  i couldn't see any wings on the larger one for certain.  at this point, i would be unable to swear that the smaller one did not have wings, but i don't recall thinking that at the time.  although, based on size and movement, it left the encounter thinking that i had witnessed a small military jet chasing a larger ufo.\r\n\r\n4)  object was bright white, oval, and far away.  flew in a straight line.  smaller one drew nearer to it from behind, but did not catch it.\r\n\r\n5)  i was surprised by what i was seeing, because it was so unusual.  we live near an airport and have military bases to our east; i'm used to planes.  i haven't seen planes look or behave that way before.  there were no unusual flying maneuvers, but the fact that they were going the same way and apparently so close was striking.  i tried to dismiss it as planes, but i'm not convinced that they were, though one or both may have been.  the sun was coming up at the time, so i'm unsure whether the steady white light of them may have been a reflection from it and may have been bright enough to cover flashing lights, so i'm still not sure what i saw.\r\n\r\n6)  flew behind trees to my north.
