come outside.  he sounded like it was urgent.  when i went outside he pointed up & asked me what i thought that was, that it was there for a while and was traveling parallel to the street (from south to north)i ran in and got my binoculars & it looked to be a large cylinder.  at first i thought it might be a balloon, but it was too large and it didn't move like a balloon.  it stayed horizontal for a long time, then it made a turn (east to west) parallel to our front street.  when it started traveling i ran in to get my video camera but it was out of battery.  i remembered i had my digital camera in my purse & brought it outside to get a video.  when i came back outside it started to change direction from being hrizonal to vertical.  in the horizontal mode it looked to be very shiny, like tin foil, on the top where the sun hit it, but the rest of it seemed very black.  i had trouble capturing it on photo or video (my camera had dust & stuff on it from being in my purse).  when this thing started it was a nice blue sky day and then it started getting cloudy and then it got really dark skies with lightening (we rarely have lightening here).  it climbed up and finally disappeared into the clouds.  since we are on the canadian border here, i called the border patrol and told them what we had seen (even my neighbor's daughter saw it).  i told them i was not a nut job or crazy.  they said i should call 911.  i told them the reason i called border patrol was because it was flying towards white rock, surrey, bc.  i asked if they would just go out and look up to see if they could see it.  i know that laughed their butts off when they got off the phone and thought i was crazy.  my husband & i got in the car and tried to keep up with it, but we lost it in the dark clouds.  about an hour later, my husband went to fill up the car at a gas station and he heard on the radio a lady asking if anyone else saw something flying over canada.  since we are on the border, we get the canadian stations better.  anyway, i was going to call the radio station, but my husband said not to and just let it go because he didn't want people thinking we are crazy.  ever since then i have been wondering what it was.  if it is a balloon i'll be so happy that i am not a nut.  but, this really didn't look like a balloon, it was very large, silent and moved in a rational direction.  balloons usually just float around. hope someone can help settle my mind.

wasn't unusual in the mountains.  it was warm, but overcast; as  though there was going to be a thunder storm.  my house was dark inside, so i decided to read outside on the porch until the electricity came back on.  i'd been reading about 10 minutes when i saw a flash of light in my peripheral vision and figured it was lightening.  i stopped reading to watch the sky for more lightening.  i saw another flash of light, but it was not lightening.  i watched and discovered the light was not only flashing on and off, but was moving to the left.  i followed the light and i saw it go into a ship.  i was awe struck.  i saw more flashing lights go into the ship and tried to decide if i should go get my camera or binoculars.  i didn't want to miss anything, so i decided to stay and watch.  i remember wishing my roommate was home to see it too.  the ship, at that time, was stationary.  no sound, just hanging in the air.  it resembled a raspberry lighted from he inside.  it was the size of the end of my thumb, making it hard to tell its size or distance.  when the last of the flashing lights had entered the ship, it began to move south.  i watched it until it disappeared behind the hill behind my house.  not too long after, the electricity came back on.  i called the local tv station, but no one had reported anything unusual and i was told a transformer had been the electrical problem.  i saw your ad on the tv and decided to finally report this.  i currently live in southern oregon and in nov. of 2004, there was a lot of air craft in the area as pres. bush was staying overnight here.  i was outside after dark and saw a bright light come on from the south.  i waited for it to get bigger as it came closer, but it appeared to be stationary.  after a while, it went off and then two bright lights came on.  they were much bigger than any other aircraft and there was no sound.  they went off and when they came back on, there were three bright lights.  they appeared to be in a straight line.  they blinked off and when they came back on, they were in the shape of a triangle.  they blinked off again and when they came back they were in the shape of a smile.  i started for my neighbor's house as i wanted someone else to see this too.  unfortunately, they blinked off again and didn't come back on.  on new year's eve, eve, (dec. 30th) 2005, i noticed lights dancing in the clouds.  it was after dark and i thought it must be one of those huge lights they use at movie premiers shining up at the clouds.  a few minutes after i had gone inside, my neighbor came over and asked me to look at some lights in the sky.  i told her i had noticed them, but figured they were man made.  she said, the light was not coming from the ground and after looking more closely, i could see she was right.  the lights were either on the other side of the clouds pointing down, or within the clouds themselves.  there were three or four of them and they \"danced\" around and around.  we talked about them for a long time afterwards.  i have seen other remarkable things in the sky and even have a couple of pictures, but these incidents were definately ufo's.  i've had friends and relatives tell of their ufo sightings, but i was never totaly convinced until i saw the red, oval, ufo in the sky over eastern madera county, california. \r\nvickie j. pippett      ","distance":"501

fin.  it left no vapor trail and was completely silent.  the front passenger of the car watched the object continuously and exclaimed that it had suddenly disappeared. the driver was looking at the

and was employed by bunker hill mining company's quality control laboratory.   i was married and my wife was completing a mining engineering degree.   at the time, we were renting a house from my parents along the northeast shore of coeur d' alene lake which was on a hill several hundred yards in elevation above the lake, overlooking the lake and to the north of interstate highway 90.\r\n\r\nmy wife, lisa, and i had just had dinner and walked out onto the second floor deck overlooking the lake and pine forested hillsides.  i was past sunset but still very light.  as we were looking out over the lake together, a glow appeared under the water, and a glowing greenish-white oval object rose from out of the water, water running off of it.   the object slowly rose vertically until it was slightly above the level of the house.  then it stopped for a few seconds, and then what i saw literally looked like a tapering white line of light going to the northwest going level  and whatever it was went from it's stationary point to being gone over the horizon  so fast that i am sure it was far less than a second and the fact that to my vision it appeared as a solid straight white tapering line. \r\n\r\nfrom my technical studies and having taken biology, knowing the human eye responds to images down to roughly 1/24 of a second, i can only speculate that because it looked like a straight line of white light and i did not distinctly see and individual object, that it was moving that distance in less than the time it takes my eyes to process it.  i have never seen anything like this before or since. whatever it was, it went from standing still to a streak of light instantaneously.\r\n\r\none of us said, \"did you see that?\" and the other nodded their head. it's almost 30 years ago, so that i don't even remember, just the nature of the interaction.   i was so stunned that i never breathed a word of this to anyone for three years. i felt like i was literally in a state of shock and despite reading ufo books since the early 1960s, my mind was still completely unprepared for this event. all i can say was that because it came from under a lake, rose vertically, stopped and shot off like a beam of light, it had the appearance of being intelligently controlled unless mother nature has such phenomenon that don't make sense.  i think i didn't talk about it, because my brain had absolutely no reference point for it in my day to day reality.  seeing something like this is far more profound mentally and emotionally than reading all the books in the world on ufos because even with all the books, it leaves room for doubt.  this personal experience left no explanation, but it also left no room for doubt either.   i do not speculate on what it was and neither can i shrug it off.  we lost sight of the object as is disappear over the horizon in a streak of light and guessing from our elevation visibility from up there in the hills of northern idaho is probably 100 mile and whatever it was made up that distance in a flash.\r\n\r\nsteve","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8272,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.6833032,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11032007-0001","longitude":-116.7769964,"occurred":277352100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":277352100000,"summary":"Glowing

morning coolness with my coffee and cigarette. the sky was quite clear, no clouds or fog, tempurature about 45 degrees centigrade, with a very light breeze from the south. the milky way was clearly visible. \r\ni was looking up towards the east at venus, which is quite bright this time of year, when i noticed a very bright object appear from behind and just above the treeline across the street from my home. when it first appeared, it's angle was about 30 degrees above the horizon and due se. \r\nthe object was unusually bright; i estimate it to be about twice the brightness of the planet venus at the time. when i first saw it, it was about 20 degrees to the right of venus. it was moving slowly (roughly 2-3 degrees of arc per second) and i initially thought that it was an airplane. there was no sound. i observed this object for another 10-15 seconds as it moved higher above the horizon, moving nw and eventually above my head. i began to notice that the object was not only getting much brighter, but it had no visible clearance lights of any kind. i also noticed that it began to have a visible shape to it.\r\nit was irregular in appearance, roughly diamond-shaped, but it was still way too small to make out any details.\r\ni then thought that maybe i was looking at a satellite or maybe the international space station, but i also realised that such objects don't move from east to west. this got my curiosity up.\r\ni ran inside my house to grab my binoculars, a vivatar 7x50 (297ft @ 100yrds). at this moment, the object was directly overhead. knowing this, i ran to the back of my house to the back porch that faced nw.\r\nat this point, the object had just become visible overhead. i quickly adjusted the focus on my binoculars. what i saw through the eyepieces was a solid potato-shaped object, slightly irregular in appearance, appoximately the size of a grain of rice held at arm's length. no details could be seen. no lights of any kind. no visible contrail, glow, or halo. it did not appear to rotate or have any other kind of movement along any axis. it was bright white in color.\r\nafter observing this object for about another 10 seconds, i noticed that the object began to quickly change color from bright white to grey and then to a ruddy red. at this moment, the object was approximately 50-55 degrees above the horizon, directly nw.\r\ni deduced that the object was possibly passing through the penumbra and into the shadow of the earth.\r\nit then suddenly went dark at about a 45 degree angle above the horizon. i checked my watch and the time was 5:41am cdt.\r\n\r\npersonal backround: i'm a us army-trained observer, familiar with almost all both civilian and military aircraft configurations and nighttime lighting. i have good knowledge of established civilian air traffic patterns in my area. i am also an amateur astronomer who owns an 6 inch newtonian telescope which i use for personal enjoyment. i have way above-average knowledge of astronomy.\r\n\r\nbased upon my personal observations of the object in question, along with it's angle and direction of travel, brightness in magnitude and variations in said magnitude as it passed overhead, and other characteristics, i have ruled-out any civilian or military aircraft, or possibly most any low-earth orbit satellites. \r\nthe object could possibly have been a stratospheric-level weather balloon, but the wind directions on the ground and higher elevations at the time rules this out (i checked the noaa reports before i posted this).\r\n\r\ni believe that i may have observed the passing of a earth-crossing object.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

other marines were in the tower with me and we were watching the stars and talking.  in iraq in the middle of the night u can see everything, it seems like u can see every star.  there isnt many planes that fly at all.   you see are planes and when they get lower there lights go out.   plus u can here them from very far away.   we were talking when one of my marine buddies said whats that and pointed to the sky in shock.   i missed it, but he said he saw a object brake apart in the sky and that when i began to watch.   the now two objects were flying as if they were folowing each other.   nothing much from wat i saw at first untill they would move vertical together in the sky at the sametime, stop in one spot, and then turn to a horazontal path.   this would happen many times.  then they would sort of disappear and we would look fro them in the sky and one would appear.   maybe two sec later the other would appear and be away from it and catch up and be right behind it again.   they would sometimes fly apart fast and then meetup when they turn back and when they get close enough stop and then move again together.  now sometimes they would go apart from each other and start to do their own thing.   once  one of the obejects shot up and then  made a half circle like turn and then shoot down at amazing speeds.   now we did see at least one plain go by because it seemed as if the objects were goin to fly at it. this really showed how fast they could move.   these objects were as bright as the brightest star in the sky.  they had a light blue look to them.   once when they were apart  one of the objects was flying around when the other one shot into it and they made a bigger obeject.  i would say 3 times the size of the biggest brightest star in the sky.   they had like a almost flash when they came togther to be one in the sky.  not some flash in the enire sky, sort of just around  them.   later after a 15-30 sec time the object broke apart to be two again.   that along with this was the most amazing part of the night.  at one point when they disapeared and we were looking for the obejects we saw one apear in the main area we had been looking at that night, (that area was about 45 degrees up away from us, like you were looking at stars from your roof that were away from your house not just about you) when we were looking fro the other object i saw it at the corner of my eye.  i then had to turn my body to see the obeject.   after about a few seconds it shot across the sky all the way to the main area we had been looking at in about one second.  i watched it move across the sky and i had to turn my body back to the orginal spot to see that it had now stoped next to the other obeject and they begain flying together again.  this all went on for about 45min.   after about 25-30 min, my ssgt, my sgt and two or three other marines showed up.  when we began to tell them what we were watched my ssgt started making jokes and thinking we were being stupid and just watching plains or jets.   when he came up to the tower his jokes and laughs at us stopped almost the second he saw what we saw.  this man never shut up so for something to leave him speachless, had to have blown his mind.    he then in a serious voice asked if any of us had a camera (most the time we always had one, and he said ,\"yall always wanna record yourself doin dumbshit, but then something like this is in the sky and no one has one!\")  we had some marines in the humvee on post below us and im sure they saw some of this along with one of the marines that was in the humvee that my ssgt showed up in.   the speeds and the moves that we saw that night are inpossible.   the three of us in the tower, the sgt,ssgt, and two other marines that showed up, and also the marines on the ground all saw this.   we are trained military personal.   some who have been on airbase and seen what jets can do and no jet can do what we saw.  no jet can stop and freeze in the middle of the sky or go across the sky at the speeds we saw, plus when they came together.    this all is easier to explain in person then just words.","distance":"Over One

mate taking a smoke. it was chilly outside, around 2 degrees celcius. so i wanted this smoking time to be as bref as possible. my room mate and i started talking about a subject regarding the univers and all its mysteries. the conversation lasted about 15 minutes. \r\n       i was just about to finish my cigarette when i looked up at the sky and saw two redish orbs fly about less than 3000 feet across the sky perpendicular to us. at first i thought it was a falling star. but i noticed that it did not leave that typical trail of light. i am a pilot and i know about all flying vehicles. they all standardly hold a starbord green light and a port red light, strobe lights, and rotating beacon. and at that altitude and thats speed, it would have made an incredible noise. but thoses objects where flying at about 1000 km and made absoluteley no sound. \r\n       what i noticed really odd is that they where criss crossing and rotating around each other. like if playing with each other. this part is the hardest to describe but i hope the reader understand what i mean by this. the flight patern and the way they where flying was not rectilinear. the flight paterns of those ufos where constatly moving either in front, back, rotating around each other. they acted as two birds who fell in love. the most impressive part is that they did not make any sound. there where no clouds around. so it could not be a form of projector or light at any kind.\r\n       i grabed my room mate by the arm as strong as i could, started to yell at him, told him to look up because there was an incredible event happening. he did not see anything. my adrenaline whent up because i knew what i had witnessed. at that instant i wanted to call the authorities and the news broadcasting company to tell them what i had seen. i ended up not doing that.\r\nthose objects disapeared behind the houses.","distance":"20 Feet or

darker than the sky.  there were multiple green lights running lengthwise down the center.  the shape was very distinct--no protrusions anywhere, just straight edges.  because of the terrain and trees which obscured my view as we turned, i could only get one more brief glimpse--this time from the rear.  all the lights appeared yellow from that angle.  i was unable to see a side or top view at any
