brought our daughter i saw something strange in the sky that i have never seen before. i am a sky watcher, so i am always looking for things, my wife like to make fun of me, but its things like this that are the reason i am the way i am. as i made my way to my vehicle, for some reason my eyes were drawn the the sky, i thought i was looking at the north star, i am not good with n, s, e, w directions so i can't tell you exactly which direction i was facing. i was on yosemite blvd. , highway 132 facing teel middle school, you can probably find the direction i was facing by those landmarks on google earth.) as i glanced at the \"star\" it must have been just the right moment because it seemed to flare, and then slowly, burn out. it also never moved. it was stationary in sky the whole time, like the stars are, thats why i thought it was a star. it was like nothing i have ever, ever seen before. i am experienced in watching the sky, and i know it was abnormal, what i am extremely interested in is knowing if anyone else saw this star/occurance in the sky, because it would not have been stationary to my town, let alone state, it was something in space, i know multiple people had to have seen it. here's hoping someone did, and can share what they saw with us all and at least confirm what i saw. please contact me at audioinklined@sbcglobal.Net if you have any information concerning this event please! i am completely sincere. i didn't tell anyone about it, except my wife i think. it was very strange.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":8262,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.6465072,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11012007-0003","longitude":-120.9914682,"occurred":1193886000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

the waxing crescent moon was up and i did photograph it, but it was not near the location of the lights.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it might be a reflection from street lamps, but the lights are not present in the sunset shots before file 6647.  four minutes later they show up in the next two files then don't appear again until file 6662 two minutes after that.  i've photographed from this same

space shuttle lift off before they left to go home.  i decided to take them to kars park on merritt island, florida.  this is a park for kennedy space port works and family.  it is about as close as you can get with out getting on ksc, 10-15 miles away.  \r\n\r\ni was taking movie pictures with my camera and the shuttle had lifted off.  about one to one and a half minutes after the launch i pulled away from the camera and look up and saw some thing going from west to east at a high rate of speed.  it was bright and looked like a flying saucer shape but you just saw a yellow light.  i asked my friends and some other people around us if they saw it and they said that they did see some thing.  \r\n\r\ni first thought that it was a chase plane to take pictures of the shuttle but quickly decided that it was not a chase plane.  they have land base camera���s that can give you better pictures than a chase plane.  also if a plane is in the launch area they will not launch the shuttle.  i have seen many shuttle launches since i live close to cape canaveral.  i have never seen any thing like this before.  i retired from the air force and have seen f-16���s, f-15���s, sr-71 and f-18���s flying at all altitudes and this was none of those.  \r\n\r\ni tried to get a movie of the ufo but it was so bright i could not tell if i was getting good pictures.  once i got home i downloaded the movie onto my computer to see if i got any thing.  i found that i had about a second of the light but i could not tell what it was.  i looked at each frame that i had and each frame was different.  it was not a good movie you can not tell any thing from what i have but a light in the sky.   \r\n\r\ni was so sure that the news would have some thing on this but no one reported any thing about the ufo/light.  i don���t understand this at all.  \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

didnt see anything at first,so,by now we are looking at bill like hes stupid or hes goofin on us,when all of a sudden,everything lit up like a christmas tree and we all seen what bill was talking about..This object was massive!!!It was at least a couple thousand feet above us,but we could all see the lights and make out the boomerang shape,it seemed to be moving in and out of the clouds,not in any general direction,just staying in the clouds.When the clouds broke open we would see it again,then it would move to another cloud and we could see the cloud light up brighter than the others..Meanwhile,my friend danny taps me on the shoulder and sais you know what were seeing a ufo!!We all pretty much agreed..We all were amazed at the size of this thing,and how it seemed to move in and out of the clouds.This was no airplane.It moved back and forth,up and down and as big as it was,made no sound.We all watched this for,what i thought was 15 or 20 mins,but my other friend kevin m.Swares it was there over an hour,to this day,we all still talk about our sighting.Weeks later,bill is at my house with a couple of newspaper clippings about ufo sightings in our area of the hudson valley n.Y.So i know we all saw what later turned out to be the boomerang!!Wewent back to our campsite a few more times that summerbut didnt see anything.We did come across an older couple who saw the same object at about the same time while camping a couple miles away from our location.Considering all the witnesses,the newspaper stories,iam convinced we all saw the hudson valley boomerang that night..My father a retired minister,believed me when i told him about this.He told me he and a friend saw something they couldnt explain in up state n.Y back in the 1960s.Inever gave ufos much

they described it as circle shape with flashing lights. there were 2 sets of lights under the object. the colours were red, blue, yellow and green. they described to me that the object was not moving fast or slow, but somewhere in between. they told me it was flying about as high as our communication tower (500 ft.) and that they watched it for about 10 seconds, until it went in behind our house and out of view, heading across the lake. the sun had  set about a half hour before this event and there would not have been and flights scheduled or any reflections in the sky at this time. when i asked my 10 year old daughter if she was sure it wasn't a plane, she just looked at me funny and said, dad i know what a plane looks like, and this was not a plane. the next day i asked each of them to draw what they had seen the night before, and each drew a circle shaped object with lights below. they were also specific in telling me that the lights did not flash all at the same time, but instead came on in pairs. both my children know the difference between the truth and a lie and have been raised to respect authority. both children were quite calm as they retold the event to me and i have every reason to believe that what they saw was something that defies reason.

as i sat on my patio enjoying cup of coffee.  as i have seen objects in our skies before, i always scan the sky when i come out onto the patio as we have a clear blue sky, unobstructed by other buildings when looking to the n/w.  this object seemed to be a metallic floating construct and it looked like no other form i've seen in the sky, except maybe a hot-air balloon, in that it seemed to have a bulbous balloon top and a 'basket' , or smaller, narrower form near the bottom, but all metalic and solid. \r\ni realized it was gleaming and slowly moving along a clear path headed n over downtown san jose, ca, i can only guess it was 1000 ft high in the sky. \r\ni quickly grabbed my canon pro1 8mp and began to relocate it against the blue sky.  i sat down and tried to steady camera, could not see object through view finder so i just began shooting at the specific area.  i knew from previous experience that even if i don't see it, it may still be there.   i shot around 15 pics and tried to capture it on video, but i can see nothing on the short clip.  i then watch as it continued it's slow pace n of san jose and then it dissappeared, not from distance, just blinked out, i suppose.   i felt that this object was 'observing' as a natural course of action, that it was there for a purpose. \r\ni have some images that i was able to zoon into to see the object and it's varying shapes, up close, when i downloaded and reviewed the images.   \r\nthe attached photos are at at least 100% and some up to 300%.  i have all the originals, but i did apply photoshop cs auto contrast and auto levels to the posted pics, to show more detail.  i have other photos available for review.\r\nthis is not the first time i witnessed and captured pics of this kind of anomoly; last

occur again tonight and it is a cloudy afternoon and it is suppose to rain tonight.  the following events occurred september 23 and 24th 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\ni was visiting a friends home in iron river and we had gotten up early to start painting her daughters room.  we needed another paint roller so we were going to her boyfriends to pick up another one.  when we left the house i saw blinking lights in the eastern sky (red and white) i said out loud ���what is that?��� i answered my self and said, ���oh it���s a plane���.  on our way back from her boyfriend���s house (we were driving east) we saw a very bright light in the sky.  the object had flashing lights like a police car it was less than 1000 feet from the ground.  when we got back to my friend���s home, i looked where i had noticed the flashing lights earlier and the object was still there.  we could not see the object we saw driving home from her house because of the tree line, so we decided to drive to the edge of town to get a better look at the second object.  the object lights were changing.  they changed from a horizontal row of (red on the edges, white in the middle and sometimes flashing blue green) to a vertical line, to a steady white in the middle and a glow of red on the edges.  \r\n\r\nwe looked around the sky and noticed 5 similar objects in the sky.  the brightest and closest to the horizon was in the east, the first one i noticed was at a higher altitude in the south west, there were three at different altitudes and staggered straight up in the sky, one was in positioned at a very high altitude in the northwestern sky and the last nnw and at a lower altitude than the one in the sw but seemed to be farther away.  all of the objects were stationary except for small erratic movements.  when looking at them through a camera using the zoom they appeared to jump around.  it was difficult to tell exactly what shape they were because they appeared to change shape.  we were only able to take photos of the brightest one because of the others were not bright enough.  in some of the photos it appears to be triangle or have boomerang shape in others it appears to be round.  we were using my friend���s digital camera it has a 3.���s zooms lens and is 1.2 mega pixels, so the shots are somewhat grainy and unfocused because of the movement of the objects.  \r\n\r\nat about 5:00 a.M. the object in the nnw sky moved quickly across the sky towards the brightest one, it flew above it and the hovered.  my friend said it attached to the brighter on or something, but i did not see it.  we observed the objects until daylight.  as the sun rose so did the objects, strait up.  we lost sight of the other objects before daybreak, i assume because they were started ascending at a higher altitude.  we then drove to my friends��� boyfriend���s house again to get binoculars to look at the last object.  the binoculars were not very strong but the object appeared to be gray or sliver and i am not quite certain of the shape, again it kept changing.  however, we did watch the brightest and closest one until after the sun rose it ascended straight up until it was no longer visible.  it appeared we were able to get photos of it in the daylight but they are at a very high altitude.\r\n\r\nlater in the day (sept.  23rd) i returned to bayfield and told my children and showed them photos of what i had seen.  my son said it must have been mars or venus, my response was that venus and mars move on the horizon, these objects (least one) did not move for almost three hours, and i���ve never seen venus or mars rise straight into the heavens.  at about 8:00 p.M. i was bringing things to my car to take to iron river and looked at the sky to see if what i saw last evening was going to happen again.  in the distant sky to the south i saw what i thought was similar to the objects i had seen last night.  i showed it to my son and he said it was a twinkling star.  as i was leaving about 10 minutes later it was no longer there, i looked to the west and saw i am certain the same type of object (it was not like the very bright one) i had seen last night.  my son (27 years old) and daughter (16 years old) were looking at it and he said it must be a plane.  after about 5 minutes of viewing the object changing colors shape and brightness, i asked if he still thought it was a plane because it had not moved out of the position it was in.  he agreed he had never seen anything like it.  \r\n\r\ni left for iron river at about 8:20 while driving i noticed another object over lake superior in chequamegon bay near washburn.  when i arrived in iron river i scanned the sky and although very distant i saw 4 objects.  there was a group of three that if you drew line to each object you could form triangle (with the point facing downward) the two on the upper part of the triangle were wsw and ese the bottom one was south.  they were fairly easy to identify in the sky, but were still quite a distance and the objects behaved in much the same way as the previous evening.   \r\n\r\ni was not able to photograph the top two, however i did get a few of the bottom one later that evening.  the photo is dark but when zoomed in you can see a very colorful lighted something, each photo takes on a different shape.  i used cannon power shot s3 digital camera 6.0 mega pixels and 12x-image zoom.  i���m not sure if the distortion is from my movement or the objects.  i took a short video of the object using max zoom and (i am not moving this time) and you can see how the objects move around, they also take on a ball shape when using max zoom.  because of this problem i did not use the max zoom and it was easier to focus the camera with a bigger pallet.  the moon was still up and very bright and i did not see an object that was bright enough to continue photographing, so i went to bed.  i set the alarm for 4:00 after the moon would set to see if one of the objects would appear brighter and lower in the horizon.\r\n\r\ni took a short drive to look for the object because the tree line is pretty high at my friend���s house.  i got to u.S. hwy 2 turned east and there was a very bright object like the night before.  i went east on hwy 2 of town to get closer and away from the streetlights i drove about two miles and pulled off on the shoulder and started taking pictures.  i observed two objects south of the bright one and one nw, i also saw in the east (quite a distance away) two very faint lights blue and red in color, with the red closest to the sky.  i will also note that the closest object in the southern direction was lighted all blue and did not change color or intensity of color like the others however it did move slightly and change shape like the others.  \r\n\r\nthe bright one during the course of the evening was ever changing at times down to one small white light with a red hue.  it also changed to extremely bright once during the night and had what appeared to be a red to be some kind ball or light that swarmed around it and then vanished.  the object than returned to its original brightness.  a craft then came from the west it was making quick turns and appeared to be moving very fast.  it then went by the bright object and started mirror the movements of the brighter object and then took off very quickly to the east.  i continued to observe the objects and when the sun started to rise the objects started to rise vertically towards the heavens like the morning before until they were no longer visible.  i was able to get photos of the bright object in the daylight and took a total of about 200 photos of these two very strange evenings.   i am still unsure as to the shape of the objects, because when the zoom is used the object appears round and when i zoom out the object appears to take some kind of shape.  either that or the object has the ability to change its shape.  i also want to note that i did not hear any noise from the object.\r\n\r\ni also called the bayfield county sheriff���s office on monday to see if anyone reported seeing anything in the sky and was told there were no reports.  i also about 10 years ago saw a similar object on m 28 in the up just past bruces crossing.  that time i was able to see that the object was triangle shaped and had blue red and white lights shining down from the corners.  my sister witnessed this sighting with me.  she is of the opinion that this is the government testing new crafts.  i disagree, i don���t believe we have the technology to build an object that has no engine noise and can move as quickly or as agile what i saw.  i also asked her why the objects if they were government crafts exit via the heavens.  if you have an explanation i eagerly await one.\r\n\r\ni would also like to note that on the photos taken on the 23rd the date on the photos says the 22nd also the time i believe is 1 hour off.  the camera may have been set wrong.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nbetty kerr\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile,
