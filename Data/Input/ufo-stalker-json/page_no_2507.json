brother in law's deck outside of egg harbor, wi over looking the water to the east on green bay which is part of lake michigan. the water was very calm that night which made for a nice quiet night. we were looking at many things that we had seen in the sky before, stars, the space station, satellites, planes, etc. looking over the water i noticed a light at about a 2 o'clock position in the sky. i said to my brother in law that this plane was flying in an unusual path, slow and straight towards land to our right. this was something that we had never seen previously. expecting to hear the sound of an airplane engine i noticed that there was none. my brother in law said that was strange and as we both watched, the light blinked and went off at an unbelievable speed to the north and disappeared. we have seen jets fly over before and this was alot faster than any jet we had ever seen. my brother in law started to laugh and looked at me. i said i think we just saw something and before i could finish my 14 year old son said he was scared and wanted to go in the house. i told him there was nothing to worry about and looked back at my brother in law who had a funny look on his face. i said to him i think we just saw a ufo. he said with a kind of laughing tone that he agreed that what we saw was a ufo. we had not been drinking and we were not tired from the day. in fact we stayed out for another 2 hours waiting to see it again but it never came back. i know i felt fine, just amazed at how fast the light moved. not much was said the next day, however after we told our wives and the other kids, everybody was sitting out watching the next night. nothing like this was seen that night. not much has been said about this since but lately i have had the feeling that i

we couldnt find where they had come from. we moved our gear a few yards away and the ants stayed marching in this circle for some time. onced moved, we took the same position as before. the sky was crystal clear  and we were all silent with just the radio on. as i was looking into the sky i saw a star like object. i first thought it was a plane. i then realized it was acting to bizzare to be a plane. it was more like \"jumping\" than flying. it sarted jumping in a triangle pattern.It did this for a few moments. i stayed queit becuase i was still thinking it was just my eyes and the motion of th eearth playing tricks on my mind. then, rudy asked if i was seeing the samething in the sky that he was. then mecheal said she had been watching it to. we looked at it moving from triangle, to square, to circle lik epaterns for about 15 mins. then, two more smaller star-like objects joined it. at first, they seemed to be almost \"playing\" with each other. all three joining together in various geometeric-like shapes. they did this for a few mins, then the two smaller ones broke off and engauged in what i can only describe as a \"dog fight\" they chased each other and exchanged \"energy\" almost like shooting at each other. the larger light did not join in this. in fact, it had become sationary once the two small ones broke off from formation with it. this \"dog fight last 2 mns at most. then, they shot away from each other at speeds i have never seen an aircraft travel at. they were gone in less than a blink of an eye. the larger object remained still for a long time. long enough for us to lose the intial awe of it all and start to talk about it. we went back and forth about what it could have been, but we were all in agreement that it was no kind of aircraft we had ever seen. i jokingly picked up the hand held cb and started \"talking\" to the light. giving it silly greetings, insulting it, telling it to come on down and sit next to the fire with us. then, it came to life! it shot right over our heads....Close! right above the tree line and passed us, out of our sight. i was startled so bad that i had drop the cb and prepared to run. in the process, i broke the antenna off of it. we all 3 jumped up by the fire and started to debate wether we should leave i didnt want to tell rudy i broke his cb antanna so i thew it into the woods close to us. then the object returned, slowly hovering just above the tree line, maybe 100-150 yards away. it was so close that we could see a distinct \"core\" which was brillant bright white, and sheathed in a radiant aura of white light (glowing i guess you could call it. we set motionless and silent and just watched it. what i call a \"spotlight\" beam, only slightly cone shaped came on underneath the object and it started slowly moving just above the inside of the tree line. it was completely silent.I got the impression it was looking for something, but if they were so advance they would have found us without effort. it moved on until we couldn't see it any more. it was then that without much debate we decided it was time to leave. we started packing and rudy saw that the antanna was missing. i voiced up and told him the truth about what happened to it and where i threw it. he was of course a bit upset and asked that i go find it. giving the current situation i was very reluctant; however. i know it landed only about 15-20 feet away from us right on the tree line. the area was so close it was recieving light from the fire so i decided id go get it. i got the flashlight and went to the tree line. i hoped that the shiny metal would reflect the fire's light and be easy to spot. i didnt see it. i shined the flashlight into the trees and almost instantly saw a portion of the antanna amoung thick bushes just inside the trees. i almost decided to leave it and say i couldny find it. i did not want to go into the woods after what we just experienced. but, rudy was a good freind and i felt bad so i went in after in. i had to get on on my hands and knees to crawl under the bushes. i kept shining the light but lost the location of the antanna while crawling. i stoped for a moment to shine the light around and try and find it. rudy and mecheal were yelling at me to hurry so we could go. while looking around, i saw the antanna in the light, it was infront of me at arms length on the other side of the bushes. when i reached for it i heard a slight crackling in the leaves on the otherside of the bushes. it was very close. i froze. the next thing i noticed was a smell i can only describe as mild musky odor mixed with anesthetic chemicels like in hospitals. i shined the light in the direction of the crackle sounds. at first i thought what i saw was the root base of two small trees growing close to each other. i quickly decided it wasn't trees, or roots. it was feet! in the light i could see thin fleashy legs, pronounced knees. what i tought was roots where three thick toes. i didnt noticed toe nails, but did see defined \"knuckle\" joins midway in the toes. one of the toes moved slightly. i quickly shined the light up. i'm sorry that i cant recall the exact details, but it was short. i would say maybe 4\" it was humaniod with long thin arms. i didn't notice the hands in any detail. the head was large and the eyes reflected the light almost like a cat or dogs eyes in the dark. i had the light on it for maybe a second before i jumped up (getting cut ans scraped by the bushes and ran back to the fire screaming.I was so in shock that i didnt even noticed that i had ran and stopped in the remains of the fire. they kept asking me what was wrong. all i could do was beg them leave with me.  the heat and burning of the fire sort of snapped me back a little. they  got me out of it. i told them i would tell them once we left. they started grabbing up the gear. i grab the machette we used on fire wood ready to strike at that thing if i saw it again. once we got out of the woods and on the road walking back to rudy's house, i explained what i saw. they picked up the pace. we made it back to the house and lay down in our beds. we briefly went over the episode of the night then went to sleep. i for one had wild and vivid dreams about the gravel pit. in the dream, the song we where listening to when the event started played back to back very vividly. at one point, i dreamed that i woke up because something was coming into the window. i then realised that i was still dreaming and laid back down. when i did the strange gravel pit dream continued. when i woke up for real. i told them bits of my dream. before i could mention the song, mecheal said that she kept dreaming abou the song. rudy claimed he did two. that morning (more like noon) we told his mom and a neighbor. i believe it was his mother that said people had been reporting seeing something that looked like a \"faun\" (like puck...Half man half deer). well what i saw didn't look like that, but regurdless, there was something there. these days. i sometimes wonder if i acually saw it. i recall the lights in the sky like it was yesterday, but the \"creature\" event is kind of fuzy to me. i attribute it to the shock and state of mind that i was when when i saw \"it\" that obsures my memory of it.

off my light to go to sleep and glanced outside my bedroom window as i always do.  i noticed what i thought was a bright star in the sky which i thought was strange because it was really cloudy out.  i looked at it closer and realized it was much closer that a star would be.  it seemed to be just below the tree line in my back yard.  i was horrified but couldn't take my eyes off of it.  it had one big light that pulsed in brightness and was for the most part constant and two smaller lights, one on each side of the main light that also pulsed but at some times became completely dark. at times all three lights became really bright and illuminated the trees around the area. you could see a triangular shape in the glow.  at times lights shot down the sides. also even smaller lights seemed to explode to the sides of the side lights that were different colors, blue, orange, yellow.  twice lights flashed along the base quickly then disappeared.  it seemed to hover, moving slightly up and down.  i was extremely scared because i was alone.  i thought about calling someone but i was afraid that it would draw the attention of the \"thing\".  at times it went completely dark.  i watched it until about 4:30am.  during that time it slowly moved lower and then to the right until i was unable to see it through the window.  while watching it i didn't notice that it was moving vertically or up and down at all until it was out of my sight which is strange.  i think i was looking too hard at just the lights.  i went downstairs and grabbed a large knife and a camera.  i was too scared to take a picture of it.  i watched it by peeking from behind a wall in my kitchen until it moved slowly away back behind trees in my neighbors yard which is set back from our street.  it glowed to each side of a tree trunk.  at that point i went back upstairs and sat in my room with the knife listening to every little sound in my house, absolutely terrified.  i slept from exhaustion around 4:45pm until 6:00am when i had to get up to go to work.  it was gone when i woke.  at this point i am unable to sleep at my house and am staying with my sister.

the first orb basicly seemed to come out of the clouds, then level off and floated out of sight. at first i thought it was a balloon. then when it either returned or an other orb showed up. this one was seen just floating over the area and not really moving like the first. it seemed like it knew i was there. i waved at it, but no responce. it slowly floated away after hanging around. \r\n\r\nmy next sighting was on monday, october 22, 2007 at 3:15 pm. i was working when i noticed something spinning through my window. i grabed my camera and filed what looked like a spinning metallic cube. it also came down from the sky. when it (seem to) notice me tapeing it, it slowed down and hovered turning like a top. i have noticed a lot of contrail activity these last two weeks, and feel they're some how connected, as all my sights have been on somewhat cloudy days. \r\n\r\ni have posted my videos on you tube and google video. the search words are \"ufos in levittown, ny\". i will also attach some files for your viewing with this message.\r\n\r\nthank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8201,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7173128,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232007-0006","longitude":-73.9992931,"occurred":1192863600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

direction over kansas city, ks.  it had about 7 dimmly lit orange/red lights on the bottom, approximately 10,000 to 30,000 feet in altitude and moving 300-1000 knots south southeast. size is estimated at from the ground twice as big as the pleides(?) constellation or three times the size of a stealth b2 bomber.  as it coasted briskly southward it seemed to either speed up suddenly, or perhaps my eyes were not able to follow it because of the moonlight and city light pollution, but it was undeniably there when first sighted, a magnificent thing to behold especially since all my other sightings were of the star-like variety, fast movers and stoppers quickly changing direction, it was my first actual adult aged sighting which i could tell what it really looked like. thanks to creator source

into the night sky as i walked out of my apartment and noticed a very bright sphere going from the northwest to the southeast.  at first i thought that it was zig zagging slightly but i could have been mistaken because of the disorientation i usually feel when i see these things. it stood out because the glow seemed to be brighter than the moon that was right beside it. i checked for blinking lights in case it may have been a plane but there were none, just a steady bright glow, and it flew a straight line until it started to disintegrate.  it slowly started to dissolve..Sort of reappeared
