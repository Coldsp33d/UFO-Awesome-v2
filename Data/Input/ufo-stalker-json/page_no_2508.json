wilderness.  this is about five miles from the nearest trail head in the oregon cascades mountains.  the wilderness area is located just south of the willamette pass ski area located along highway 58.  we were camped at the base of mt. yoran which is a rocky volcanic plug located just north of diamond peak.\r\n\r\nwe were in our sleeping bags looking up at a perfectly clear fully dark night sky.  there were no other campers or any other source of light.  we had a clear view of the sky and the dark spire outline of mt. yoran to our north with no obstructions. from our camp site to the top of yoran is less than 1000 feet.\r\n\r\nas we looked up a bright light came into view above mt. yoran.  from our perspective the angle of view was approximately 50 - 55 degrees above us to the north.  the object was pure white and at least 10 times the brightness and apparent diameter of any stellar object in the sky.  it moved smoothly and silently.  there were no flashing lights or any other sign of it being a conventional aircraft.\r\n\r\nas the light moved south it made a smooth sweeping crescent shaped arc to the east and eventually turned back to the north to disappear behind the black silhouette of mt. yoran.  the entire period of visibility was fairly short, but what could not be easily explained includes several interesting points:\r\n\r\n1.  the flight pattern was not normal for regional jets or local aircraft from the small oakridge or odell airport/landing strips, and there was no sound of any kind.\r\n2.  the willamette pass ski area could receive an emergency medical helicopter, but it is so close to mt. yoran that any such aircraft would have been noticeable from just below mt. yoran.\r\n3.  the object appeared to come in over mt. yoran and turn to the east and then north all the while staying over the visual space of mt. yoran from our angle of view.  no high altitude object would have been able to turn in such an arc.  it also could not have been an astronomical object since it moved slowly and turned smoothly all the while remaining pure white and not changing in intensity, color, or size.\r\n4.  we debated the visual clues that night and the next day to understand what we had seen.  nothing we could come up with matched the visual facts since we had a clear view with a large rocky peak to compare direction and size with.\r\n5.  the object moved eloquently as if under precise control.  it curving flight was mathmatical in its smoothness and it was moving much slower than a shooting star, much faster than a high altitude jet or large orbital object like the international space station (which i have observed on several occassions by the way.)\r\n6.  i personally was in the air force for four years and have countless hours of night time flight line experience observing every manner of aircraft.  this was not not similar to any winged aircraft.\r\n\r\nthe top 100 feet of mt. yoran represents an area of approximately an acre in total horizontal space.  from our point of view, it appeared the object was within several hundred feet of the summit and could have been up to 50 feet in diameter if it was as close as it appeared to yoran's rocky spire.\r\n\r\ni have attached a photo showing divide lake and mt. yoran from the angle we observed the object.  our camp was located at the north end of the small lake closest to the lower slope of the mountain.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

five seconds or more, and looked away for a few seconds to make sure i wasn't just seeing thing's, being so early in the morning for me. as i looked up again there it was still hanging there not far from the jet.\r\n i couldn't believe it. to me it looked like i was seeing the edge of a disc, and it was either giving off it's own very bright goldish, white light, or it was a metallic object that was reflecting the sun off of it's surface. i know it wasn't a star because it was very horizontal looking(one side of a disc).\r\n i then looked over at a friend of mine who had just started to look where i was looking. i said ,do you see that. he said, it's just a jet. so when i looked back up it was already gone. so he missed seeing it just within those few seconds, and i didn't get to see how

it was a stationary object in the sky and looked unlike anything we have seen before or since.  i went in the house to get the binoculars to see it better and it tilted made a zag to the right (west)

look to see if they saw anything but they did not. \r\n     what seems unusual about this is that i have never heard of any ufo looking like the one that we saw.  what we saw looked like a black 6

an extremely bright and unusually large star.We were saying how it was actually emanating light like the moon does when i started to see it change shapes.I could've sworn it was getting \"longer\" then contracting smaller again.Over and over i thought it was doing that.I asked my boyfriend and he said he noticed that but it was probably the fact that it was so bright that it appeared to be doing that since we're so far. i grabbed my binoculars and what i saw looked nothing like a star.It looked like a multi color translucent cone or what i called it was an octopus.The tip was white blue (like the color of stars) that faded into green then orange and yellow towards what appeared to be like octopus legs spreading outward in a cone shape.I continued watching it and i could've sworn the legs were swaying and contracting,yet it remained in the same general spot in relation to the stars.Then we both started seeing shooting stars that were that same color light blue coming downward.He saw 3 total and i saw 2 during this 2 hour period all together all while we were trading off with the binoculars. after stopping our neighbor that walked by and pointing out to him we asked him if he thought it was an unusually bright star and if he saw it changing or moving at all.He said he did too and we all kept watching it.I then looked at it again with the binoculars and its completely a different shape and size.It now looked like a circle ,still with the same colors,and separated \"legs\" but with white dots on the end of each \"leg\".The closest thing i could compare it to would be a far away firework shape. it then appeared to rotate horizontally making it look more like a flat disk,as if the shape was thin and had turned on its side.After the initial things we thought it could be like a plane,or light tower or something reflecting off the sun and after both of us telling each other out loud that we're not crazy we thought maybe it could be a meteor since all the shooting stars,then we thought it was missile testing(which we have actually seen before and later found out that's what it was).The sun was barely rising and it remained bright despite the other stars noticeably fading.The strange thing is that it remained in that position in relation to its neighboring stars while it changed shapes and got brighter then darker,bigger then smaller. we went inside before the sun came up and when we last looked at it it was slightly smaller but still as bright.We compared the clarity we saw when viewing a passing plane using the binoculars to the clarity we saw when looking at it and it was just as clear which makes me think it had to have been close.\r\ni could draw a picture in color of exactly what it looked like in all the shapes.\r\nmy main concerns were that given that we are at war it was another 9/11 type  thing and the other fear that worried me was fact that this incident was accompanied by so many shooting stars.I am hoping to hear that it was some random \"testing\" or that it was a local entertainment venue.As long as i gain some kind of confirmation that there was indeed something more than just a star and that our eyes and in this case extremely vivid imaginations weren't playing tricks on us. we both know what we saw and im hoping this site might help us find out what it was.","distance":"Over One

path, near military installations, and are current with modern jet aircraft information.My sons have excellent eyesight, and i have corrected vision.We were at our home in the front of the house when the sighting occured.\r\nthe event started when my youngest son visually detected two round objects near the 2/3 moon. the moon was at approx. 40 degrees above the horizon to the south/south-east.The sun was going down, and the sky was blue and clear-w/no clouds and excellent visibility.The two round objects were pointed out by my youngest son to my oldest son and myself, and we immediately saw the objects. we had no camera available with adequate lens magnification and the video camera's batt.S were dead.We did have a 25x spotting scope and a tripod which we set up immediately and used throughout the event.Both objects were percieved to be at high altitude, and were not star like; although they were luminescent(perhaps sunlight reflection).The objects moved from the right to the left of the moon and gained altitude as they did so, as measured by their proximity to the moon. the two objects never crossed in front of the moon. they did move independent of each other and reversed their direction several times during the observation.Both objects maintained the same size and brightness during the 20 minute observation until they moved away and then diminished in brightness. they would gradually move and then stop, sometimes one would stop or slow down and the other would close in next to it's companion. right before the objects moved beyond sight with the scope, the one that maintained it's position on the right very quickly/instantly moved (no percieved gradual acceleration)to the right away from it's companion and went out of magnified sight. the remaining object continued to move away and upward until it to was gone. at no time did the objects appear to be conventional aircraft, and no additional lights, or other colors beside the white luminouscity were seen on the objects.","distance":"Over One

roof and just was washing the sky but nothing interesting was happening so i went back inside my house.The timewas about 7:15pm so i could put a reminder on my t.V for 8:00pm. i probably took 5 minutes tops and went back outside. the sky was still clear and there was light outside and everything was normal nothing strange, all the regular stuff i normally see (planes, some birds, insects,) and at around 8 as the sun was setting it was getting a little dark but still good viewing. i guess it was about 10 to 15 minutes past 8pm when i saw from north going south a low imnot sure how high it was but well below a plane maybe about the height of a helicopter. a greyish almost cloud like color and it seemed at times see through like a cloud it was about the 50 feet long and made no sound it was kind of like a sonic wave almost that's the best way i can explaine it.I did have my digital camera with me but as soon as i saw it moving over the sky i kind of couldn't beleive it and i almost froze then i grabed my camera and took 4 to 5 pictures but when i brought my camera to work to look at them there was nothing on them but the tops of the trees and the sky. i would like to also tell you about an orb that i saw about a week ago also just over my house. at first i thought it was a peace of cotton that was getting some glare off the sun the time was about 6:00 to 6:30 pm on thursday oct. 11 2007 and it moved from east to west. i was staring up with my shades on and i caught a glare but as i said i figured it was cotton but it seemed to give off it's own light source the

i noticed out of my peripheral vision a light in the sky.  i glanced up and saw what i initially thought was a flare rising at approximately a 45 degree angle (north to south).  the flare then leveled out and traveled for roughly three seconds from my left to my right (north to south), then immediately and without indication of a turning motion or stop the light began moving the opposite direction (south to north).  at that time another light moved from a lower elevation out of my sightline up to roughly the same elevation as the first light.  the two lights then began traveling within my range of vision back and forth and up and down very strangely.  i have never seen anything move in such a manner.  \r\n\r\ni then tapped the shoulder of the gentleman next to me, pointed into the sky at the object and asked \"do you see that?\", to which the gentleman replied \"what the **** is that?!\" when he located the objects.  at roughly the same time another object appeared (exactly similar to the first two) from a cloud bank to the north and joined the other two.  all three objects were moving erratically and completely independantly of each other for apporximately 4 more minutes.  during this period several other people (roughly 10-20 people) noticed us staring into the sky and pointing and began looking at the objects as well.  there were several exclamations of excitement and amazement from the other witnesses.\r\n\r\nmy train arrived at 5:31pm and i boarded.  within 30 seconds of boarding the train we experienced a very furious hail storm for roughly 2 minutes.  after the hail cleared and as the train was travelling south i was watching out the window and saw two military fighter jets travelling at an extremely high rate of speed and very low to the group toward the location the objects were originally sighted.\r\n\r\nthis sighting occurred at the onset of some serious weather storms and the objects were actually in the sky between the normal clouds to the north and the dark clouds to the south.\r\n\r\nthe best description i can offer was that the objects looked like stars.  they were very bright, shape and size was undiscernable.  distance over the lake and elevation were also impossible to determine.  at the rate in which they crossed back and forth across the horizon, the speed was amazingly fast if they were more than 5 miles away.\r\n\r\ni contacted wgn news and abc news during the evening to see if anyone had reported the lights.  i was told that no one had reported anything.  i unfortunately did not have any type of camera when this occurred.\r\n\r\nthis is my first \"sighting\" of something strange.  i do not know what i saw, therefore it remains unidentified as far as i am concerned.  it was obviously in flight and tangible, so therefore i am reporting that it was an unidentified flying object (ufo).  when i first saw it i thought to myself, \"dont over-react. there is a perfectly logical explanation for what you are seeing.  you arent crazy\".  now i feel like i was part of something amazing, something that doesnt happen everyday.  i will remember this for the rest of my life, even though it will be determined to be a
