heard someone say \"i have never seen anything like that before\" but of course my only wittnesses were drunk. but the weekend before that my husband and his friend came in saying they saw a ufo i

to south\r\n\r\non march 31st, 1964 i had just come out of the movie theater on governor's island, new york, with a friend.  as we exited we were facing roughly due east or slightly east-southeast looking upward about 60 degrees above the horizon.  above us, over the building across the street from the theater we saw an object on our right at about 2 o���clock passing on a north to south trajectory.  a dim dark outline of the object was visible.  the shape was disk-like.  the object disappeared behind the building at about 10 o���clock.  we could distinctly see crisp outlines of rectangular windows which were brightly lit.  these rectangular shapes were passing left to right, ie., in a direction opposite the object���s trajectory, with each rectangle disappearing on the right as it rotated around and a new one appearing on the left.  the object���s horizontal span to the eye was perhaps 10 to 20 degrees.  it was clear that the object was very close.  it appeared to be within a distance of 200 feet at most.  \r\n\r\nthere were about 15 to 30 people ahead of us who had just exited, too.  most of them began running toward the left across the street, to follow the object, which was moving beyond the building located across the street.  the object appeared to be headed in a southerly direction.  we all ran, because we knew it was heading toward an enormous field, the old, original airfield on governors island, where the wright brothers first demonstrated their prototype plane to the united states army.  at the time this field was no longer in use except perhaps for an occasional helicopter.  \r\n\r\nmy friend and i had just seen a performance of the movie, \"the ugly american\" with marlon brando.  the movie had started very late in the afternoon and ended in the early evening.  as we exited it had just turned dark.  the sky was fairly clear with a few low clouds that evening.  visibility was good.  the time was perhaps about 8 pm, possibly 7 pm.  my friend and i left by the theater's front door.  immediately, as we exited the theater we looked directly up and overhead.  others exiting just before us had seen the object, too.  what made us first notice the object was the excited reports of those who had just exited before us.\r\n\r\naltogether about 20 people ran from the theater out to the air field.  the object appeared to be moving at a steady speed.  i would guess it was going only about 20 to 30 mph, based on my sense of its altitude and distance.  we saw it continue on in a southerly direction at a low altitude, until it disappeared from view somewhere over staten island.  \r\n\r\ntotal elapsed time until the object became too indistinct was about 2 to 3 minutes.  when we first saw it we did not have any idea what it was.  we were very attuned to the sky.  we commuted through the harbor by ferry every day to go to school on staten island.  since governors island is right in the middle of new york harbor, aircraft pass overhead all the time.  thus people residing there, such as those who were exiting the theater that evening, are naturally accustomed to seeing aircraft frequently overhead.  however, this was not any ordinary aircraft.  the object was clearly not a plane for it was moving much slower than a plane would.  nor was it a helicopter.  there was no sound, no noise at all.  governors island is exceptionally quiet.   you could tell when aircraft were flying low over the island.  low altitude passovers were infrequent.  this object flew much lower than any i had ever seen in the two years i had lived on the island.  we didn���t believe any balloon could produce such a convincing appearance of rotation, because it was simply too close for us to be unable detect whether it was a balloon.  also it was moving much faster than we thought any balloon could go.  we had seen a number of dirigibles but did not know of any that had rotating lights.  none of the flashy well-lit ones that are common today were common in new york harbor then.  \r\n\r\nthe unfamiliar qualities of this object led some 25 people to run out of the theater toward it.  we were so sure that this was a valid ufo sighting that we expected there to be some mention of it in the next day or two in the newspaper.  we saw no news reports.

admiring the nice weather and gazing at the night sky,i notice out of the corner of my eye a very large,bright light approaching from the northwest.I begin to watch as it comes closer towards where i am standing.This object seemed to have come from at least 5 miles or more away and from the vicinity of the delawaer river scenic area, this area is very rural and at the lower reaches of the catskill and shawangunk mountains.It was a mostly clear night,very few clouds and plenty of stars out.As this came closer i realized that this was not any star or airplane,it was to bright,with no apparent blinking lights of a conventional aircraft!I thought to myself here we go again,you see,me and 4 friends witnessed the infamous boomerang craft while camping in a secluded area of dutchess county n.Y in the mid 1980s,but thats a whole different sighting altogether!!Anyway,this object is,by now maybe a half a mile away and is brighter than any thing in the sky.Im fixed on it with my eyes and contemplating running inside and grabbing my video camera,but i decide to just stay and watch this thing.Its then that irealize it is no longermoving but is completely stationary.I watched this for at least a minute or more when it suddenly flashed really bright and shot across to the east and back to approx.Where it was when it flashed!!It looked like the same thing as waving a lit cigarette,back and forth in a dark room,thats the only comparison that even comes close to what i seen this object do.By now i am totally mesmerized by what i am seeing and caught up in the moment.I watched this as it moved across the night sky in a more northernly direction from wich it came.The whole episode lasted 2or3minutes.I only told my wife and closest friend of this at the time.Months later while talking with a neighbor about this,his 27 year old son interrupted me and said almost word for word everything i saw that night.It was nice to know i wasnt the only one to witness this event and my eyes werent decieving me that late summer night!!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

chem-clouds.\r\n\r\nthere is a very large window in my second floor apartment.  i turned off the television about 9:30 p.M. and went to the window to see if i could discover whether the clouds had cleared.\r\n\r\nthese ���clouds��� had been in the making all day by the double-barreled tanker planes that produce chemtrails.  i was checking the sky because i was hoping to be able to open the windows to let in some fresh air.  since i just recently found information on chemtrails and am still learning about this, i wasn���t sure that it was safe to have my windows open if the ���chem-clouds��� were still there.  \r\n\r\nwhile i was peering out the window into the dark sky, trying to determine whether i could see anything, a very large mass of light passed behind a chem-cloud showing me that, in fact, the chemtrails were still there.  i would call this a ���ball��� of light, except the mass was diffused behind the chem-cloud so i couldn���t see any precise shape to it.  but my guess was that it was a ���ball��� of light.\r\n\r\nit didn���t make any sound. this wasn���t like anything i have ever seen before.  stars and planets and planes all have small points of sparkling light that are either stationary or traveling in a mostly straight path.  this light was many times larger, like a huge cotton ball sliding down a winding path in order to stay behind the curved chem-cloud, swooping like a giant bird, covering much more distance than a plane.  its motion appeared almost playful.\r\n\r\nit appeared in the east and swooped to the west.  as soon as it was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another one appeared in the east and swooped to the west like it was following the same identical winding path to stay hidden behind the chem-cloud.\r\n\r\nwhen that one was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another appeared.  it finally dawned on me that i should start counting.  so i can���t be positive, but i think that there were approximately 6 in all and identical in size, light, and path���except for the last one.  that one surprised me when it got to the west side, because it turned slightly and came back a short distance before it disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

that weekend my wife and i went to my sisters home in chester county, sc.  this is where i was raised.  we got there just before it got dark.  we unloaded some things from the car and took them into the house.  my nephew,donald, was helping me.  he was about 9 years old at the time.  donald and i went back outside to look at the moon with binoculars.  i had 10 x 50 binoculars that i had just bought.  as donald was looking at the moon, i saw a brilliant white light coming across the sky.  my first thought was one of the earth satellites that was in orbit early in the space program.  i got the binoculars from donald and started looking at the object.  i immediately knew this was no satellite.  it appeared to be a disc that rotated inside a larger disc.  i could see lights inside the rotating disc.  i called my wife and my sister to come outside.  i gave my wife the binoculars and asked her to look at the object.  her first words were \"what is that, its rotating ?\"  i had not said anything about it rotating.  we all took turns looking at it.  it was probably no more than 2 or 3 minutes.  the object was moving at a fast rate of speed.  it was moving from left to right, which would be from northwest to southeast.  as it went away from us, it appeared to stop and hover in air for maby a minute or more.  then suddenly the whole sky was illuminated by abrilliant white light.  i would describe it as seeing a flash from a camera in a dark room.  after that everything went dark.  there never was any sound at all.  there was no wings like an airplane.  it just appeared to be disc rotating within a disc.  this was no star, meteor, or anything like that.  i know this was a long time ago but i will always remember what we saw.  most people seemed unistered when i told them what we saw.  i have a bs degree in chemistry and have always tried to apply scientific approach to things.  i have spent much time outside at night looking up at the sky.  never have i saw

we heard the sound of dripping water outside as we lay in bed waiting for santa to come. we over at my uncle bjorn's house in stockholm celebrating christmas with dancing and abba discos! we thought it was santa feeding his reindeer outside, so we ran out with our video camera to greet him. it wasn't him. we were just so shocked! there were all these little guy with slimey green skin and 10 hands and 100 legs and 20 arms and 78 feet and seven heads! there skin was so neon green it glowed in the dark and they didn't need lights because they had night vision contacts! my little brother who is just so bold walked right up to them and asked them what they were doing in our garden. my mommy scolded him and told him to be more polite as the martians were our guests. the martians were celebrating christmas they said. my brother was all of a sudden happy and interested in every little thing they said. apparently they knew santa claus and he was on holiday in perth, australia so the martians were filling in for him that year. they had just finished delivering all their presents to all the little human children that they decided to land in our garden for a little party before returning to wackatanilani(planet undiscovered by those silly humans). they invited us to join in tango dancing and offered us gourmet slime chocolate chip cookies with a glass of slime for us children and a glass of martini slime for my mommy. we had sooo much fun. it was sooo awesome. next, they took us to their ships of all different assorted sizes. they often escort many different species so they must have different shaped ships to accomodate different amounts of legs and heads and whatnot. they gave us a ride on the ufos and took us to mars. it was all red and dusty and it made me sneeze and feel nauseous. i just wanted to go home. they took us to wackatanilani next which was much better than mars. it was all tropical and looked suspiciously like hawaii except that there were all these martians and their purple spikey dogs sitting on levitating porches. they took us back home and laid us in bed because we were so tired. they said they would visit us on december 25, 3000 when santa claus is going on holiday to iceland. we didn't have enough time to remind them that we wouldn't be alive then when one of them said \"beam me up slimey\" before disappearing in a cloud of dust. we fell asleep immediately and awoke in the morning as if nothing had ever happened. we ate scrambled eggs for breakfast which was really good because my mom cooked them and then put them on toast. you see my brother can't cook very well and usually the eggs come out all watery and somehow orangy with all this gunk like liquidy stuff on the side and he burns the toast and uses cheap margarin instead of irish butter which my mom says is the best kind and then she uses it on bagels too not just toast. and then we opened our presents. i got the bike i had always wanted and my brother got the plastic ufo toy he wanted. haha! it was a bit of a joke after we been on the real thing. we went to school on january 1 and we told all our friends what had happened. none of them believed us and they punched us in the noses and refused to be our friends. we have never had any friends since because we keep telling them about the martians. this is okay though because we know the truth about ufos now!!! we are so glad to have found the mutual ufo network to find people who know the truth and aren't blinded by the social norms of these brainwashed humans. we have dedicated our lives to the research of ufos.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"12:59:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Patterned Surface,  Insignia,  Appendage(s),  Louvres,  Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":8147,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":59.32893,"location":null,"logNumber":"SE-10152007-0005","longitude":18.06491,"occurred":977738340000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Stockholm County","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,  Boomerang,  Bullet,  Missile,  Cigar,  Cone,  Chevron,  Circle,  Cross,  Cylinder,  Diamond,  Disc,  Egg,  Fireball,  Flash,  Oval,  Saturn-like,  Sphere,  Square,  Rectagular,  Star-like,  Teardrop,  Triangle,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":977738340000,"summary":"It was soooooo cool!

i wondered what was going on.  \r\n\r\ni ran downstairs and into the living room where my mom was sitting, trying to figure out why her reception, too, had been interrupted. the fan sound was really loud still and it sounded as if it were right above the house.  we both went outside the front door, which was connected to the living room and ran out to the front sidewalk.  \r\n\r\nwe looked up and about 30 feet above us and directly above the house was a black sphere, about the size of a suv, maybe 12 to 15 feet in diameter.  it was perfectly round with 2 panels protruding out from opposite sides \r\nthat were about 5 feet long and 2 feet wide, and a pole on the bottom that extended down maybe 5 to 6 feet, with a reddish/yellow light on the end. the panels did not seem to be causing the flight.  i could not figure out where the fan sound was coming from.  the craft was very still, besides the slow movement over the house.  the fan sound was so loud.  there were no markings that were visible to me.  the black surface seemed to shine, almost metallic. there were no lights other than the one at the end of the pole. it hovered slowly past us and once it was about 50 feet away, it suddenly became 150 feet away.  it did not zip away with great speed, it did not disappear and reappear, it simply took the perspective of being 150 feet away.  \r\n\r\nmy mom and i were freaked out.  the fan sound without an engine sound running with it was unexplainable.  we went back inside and i had the feeling that i wanted to go chase it or call someone. now that i look back on it, i wish i had.  my mom picked up the phone and dialed the sparta airport number which was about 5 miles down the road.  she reported as best she could what we had just seen and they said they did not have anything on the radar.  i shared this story with several people around that time.  \r\n\r\nuntil recently, as my conversations with people have delved into the ufo subject, i recount this night and

in the sky, appearing to us as a spotlight.  the distance was less than 1 mile and the elevation above ground level appeared to be several hundred feet.  i stopped the car to watch it and it suddenly went out.  at the time i was thinking a helicopter searchlight was looking for a lost hunter or something, as the area is quite remote.\r\n\r\ni drove my wife to work and returned by the same route some 45 minutes later. the road was skiff mountain road in sharon, ct, opposite pecks pond, which will be shown on a map of the area.  stopping in the same spot but with the car pointing in the opposite direction which was north.  nothing was visible but i stopped the car and got out a very powerful spotlight of 1 million candlepower.  i shined the light to the east, toward where i saw the object earlier.  suddenly and instantly, the light came back on, this time shining in my direction.  it was of extreme brightness, beyond anything i have seen on an aircraft before.  i turned my light off but the object kept its light focused on me and began to slowly move to the north.  i returned to the car to turn the engine off in my car to better hear if there were rotor or engine sounds. as i went to my car to turn off the engine, i saw my distinct shadow and that of my car so i am certain this spotlight was pointed in my direction.This is an extremely rural area and there were no sounds detectable.  i could see some reflection of the light in a pond that was situated between me and the object. i am very familiar with the area as i have hunted deer in that precise area for years.  there are no homes, businesses, or installations of any kind in that area. \r\n\r\ni cannot say anything definitive about the shape of the object other than that my impression was that it was of a diamond or delta shape.  there were no position or navigation lights visible. there was no moon or other artificial light in the area;  no streetlights or house lights either. the object began accellerating to the north but the light continued to shine in my direction.  there was still no noise.  based on the terrain and my familiarity with the area, i would say that it could not have been higher than several hundred feet.  my shadow and that of my car were extremely elongated, indicating that its height above terrain was quite low.  all of this happened within 3 to 4 minutes or so.  then the accelleration became extreme and the light remained on.  within in the next 20 to 30 seconds, it accelerated, without any apparent increase in altitude, to the northeast at an incredible speed and as the light became more and more faint, until it appeared to be extinguished.  it traveled 8 to 10 miles to the northeast in those 20 to 30 seconds. \r\n\r\ni was prompted to report this incident as i have just had another tonight which i will detail in the next report, following this one.\r\n\r\ni am retired now but hold a commercial pilots license with, aircraft single,

lake/charle ng haunting crime scenes. it was a success, but i am regretting not stopping at the argonaut mine. we drove past it slowly, we looked at it, but we didn't stop to investigate. one of the greatest mining disasters happened at the argonaut mine, where many lives were lost. i believe there is plenty of residual haunting activity at this mine location. \r\n\r\ngoing over my emails, i received this email from deb gibble on mount shasta:\r\n\"one night recently, on coast to coast am, a guy called in and said he was hiking alone in the trinity alps area or somewhere up there where he had a good view of shasta, and he saw not one but two f15's fly into the mountain. it's like the mountain opened up and they went in and the door closed, like aladdin's cave or the pied piper or something! the reason he called in is people were speculating where steve fossett might be, and the man was suggesting fossett's plane, too, might have been swallowed up. the phone conversation you had implies to me that, let's call them the 0 club, is monitoring paranormal sites or activities. i don't think it's a bad thing. i'm glad they're curious about the universe, too! take care. deb

(thinking it was my boss).\r\ntr: hello, you can call me tr, i am with the osir.\r\npaul: osir? as in the office of scientific investigation and research?\r\ntr: yes. are you still conducting the pre-investigation at mt. shasta?\r\npaul: yes, october 13.\r\ntr: where will you post your story first?\r\npaul: on the forum at hpi.\r\ntr: anywhere else? the hpi forum is not an open forum, will you post it at your own site jazma online!?\r\npaul: yes.Tr: do you plan to fictionalize the story or are you reporting the story as truthful?\r\npaul: truthful...Why?\r\ntr: if you and your team see anything of significance, we may be in contact with you, we may want to talk with you. are you okay with this?\r\npaul: sure.\r\ntr: thank you.\r\npaul: can i contact you while i am at the summit?\r\ntr: no, we will wait for your article, if needed we will contact you.\r\npaul: okay.Tr: thank you, goodbye.\r\npaul: goodbye.\r\n\r\nas i looked back on my phone, the numbers were 0000 indicating a secure line from the government. i am aware of the 0000 because with a government job i had, i had to deal with the fbi all the time. when the fbi called, it was always 0000. if this is not the osir, then it is someone in the government that is curious on our findings. it could even be norad for all i know. the interesting thing is...Why would mt. shasta have ufo cams on the mountain, if someone isn't really interested. osir in the ufo community is rumored to be government funded and some suspect the funds come from the cia. dan ankroyd in the 80s came out with a television called psi factor based on the activities of the osir. here is the official osir website: http://www.Osironline.Org/to better understand the osir, which for the longest time was a covert agency, which recently went overt and then back to covert status, see this article:http://www.Unexplained-mysteries.Com/viewnews.Php?Id=65179i believe the osir website that we now see, which is overt is actually a group of people who have taken on the name osir and they are not the real osir, but of course this is my opinion. i later learn from paranormal investigator chris grissom, that this telephone call could have been hoaxed and the 0 numbers could have been done by telephone spoofing. rats! i thought i had the real men in black after me! \r\n\r\nlike jim phelps of mission impossible's i.M. force, i am going over the bios, profiles and photos of some of the hpi paranormal investigators and i am amazed at the variety of members we have in hpi with very interesting backgrounds. holly delaughter's ex-father in law is country music hall of famer hollis r. 'red lane\" delaughter.   donna reynolds is a witch of the sacred fire circle and going through her emails, she tells me that i should check out their festivals and write an article, she goes into details to tell me the upcoming festivals they are having, like: dark moon circle on wednesday, october 10, 2007; full moon circle on 10/26; wanda's autumn bazaar at her shop in elk grove on 10/27; an all-hallow's eve event at her shop on 10/31; and their samhain celebration on 11/10.   donna at the last minute had to cancel, due to some serious issues she needed to take care of.  we do have some interesting 'characters' in hpi.\r\n\r\nnow to the pre-investigation at hand.  the date is october 13, 2007, saturday.  roll call for paranormal investigators/ufologists/cryptozoologists:  paul dale roberts, lead investigator/scout, michele stump/researcher, chris grissom/technician, nicole rae pollard, holly delaughter/psychic, kelley tuttle/guide/psychic, bruce roseberry/guide, glennis roseberry/guide/mt. shasta historian, hanako zeidenberg.  \r\n\r\nthe reason why i gave us all titles of ufologists and cryptozoologists, because we all earned our merits for being a cryptozoologist by tracking bigfoot and a ufologist by ufo skywatching this night.\r\n\r\nlet's talk about the history of this magic mountain, we all know as mount shasta:mount shasta was formerly known as strawberry valley, berryvale and sisson. a long history of mythology surrounds the mountain, including legends of lemurians, atlanteans, secret commonwealth citizens, dwarfs, fairies, bigfoot, and space beings who materialize at will. the indians believed mt. shasta was a portal to other dimensions.  bigfoot of course is associated with ufos and is considered an interdimensional being, that can walk into this reality and his own dimensional reality at will. mt. shasta is a very special place to say the least; it represents much more than just a mere mountain. mt. shasta can be considered as one of the most sacred places on this planet. the mountain is a mystic power source for this planet.  some people theorize that it is connected to a leyline, similar to stonehenge in england.   it is a focus for angels, spirit-guides, spaceships, masters from the light realm, wicca and the home of the survivors of ancient lemuria, which sank under the waves of the pacific ocean a little over 12,000 years ago.   \r\n\r\nthe last of the lemurians and some believe the last of the atlanteans (of atlantis) retreated to underground caverns in this sacred mountain.  people who have been in the caverns, claim to hear the sound of machinery.  in the 1930s, little people with bags of gold would come out of the caverns and trade their gold for goods provided by the farmers.  \r\n\r\nfor those gifted with clairvoyant abilities, mt. shasta is embraced in a gigantic, etheric purple pyramid whose capstone reaches far beyond this planet into space, and connects us intergalactically to the confederation of planets for this sector of the milky way galaxy. this awesome pyramid is also created as an inverted version of itself, reaching far down to the very core of the earth. you can call mt. shasta the entry point of the light-grids of this planet, where most of the energy comes first from the galactic and universal core before it is disseminated to other mountains and into the grids. most mountaintops, especially tall mountains, are beacons of light, feeding the light-grids of this planet.  strange lights and sounds are often seen or heard on the mountain. lenticular clouds, shadows and outstanding sunsets add to the mystical aura of the mountain. several tunnels stretch far into the interior of this majestic mountain. people come here to seek out the present-day lemurians, survivors of the sinking of the continent of mu. yes, our lemurian brothers and sisters are real; they are well and physically alive, living in the subterranean city of \"telos\" beneath mount shasta, so legend has it!   \r\n\r\nthe lemurians, atlanteans were a highly evolved race of people, that surpass our own living styles with their advanced technology.  many people believe that these ancient civilizations were visited by the gods (extraterrestrials).  prior to the sinking of their continent, fully aware of the eventual destiny of their beloved continent, the ancient lemurians, using their mastery of energy, crystals, sound and vibrations, hollowed out a vast underground city, with the intention of preserving their culture, their treasures, and their records of ancient earth's history; history that has been lost since the sinking of atlantis. lemuria was once a vast continent, and larger than north america, connected to parts of california, oregon, nevada and washington. this large continent disappeared overnight into the pacific ocean over 12,000 years ago in a vast cataclysm. all inhabitants of the earth at that time considered lemuria, the land of mu, their motherland, and there was much weeping on the earth when that happened. about 25,000 lemurians at that time were able to migrate into the interior of mt. shasta, the most important of their various administration centers, prior to the sinking of their motherland.  they are still here in tangible, physical, immortal bodies, totally unlimited, living a life of pure heaven on earth. american indians believed that mt. shasta was of such immense grandeur, that its existence could only be attributed to the creation of a very \"great spirit\". they also believed that an invisible race of little people, about four feet tall, lived along its slopes as guardians. these wondrous little people, often referred to as \"the little people of mt. shasta\", are also kind of physical, but not quite, and they are very often seen visually around the mountain. they are third dimensional beings like humans, but they live on a slightly higher level of the third dimension, such as third and one half level, and they have the ability to make themselves visible and invisible at will. i think i explained enough about the history.  \r\n\r\nnow let's talk about this pre-investigation to this sacred mountain.  07:30 hours:  chris grissom & michele stump arrive at my doorstep.  we pack up my vehicle 'ghosttracker' and hit i-5 north towards redding.  we arrive at starbucks at 1400 eureka way for a briefing at 1300 hours.  i explain to them the history of mt. shasta and the purpose of our investigation.  the reason for our investigation is merely to seek the truth.  kelley tuttle, a resident of redding, discusses other information about mt. shasta to the team and will guide us to the campground, being prepared by bruce & glennis roseberry.  kelley who was very enthusiastic uses white shoe polish and writes on the three vehicles heading to mt. shasta 'hpi paranormal' across the back windows.  the mib won't have a hard time spotting us out.  kelley equips each driver of the three vehicles with walkie talkies.  we convoy up to the campsite with kelley leading.  during the whole stretch everyone is talking on the walkie talkies about this and that in regard to mount shasta.  i glance down at the book holly loaned me called 'the lost civilization of lemuria - the rise and fall of the world's oldest culture by frank joseph.'  \r\n\r\nmichele stump, our historian/researcher doesn't waste time going through the contents of this book.  as we head up the mountain, there was one black government type of vehicle going down the opposite way.  the woman in the car, wore dark sunglasses and a suit with black tie.  what was odd is i am going up towards the mountain and she is going down the mountain and our eyes connected as we passed.  well, it just seemed odd.  after that odd glance with the possible mib, we chatted more on the walkie talkies and talked about how the weather gods were on my side.  the skies were very clear and it was a warm day.  there were many naysayers that thought this day would be cloudy and rainy.  it rained hard on friday, but i did a general george s. patton prayer for good weather and it worked!  i also told everyone how i stopped in the small town at arbuckle and i was waiting forever for this pick-up to move and finally gave up and crossed over.  i look back and a colusa county sheriff pulled me over.  he said i didn't yield.  i explained politely the situation and he ran my plates and let me go.  whew!  besides the walkie talkie chatter, i had to listen to michele and chris argue about the 49ers and the cowboys.  michele had her 49er jersey on and chris had his cowboy jersey on.  \r\n\r\nwe met up with bruce and glennis at black bear restaurant and bruce and glennis lead the convoy to the campsite.  it was a perfect campsite, we had a clear view of mount shasta and the open sky.  i went over the equipment that was assigned to everyone.  let's go over it here:\r\n\r\npaul:  listen up sound enhancer, police band walkie talkie (not used), cell phone, digital camera, binoculars, 2 flashlights, 1 red laser light.  note: laser lights and flashlights are to signal ufos, some ufo groups use this method to signal ufos and they in turn signal back.  i signaled the morse code for 'hello'.  \r\n\r\nholly & nicole: 2 digital cameras, emf detector, 2 cellphones, 2 listen up sound enhancers, 2 laser pen lights, audio digital recorder, video camera, telephoto lens (cannon & rebel cameras), dowsing rods, video camera, 2 flashlights.  note: nicole became a spotter for bigfoot using binoculars.\r\n\r\nhanoko: digital camera, cell phone, tent, sleeping bag.  note: hanoko became a spotter for the group surveying the hills with binoculars.\r\n\r\nmichele: tent, digital camera, cell phone, binoculars, telescope, night scope.\r\n\r\nglennis: digital camera, cell phone, 2 sets of binoculars, tent.\r\n\r\nchris: flashlight, cell phone.Kelley: tent, emf gauge detector, retracting telescope, digital camera, binoculars, digital audio recorder.\r\n\r\nas we set up tents, gathered rocks for a makeshift fire site, i looked upon the hillside and saw a long-haired topless woman moving about frantically.  i instantly thought, could this be a lovely nordic alien woman moving about the bushes?  i had to go up and investigate.  it was actually nicole, with her long lady godiva hair, she threw off her top because she ran into a nest of wasps.  she actually got stung 15 times.  she was like a champ and after i took out the wasps out of her hair, she continued to assist everyone in gathering firewood.\r\n\r\nwhile we still had daylight, we did a bigfoot scouting mission.  our objective is to gather any bigfoot hair or dung samples.  we were to look for any bigfoot nesting area and try and locate some bigfoot footprints in the mud, in which we would have took photos of the footprints and placed plaster of paris around the footprint for analysis.  the spotters were nicole & michele for this scouting mission, both using high-powered binoculars.  during this mission, i was also looking for angel hair (associated with ufos.  ufos are known to deposit angel hair that is almost like a spider's web.  it disintegrates quickly - no angel hair found).\r\n\r\nas night fell, everyone shared snacks and beverages.  i brought cheese, ham, ritz crackers, cheez-its, pepsi.  kelley treated us to apple streudel pastry.  other members brought a variety of snacks to munch on, as we prepared the telescopes for observation of mount shasta and the open night skies.  during this night sky watch, we signaled the skies with our laser pen lights and high-powered flashlights.  signaling ufos was not successful, we did not obtain any signals back.  during this ufo investigation, i had hanoko drive the ghost tracker (i was tired of driving) to the local store for necessities for the group.  after driving around in the pitch darkness for a good long while, we decided to go back, before we got lost.  it's amazing how all of the streets look the same in the deep woods of this alpine forest.  hanoko was having a good time, this was her very first ufo/bigfoot investigation and we talked about how we first arrived i threw on some halloween music 'thriller by michael jackson' and finally some rick james.  when another camping party told us if we can turn down the music, i said to everyone���.'oops!  that brought me back to reality, i remember we need to do a serious investigation up here', as i turned down the music.  hanoko and i, never did find that store.\r\n\r\nwe had a couple of mishaps that we now look back at and laugh.  i am reminded by this team, that whatever happens in mt. shasta, stays in mt. shasta!   so, i will not disclose those hilarious mishaps.\r\n\r\nmost of the group stayed up most of the night, i had a whistle, so in case anyone fell asleep, i was going to blow my whistle and wake up the group if i saw a ufo during 3am to 5am.  guess what?  i fell asleep, i was so disappointed in myself, that i could not stay up for that long.  i literally passed out in my car, it must be that high altitude.  this was an exciting pre-investigation and the whole team had felt like family.  michele felt a spiritual connection to this mountain.  i was saddened that michele lost her $900.00 wedding ring at this campsite.  she lost it by taking off her gloves.  in the morning time, we looked and looked and it was nowhere to be found.  i made contact with shannon 'ms. macabre' mccabe, president of h.P.I. and told her about our findings, i placed her on speaker phone as she talked with this group.  unfortunately, we did not capture an alien 'gray' and hogtie it for positive proof that aliens do exist, nor did we gather any dung samples to place on shannon's doorstep the next day.  none of us received an anal probe either.  after i told shannon about my findings���she could only say one thing���'rock and roll!'  it was nice sitting around the campfire, telling jokes, talking about the legends of mt. shasta.  glennis and bruce who frequently visit mount shasta, had so many historical insights about this magic mountain.  glennis explained to us how a group of indians were massacred near and around mount shasta and that perhaps there is a lot of residual haunting activity at this location.\r\n\r\ni thank the guides, kelley for leading us to the campsite and glennis and bruce for preparing the campsite for us!  we could have not done this mission, without their assistance.  i thought to myself, since people claim to see lemurians, dwarfs, aliens and fairies, couldn't all of these creatures be the same thing.  they are all described as being small people.  could fairy circles be the equivalent of crop circles or ufo landing sites?  hmmm.  the only tall creatures that exist near mount shasta are the nordics which are compared to as angels, because they are tall, pale and have long blonde hair.  then there is bigfoot, which is supposingly 10 to 12 feet in height.  in the morning, as we all were about to head out, nicole and holly said they were having breakfast with glennis and bruce at the black bear restaurant and were going to drive up the mountain towards the caverns sunday morning before heading home.  we cleaned up the campsite and everyone gave each other a farewell hug and discussed future scouting missions to places like whiskey hill in redding and some other haunted sites.  since i was tired, i let one more person have the honors of driving the ghost tracker home.  i let chris drive the ghost tracker home as i took a power nap.  chris drove himself home and then i drove michele back to my house to retrieve her car and she was heading home with a million errands to do.  on our way back, we got a call from hanoko, she left her sleeping bag in my trunk and we were able to pull off the side of the road, where she was waiting for us to get her sleeping bag.  thank goodness for cellular phones!   the next time we investigate mount shasta will be next summer and we're bringing a bigger team up with us!  \r\n\r\nfindings:\r\n\r\npaul: using binoculars spies a large animal behind a tree.  could be a large deer.  i saw a fast moving object (bright light) shoot straight up from the horizon near mount shasta and disappear.   many of the team members were able to see the billions of billions of stars in the night skies, the milky way, the big dipper and satellites moving across the night sky.  the night sky was gorgeous.\r\n\r\nkelley: her psychic abilities causes her to feel dread at a hollow out tree.  later on this evening, she spotted what she thought was a ufo, fast moving object that disappears as fast as it appeared. object appeared as a star.  her emf meter went off on its own during the bigfoot scouting mission.\r\n\r\nholly:  feels a presence further up the hill during the bigfoot scouting mission.\r\n\r\nhanoko:  spots 2 ufos in the night skies using binoculars.  they moved swiftly in a linear pattern.  both ufos moved swiftly from point a to point b and vanished.  both ufos are separate incidents.\r\n\r\nbruce: spots one ufo, didn't get full information on his sighting.\r\n\r\nbigfoot scouting mission:  scouts: nicole, holly, hanoko, paul, kelley, michele.  headquarters with walkie talkie was chris grissom.  three scouts hear strange shrieking cry from their listen up devices. bigfoot is known to make screeching sounds.  no dung samples obtained, the closest dung sample was deer dung and i wasn't about to pick that up!   one location of our scouting expedition, we discovered no birds chirping, which we thought was unusual.  it has been said that if bigfoot is nearby, birds will stop chirping.  holly feels that there is a presence further up the hill, but we decide to turn back before it gets too dark.  we also heard a loud rustling noise, but that could have been a large mammal. \r\n\r\nnow as i close this

sighting was behind daniels harbour, very near to portland creek.  me, her and her brother where out looking in awe at the milky way when we noticed flashing lights off to the west/north west.  i pointed them out, but they had noticed already, and wondered if it was the northern lights in some fashion or a meteor shower.  slowly them cam closer until the moment became so surreal.  here we were watching, what i was conviced of at the time, a fleet of alien spacecraft.  they were in a staggered formation..\r\n\r\n0     0     0     0\r\n\r\n   0     0     0    \r\n\r\n0     0     0

girlfriend said she could make out the shape of the objects.  i thought i could, but wasn't too sure.  she said they were triangle shaped, i though maybe they were triangled but kind of stretched into a teardrop shape.  i later had a dream, about 5 days later, of them being teardropped that was very vivid.  her brother appeared to be scarred and got in the car.  i was amazed, shocked, in awe, and felt very peacefull.  fear was nowhere in my body.  eventually they passed very slowly and vanished over the tree line.  i waited until the last one was out of site.  \r\n\r\nthere was also a solid white light that made a west to east path as the last few went over head. \r\n\r\ni also have to admit that i heard the rumble of jet engines.  although very very faint and not until they first ones were well past.  cfb goosebay may have been running maneuvers or whatever they do, but i have never seen lights like these on the bottoms of fighter jets.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

retracing its path several times. it reversed direction in the sky 5 times before moving west. the lights at first looked very much like a plane with the exception of being very bright. the configuration was wrong for a plane as well. on the end pointing toward the west it started out as being green. the next light in the middle was red then the light on the east side was a bright strobing white light. the red and green lights were slowly pulsating and eventually all the lights turned to red. the strobing light also went to red. the duration of the incident was about 3 minutes. the craft eventually kept going west and we could not see it as it went behind a large oak tree. the distance from us was difficult to judge. perhaps 5 miles or so. we used binoculars to watch it but could not make out what the shape was. i would say that by the configuration of the lights that it appeared to be cigar shaped. i would be interested in hearing if anyone else in the area saw this as well.
