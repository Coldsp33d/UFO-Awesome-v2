returned home she stood in front of me unlocking the door.  i remember seeing very bright strobing light shining over my shoulders which prompted me to say \"what is that?\", and then turn around.  about halfway into my turning time slowed down and it felt as though the air was thick like vaseline.  both my mother and i saw this round object, about 3 feet off the ground and roughly 20 feet away was stationary and, pulsating.  because time had slowed it was initially a strobing white that seemed slow as well until it turned green and the flashing started to speed up.  as the light began to appear quicker so did time slowly start to return to \"normal\".  finally it went purple as time returned to how we normally perceive it and as it began flashing very quickly it finished with a burst of light leaving no trace of having ever been there.  i can't speculate as to whether it moved or just disappeared because it temporarily blinded me because the flash was so bright.  given that this object was maybe only 20 feet from us, and was so far outside the realm of normalcy, i was frantic telling my mom we needed to leave or call the cops or something.  what was equally confounding and frightening was my mother responded with a very flat affect, as if sedated, claiming perhaps it was a power line.  it was very much unlike her.  i was frantic and shocked, determined to leave our home and return to my grandparents house or anything to get us away from where we were.  i can only describe my reaction as panicked and very frightened.   as many years have passed when i now ask my mom  about it she claims she was merely trying to remain calm so that i didn't become more frightened but i think there was more to it than that.  it had been clear to me that this was not any kind of earthly phenomenon, and there wasn't a technological explanation in my back yard where there was a stone wall.  i didn't know anyone in the area outside of our next door neighbor so it couldn't have been kids playing a joke because there were no kids in that area to my dismay as a child/teen.  i automatically assumed it was something outside our realm of understanding given that time slowed during the event.  even at 12-13 i had experienced enough frightening events to be able to say this wasn't similar to how \"time slows\" when you say crash your bike.  this was time slowing presumably by other means because it was like rah second was 5 seconds long.","distance":"20 Feet or

of a stick. i joked and said ok, now merge together, at which point, as seen in the video, the lights moved much closer together and turned on a sharp angle in the sky and proceeded towards the airspace above me. \r\nas they got above me the lights went out but i was able to observe two teardrop shapes, pointy end forward against the slightly light polluted sky, one hovered above me while the other continue north over my roof and over the treeline behind me. the second one shortly followed course.\r\nout of view.\r\n\r\ni was arrested the next morning for abusing the traffic out front

sitting on my front porch listening to music and since i like to listen to aircraft passing i decided to pull my headphones off. the strange thing was that there was no sound. this light was hovering over that house for about a minute or so. the light was very bright but oddly enough not so bright that i couldn't look directly at it. i'm located in the columbia area and i could tell that i was facing north when looking at this object. that bright white light shut off. what replaced that bright white light was a green and red light pattern. it's difficult to explain but the lights appeared to be one and the same and yet separate at the same time. this craft still didn't move and i could tell because it didn't appear to be getting bigger or smaller. i couldn't make out the exact shape of the craft but i could tell it was big. it was like looking into the dark to see a blurry figure and you can't tell the exact shape but you can tell how big or small it was. this thing was huge. i'd say it was the size of a c130. about 20 seconds after the bright white light changed to the green and red light combination it shot off to the east at a speed that was ridiculous. this was weird because it went from a stand still to shooting off at such a fast speed. there was no build up to the speed. that kind of maneuver seems ridiculous because that has to be technology i've never seen before that allows an aircraft to go from a stand still hovering position to speeds i haven't seen fighter jets match. it didn't make sense how fast this thing was and yet there was still no sound. i couldn't believe what i saw so i stood up and looked around for neighbors. i spotted one such neighbor who happened to be an air force veteran and we talked a lot because i'm an army veteran. i asked him if he saw anything weird. he told me that for several nights he saw the same thing. he too said there was no sound to this aircraft he was witnessing. he said it didn't seem like a drone because drones don't move like what he saw and he thought it was weird he never heard any sounds coming from this object. i decided to call shaw air force base. i got in contact with the command post. they said they didn't fly anything over my area. they got me in contact with mcintyre air national guard base. they said it could have been an apache helicopter with \"whistle mode\" engaged. now i'm no expert on apache helicopters but i have ridden in one before and i've seen the so called \"whistle mode\" in action. that doesn't eliminate all sound nor does it explain the speed i saw. even the person i was speaking with couldn't explain why this thing was so unbelievably fast. i'm not sure what i saw. i don't know what i saw. i just know that i'm a combat veteran who was deployed to kandahar air field (kaf) and i've seen all sorts of aircraft. i've never seen anything like this before. that speed, the way the lights were so weird, the fact i heard nothing and the fact that the outline of this thing looked a heck of a lot bigger than an apache is something i cannot explain.","distance":"21-100

the aluminum foil type - since it seemed to be reflecting the sun's light. it was that bright reflection that caught my eye. it would be dark, then a few seconds later it would be bright as a reflection. \r\n\r\ni was about to pay it no mind, when i noticed that the reflection was a rhythmic flashing. every few seconds, this object flashed a very bright light. that made me very curious, i have seen many aircraft in my time, though i don't profess to be an expert, and i had not seen an aircraft with such a bright strobe light. it was traveling a decent speed, no faster than a standard aircraft or helicopter (and indeed it could very well have been one), but again i have never seen such bright flashes of light on an aircraft, especially in the daytime. the object did not reflect the sun, the only light was from the flashing lights. \r\n\r\nit was flying normal and level until it was almost out of sight - but then it changed direction (more eastwardly or perhaps northeasterly) and quickly climbed in altitude. all the while to object flashed very brightly (which seemed odd to me since a change in direction can sometimes block a right or way light, or strobe or navigation light on an aircraft). this object had a uniformly bright flashing light. it continued to climb to what i can only imagine was a very high altitude (perhaps between 10,000 to 15,000 feet, maybe higher - it seemed to be on the level of the commercial airliners that flew through the area after the object vanished.) but i couldn't tell just how high since i really had no way of knowing how large the object was.\r\n\r\nthe object hovered stationary in the high altitude position for several minutes, flashing brightly every few seconds. it was certainly above the high cloud cover as it was becoming obscured at moments, but i could still make out the bright flashing. and then, as the clouds passed, the flashing stopped and the object seemed to be gone. minutes later, commercial aircraft were flying northeast to southwest in that same patch of sky. they were clearly creating contrails and were also not reflecting any sunlight.\r\n\r\nit could very well have been a helicopter or military aircraft, but it struck me as odd enough to warrant creating a report. the sky was clear, with light high clouds, and sunny!","distance":"501 Feet -

member witnessed this same object 20 miles away in town and was high up on a parking deck roof.  he could see what he described as some sort of appendages, or \"arms\" hanging from the craft in addition to a possible triangular shape.  it came from the same direction, north, over a very large bridge and headed east.  i kept my eye on this ball of light, as the plane approached it, the object stopped, hovered and then abruptly changed direction, moving at an unreasonable speed directly up and east until it was gone within 2 seconds.  i looked for the plane and saw it had just passed where

pass through my arm and hit the goat...He jumped and walked away... i asked and that fence was not electrified and i was standing on dry dirt. i'm constantly shocking everything i touch...People, dogs,and now goats... that was the strongest shock i've ever felt yet. there is farm land all around me and my landlord has taken pictures of crop circles ( she walks more than i) my dog doesnt bark hardly ever ( akitas tend not to) but every night he jumps with a whimper and a bark and goes straight to the window. please let me know if you think anything of this. thank you for your time.

firstly, as a bird or bug, though it did not seem natural (4h:31m:53s).  the system by which i review my video material allowed me to slow the video down enough to capture six frames of images out of thirty frames/second the camera is set at.  i measured approx. distance of event duration at ~200' linear.  according to online table, an object travelling 200' per second is moving approx. 136 m.P.H.  if the object travels this distance in 1/5th of a second it can be approximated then, to be travelling between 600-700 m.P.H. minimally.  this rules out any natural species, and most man-made devices of this size and of similar type/function.  supernatural or gov't. project.  you be the judge.  i have not fabricated or altered any of this event or material-display thereof. after realizing the
