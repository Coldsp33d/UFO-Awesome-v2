of our warm nights. i was seated facing north towards midway airport about 3 miles away. as usual the night sky had the typical airplane traffic and the sky was fairly clear but alittle windy. while i sat in the patio i wathced the night sky and followed the airplanes as they came and went. most planes here fly fairly low due to our close proximity to the airport. as i sat, i saw directly in front of me and a little to my left a very gold/orange light fly from the low north it was a solid color with no other colored or flashing lights on it. sometimes a plane can look one way until it hits a certain altitude and then the lights are turned on or seen. but this time that did not happen. this bright gold/orange light from where i was sitting was the size of a mini cooper car. i got up from my seat and as it flew practically overhead and it looked saucer shaped. i thought ive never seened that before. no other lights, windows, marking, noise could be found or heard. just a solid gold/orange object shaped like a saucer. as i tried to follow it and it was not moving that fast it just dissappeared before i could get to the front of the house. then i went inside the house and told my husband what just happned. i went back outside to roll up my water hose and decided to sit back down on the patio. again, i see something strange. i see a light coming from th north and it looked like a small type plane at first that has the strobes on it. it came to above tree top level and just stopped and hovered there. then it started to what looked like fluttering green, red, yellow, white tiny lights just fluttering/strobing all over the sky and no plane in the middle of these lights. then these lights as a group started moving to my right, then to the left, then up and then down. when this started happening all of a sudden i see the gold/orange light come up to the right of this fluttering object and as the gold/orange object was ascending the fluttering object of lights just danced around it but never moved from the location in the sky. the gold/orange light this time was the same with no other lights, windows, marking, noise. this time it was the size of a large beach ball\r\nand again it was moving slowly in the same direction overhead and very low. i couldnt beleive what i was seeing. i got up and this object slowed over me. what i saw was a round gold/orange disc with what looked like 2 silver metal attena or leg type protrusion coming out of it on its left side over me.Wow!!! i stood in awe. then while this object is still right over me a small round gold/orange orb came out of it to its right and stayed in the sky.

from church i witnessed something that i have never seen in my life. as i was driving through town traveling east i noticed something very strange in the eastern sky at exactly 8:43 pm( i know because i kept looking at the clock during this event). i witnessed 4 lights white/orange in color appear suddenly above the horizon. these lights were not close to town, in fact i would say that they were at least 10-20 miles away. wichita is the air capitol of the world and we have many aircraft that fly over town due to the airport traffic and activity out at mcconnel afb. i myself am an aviation enthusiast and have been all my life. i have watched aircraft at night come into town and have seen military aircraft at night but these lights that i saw were not aircraft landing lights. when i first saw them appear as i stated earlier there were 4 lights and the all appeared at the same time. after about 30-60 secs the light furtherst on the left of the 4 lights suddenly disappeared and another one replaced it next to the light that was furthest to the right and it did this several times giving the appearnce that the lights were moving from the north to the south.  3 minutes after the lights appeared at 8:46 pm all 4 lights disappeared. at this point i knew something wasnt right. i began to think that they might have been flares from a military aircraft since we have an afb here in town but as i have had time to think about it i have seen military aircraft launch flares at night and when they do so you see one light appear and then another and so on, they dont appear all at the same time and disappear at the same time. as i stated earlier these lights were very far away. when they appeared they almost looked like stars only they didnt \"twinkle\" like a star does. now heres the kicker for me. at 8:48pm 3 more lights appeared much further south than the first 4 lights. these lights did the exact samething as the first 4 did with the light on the left disappearing and another light appearing next to the light that was furthest on the right. then at 8:50pm the lights disappeared and i didnt see anything else on my way home. once again these light did not look or act like flares. i cant tell you if these lights came from an object because of how far away they were and i know they were far away because if you have ever seen an aircraft flying at a high altitude when u first see it from far away they look like they are just above the horizon and as they get closer they get higher and higher in the sky when really it just line of sight which would explain why the lights seemed closer to the horizon then being high in the sky. also you if you took a penny and held it up to the lights it would have blocked them out. now i cant say that these light were from a flying saucer or a triangle object or any type of ufo ever seen. i dont believe in aliens but i cant rule out what people have seen before in the sky. i have heard strange stories from people who have seen objects in the sky and cant explain them but until last night i had never seen something like that. i wasnt looking to see something like that either, i just had got out of church and was heading home after a long day. it kind of freaked me out a little hehe. i did not have a camera with me at the time so i did not get any photos of this event. if you have any questions you can contact me at the numbers and email address that i listed. thx, jordan","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

rest stop to rest and i got out of the car, around 5:00 am i looked up to see a round shaped orb in the distance around three or four miles away at around 8,000 feet. the orb was a large sphereical shape glowing orange and zipping around as if it were looking for something. i watched it for close to ten minutes until i thought it looked at me, i't started moving toward me, i got a erie feeling and i got in my car and headed home. i lost sight of the orb when i got to frightened to stay any more. so i got out of there in a hurry. i remeber looking around and adjusting my mirrors to see if it

to bark at the object.\r\nso as i looked up at the clear night sky, i saw a ball shaped object traveling due south at a slow rate of speed. the object appeared to be a bright orange in color. it seemed to be flying at about the same highth that small crop dusters would be flying. it was close enough to the ground for me to tell that it was not an airplain of any kind. the object flew in a straight line and was not desending as far as i could tell. it actually began to go higher in the sky.The ball shaped object made no sound, nor was there any sort of vapor trail or any thing coming off of the object as it flew. there were no marks visible on the object. it really did appear as a glowing sphere in the sky as it continued on a southerly course and went out of sight. this is the third time i have seen this same type of object, it was not a plane or a falling star or even ball lightning. i am convinced that this was something under pilot control. a few days later, my dog died

house i looked at the stars and was amazed at how bright they seemed and how crisp and clear the sky was. then i remembered reading something a few weeks ago about mars being the brightest object in the sky sometime soon. this had me watching the sky as i left her house just because i was amazed at how beautiful the stars looked. i made a right hand turn out of her driveway and then a left on to starrsville rd. i went up and down the first hill and was coming up to a brand new subdivision on my right when i noticed a bright glowing light...Light a giant red street lantern through the trees. i undid my seatbelt and glued my face to my windshield to try to see it. i could not clearly because of the trees. i continued up the road just a bit all the while watching for this light. then i saw it. it was above the treetops of the pines, good old ga pine trees. it looked metal, but not shiny. it had a glowing aura, like it was on fire, but no flames of course. it seemed to be orangish-reddish...At glance it would have been mistaken for an extra bright harvest moon. i fiddled for my phone as i slammed on my brakes but then realized the darn thing was moving slowly down and diagonal to my right. what i wanted to do was what you see people do in movies, get out of my car and try to walk closer to it, hehe. however, instead of stopping i realized it was moving and decided to keep moving in my car since i was driving in its direction. my fist would have covered it up had i held my arm out. i know it's really hard to judge an object's size from the ground when it is in the sky, but i'm going to say 50 feet across, which would be guessing a little large, because it was not very high in the sky. it was not even a mile away either. it was freaking close. it seemed to have two halves, kind of like how a brain is split, but a sphere and not the shape of a brain. in actuality, it almost could have been two objects right next to each other. there seemed to be other lines on it too. anyway, i rounded another curve and lost sight of the object for the trees and the curve. however, as soon as i lost sight of it sparks caught my attention to my left. my initial response to the sparks were the glowing embers left over from fireworks that fall out of the sky, but these were moving up like something had exploded or something. as i was coming up to the stop sign where i turn left and cross over rr tracks to approach the intersection of hwy 213, i noticed a red blinking light on the transformer at that intersection blinking. i don't know much about transformers except that i believe that they do have something to do with magnets.....And i don't know for what that red light was blinking, but i'm calling the power company tomorrow morning to find out. there were no power lines down, the transformer had not blown, and the people across the street from the transformer had power....Maybe it had a short overload from whatever object was in the sky that i saw. i had thought maybe a transformer had exploded but there are no power lines running where i believe my orange ball was in the sky and everyone had power that i saw. the red blinking light may be totally insignificant. however, i drive that road all of the time at night and have for almost 5 years. that is the first time i have ever seen the red blinking light on it. to make circumstances seem even more unusual: i still had my eyes glued to the sky looking for anything else or my orange ball again when i noticed an airplane moving incredibly fast in the direction of the sighting. i then looked around and noticed numerous other lower flying craft that obviously were not commercial planes heading in for a landing at hartsfield international. i made my right hand turn, still with my face plastered against the windshield, on to hwy 213 headed to ga hwy 36. i called my boss's son and asked him what a red blinking light on a power transformer meant. this call took place about 8:17. i was telling him the story and watching and telling him about the planes i was seeing. i picked one out that seemed to be headed in the same direction i was, which happens to be on the outskirts of covington. when i made my right hand turn on to ga hwy 35, the plane i had picked out to observe also seemed to make a right hand turn and then about a half mile down 36 the plane seemed to make another right as if it was circling a perimeter. it seemed as though the planes or aircraft i saw were looking for something. there were about 10 aircraft...I really did actually try to count them. however, i was also trying to drive and focus on that one. they just seemed to be fishy. it was dark and they were high enough i could not tell what type of plane they were but much lower than airliners and obviously not on any route of a commercial plane. i cannot have been the only person to see this object or possibly even notice the unusually high number of planes that seemed out of place in the sky. i never saw the orange object leave in to the night sky or shoot away somewhere and i never saw it \"disappear.\" i only had lost sight of it. .....I wonder if it landed or hovered low among a clearing in the trees or what. that is the part that really baffles me...What happened to the darn thing. just to note....I've always been interested in ufo's, ones that can be explained by earthly human creations and such and the others that still cannot be explained. not until after this sighting tonight that i did some research had i ever even heard about a bright orange fiery thing like i saw. i found some reports of what almost exactly i saw that are fairly recent...I'm talking within the past two months..In the ten minutes i looked around on the net, i found at least 5 or 6 recent ones from all over the us and canada and some older sightings from europe. my first thought when i saw the light through the trees was, \"darn, that's a really huge bright street lantern.\" and then immediately following that, was \"what the he!! is that?!?!\" hehehehe however, there's not subdivision where i saw it and then i found it it was above the treeline down the road.

just before dark my son wandered into the woods to mabey spot deer feeding in the afternoon.\r\ni decided to walk up the two rut muddy road thick woods on both sides to the main road because fishing was slow.\r\nthe guys had a fire right on the river bank and so i told them i will be back in a while.\r\nas i was walking along the road i was hearing lots of scurring in the woods on both sides i had no flashlight and thought man there are a lot of deer around because this area is known for lots of wildlife.\r\nas i made it along i was unnerved at the sounds in the forest so i found my self steady looking to mabey see what i thought was deer and mabey it was.\r\nthe woods were realy dark the road leads to a field which is mabey 200 yards or more wide just short of the main road as i came up on the hill to the edge of the field i was shocked to see 3 large orange balls moving down towards the ground and towards myself and they stoped just over the trees mabey a mile away or closer and hovered there.\r\ni knew it was not natural i am a comercial pilot and i know aircraft.\r\ni stood in shock thinking this cannot be real.\r\ni stayed mabey 10 to 15 minutes then began to feel nervious so i made my way back to the men on the river in a hurry mud and all.\r\n\r\nnames removed to preserve anonimity.\r\n\r\n\r\ni then in a panic took off looking for my son which was 17 years old at the time and as i started into the woods calling him he came towards me totaly shaken telling me dad you will never belive me but i have been hidding from aliens i am scared they are in the woods and i believed at that time he had seen something he was serious.\r\ni told him jr. i just saw three orange ufos up at the road and it scared me so i came looking for ya.\r\nwe made it back to the river and my son excited began to tell the other 3 men what he had seen and they started on the both of us.\r\nwhat i did not know was the three of them saw the same thing as my son during that time the sequence i am not sure but we all saw the same.\r\nit was a clear cold night stars were bright and about that time one of the other men holding a fishing pole hollered look up and to all our amazement the stars looked as if 6 to 8 of them from different parts of the sky moved very fast seeming to converge in a group and then all of the sudden three of the objects side by side came over our heads and landed or went out of site on the other side of the river mabey 2 to 400 yards away all three lights were round bright white blinding lights as big as mabey 100 yards in diameter all side by side all touching down or going out of site in the forest just on the other side of the river.\r\nit scared all of us so bad the three friends of mine along with my son and myself droped our fishing poles screaming lets go home.\r\nwe left fire poles and all speeding up the muddy road to the main road each and every one in a panic some of the men were fussing take me home first i need to find my wife and children.\r\nwhen we made it to the top of the hill this is where the trees on both sides end and the field starts i slamed on the brakes all of us in shock to see what looked like a (brilliant white egg shaped sphere with a tail with long spikes all around the middle and front section hovering 20 feet over the main road 200 yards from us and it looked as if it or the spiked part of it was making slow revolutions.\r\nthis i tell you this is true four grown men as old as 50 and my 17 year old son was frozen in my truck looking at this thing straight in front of us the lights were brilliant white the object then apeared to raise up started down the road in the direction that we intended to go and then it shot off just over the trees out of sight.\r\nthe 3 orange balls were no longer there.\r\nall 5 of us were terified we raced to donnies home first he ran to the door his wife came out and we all told her of the story and were all looking at the sky.\r\ngene 50 years old lived next door we ran him home and then raced to davids home.\r\nhis wife came out to meet us and all of us witnessed strange lights over the trees behind his home.\r\nmy son and i started home to see cars stoped along side of the road looking at the same lights.\r\nwe made it home and was terified trying to calm down we found ourselves sitting in what we call is the red room which is my private study off of my bedroom on the rear of the home staring out the window at the sky.\r\ni live on 6 ackers of land and we have a large dog kennel just in the woods behind my home and a chesapeak bay retriver which lives on my back steps a guard dog she lets us know if any thing from a person to a squirl is on our property.\r\nwe were home mabey 4 hours calmed down alot no tv didnt have one at that time i guess it was around 1 to 2:00 am and there was a noise that sounded sorta like a prop jet flew tree top high right over the house i ran out side and could see nothing.\r\nwithin 30 to 45 minutes all of the dogs in the kennel were roaring they are all hounds and they will tell you when there is something there that is not supposed to be.\r\nat that time my retriver was going crazy hair standing up on her back barking towards the kennel.\r\nmy son was scared but i convinced him to go with me to see what had the dogs stired up.\r\nmy son and i opened the door and the retriver took off you see she most of the time will not leave the patio unless i go out if she is stired up.\r\nthere was frost on the ground didnt even have shoes on we took off behind her and she ran just behind the kennels and all of the dogs were roaring and she was hair standing up barking at something in the bushes along with all the other dogs in the kennel and then she took of after what ever it was and so my son and i ran back down the road that leads to the kennel to my back yard at the very rear of the property trying to cut off what ever it was she was chasing.\r\nwhen i got to the blue berry hedge row which at the very rear of the property she was still the dog making her way to me in a roaring like panic.\r\nat that time i stoped not really scared but kinda numb to see this max of 4' tall creature person alein staring at me.\r\nit looked as if it had a clear glass like covering around it,it apeared to have a faint glow of red and black the face i could not see nothing but what looked like it had a red set of goggles and a black or dark covering over the lower part of its face sorta like a mask. the body appeared to sorta glow. i can probally draw it better than explain it.\r\nit then dissapeard just as my son and the dog got right up on it and my son then told me you see i am not crazy this was the same description as he told everyone.\r\ni will not go into detail but my son and i were commited to an insane assulym by our family because they realy thought we were crazy.\r\nwe were realeased within 2 days and then my father came to me and appologized when he said he had heard on the radio and the news that lots of people had been seeing strange lights and that the goverment reported that a soviet satilite had fallen that same night.\r\ni am 45 years old with 4 children church goer retired builder and commercial pilot.\r\ni have been riddiculed commited along with my son and opressed to say anything but i know what i saw and four other men will say the same

got up and went out on the porch and started watching the light. it was just one single bright light and it was hovering above what looked to be the area of unser blvd. and cabezon, or thereabouts. it stayed in one place with very little extraneous movement. this made me think that it was possibly a helicopter with a searchlight on a possible manhunt. after watching this light hover for about 4 or 5 minutes it began moving in a wsw direction. it came toward the apartment building and that's when i saw that the light didn't belong to a plane or helicopter. the object made no sound as it flew overhead at a startlingly low altitude (maybe 1000 feet). rather, i should say it made very little sound. a very quiet humming whistle sound was only audible when the object was directly overhead. i was absolutely energized when i realized this was not like any flying machine i had ever seen and i dashed indoors to grab my small binoculars.\r\nalso, i observed the object had no red wing lights or tail lights anywhere to be seen. and i'd describe its shape as a triangle or chevron because that is what it looked like when it caught a little moonlight overhead, but it was awfully dark. and i only lost sight because it flew over our building and continued out of my sight range.\r\ni saw this object three times in the next two weeks, and then never again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it was about 4am when i recieved a message from a friend who said he could see something strange going on over lake ontario, and told me to look. i live at the beach, so i walked outside, an sure enough, it was the strangest thing i've seen in my life. i was completely in bewildered and in awe. \r\n what i first saw was a very bright yellow-amber-coloured sphere floating high above the lake, but under some rather low clouds, maybe 5-10 degrees above the horizon. it really lit up the clouds above it, almost like there was a light source rotating very fast, or some sorta radioactive fire burning/flickering, like a really big and bright candle in a hurricane that just wouldn't blow out. it seemed to light up the clouds more than anything, but it gave a fair reflection off of the lake too. considering it wasn't moving, i wasn't sure what it was, and i still don't know.\r\n i watched this phenomena for over an hour, and what it / they were doing was rather unusual and hard to describe. it basically hovered for about 10 minutes, slowly drifting downwards or further away. the closer to the horizon it got, the dimmer / further away. as it approached approx. 2-3 degrees above the horizon, suddenly another one lit up to the upper-right, about maybe 5 degrees away horizontally, and vertically. as soon as this one light up, it, it seemed to eject something to it upper-right, barely visibly except for a very dim light the 'projectile' shed. within about 30 seconds after, the first one sorta fizzled a bit and went out. the second one slowly drifted downwards or further away for about 10 minutes, growing slightly dimmer (or maybe just further away), and sure enough, when it reached about 2-3 degrees above the horizon about 10 minutes later, another one (or probably the one that fizzled out) suddenly lit up, again approx 5 degrees up and to the right, and ejected something to its upper right...\r\n i watched them appear and dissappear like this for quite some time, they must have done this at least 20 times. it looked almost like they were playing leap frog. however, there were certainly some rather peculiar instances. i'm not sure where to start. \r\n besides from this pattern of appearing/reappearing, sometimes the one that last fizzled out would light up just a little bit for about 10-15 seconds. it looked like what an ember would be to a fire, barely burning, but looking hot. during one of these moments, i definately saw the fizzled one hovering, then suddenly gain a couple of degrees in altitude. when it was lit up (it only shed enougth light to be seen) it looked similiar to whatever was being ejected / what was happening when the other would initially light up, just it didn't move as far or fast as whatever was being 'ejected' (?) and didn't have a particular velocity.  this happened several times. \r\n another instance - the weirdest one by far - is when i ran inside after half an hour to get my roommate and my camera. when i ran back outside, i could see 2 of these 'orbs' lit up and just kinda hovering, but one was burning waaay brighter than i saw all night long. it actually lit up the beach a little bit. i was running to the beach to get a good pic, and just as i opened my lens, the really bright one moved very fast from 10 degrees above the horizon to about 1-0 degrees - from the sky to the ground in less than a second! it was soo bright (comparatively) then burned out almost as soon as it hit ground-level. the less bright one (still pretty bright though) just hovered, and they eventually continued their little pattern... \r\n there were a couple of times they were both completely faded out, for at least five minutes. i waited and watched, and sure enough, another one would appear. at points, i could see both burning bright and clear for about a minute or so at a time. there were also two instances where one would appear to the upper left of the other, approx. the same distance away as i'd estimate according to their little pattern.\r\n the whole time, i noticed about 60-70 degrees above in the sky, there was a very bright 'star' emitting white light, which was also flickering/wavering. it was the brightest 'star' in the sky, besides from the amber 'orbs'. it would sometimes go right out and then reappear a couple of seconds later. i could still see the stars next to it when it went out, so it wasn't being covered by clouds. in fact it shone soo bright, i could see it right through the thin ceiling-clouds we had. for some reason, i'm left with the impression it was some sort of 'mother ship' or something, i'm not sure. i am, however, pretty sure it was related to whatever was happening.\r\n the last few minutes of this sighting were rather uneventful, the last 'orb' continued the same pattern, but i didn't notice anything shoot off of it when it appeared. it eventually just fizzled out entirely. i waited approx. 10 minutes to see if another would appear, but to no avail.\r\n this was certainly one of the most profound moments of my life. i knew there was something else out there, i just never believed people would ever see such a thing. now i believe, and i actually have a couple of pictures and movie clips to prove what i saw.\r\n yeah, i'm a little nuts, but i can prove what i saw, and i also have two eye-witnesses who saw the same thing i did.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8099,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.248783,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10102007-0001","longitude":-79.879685,"occurred":1191999600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1191999600000,"summary":"2-3

highway that runs a short distance before entering downtown and intersecting with rt22.\r\n\r\nbeing young and in love we had stopped on this rarely used road to do a little necking when we both noticed an exceptionally bright light about ssw from where we were.\r\n\r\nat first we thought it was a jet from ohare airport that was about 20 miles away but as it came closer we noticed it made no sound whatsoever. i was intrigued and stepped out of the car for a better look.\r\n\r\nwhat interested me was that i could not tell exactly how close or the altitude since i had no point of reference and the exact size of the light not known.  looking into the dark sky it would have been about the size of a quarter if it were held up in front of you.  the shape was hard to define but i would say it was more round than long, but not a ball or saucer that could be defined.\r\n\r\nas it seemed to come closer it also seemed to drop toward me, growing larger.  at that time my fiance was literally yelling at me to get back in the car since she was petrified.  i had recently left the us marine corps and did not see any logic or added safety inside the car, so i stood there and stared at it as it came closer.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden i felt illiminated, sort of tingly, and felt that this thing was taking a close look at me.  there is no other way to describe the sensation.  my fiance said i was lit up with a kind of glow around me, but there was no discernable light projected on me.\r\n\r\ni was not afraid in any way but my fiance was screaming by then to get back into the car and go. \r\n\r\nabout that time we heard the sound of jets coming closer and i immediately recognized the sound as phantom's since i was an ao in viet nam with the marines and had considerable experience with the phantom sound.\r\n\r\nthe object seemed to pull back up and i no longer felt tingly.  it then moved west for 5 to 6 miles, again with no noise, and the jets from the glenview naval airstation passed overhead and went right after this thing.  i would say that they were about 1500 agl and moving without burners, but moving fast.\r\n\r\nwe watched the object from the rise we were on for a few more minutes as it steadily moved south in what looked like a wide, slow circle. i could see the lights of barrington illinois and it looked like it was over them as the jets closed in.\r\n\r\nthen it just dissappeared like someone turning off a light.  the jets formed up and headed back towards glenview naval airstation.\r\n\r\nwe sat there and talked about what we had just whitnessed, me taking abuse since i did not listed and leave.  after about 15 minutes i saw another light in the sky, similar looking but not the same, coming towards us from the west.  as it closed we could hear the jet engine sounds and i identified it as a boeing 737 as it flew overhead.\r\n\r\ni never felt afraid since it only illuminated me and i was facinated.  we discussed what might of happened if the jets had not come.  personally i think the outcome would have been the same except we would have been able to view it longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

oldest son who \r\nis 12yrs old, and my neice were sitting outside on the front porch enjoying\r\nthe fresh air..My front porch faces east, the sky was clear, no clouds, lots of stars, i noticed a greenish star like object going from southeast to northeast,i didn't notice any beacon light like most aircraft have,the first thing i thought was that it probably was a satalite, i pointed out the object to my son, we both saw it fade out to the north..About 10 minutes later i looked up and saw a brighter star like object, white in\r\ncolor, this time going from west to east over our house, again i pointed \r\nthis out to my son, and also my wife and neice,the object crossed in the\r\nthe path of a star, the weird part about that was that when it went by the stationary star, the star lit up, like a car headlight, a really bright\r\nwhite light, i said to my family \"look, there is two of them now\", we all\r\nagreed..The bright object continued it's west to east course in a straight\r\nline, the star that lit up as it passed stayed stationary, and it gradually faded out to just the original looking star, eventually the object going west to east faded out as it headed farther east thru the night sky, at this point i had my son go in the house to see what time it\r\nwas, it was 8:30pm..About 5 minutes later, again going from west to east\r\nwas the greenish star like object it to finally faded out as it headed farther east, to me it felt really odd to see all this happen, do satalites in earths orbit transverse the sky like these object did within\r\nthat time frame? me and my family finally went in to the house, but me being still confused at what i saw, went back out about 15 minutes later\r\nand saw 3 high flying aircraft jets, the kind that are up about 30 to\r\n35,000 feet, and leave contrails..All three were heading east to west and\r\nwere side x side faned out across the sky, the first thing that came to mind was that they were surveying
