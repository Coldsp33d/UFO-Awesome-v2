this will be quite an elaborate description, but i don't want to leave out anything that might raise doubts or eyebrows. this experience is imprinted into my memory, much as it would happen during any other historically-important moments in time - as a consequence there's a lot to tell.\r\n\r\njust after half past nine in the evening of october 6th, i was walking my dogs as usual. the sky had been exceptionally clear compared to previous weeks, allowing me to spot a satellite passing overhead at relatively great speeds with the naked eye just prior to the actual incident.\r\n\r\nabout two minutes later, with me walking across a narrow, non-illuminated trail leading up to some exercise fields as well as dense forests + additional trails, i stood in awe when witnessing a bunch of tiny, bright objects gently moving along the tree line right in front of me (well, a bit to the left, that is). from my recollection, these little circles were red in color, although i cant tell from the pictures ive taken (in which they turn up blue/whiteish). a slight pulsating of light seemed to be occurring, although not as distinct and wide apart as youd expect from, say, civilian aircraft.\r\n\r\nthe most amazing thing was the fact that the individual objects seemed to be part of some sort of formation - they were moving as a whole, although every now and then, one of the objects would speed up and 'fall out of line' (towards either direction), so to speak.\r\n\r\nall in all, i was able to count at least 4 objects within said formation - its likely that there were 7 or more. i have to add to this that the tree line (used as a point of reference) was no more than a 100 yards from my person, with the actual objects seemingly much further away (at least a few miles, i reckon) - so perhaps ive missed out on a few additional ones. either way, having seen the formerly-mentioned satellite pass by just yet and being all-too familiar with the brute power of overflying f16s and a10s (my house is pretty much located underneath a military flight path), i was pretty clueless as to what was happening before my own eyes.\r\n\r\nseeing as how i live in a forested area with lots of natural beauty present there, i never leave the house without my digicam - the evening of october 6th was no exception to the rule. however, with darkness gradually kicking in earlier every day (compared to reasonably-clear summer evenings), and my photo-taking skills limited to simple broad-daylight/macro shots kind of stuff, i had no idea what to do with my camera other than to switch between various modes and just 'snap away'. at first i felt very nervous about missing out on the experience altogether, seeing as how long it took to switch between the various camera modes with nothing other than the on screen display to assist me. however, much to my surprise, the event would go on to last another 3 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nwhilst shooting pictures (15 or so in total, half of which ive deleted instantly), i tried to somehow get a decent light source near the vicinity of the objects - again, i had virtually no point of reference other than the tree line and lamp posts. my digicams built-in lcd wasnt helping at all, leaving me to act on gut feeling rather than anything else (not a good thing, that is). pointing at the thingies in the sky with a flashlight didnt turn out to be genuinely useful either. in order to improve the situation a bit, i proceeded to walk closer so as to look past the actual tree line (then partially blocking my view).\r\n\r\nin the process of doing so, i felt a bit distracted by a small gathering of partygoers to the right of me (another 200 yards away from me), forcing me to focus attention on my dogs and getting them their leashes on. after noticing said people, it just struck me how quiet everything had been beforehand. just the motorway's humming of passing vehicles, 400 yards or so in the distance - no roaring of jet engines as can be experienced when the f16s and a10s are up to their business as usual (every two weeks or so, can be heard from miles away, especially in such clear conditions).\r\n\r\nbesides the tranquillity, another fact that conflicts with the 'military craft' (or civilian airliners for that matter) option is the fact that these objects seemed to be hovering 10 miles or so away, which would put them very near (if not across) the belgian-dutch border - not a typical place for 4 or more belgian (or dutch for that matter) fighter jets to pull off all kinds of weird stunts. plus, military jets tend to not randomly disappear en masse either, unless i've missed out on lockheed���s latest production cycle.\r\n\r\nin all fairness, the actual airbase is located pretty close to said border, but its fighters never venture northbound (towards the border) - rather, they will usually end up going south (inland) and then east (towards my place) before returning to base.\r\n\r\nit wasnt until having walked up to the well-lit cross section of this areas various trails, that i lost track of the formation of objects entirely. i've tried to look out for it in the following 10 minutes or so, but to no avail. all the while i was still very much in a state of curiousity-meets-nervosity, trying to make sense of what had just happened. i was assuring myself that others (within a radius of at least a few miles) surely must have witnessed the same phenomenon, as it occurred on a saturday night, during (or just prior to) 'going out' time. all the way back, i couldn't help but looking over my shoulder, yet nothing popped up anymore other than noisy civilian aircraft.\r\n\r\nafter returning home, it turned out that most of the pictures contained nothing more than utter darkness and a few faint lights (from the lamp posts bordering the forest zone). luckily enough, after a few iterations of enhancing two particular pictures i was able to at least extract some evidence of the formation having been there in the first place. naturally, i've kept the original pictures to provide as evidence should anyone really care. the \"evidence\" i'm providing through these pictures is a little rough around the edges, to say the least - i personally have always hated vague material like this, but given the circumstances i'm hoping for you to bear with me.\r\n\r\nin between, i managed to shoot two movies as well - unfortunately, these show the typical 'jerky movement' kind of pictures of a few lights doing nothing in particular. again, i've enhanced this material a bit yet the results are quite appalling still. if anyone's interested i could still provide the enhanced and/or the original video footage, though.\r\n\r\nto conclude all of this, i will add that i've always taken a liking to looking at the skies above, yet remain extremely skeptic of anything related to extraterrestials and whatnot. i've seen my fair share of weird stuff up there, yet was mostly able to track down the meaning of it all afterwards. in this particular case, however, i stand empty-handed and have to ask for possible additional witnesses to come forward.\r\n\r\nmaybe these are thai floating lampoons (quite a fad as of late)? perhaps, but they're illegal here due to forest fire hazards - plus it wouldn't account for the rather sudden position changes at times. feel free to fill me in if you can.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8094,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.0983909,"location":null,"logNumber":"BE-10082007-0005","longitude":5.7837625,"occurred":1191728400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Flemish

approximately 10:00 pm and 12:00 midnight on or about june 22, 2007. the vantage point from my patio is approximately 100 degrees over the high desert from an altitude of 5,100 ft above sea level. my view is from approximately 10 to 15 degrees from west of north to directly south (north west to south). at approximately 11:00 pm, david, who was seated at the patio table facing north) commented on a dark object with a series horizontal of lights that were parallel to the ground. the object was about 10 degrees west of north and appeared just over the roofline of my neightbor's home next door (toward the north. the lights appeared to be evenly spaced and parallel to the roofline. after approximately 10 seconds, the lights disappeared. about 3 to 5 minutes later, i saw the same lights, only directly north and just east of my neighbor's house where there was no obstructed view of the object desert floor below. when i initially saw the object, the lights (pure white, almost bright) were stationery and did not move. after about 15 seconds of viewing, the lights either went off one-by-one in a syncronized fashion (from left to right) or they began to slowly rotate in a counter-clockwise direction at a slow speed. i say this beacuse i could never clearly see the shape or perimeter of the object. the moon was in a new phse and there was little ambient light in the vicinity. the lights appeared to either go off, then on or rotate in a counter-clockwise direction for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. the it appeared as though the direction of the lights' rotation (or sequence of being activated/deactived) reversed to a clockwise direction. this continued for about another minute to one & one half minutes and the lights totally extinguished, never to be seen again. although i failed to count the lights, i am estimating there were 15 to 20 in all. while i witnessed, along with my wife and david. the object moved very slowly toward the east over el mirage dry lake bed. not able to see the object's perimeter or shape with any certaintly, it was almost impossible to guage its distance away from me, as well as its lateral movement. for the sake of an estimate, i'm guessing that the lights were about 800 to 1000 feet off of the desert floor and its overall easterly movement approximately 3 to 5 miles. for clarification, the lights appeared to be components of a single craft due to the fact that they were evenly dispersed laterally and the same altitude from ground level, moving the then same direction & speed at all times. when looking around the lights (attempting to determine the object's perimeter/shape/size), there was no visable detail from the hills or terrain behind the object nor any stars behind/above it were visable at all, it was pure black. i have never witnessed anything like this before, nor had my friend david or my wife. we are 100% certain that we did witness a ufo. the question is whether it was controlled by extra-terestrials or the local government (right next door to edwards afb). purley amazing.\r\n\r\nps: my camera batteries were dead or i would have grabbed it and taken photos!","distance":"Over One

myself to spending 2 weeks \"watching the skies\" from my bedroom window! it was a time where i was paying much greater attention to the sky and is really the only reason i noticed what i did.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and blue. what i saw first appeared to be a commercial airliner- just as high in altitude, a similar chem-trail, appearing speed, linear movement...Nothing out of the ordinary. what drew my attention to it in the first place was the reflection of the sun's light from it's metallic surface. on closer inspection however, the profile of the solid metallic object was not as distinguishable as you would expect it to be if it were a commercial airliner. i also noticed that the white \"chem-trail\" was not lingering for very long either. something just wasn't quite right and it held my attention.\r\n\r\ni must have watched it cross the sky in an earthly fashion for around 5-10 seconds...(from left to right) however this \"commercial-airliner\" suddenly stopped dead in mid-air. the object then moved much faster than before back in the direction it had came without \"turning\" or rotating(right to left)  \r\n\r\nthis seemingly irrational change in linear direction was immediately marked by the emission of a very thick, black smoke-trail which came from the \"front\" or \"other\" end of the craft. watching from a window it quickly disappeared from my available view.\r\n \r\ndespite having been desperate to see a ufo with my own eyes at the time, it was ironic that what i saw terrified me so much that i ended up in tears!  as irrational as it seems now, especially given the altitude of the object, one of the thoughts or feelings i had at the time was \"if i can see it what's stopping it from seeing me?.\"

slight breeze out of the west as usual, with clear blue skies about 9 am early sept, nice cool morning.  i was looking up at the sky with my newborn son, pointing stuff out to him, (ex. that is a lady bug, that is a leaf, that is a stick, that is a plane, that is a bird, that ... is a ufo.) thats when i saw something bright orange, and about half as high as the jets that fly over are.  it was huge, cut a city block in half and that is close to the size of it.  it was double cresent shaped, one crescent being larger and more cup shaped, the smaller end had multiple protrusions and jagged looking, alot like a \"ferengi ship\" in its general shape, though it was spinning horizontally about a central axis. i thought right off the bat, that it was something special and rare.  i grabbed up my baby and quick ran and got my video camera. when we got back out side it wasn't where it should have been for its speed, i thought i had lost it, then i spotted it.  it had moved well to the northwest, and climbed very very high.  i got it in the camera and zoomed in as best i could, and trying to hold it still to keep it in focus.  as i was viewing it later on a bigger screen, there is a small orb that zips past the craft in the opposite direction.  the large craft going to the northwest, and the orb going east-northeast.  i lost sight of the craft when i couldn't keep the zoom out as far as i had it, and keep my hands from shaking it out of the frame.  about an hour later i also zoomed in on a commercial jet to get a size comparison.

(for the record this person adamantly does not believe in ufo's.)  once we arrived at the loction a few minutes after the incident, we got out of our cars and shared our thoughts on what we saw.  he said, like i did, that this was definitly not a plane, blimp, balloon, banner, glider, or helicopter.  this was something neither of us have ever seen before.  he looked at it for a while like i did, but he looked away when the object was in the process of \"flickering\" and when he looked back the object was completely gone from the sky.  like myself, he spent the next 10-20 seconds before the light turned green scouring the sky to find any evidence of this object's presence.  he too was unable to see the object again and was unable to explain the incident.\r\n\r\nif anyone else saw this same incident please email me about your experience (mfboomertime@yahoo.Com), i would love to hear either a logical explanation of this event or someone else who could corroborate my experience.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":8067,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3805299,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10052007-0006","longitude":-71.1015128,"occurred":1191567600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,  Square,  Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1191567600000,"summary":"Rectangular object hovering in air then became transparent and disappeared","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:440025"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Brookings","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in harbor at a friends house. it wasd around 2am the sky was clear and the stars looked distant. i looked directly above twards the sky and noticed what i first thought was a bird. i noticed that what i thought were its wings were still in place. i had my friend look and we both agreed that it was too high to be a bird unless it was a big big bird. as dark as it was and as high as it was we could see it some what clearly. i then came to the conclusion that it must be a plane beacuse what we thought were wings were stuck in place. what we thought was flapping wings turned out to be 3 to 4 airplane like wings extending outwards  about 2 thirds the size of the object. we b oth decided it could not have been a plane beacuse it didnt have the little red light and it seemed to be tumbling in a 360 degree circular motion. like ball hoovering in place that spun randomly in all angles. it was not bright but it was sort of florecent white but very dim. mabey so that it could not be seen. my friend and i both were curious and stumped. it was not a satelite, gravity gave that one up. it was not a bird or a plane. we have a small airport and i see planes verry often and this was noticably larger and traveled much faster for how high it was. we watched as it crossed the sky. at the altitude it was it traveled in both our opinions at a steady fast rate. i first saw it south of us heading north. after flying over the top of us continuing north it seemed to increase in altitude, slowing down but not much as it fadded. we would have maintined a good visual if it maintained altitude as it headded north but beacuse it increased in altitude it faded much sooner than it would have. my friend mentioned this website emediatly after loosing site. we both agreed on what we saw but couldnt come to any reasonable conclusion. my friend as well as i will tell u that what we saw was not a plane, bird, baloon, or satelite. i can say that i have not seen anything resembling it from ufo pics on tv or any popular pics. what we saw was truely unexplainable and i cant compare it to anything ive ever seen.
