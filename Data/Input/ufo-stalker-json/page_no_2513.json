(imagine a paper plate with something very light on it say, a blob of ketchup) i looked around imagining that it might fall onto a car or a pedestrian. i pulled out my camera to see if i could zoom it to get a better look at the thing and where i thought it would land. my card was full so i couldn't figure out how to use that feature quickly.   i turned back around from throwing the camera on the front seat of the car, looked to see how close it was to the ground and it had begun \"falling\" up.  it was moving in the same manner but upwards,slightly faster than it had been \"falling\" and moving away from my position. as it rose higher and almost out of my sight, ( 20 seconds ish )the sun glinted off of it and i realized that it must've had some part of it that was shiny metal although it did not appear to have  been shiny up until that point. \r\ni did not feel particularly scared, upset or what have you. i was just pretty curious. i can't get the image out of my mind though because it was just plain wierd.\r\n i can't imagine this was under intelligent control because of it's flappy type of movement but it wasn't windy enough for an object of any weight to be held aloft and propelled upward in that way. \r\nthe whole thing took about one to one and a half minutes and the total movement of the object might be described as a straight downward fall then up and away at an apx. 70 degree angle. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

except it moved closer, then overhead, and finally past me.  then i started noticing other blue and red lights that appear as glowing orbs on a 12x optical digital camera. i started filming and snapping pictures then comparing them to the other ones and noticed that there were hundreds of ufos that are imitating stars and the constellations behind them.  i've seen several low flying silent objects that pulse bright lights.  on still shots i can make out several color changing bulbs along a boomerang shaped object.  \r\n\r\ni've read that people have seen them sucking up large amounts of water over bodies of water which would make this next part make sense.  i've seen what appears to be the front fly downward while the outer edges stay still so in essence it appears to spin on it's own axis making it blur and my guess is it's rotating at high speeds to separate substances of different densities by centrifugal force.  thus seperating the two atoms of hydrogen from oxygen and creating hydrogen fuel cells for their power, so in essence we're the bp of our solar system.  \r\n\r\nthese sightings have occurred from october 1st 2007-present.  i have several videos but the most convincing ones couldn't be caught on tape due to their habit of traveling fast as light, kind of makes it hard to prove a skeptic wrong when all you have is a blurred image.  best proof is to watch the night sky for abnormalities such as constellations n stars flashing blue and red with some of them breaking formation then flying back to where it should be.  they all appear brighter to me than surrounding stars and move counter-clockwise repeating the night sky.  the thing that makes them stand out the most is the ones on the horizens appear lower than the rest and i've seen the most activity when most people are asleep from 3:30-6:00am. all of the brighter \"stars\" seem to move in unison so that's one hell of a tactic to invade a planet.  it appears they send a few low flying scout ships to record how our night sky might appear to us and then the rest cover the stars up glowing bright to cover up the star behind them.  then they just hover and observe.\r\n\r\nmy friends thought i was going crazy until they saw some of the things i saw and now they're convincing their friends.  i took footage to my local news station and they blew me off of course saying it was venus but venus doesn't move like the things i saw.  the red and blue lights that have a bright flashing strobe lights are our planes flying around the ufos i've seen disappear and made no sound.  \r\n\r\ni was out filming friday oct. 5th and saw several low flying ufo's while at my friends house.  we went back inside after our cigarette break to finish watching our movie when the pandora air siren went off.  that sound freaked me out because i though we were under attack or something but it was a fire alarm down the road according to her dad's police scanner.  i drove out to the country down the street to check it out and saw the barn fire.  i deleted some footage of the other encounters to snap a short video of the fire but the crazy part is i saw a flying triangle on the backside of the fire but not a bright glowing orb surrounding it.  i'm not sure if the three objects around the tree on the left are debris flying from the fire or the under side of the craft i saw in the area afterwards. i didn't see it do anything to the barn itself and there's also 2 brighter objects that could either be debris or another craft above the fire. i just kick myself for not getting the 2gb memory stick while i saw at the store earlier.  i only had the 32mb internal one so i kept having to edit the size down to cut out the getting focused in on it. when you only have 41 sec of footage total you try to make it last.  \r\n\r\ni was a nonbeliever before last week, i always just hoped there would be intelligent life out there that would come to make contact someday. \r\n\r\nwillis s.,

9:30 p.M. from the auto dealership. i was a car salesman at the time. i started driving towards the city of toronto, canada, on the qew (queen elizabeth way) eastbound to meet some friends at a bar on the esplanad (a street lined with nightclubs). i didn't have anything to drink and didn't smoke any pot on that day/evening. \r\n\r\nas i was driving, i noticed a string of lights slowly rotating counter clockwise over the city of toronto, at about the ten o'clock position from my point of view. this caught my eye because these formation of lights were very unusual. the lights were evidently in a circular pattern with about two thirds visible as the other third rotated out of view. imagine a pie plate with about 25 lights around the circumference of it. as this \"pie plate\" would revolve, a third of these lights would be hidden from view as if they were obstructed by a solid body. it was at night so all i could see was these rotating string of lights but they were definitely on a \"fixed\" platform as the lights were revolving in unison. \r\n\r\nalthough i've heard of ufo's and was curious, at that time in my life, i didn't really give that much thought about them. i've always been interested in nature and especially about the universe. i've seen all kinds of aircraft and advertising blimps at night before. i drove taxi's off and on for fifteen years on the night shift and have seen countless meteors, lightening, satellites etc. on two occasions i've even seen extremely bright, slow falling, green fireball meteors lighting up the ground, for a couple of seconds, as if it was daylight . i've read, in later years, were other witnesses reported green fireballs as ufo's. i chuckled to myself thinking how easily \"ufo believers\" can be fooled by natural phenomenon. \r\n\r\nanyway, these circle of lights were slowly descending and approaching towards me (westbound), while i was driving about 115 kilometres per hour on the highway eastbound. these lights were getting closer and closer as \"we\" approached each other. i recall thinking to myself that this must be some kind of advertising balloon and those lights were letters. as i kept driving, i was paying more and more attention to this object because the closer it was getting, the more unusual it looked. i kept glancing at it, while driving, waiting until it was close enough to read what these letters were saying, still thinking it was some kind of advertising blimp. the closer it got, the more i looked at it. now at my nine o'clock position, the string of rotating lights started to bank left like an airplane would \"turning right\" at this point, i realised that these lights were not letters at all. they were different shaped, yellowish white lights. the reason these lights were different in shape was because they were \"ingrained\" into some body. when the lights were seen head on, they were circular. but as they rotated out of \"direct\" view, they changed shape like the different crescents of the moon. that's why they appeared to be all different shapes. \r\n\r\nanyway, during the time when this object started to bank left, from my point of view, i was struggling with myself trying to understand whether this was a plane or a balloon. it was flying too slow for a plane, yet, too fast for a blimp. also, it didn't appear to be flying or floating. the best way i can describe it's motion is that it looked like it was \"sailing\" in the sky. \r\n\r\nwhat's interesting here is that the human brain tries to associate what the eyes are seeing, to something already seen or experienced before. that's why i was at war with myself trying to decide whether this object was a plane, blimp or a balloon. every time i resigned myself to what i must be witnessing, i jumped to another conclusion. this jumping from one conclusion to another occurred during the whole experience. i was imagining all kinds of things. for example, if it was a plane, the only way these lights could have been positioned was in a circle because this plane must have had some kind of supporting structure in a circle from wing tip to wing tip. this didn't make any sense at all. i've seen advertising planes before. this was nothing like this. not even close. than i was trying to imagine a \"goodyear blimp\" with these letters going across it's side. this was nothing like it either. so here i was, trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. as i was driving, i started to slow down because i kept looking at this circle of lights more than the road ahead of me. in retrospect, i don't even know how i kept my car on the road because i was so awed by this display in the sky. \r\n\r\nhere is the killer. \r\n\r\nas the object kept banking and banking more and more, it eventually ended up totally perpendicular to the ground! the first thing that came to mind was a big ferris wheel rotating in the sky. at this point i slowed down to about 50 kph (30 miles an hour in a 60 mph highway for my american friends) and put my four way, flashing hazard lights on my car fearing that another car would smash into the back of me for going so slow on a 100 kph highway. \r\n\r\nhere is the shocker. \r\n\r\nas i was mesmerised by this ufo, a surge of adrenaline hit me like a ton of bricks. i didn't realize how big this thing was. at first i thought it was the size of an airplane fairly close. it was gigantic! at least twice the size of a football field, bigger than an aircraft carrier!!! i don't know what gave away it's size. maybe the reflections of light on the ground. the best way i can relate this sudden realization is like one of those illusions most of us have seen. you know, when you look at a pixel drawing with an image you can't see until you stare at it for a while? after a period of time, you make out the face of a women or something like that? that's kind of the transformation i experienced. at first i thought the object was the size of a large plane than suddenly i really saw it. it was huge!!! i yelled out loud to my self, \"holey f**k, it's huge!!!\". i don't f***ing believe it, it's f***ing huge!!!. i thought it was fairly close at first, than bang!, it was much farther away and larger than my brain first comprehended it. speaking about this surge of adrenaline. have you ever had a really close call having a car accident? when your heart rate skyrockets to about 180 beats per minute? that's what i felt when i realised how gargantuan this object was! i could literally feel my heart pounding like crazy. to be frank, it literally scared the hell out of me, when i realized how big it was. at this point, i rolled down my window and pointed to this giant \"ferris wheel\" in the sky to the other motorists, but it appeared no one seemed to notice as they screamed by me at regular highway speeds. i remember how cold it was when i rolled down my window. it was something like minus 30 celsius below zero. \r\n\r\nafter, i don't know how long, probably only a few seconds of rotating in this perpendicular position, this thing started to climb and right itself and \"sail\" back to the direction it originally came from. i rolled up my window, turned off my hazard lights, and started to speed up to chase it. still it seemed other motorists didn't notice this object. it still irks me to this day. as i was approaching the city limits, this object was in it's flat position again climbing over the city. then, all of a sudden, the rotating lights turned off except for a red \"aircraft like\" blinking light (which i never noticed before). after a few seconds, the rotating lights turned on again. it was like in the movie \"close encounters of the third kind\". the lights just blasted on. than after a few seconds they turned off again as it seemed to be right over the city. strange behaviour. now i was exiting off of the highway on to spadina rd. i lost track of these lights because of the tall buildings. when i was on the street where i was going, i saw a cop parked on the other side of the road writing a parking ticked. i stopped in the middle of the road and ran over to him. he was quite taken aback by my seemingly aggressive approach. i asked him, \"how long have you been here?\" i forgot what he said, but i asked, \"did you see that big circle of lights flying in the sky? he said \"no\". after parking my car, i met my friends at the bar, \"baily's\", and told them what happened but they didn't take me seriously as they've already had a few and were more interested in the ladies. \r\n\r\nafter \"sitting at the bar by myself\" for a couple of hours i went home. i was living at my parent's house at the time, temporarily, so when i got home around 1 a.M., i called the police. i didn't know who else to phone at the time. they didn't take me seriously of course so after that, i phoned the toronto international airport and managed to get through to air traffic control and asked them if they had anyone call in with a ufo report. nothing. so i called the police again and convinced them to take me seriously as i wanted to make a report. they told me they can send a couple of officers to my house. as it was late and my parents were asleep, i told them i'd rather come to the station the next day to report. next morning, when i contemplated going in i decided not to, fearing they would think i'm some kind of wacko. \r\n\r\nas the days went by, scanning the newspapers looking for a \"ufo sighting\" to no avail, i started doubting myself. i was trying to convince myself that perhaps i was somehow mistaken. maybe it was something not out of the ordinary at all. maybe it was a balloon or airplane of some kind. maybe like thousands of others, i witnessed something that i misinterpreted for something else. \r\n\r\nand now the conclusion. \r\n\r\nabout a week or so later, on or about the tenth page of the toronto star, bottom right hand corner, there it was! a short article. \"dozens of mississauga residents reported a ufo as big as a football field!!!\" i don't recall the whole article. i'll never doubt myself again no matter how much ridicule i'll be subjected to. after about 27 years, i just had to let this out. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with

near the objects and one of them shot off to the north at incredible speed. being an ex-airforce weatherman i knew these were not rawindsone devices but indeed controlled aircraft.\r\nafter a few minutes of observing from the concert stage i pointed out the objects to other musicians and the sheriff's deputies acting as security.\r\nwe then saw 4 more spheres moving slowly and randomly to the southwest of our location when a very large object i can only describe as comb-shaped came in and out of view for only about 10 seconds. at this point most of hte objects faded from view except for two which actually came close enough to make out as silver spheres and they stayed in one place for the next 20-30 minutes until it was dark and we could no longer make out if they were present. one odd thing or rather another odd thing about this incident is that several days before on sept 6th 1998 we actually saw a glowing object crash near roseburg oregon and though i tried to report it to police they ignored me and to this day i truly don't think anyone ever investigated the crash site. it was probably a meteor but i don't know.\r\ni am currently as far as i know the only witness who

astronomer and i was in my yard setting up my telescope for an evening of ccd imaging. as my telescope was going through the alignment procedures, i began to look to the sky and watch for satellites passing by.  the early evening is usually a good time for that. \r\n\r\no���hare airport is directly to the southwest of my position about 2-3 miles. i noticed an aircraft climbing out and heading directly from the airport flying toward the northeast. living close to the city, city lights reflect off the ���belly��� of aircraft and give them an interesting glow.  i was just watching the plane fly by and i followed it as it passed and headed off to the northeast. at that time i saw something coming from the exact direction that initially i thought was another plane coming from the northeast, but at a much lower altitude and heading directly toward the airport to the southwest. i immediately thought this was odd and i began trying to identify it for several reasons. 1. absolutely no lights 2. no aircraft flying to the airport would arrive inbound directly under the same path of the aircraft i just saw departing. 3. ���if��� it was an inbound plane, it was not on a ���normal��� final approach course to the airport. 4. it was completely silent. 5. the size and shape was odd.\r\n\r\nas the object came over the top of me, i noticed the reflection of the ground lights off the bottom of it.  it appeared to be of a metallic structure.  i kept trying to identify it.  it appeared to have a winged or boomerang shape to it. i���d guess the altitude to be 300������500��� above ground level.  it was moving on a straight and steady course at an estimated speed of 150 mph ��� 200 mph.  it moved by fairly quickly, so i didn���t have a lot of time to study it.  i���d also estimate the size to be about the size of a 737 or possibly smaller commuter regional jet type. i questioned myself that it might be a bird and i may have misjudged the size, altitude, and speed. but if it was a bird, it was well above my 75��� tree and would have been the largest bird i���ve ever seen even if i misjudged it.  even the largest bird i���ve seen in my area, a turkey vulture with a 6��� wing span, wouldn���t even be close to the size even if i misjudged the altitude. also, it had a metallic reflective nature to it. i also thought��� well��� may be it was some type of balloon or a group of balloons tied together.  nope, the winds that night were from the southwest and it would be been flying directly in headwind. again, the silence of it was very strange for the size and speed of movement. it just continued in the same direction to the airport with no change in speed or direction and i lost sight as it went behind the tree line. i was curious if anyone else had seen anything strange that night.  i did notice that about 4-5 minutes after it past, some aircraft were flying in a ���non-standard��� pattern as though they had a missed approach.  i was curious if the airport had any ���strange��� disruptions that evening around 7:50pm???\r\n\r\ni was a commercial pilot for a long time, an avid amateur astronomer, my bs degree is in aerospace science, but this was one of the strangest things i���ve seen.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

which was about 9:30pm. at 12 midnight, i heard something so i sat up in bed and looked at the bedroom door, which was open, you could see our hallway and back door from our bedview, at the start of the bedroom door and to about half way down the hallway there was a bluish white light, the ligt was lighting up the hall way area, and in the light you could see a lot of particals floating around like as if someone threw white powder in the light beam! i looked at the clock it was 12 midnight exactly, i looked at our baby in the crib she was facing me, looked back at the hallway i saw a small fat brown blobby thing, with some what of a childs face! but just blobby, it looked really weird, then a head of something grey popped threw the hallwall wall, then it slowly stepped into the hallway from out side and they just stood there looking at me, lol, i stood up and just stood there just to see a taller bluish-gray looking thing step threw our wall into the hallway, this thing was huge and thin!, and it was acting dainty like, it put its hand out towards me and for some reason i walked to it!, i wasnt scared at all! and i turned around and the two smaller ones were infront of me, the gray little one looked at me and when i looked in my room and the baby was still facing where i would be sleeping and my husband was still sleeping in the babies same direction as well and my side of the bed was empty!, i looked at the clock, it was not 12:01am exactly, i was still holding the large beings hand \"finger tip/thumb holding\", we stepped threw the wall and into their craft,the interior was pearlized white/cream like in color, when i touched the wall, there was like a slight glow around my hand and fingers, the seats were molded into the wall, there was some translucence to the walls of the craft, where ever we went to, you can see the night turn into day, it went from dark to light really fast durring that travel, in the middle of the craft i saw this weird bulb light thing, i walked to it \"it was humming and yo could feel vibrating air like around it\" i went to put my right hand on it and the short fat brown being grabbed my wrist, his hand/thing felt like sand paper! the little gray in between the two put his hand up to where the brown one saw his hand and let go of my hand, then the huge bluish gray thing pointed to the wall, so i looked at the wall and the craft was either stopped or it slowed down to a still, it was lit out side, then the tallest one looked down, so i looked down and the craft slowly dipped the bottom of the craft into water, we were in water! then it plunged downward and i looked up as they did and i saw a beautiful coral reef, you could see some fish swimming all around, some plants, i remember a huge yellow fish with a blue striped next to the wall of the craft, then i looked at the things you have the brown on on my left the gray in the middle and the bluish-gray on my right, the little gray said \"we do exist\" ((mentally)) his mouth did not move! then they looked out into the water, the craft pulled up slowly out of the water, the walls became slightly non-trandlucent again, the craft took off then it went from light to dark! before i knew it the tall being came to my side to lead me back to my place ((my hallway, we stood back in my hall way)) i looked up at this being and for some reason it made me feel like as though it was a female, she must of been between 6-7 feet huge wrap around pit shaped jel like eyes, she had fat hairs lining the bottom of her eyes, and on the tight areas of the facial skin there were bumps or pits, maybe like poors or blemishes! i dont know, no expressions! but it seems very calm, and dainty like, i believe the other two were male, they just acted differently from the tallest one, anyway looking at her, i wasnt scared but i looked into my room and the clock now said 12:15am exactly!, my husband and baby were sleeping in the opposite direction and my side of the bed was still empty! i crawled back into bed, looked at her as she went threw the wall and gone from my life! from that day one, i have had a new prospective about life else where and where they may be hiding out! and i also hear destorted windpipe chime noises \"very rarely\" but i dont know what it is!  i can draw this as well if you would like. just let me know.","distance":"20 Feet or

dog.  we have a very nice view of the night sky to the north when it's clear which it was tonight.  i regularly see meteors and satilites, it was these and the stars in general that i was looking at and/or for.  i happened to see a very faint meteor that looked like it was very far up in the atmosphere becuase they are usually much brighter.  this was to the north/northeast.  after that got my attention, i continued to scan the sky further to the north when i seen a triangle shape flying from north/northeast to south/southwest.  it had no lights what so-ever.  because of this it was virtually invisible against the night sky.  i have very good eyesight though and was able to make out just the front of the object which was triangle shaped, just more spread apart.  i could not make out the rest of it however, but it definitly had mass because it blocked out a few stars as it passed overhead.  it was so nearly invisible against the night sky and that it had no sound if you wasn't looking up at the right exact moment or have fair to bad eyesight, you would have never known it was there.  it was completly silent!  i could not say with any accuracy how big it was or how fast it was moving ( the whole thing took just long enough to fly over and disappear over the houses, just seconds ) or how far up it was.  i look at the night sky every night and have never seen anything like this!!  wow!!!  we also live near an approach pattern to epply airfield.  i've seen many planes at all altitudes at all hours of the day and night.  this was not a plane! i didn't know what it was when i first saw it, so i really focused on it and knew it was never anything i have seen before.  i think i may have even quit breathing for a few seconds.  virtually invisible with no lights,

the coast, is an area known as the mumbles. i visited this area on june 30th 2006, catching a bus which dropped me off on the road above a small cove called limeslade, at approximately 16.45. i went there to take some photographs for my weblog. \r\n\r\nit was a beautiful, hot summer's day, and my plan had been to take some photos, grab an ice-cream from the nearby cafe, walk out to the coastal path, and then return, before following the coastal walk back to the nearest village, oystermouth, to get a bus home. strange as this sounds, i suddenly got the sense that i shouldn't venture out onto the isolated coastal path alone. that could have been just the natural caution of a woman out walking alone, admittedly. but as i stood overlooking limeslade, taking my shots, i grew more and more uneasy, to the point where i felt quite desperate to leave the area. i blamed my discomfort on the heat of the day, and when the next bus arrived, around 17.15, i hopped aboard and returned to the city centre.\r\n\r\ni thought no more of it, until i uploaded my pics onto my pc that evening. one of the shots showed a bizarre, airborne object, which seemed to be flying over the sea. i considered this may have just been an insect or airborne seed, close to the camera. however, it looks like a larger object some distance from the camera. the object looks like some kind of prehistoric creature - a pterydactyl or other such creature. i've attached my original shot, plus an enlarged, cropped section of the shot, showing the object. i don't know the precise time the pic was taken, but it was sometime between 16.45 and 17.10 on that day.\r\n\r\ni'm hoping you can give me a rational explanation for this strange apparition - there probably is one, despite how i felt at the time the shot was taken. many thanks for your time.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),  Wings,  Other,

delaware, oh. i've been stargazing my entire life on and off, so when i looked up at cassiopeia, down and to the left (approx 230 deg) i easily noticed two much brighter \"stars\", about the brightness of polaris/venus when quite brilliant. \r\n\r\ni had just walked up to a bonfire, and was looking up at what was turning into a wonderful night sky with hardly any light pollution. as i noticed them near cassiopeia, i took a few seconds to determine if these were jets or satellites, and after they remained motionless, i knew they were something else, especially with their size, placement and brightness. i drew my wife and friend's attention a couple other bystanders to them and they were all able to see the objects. they stayed immobile for about 15-20 seconds, then slowly started moving. they moved in parallel what looked like out of orbit (in the direction of the t below). it took approximately 30-45 seconds, perhaps longer, for the ufo lights to go completely invisible to our naked eye. unfortunately it wasn't completely dark at the time or we could have tracked them further, i believe.\r\n\r\nsomeone mentioned maybe they were satellites. i immediately discounted this because they were not moving on any axis (pointed out a satellite on the orbital plane later that evening to my wife and others), and initially they were not moving at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n
