bright object moving very slowly, assumed it was a satellite, and debated even mentioning it.  i finally decided to point it out, and as soon as i did we both saw it start to move very unnaturally.  it changed direction and changed colors.  it looked as if it were swimming rather than flying.  it was jellyfish-like in the way it was almost always moving very slowly then would shoot in one direction quickly and kind of drift in that direction.  at one point i observed a commercial airplane fly near it and underneath it, and at that point the object became still and gave out a white starlight.  i watched it for about 45 minutes on the beach.  i finally went home and stood in my front yard and immedietly found it.  i called my mom and brother outside who both looked with toy binoculars and observed it was infact moving.  they observed the colors as well, but i let them know that it was not making any bursts of speed like i saw over the sound.  it appeared more west at this point, no longer over the sound but over the island.  i videotaped some of it, although i couldn't zoom in enough.  the object does infact move on tape, but the video does it no justice.  if anyone in the long island - conneticut area witnessed this, i'd like them to contact me immediately.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

i noticed some strange lights over the mt range, it was about 12am and the fish were not biting so i was relaxing and watching the sky.The moon was low in the sky and didn't give us much light. all of a sudden this pond which was 2 miles across turned as bright as day. we looked up and there was a huge  over us,maybe 2-300ft above us and made no noise at all.This disk coverd the space from the waters to the road where the car was,this would have made the spear at least 500 feet across my friend got very nervous along with me and we decided to get the to shore ,put the canoe on the car and leave. the light stayed with us all the way to the boat ramp. as we were putting the canoe on the car the light came closer. we were scared by now and just wanted to get out of there. we thru the gear and the canoe on the top of the car and tied it down with only one rope. the trip to the highway takes about 1 half hour and the next thing i recall is us parked on the side of the highway with all the poles and gear neatly stowed neatly in the back of the car. it took two and half hours to get where we stopped, it usually took 1 half hour to get this far. we arrived home about three and a half hours late. no reccolection where all this time went. also the canoe was tied down the way it should and not the way we thru it on the car. my friend would never talk about what happened and his wife told me he later had a nervous brakedown because of what happened that nite he never told her what happened and asked that i didn't either. \r\n ","distance":"101-500

two hours north of san francisco).  we were watching the sun set over the ocean and preparing to watch the clear night sky, so we had big binoculars (16x70) set up on a tripod on the west-facing patio.  moments after sunset (which occurred at 7:15 p.M., [see photo ���100_1605[1]sunset���], while the sky at the horizon was still orangey, we noticed a very bright orange/gold streak moving at a slightly upward angle in a north-to-south direction [see photos ���100_1607[2]picture 3 unenhanced��� and ���picture 3 enhanced for brightness and contrast (3)���].  at arm���s length and measuring between thumb and forefinger, the streak early on was about an inch above the horizon.  we then looked at it through the binoculars and we saw not only the streak, but a dark, somewhat elongated object that was rounded at the leading edge of what we then called a ���trail���. over the next minute or two, the trail got to be about four inches long (as measured above) and the object took up a good ��� to ��� inch of that measurement.  we continued to see the trail but not the object with the naked eye.  \r\n\r\na minute or two after we first saw the trail, the object/trail appeared to stop and hover in place for another 10 minutes or so, but the trail did not dissipate at all like a vapor trail would.  (since we were facing west, it's also possible the object was not hovering but rather moving west to east or east to west after it appeared to stop.) we could see the trail and the \"unmoving\" object for a total of 10 minutes or so until it got too dark to see through the binoculars.  the pictures we took do not even begin to show the brightness of the trail.  \r\n\r\nbased on the \"distance to horizon\" calculator on the internet, we estimated the distance to the object was about 15.5 nautical or 17.9 statute miles.  (we did a google earth calculation that showed our rental house was 172 feet above sea level and, adding the five-foot height of the tripod, resulted in a \"height of eye\" of 177 feet.)  if the object was almost 18 miles away, the object would have to be quite large to appear as big as it did, even though it required binoculars to see it.\r\n\r\nour collective conclusion was that the object was too big to be any kind of airplane and that the trail was not a vapor trail.  the way the object appeared to stop and hover, and the fact that the trail did not dissipate, were also very strange.  maybe it was some kind of missile, but we sure can���t figure it out.  none of us had ever seen such a thing.

horizon just to the west of costilla new mexico at 7:20 pm it was between jupiter and the moon just below\r\nthe ecliptic line about two thumb lengths, with a compass it was 160 degree mark. the light at arms length was the size of a pin head. it was brighter then venus and you could see two lights together with the naked eye. the light was stationary and did not move for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n  when i observed the lights with my 10-50 binoculars it was reflecting light form the sun and was a golden diamond shape translucent with three lights internally you could see structure three parts the right and left were beveled outwards into the middle and the bottom was beveled to the middle making a straight line below the other two compartments. as the sun set the object glowed white with three separately lit compartments it would glow brighter and then weaken several times. the diamond shape was more defined as it grew darker. the object disappeared around 7:43 and the clouds moved in.\r\n\r\n witness # 2 costilla nm \r\n,\r\n\r\non saturday evening 9/22/07 at 7pm. my girlfriend and\r\ni were on our way to her moms b-day party and she\r\nnoticed a bright light in the southern sky, just south\r\nof the rising moon to the east. i told her to pull\r\nover cause it just wasn't moving at all or blinking,\r\nand it was too bright and large to be a star.\r\nspecially do to the fact that it was still day light\r\nout, and she preceded to take three pictures of it. it\r\nwas an easy shot for the camera do to the exposure\r\nlight available.\r\n\r\nwe went on to the party and once we arrived we just\r\nkept watching this still light, but this time with her\r\nmom and her step dad, brother, brother girl friend,\r\nand last to arrive was my friend and his two boys

side\r\nlike eyes, almond shape to be exact.\r\n\r\nafter about 40 mins. of watching it clearly, some\r\nclouds moved in and the object slowly disappeared.\r\nalso it was my opinion that the object

saw. there was an absolutely disproportionately humangous \"star\" in the blackness of the sky. at first i thought it was an airoplane flying low. but it had no landing lights flashing. then i realized it wasn't moving. i also heard no noise. it was just hovering stationary and silent. i thought to myself, i must be dreaming. \r\n\r\nthen i tried to discern a shape. but the thing was so imensely bright that i could not see into its center, so as to find a shape. it was an abnormally intense bright white, visibly radiating rays of extreme bright light outward. activity-wise it was almost as if it was \"very twinkling\", but when i looked at the other stars for comparison, it out-twinkled them all. there was an energy movement about it, radiating this brightness outward. and for a moment i could feel a neuronic response in my fingertips, shooting down to my toes, as if a lot of sharp needles had penetrated me all at once. \r\n\r\nat this, i went to stay close to my door,

as they moved in the sky, and as they passed, they momentarily blocked out the regular stars, yet the big \"star\" was not at all affected by it, as it would not disappear \"behind\" the clouds, like the rest of the stars. instead, the clouds passed behind it and its light outshone the clouds.\r\n\r\nthen i tried to discern a reference size between the normal stars and this one in question. the normal ones were so tiny in comparison, like the point of a pencil-tip, compared to a 25 cent american quarter. _go figure...\r\n\r\ni called my daughet to see what i was seeing. (to make sure i wasn't dreaming\".)\r\n\r\ni had an uneasy feeling the whole time. -as if any moment it would drop low and come toward me. for this reason i went inside the house. i wanted to report this to authorities but then stopped short at the thought of having to wrestle with their disbelief and ridicule. -forget it!\r\n\r\nps.: i observed two helicopters, flying toward the direction of the \"star\", minutes apart one from the other. there was also an airplane, small, like a private plane, flying toward small executive airport in orlando -away from star, as if for landing). i do not recall the color of the choppers.)\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7989,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.6023798,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09242007-0006","longitude":-81.3300252,"occurred":1159081200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1159081200000,"summary":"Huge

23/07 ~1:00 am or so). i was outside around a fire with my niece and nephew. the sky was clear, weather nice. i looked to the sky and seen a triangular shaped ufo/aircraft at about 2500-3000 feet up flying low speed. it's belly was lit up with approx 7 white lights (in a v shape) and it was virtually silent (it was very silent). it's direction was north i believe, following the niagara river towards niagara falls (30 km away). our sighting was with 3 people and i would say it was 2-3 minutes duration as it disappeared into the night and tree line. this is the 3rd time in 1 month i have seen it. i visit my friend regularily who lives in ft erie, he has seen it with me a few weeks back. it was an awsome sight to see and next time i will have my camera on hand to video it. it is as if i can set my watch to this 'thing'. i also know it can be seen from buffalo, but do believe it was in canadian airspace the three times i seen it.\r\n\r\nmy take on this mystery aircraft/ufo is this. i believe it to be a b2 spirit bomber patroling the border, i may be wrong though. i am a true believer in ufo's and an aircraft buff, but to the untrained eye... this is one very freaky sight and confuse/scare someone by it's appearance. it is ghostly in nature and it blends into the night sky perfectly. added all that with it's silence and i am sure it is a b2 stealth. anyone reading this who is in either buffalo ny or fort erie ontario areas, i urge to set out with your video camera at about 10 at night to be sure you catch it. the wait is worth your time. i only assume this aircraft is flying easterly over lake erie then onto lake ontario. our area here is big time internation border with numerous bridges crossing into the usa and i am certain it is a secret border patrol tool. very intimidating!!!\r\n\r\ncomments and questions can be sent to bertgjohnson@gmail.Com \r\n\r\nthanks! b johnson\r\n\r\nps: please contact me with other area sightings. i have not seen it from niagara falls btw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

the post game show, i went out to my deck, which is on the west side of my house, in my backyard. i was sitting in a chair facing east (towards my house) when i saw a jet traveling north from the south. there was nothing else to look at so i was following the jet with my eyes when an object caught my eyes when i was looking directly east. this object was all white and was completely standing still when i first saw it. at first, i thought it was a star or mercury/venus, but it was too early in the day to be able to see a star or planet. i kept my eyes on it and suddenly, it shot off from the ne to the sw. there was a very slight breeze from the ssw at the time, so i do not believe this was something carried by the wind, as it would have been going against the wind at a pretty good speed. as the object moved to the sw i was able to get a closer look at it. it was a very odd shape. almost like a balloon with a huge streamer, but the streamer did not flutter around as you would expect from a balloon being carried by the wind.\r\n\r\nfrom the time the first object i saw began moving to the time it was out of sight was about 10 seconds. i did not get a chance to take a picture of that object. i was actually thinking about going inside and grabbing my camera when i notice a second object. this object was already moving when i noticed it. trying to think quick, i ran inside and grabbed my camera, turning it on when i was running back through the house to the deck (this took about 30 seconds as i had to go to the lower level of my house). when i got back outside, the object was just disappearing behind some trees and i could not get a picture. but, i immediately looked up to where the other objects appeared from and there was another object. i tried taking several pictures and am attaching the one of the best quality (object is in lower left corner). i can not tell what it is, even after zooming in on it. the sky was very bright and it is very difficult to zoom in on a small object very far away with those tiny view finders.\r\n\r\ni do know that whatever these thing were had to be moving with their own power and not carried by the wind. as i said, there was

(for some years now, i've been resting my eyes by staring out at the horizon, as suggested by a nurse at work.)  as usual, i went into a corner conference room. (i believe it was between 10 and 11 am.) from there, i can watch people outside on the streets, birds flying overhead, airplanes heading to or leaving from msp international airport, and check on the weather.\r\n\r\naround the end of june, or beginning of july, 2007, i went into the corner conference room and began watching the people on the streets below.  it was a nice sunny morning, with big fluffy clouds floating by.\r\n\r\ni stared towards the river and began watching planes fly overhead.  they must have redirected the planes, and i thought of our 911 disaster, as one plane headed in my direction (though clearly, it was high enough in the sky to not be a threat).  as i watched the approaching plane, it was very high in the sky, and above some clouds, but i realized it was definitely a nwa plane, since it had a red tail.  as i lowered my eyes, i saw a bird flying.\r\n\r\ni glanced up again to see how close the plane was, when i saw it.  it was between the plane and the bird.  it was a solid black line.  in a blink, the figure went from a solid black line, to a solid black triangle, to a solid black square.  it was as though i was looking at the bottom of this object.  i think it changed form again, but i don't recall exactly what the form was.  in a blink, it kept repeating the formations.  it moved as though it was hiding at the bottom of the clouds.  the bird flew on.  the plane flew on.  the object moved slowly towards our building.\r\n\r\ni wanted to find someone to see it with me, but i was instantly fearful of two things.  1. what would someone at work think of my asking them to come see this.  2. what would i miss if i left to go get someone.\r\n\r\ni stared in amazement.  it went right over our building.  i thought to myself, if it is real, it will cross over to the other side of the building.  i ran to the other side of the building to look.  i stood anxiously waiting.  it appeared, and continued on, slowly, towards the capitol.  it was still continuously changing shapes.  i watched until it was gone from sight.\r\n\r\ncan anyone explain what it was that i saw?  the few family members i have told, don't believe me.  i don't dare tell

headlights do not do this so i decided to get up and look out the window to try and see what was causing it.  i got up, looked out the window, and just to the southwest, there was an extremely bright light.  it was more wide than high and it looked like a row of extremely bright white lights.  i did not see any strobing lights at this point. i watched it for several seconds.  it seemed motionless

 it was low in the sky and it was above the tree line.  there was a pond, some houses and trees between the object and myself.  as i continued to observe the object, the strobing lights activated

an aircraft.  i also have never heard of aircraft lights that were strong enough to display on the interior walls of homes.  after a few moments, the object moved to my right, which was towards the

mph.\r\n they were really moving,with aplasma sheild around the lead craft. they flew over the international harvester plant also along st. rt. 72. \r\n   i first noticed what looked like a fireworks mortor going off, then it started to advance towards us at extreme rate of speed, i said to john look at that pointing towards the area that it come from. he stated wtf! is that a meteor?  and i replied i don't think so meteor's don't climb in altitude,or start from the ground up. and it sure wasn't swamp gas traveling at 5,000 mph  looking at each other and saying awesome. all night long we keep shaking our heads and saying that was wild. we lost site of the objects as they passed over the building heading north, because of the extreme speed they were moving.","distance":"Over One

and see a star kind of thing in the sky but its brighter and drifting. one by one they come up from the trees.  they appear to be like orange street lights, but they're way too high to be street lights.  these three lights move in a rough line.  they appear to be bigger than stars, glowing in a weird manner, but smaller than the moon.  i'd say roughly 1/4 or 1/5 of the moon's size from where we were looking (not actually that size, but relative to it).  anyhow, two more join the first three from behind the trees and form an elongated m shape.  their motion slows down, and they are moving in various directions.  after about three or four minutes, three of them condense into a tight straight line formation, much closer than what they were like before.  after a little those three form into a triangle with the other two on the side.  eventually, the triangle slowly fades away, the one of the other two fades, and then the last one fades some time after the rest.  by the end, we were joined by my brother and father, so a total of five of us saw at least some of them.  we were positioned in a way that we were looking to the moon in the south, and the flying objects were around 45 degrees to the left of the moon.  their motion was not in the typical manner of airplanes, nor was their color and size.  no smoke trails were visible.  we captured some poor video and pictures.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

and told me to hurry and come outside.I ran outside and he was pointing to the sky.I was amazed at what we were looking at.They were fying so smoothly heading north.I ran downstairs to the basement to get my camera.When i got back they all went into the clouds.They were white in color,most likely because the sun light was reflecting from them.They all diseappered in the clouds and the clouds were headed southeast.But we were able to see 2 of them in the clouds.They stopped and were hovering.During all this i had a huge smile on me.I always believed in ufos.After a few seconds in the clouds one ufo came down out of the cloud and was still hovering.It stayed there.Then we see a airline jet coming from north headed south towards the ufo.Then the ufo goes back in the cloud.10 seconds after the plane past the ufo comes out of the cloud and starts heading north.The others i guess have gone in another direction.Most likely south east with the clouds because we couldnt find them anymore.So the one we see is headed north and goes into a another cloud and stays there for a few minutes but we cant see it nomore because the clouds are more thick now.It appears from the clouds again and keeps going north.Now the sky is full of thick clouds.We stayed maybe 20 min looking but nothing.I go back inside.10 min my father calls me again and points to the sky to show me a airplane that has that big radar on it.It was flying around the area then it flew out of site.And 5min after that plane showed up,my father told me that 4 f-16 flew through the area.I guess they were looking for the ufos.Others had to see what we saw,thats why the f-16 were flying around with the other plane.I took 8 photos total but only 1 has the ufos in it.Maybe the others have something to but i cant find nothing.I found 2 ligths in the photo above the trees inthe clouds.You have to zoom in on the photo.I also discovered 2 more objects in the photo,1 in the left and 1 all the way on top of the photo,a total of 4 objects.Remember to zoom.Enjoy.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
