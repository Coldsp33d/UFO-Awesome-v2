[i had both of these present, and fully charged, to record some of our annual get-together music]. i was very surprised about my digital slr, as i quickly changed settings, wondering why it would not work, as i had taken several shots previous to this sighting. i tried to just fire the flash of the camera, to see if there would be a reaction of some sort from the object. the flash would not fire. i was torn between trying to figure this out, knowing i'd be missing part of what this object was doing. i tried the the video cam...Nothing. it would not record. i put them both down, deciding to just watch, while mentally cursing the manufacturers of what i thought was fairly good digital equipment. by this time, the object was halfway between clinch mt. and pine ridge. we continued watching its movement, fairly slow, deliberate, with occasional moments of hovering, until it could no longer be seen over pine ridge. no blinking lights were seen by three witnesses. the fourth thought he might have seen a blinking red light, but not at all times. there was absolutely no sound. the estimated time of sighting is three minutes. i knew something extraordinary had been seen, and we were all fascinated, not really knowing what to think, except that it was definitely not a plane or helicopter. while the event occurred, it seemed to me personally that i was seeing it, yet at the same time not really believing that this was something i could not explain. just remarkable; i really can not find the perfect word. totally amazing falls a bit short.\r\n\r\nfor informational purposes, about 5 minutes later, i picked up the nikon to see if i could take a shot; it worked perfectly, still showing a full battery charge.

my wife and 1 year old son around 7-8 p.M. on wednesday september 19th 2007 and noticed a large very bright object in the sky.  it seemed to have blue and yellow streams of light flying around it.  at first i thought it might be a planet such as venus so i just mentioned it to my wife and said let's see if it moves.  so during our walk with our dogs we kept an eye on it.  then when we reached our house i could see it clear as day right from my front door step.  it was far away but it looked unusual enough that i figured i would take a photo of it.  as soon as i took the photo is start to move upwards at that is when i knew this was no star but could not figure out what else would glow so intensly and stay in one position for more than 10 minutes not to mention the strange strands of blue and yellow it had moving around it.  after it moved upwards it slowing started to move towards us, but then it suddenly sounded like a small plane, we were in a bit of shock so i forgot to take another photo, and when i heard the plane engines i also thought it might just be an aircraft of some sought but still could not understand how it glowed so bright.  anyway, it flew right over our heads and i looked straight up underneath it.  it was about the size of a large fighter jet but looked very different from anything i had seen before.  it was a trianular shape on on each front side of the triangle were 3 massice lights.  it didn't fly fast as it past over our heads.  after this all happend i took my iphone in to my computer to get the photo off it.  unfortunatly it does not have a zoom.  but i am a web designer and have software so i put it into photoshop and then changed the dpi to 300 so i could get a clear view.  i enlarged it and what i saw was even stanger than the first part.  it may have been an accident or something wrong with the camera but the zoomed in version looked like an aliens head, with a large bright square box in the middle, no joke, the box has a missing right corner and this is why i contact you.  after this i looked on youtube and did a search under gulf breeze ufo and came across a video of the well known ed walters who also lives here in gulf breeze.  he has one part of his video that shows a craft that is exactly the same as what i saw flying out of the light.  it has 3 massive lights on each site, but his photo is shot from the side.  at that point i really regreted not shooting the photo of the craft as it passed over but as it sounded like a plane, i just thougt it must be.  but when i think back the engine sounded much too small for that size of plane and those lights on the front seemed way too big for it to carry or need.  any way, as you might think this has really freaked me and my wife out and i just wanted to mention it to someone.  i also wanted to know if you know how i can reach ed walters as i would like to ask him about what he saw. i would also like to add that the photo was taken by an iphone, so i have no access to the film to edit it.  the first one attached is the far away version, the second is the zoomed version.  again this is only the photo of the light, the thing that flew out may have been it, or something coming from it, i'm not sure but i have attached a screen shot from the ed walters video so you can see what i saw. thanks","distance":"101-500

for two or three hours at a time. whether i saw alot or only a couple ufos. even the very first night i decided to go out and look at the stars was the night i saw the most number of ufos. the ufos i saw were always very high in the sky, most alot higher than commercial planes fly some were a little closer but i still could not see any detail of the ufo. some look like they're moving very fast and others alot slower. i would usually see them one at a time as i paned across the sky until i saw what looked like a moving star and i'd follow it all the way across the sky until it was out of sight. some look like white light and others a yellowish or gold color light but never flashing or blinking. some nights i would see ten or more of them. one time i saw one following right behind another. usually they travel just in a streight line but once one was traveling in a streight line until it crossed in front of a bright star then cut at an angle in a different direction. never any sound and they look soo odd the way they move its like nothing i've seen. on this paticular night in august i saw the strangest ball of light i've ever seen. it was a closer looking white light i happend to pan across when it faded out. so i kept my binocs on that same spot until it appeared again in what looked like a slightly different spot and again slowly faded out so i counted the seconds in between this time, about every five seconds it would reappear in a different spot about the same space from the last, it went up,down, and across at different angles. each time i counted the seconds in between and it was always five seconds, i saw the light reappear around twenty times then it stopped. i was excited, amazed, and puzzled about it as i am every time i see these

avenue (midway airport).  i was on the i55 when traffic came to a dead stop just around wentworth avenue. from here the traffic was moving a few feet every couple mintutes. typical scenery here is lots of midway airport plane traffic and birds. and thats what i saw, as always. except, i first noticed was a gold/red contrail like on fire inside with a ball of light going down not up. i looked and looked and could see no aircraft attached to the top of this. it was very short and vertical hovering about 200 feet above the southbound side of traffic in front of me. i kept watching and wondering what the heck is that contrails dont go from the ground up. seeing contrails is normal around all this airplane traffic but not like this. while that was happening in front of me about half a mile in distance. i saw a flash of silver light on my right side. i looked and thought it might be reflection from a bird or a plane. i saw a whitish/silver orb that from my point of view looked to be about 300 feet up . it did not fly but it moved slightly for about 1 minute. now iam trying to look at two odd things while driving. i thought ok maybe just a bird and pay attention to the contail in front of you so you dont get in an accident. when i turned my attention back to the contrail i saw that it had changed to what i can only discribe as a rocket like white/blue contrail as i got closer to it i saw what looked like a small black round ball at the top of it. then as i paid my attention forward in traffic the orb/disc reappeared on the other side of the south bound traffic hovering again this time right by the contrail and then a commerical plane flew right over these to objects. these orbs/disc were from my point of view the size of about 4 of those large work-out balance balls put together. i kept thinking is anyone else seeing this. they would have too.  the orb/disc dissappeared into thin air after about 2 minutes. then i found myself driving right underneath this rocket contrail that hadnt moved an inch from its original spot. it was almost like you could touch it. i tried to keep looking for it in my rear veiw and it continued as last seen until i counldnt track it anymore.  then traffic was easing up a little and again saw the same orb/disc now back on the the right side of the highway. i watched again it just hovered and dissappeared into thin air. then as i reached my cicero exit i could see over the train tracks the orb hovering really low and next to the setting sun .

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have been working on a feature film just off the blue ridge parkway near roanoke, virginia for a month.  on tuesday night, september 18, 2007 i observed a seemingly very bright, multi-colored (green/red/blue) strobing (constant) aircraft on the wesern horizon over what appeared to be either the blue ridge mountains or near the town of vinton, va.  distance was impossible to guage.  the craft was far too bright to be a star i thought.  then, a moment later, i noticed that the vehicle was not stationary, but instead was making erratic movements.  these movements were both on a vertical plane as well as cricular and without reasoning.  the movement was nearly constant, and without any patern.  it would suddenly move up and down on the same vertical plane for several passes, then come to a stop.  then it would move in semi-circles, sometimes changing directions immediately in opposite directions.  movement was both minor as well as severe at points.  because there was no way to tell how far away the craft was, i cannot judge the distances of these movements up down and around.  i asked two other people sitting nearby to come verify what i was seeing and not only did they verify my observations, but spotted another vehicle which looked exactly the same, only this craft was much closer, appearing just over the top of a nearby set of trees.  we all confirmed that the vehicles were emitting exactly the same colors and strobing patters and that both were making similar extreme movements.  it was our collective opinions that known craft would be hard pressed to make such aerodynamic movements based upon our limited knowledge of modern aircraft.  additionally, since we were situated away from the cities near the blue ridge parkway, we had a very unobstructed viewing given the lack of lights out there.  these crafts rose proportionately to each other in the night sky over the course of the next three hours.  then, last night (september 19, 2007) we observed the same aircraft, first on the wesern horizon again, then watched as two more identical vehicles appeared in a quasi-triangular spacing over the lower western horizon, again looking and acting the same way as the night before.  they remained active again for several hours.  i would like to say that i do not rule out military aircraft as i believe there is a base in the general area of roanoke, va.  but i would hasten to add that although these may indeed be military, they were awfully brightly lit, which goes against accepted procedures for military aircraft lighting, strobing constantly as opposed to the expected flash lighting of commercial aircraft, and most importantly, were dead quiet (although range was again, impossible to determine) and demonstrated extremely severe maneuvers for conventional aircraft to make.  if these craft were as far away as i suspect (5-15 miles) that would make the movements we observed extremely fast and covering the distance of perhaps miles in mere seconds, with dead stops and 180 degree countermovements producing in my opinion, excessive structural stress.  again, if these were military, they are clearly testing anti-gravity matter devices.  a few digital phtos were taken, not by myself however, and appear as an amber globe.

sound from above. when we looked up to see what is was, we noticed a huge craft in the sky. it was massive, probably the size of a football field, and was comprised of rings that broke it up into several sections. each ring featured different colored lights than the other ones. it also had one huge light in its center, that we thought might be some sort of tractor beam. we were young boys, approximately 7-9 years of age, but we knew it was a ufo immediately. it was moving very slowly, and heading west toward the city of moorpark, ca.\r\n\r\nwe were nearly breathless, and stood still because we thought we might get beamed up by that huge light in the center (of the craft). once it passed over us, we relaxed a little, and then got exited about telling our parents what we had just witnessed. we could see it for about 10 minutes until it got too far away. the craft never changed speed or direction and continued heading west. \r\n\r\n  then, we went home to tell our parents. my dad said that we were full of it, but the next day the sighting was featured in an article in the enterprise, the local simi valley newspaper. we showed him the newspaper, but he still insisted that we, and the other eye-witnesses, were all crazy. according to the article, most of the other witnesses saw it in moorpark about 15 minutes after we did. this made perfect sense, as it was headed in that direction very slowly. \r\n\r\nnot too long ago, i noticed a sighting posted on mufon, that seemed earily similar to ours. not only was the description of the craft almost identical, but the location was as well (simi valley). and, as if that wasn't enough, there were even more bizarre similarities! the man was also about the same age as us at the time of his sighting as well (perhaps a year or two older). his description of the ufo gave me goose bumps too. he described it as a huge craft with many different colored lights, with colors reminding him of a christmas tree. this is what really made me want report this encounter. when i have the chance, i am going to the simi library to see if that article from the newspaper is in their archives. this way i can find out the exact date and a more exact time.

out for a smoke on the deck during the commercial. after sitting down i noticed through the trees what looked like a very large star, much larger than the north star, shimmering in the sky. the color was predominatly white, but there were distinct flashes of red and a turquise green every few seconds. since i do live close to both an aircraft plant and private airport i assumed it was a helicopter in the distance, that was traveling towards or away from me at an angle that made it appear to be still. i kept my eye on it and upon finishing the cigarette a few minutes later, it was the same size, distance, and there was still no noise that would make me think it was an approaching copter. i called out my mother to ask her opinion, and she agreed it didn't resemble aircraft or a star. we then summoned my sister, who also confirmed it was odd. my mother suggested we try another point of view, so we headed to the driveway, where we had a much clearer shot. we stood there for a few moments and my mom suggested we turn around and look at a star for a few seconds then turn around to compare it. upon turning around, it was clear this didn't resemble a star in the slightest. then a plane went by passing it closely, as the plane passed, our 'object' dimmed almost dissappearing. then upon the plane gettting further away, it brightened to it's original state. then only watching it for a short time we saw at least 4 planes come withing close distance, but it only dimmed a couple of those times. one advantage of the planes going by was that it made it clear this was not a recognizable aircraft. we did notice minor movements, slowly up a bit, or to the left. about a half hour later, everyone else elected to go inside, but i stayed for a while. i sat back down in the original chair i had spotted it in to light another cigarette and it was no longer visible from that spot, so it must have moved more significantly than we had suspected. after a while i did decide to opt for bed as well, but did check to see if it was still there, over 75 minutes after the original sighting, and it seemed to be the same strength light and position. this morning, it was as clear a morning as it was last night, and there was nothing there that would explain it. i will have my eyes peeled this evening to see if i can find a logical explaination or chalk it up to \"unknown\".","distance":"501

it was about 4:45 am. around 5:00 i went for a ciggarette with two friends on the porch. i noticed how clear the sky was for the storm we were supposed to be expecting. i also noticed how bright the north star appeared to be and questioned its placement, then thought maybe it was a planet. iasked my friends what they thought and then i noticed it had a huge bright reflection in the water similair to the way the moon would, but the moon was not out at the moment. about as soon as we began to question the star we saw it move, just a little at first but in an akward way. it began to dance in exactly the ways i had seen before on tv of recordings others had made. it was a brighyt white light that gave the illusiion at first it was a star but then when it moved closer to us it was very apperent it wasnt. it moved so fast and appeared as though in just one second it could have been where we were. igrabbed a light toy and began to make a circular shape with my arm. when  i would do this it would always move and then a strange lighting would strike, but only when i used the light. at times it appeared there were others but much farther away. it also looked as though it was sucking stars right out of the sky but we could not be for sure. for certain moments when i would stare to hard in awe it felt as though i had been temporarily hjypnotized in an intriguing but somewhat parylizing light. this game of light tag went on for about two hours and as the sun began to rise a strangely shaped set of very low and close to shore clouds rolled in out of nowhere. they almost appeared as a giant mass of land coming to shore. this part was actually a bit frighting. the water was completely still, and the air grew very still as well and humid and hot. as the sun began to show we watched it continually move out ward away from us but still darting around until it looked like a star. during the daylight it was still very visible and still moving enough to the point where other early risers on th beach saw it when i asked them. beforew it faded out of sight we saw one more much closer and more definable come into our vision and out very quickly and quietly across the sky. it appeared tyo be a metalic texture and oval sheped. we watched for another hour and didnt see anything else. thank you for hearing my story...Please write or contact and help me understand this. my other friend eric fisher has also contacted you with this story as he was the one with me. thank you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,
