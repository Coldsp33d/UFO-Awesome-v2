are a few funny things about this experience that i marvel about. it was not so much visually stunning as it was amazing and 'cute'.\r\n\r\nit was getting late in the night sometime before midnight, around 10pm and my sister's birthday party had just wound down and the last few people had left. i was sitting in the living room thinking about closing the balcony door. i got up and leaned over to release the door stopper when out the corner of my eye i saw a streak of light fly through the night sky. it was quite a distance away and i thought it was a shooting star. quickly i turned my head to make sure i didn't miss it as i love seeing heavenly bodies fly through the sky, when suddenly this light had come to an instantaneous halt! then before i could get my wits about me this light started moving backward and forwards at an amazing speed. judging by the distance (the light seemed to be out of earth's atmosphere) this light would of probably been covering a phenomonal area in no time as it danced back and forth.\r\n\r\ni stood there not knowing what to make of it. it's brightness was more intense than any other visible star in the sky and it was back dropped by the moon. i live in the city and the stars are not very bright where i am so this light stood out.\r\n\r\nit was only about 5 seconds or so of this light dancing backwards and forwards almost as if it was waving, then suddenly it zooms off at ligthning speed and vanished right before my eyes.\r\n\r\ni stood there for a while in denial of what just happened, not able to make sense of it. my mind was trying to be logical but my memory and emotions were telling a very different story.\r\n\r\nit occurred to me in the following days that this had happened on the night of my sister's 16th birthday. to me i will never forget that date further more. i thought that it was uncanny that i happened to see it just as i stepped out onto the balcony. what was the chances of that? if this craft did not want to be seen by me then why did it dance before zooming off? why did it wait for me to go out on the balcony? was the date significant? or just a way for me to remember when it happened?\r\n\r\ni don't know the answers to this but it does feel good to think that there was no accident that this event took place.

(i'm not religious) so unless god was doing a magic trick for me, that was the number one unexplainable thing i have ever witnessed.  i called everyone that same night/morning that's quite a few people; they all believed me, a few even mentioned they have seen plenty of things in the sky similar in their countries as their nights are much clearer than ours, one even laughed and told me, come to my country and you will see something is happening in the skies that we are not being told.  my friends are from all over - israel, peru, ecquador, brazil, england etc.. next day and after that, i was researching everything, every website, current stories, ufo sites, recent news etc... to see if anyone saw or reported the same or similar.  nothing, however, strange things started happening after that - i won't mention so people start thinking i'm nutty - one thing i will mention is 3 nights after, a helicopter was flying continuously directly over my building/area for approx. 30 minutes between 3-4am in the morning.  that was extremely unusual in this very quiet neighborhood..In manhattan period! especially at that time of morning.  i figured it had to be military in type due to the very loud sound of the roters. i looked out and up and i could see only the shape, but also three bright large square lights under it.  i didn't know helicopters had huge lights like that underneath them, they were not search lights, more like the bottom of the helicopter.   i have since gone and bought a serious camcorder with night vision and infrared with extended magnification.  i am now fully equipped ..Sorry for the long story, but i have not been the same and i don't like not knowing, especially after what i saw.

negligible.  i had a minor amount of white noise inside of my house at the time of the sighting, other light sources being an incandescent light behind me and the monitor on my desk.\r\n\r\nat the time of the sighting, i was working at my computer, situated in the corner of a room with a very large window to my right side, giving me full view of the sky.  there are trees around my house, some fairly tall in the 50-75 foot range; this being in january, there were no leaves on any of the trees and the branches were small enough to not obscure my vision.\r\n\r\nout of the corner of my right eye, i saw some lights heading directly toward my house, flying somewhere in the range of 30-50 feet off of the ground.  the lights being so low was the first thing to catch my attention, and immediately after that the realization that i did not, hear any sound being emitted from this object, regardless of its extremely low altitude.\r\n\r\nthere is a decent amount of air traffic around this area, usually national guard helicopters and some small to mid-sized airplanes, all of which i can clearly hear from 800+ meters away.\r\n\r\nthe object maintained a constant speed of approximately 25-30 miles per hour and did not change course for as long as i watched.  \r\n\r\nthe lack of light worked against me as i was unable to make out any outline on the object; there were four circular lights that i saw; two spaced in the front and two more off to a 45-degree angle behind the first two.  the object did not rotate at all, moving much like a fixed-wing craft.\r\n\r\ni consider myself a fairly smart person, but this absolutely boggled my mind; the rate of speed, the lack of noise and the low altitude all kind of hit me at once.  i was, for a lack of a better term, stunned; in my right mind, i would have either told my father, who was in the other room, to look out the window or ran out my front door to see where it went next.  \r\n\r\nregrettably, though, i sat in a state that i can only describe as stunned, processing what i had just seen.","distance":"21-100

the pathway of oncoming air traffic. the observation occurred around 4 p.M. on february 23, 1984 over hamilton hall on the ohio state university campus in columbus, ohio. when the first witness, w1, sighted the object, from a stairwell under an east-facing window, it looked, in general, like a flying, rotating rectangle. part of the time it had a bright light under it. it moved slowly, was on the flight path of port columbus airport, and a low jet appeared to pass under it as w1 watched. w1 went to the department office and collected 4 other witnesses.\r\n\r\nin general, it looked like a rectangle, which would disappear and then come back into view. during part of the observation, a much smaller, but very bright white light was under the rectangle. the object rotated at precise regular intervals of about once a minute. it didn���t just twist randomly in the wind. \r\n\r\nthe witnesses watched it for approximately 20-25 minutes as, it slowly drifted toward port columbus airport. the witnesses asked if there were a telescope or camera in the building, but were unable to find one. by around 4:20, a witness called warren nicholson, who worked at the nearby battelle memorial institute and who investigates ufo sightings. by this time, the object was nearly out of sight. mr. nicholson called back to say that he had looked for it from the roof of the main battelle building, but had been unable to see it. he later said that he had checked with port columbus immediately and they told him the wind velocity was 0. they couldn���t see it on radar.\r\n\r\nmr. nicholson later said that that evening a family had also made a ufo report describing it as four lines in the sky. the father had taken pictures through a 1200 power telephoto lens with asa 400 color film. the wife described the lines as tear drop shaped and the husband described each as shaped like an airplane���s wing section. they were visible in the west and were dark. they then flew away in four different directions. mr. nicholson said the witnesses were very credible. he thought that many sightings in one day were a ���flurry��� of activity.\r\n\r\nso far, the object has never been identified. one characteristic noted by all witnesses was its regular rotation and rectangular appearance. no balloon shape was seen. it would be quite difficult for a balloon to continually rotate regularly, because wind currents would prevent this. the rotation was very regular, not a twisting in the wind (and there was no wind). in addition, there would need to be some sort of power plant and a method of propulsion to allow it to maintain its rotation.\r\n\r\nthis sighting was in some ways similar to the november 2006 sighting over o���hare in that it was near an airport, where an airplane could have struck the object. as in the o���hare observation, all witness was credible. all now have ph.D.S and have been or are university professors. the reports were collected from each individual witness independently within a few days of the sighting. the observation was reported in several books.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

tails.   i thought it hit the earth..Seemingly close to me...Driving distance even....About 45 minutes.\r\n....I thought my life had changed, having witnessed this event.  i expected news of  a fire and that night looked for signs of a fire...But nothing...\r\n\r\nso, what was that?    the tail was really bright blue...?  is that recognizable ? \r\n\r\nin a hurry.\r\n.. sorry about spelling and grammatically errors.\r\nthank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:17","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7924,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4015781,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09162007-0002","longitude":-122.3608105,"occurred":1189837260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1189837260000,"summary":"2

ask for the address.]\r\n\r\ndriving out of town, going for one last stop. it's about 16:50 - the sun had already set behind the mountains. noticed a bright patch of white in the darkening sky - too big for venus, not quite as bright. could be a very bright small cloud, but other clouds are drifting and this one isn't. at a parking lot, i braced my binoculars solidly, and determined the object was stationary for about 1/2 hour. i asked another person to look and tell me what he saw - it was the same. the object was about 25 degrees above the southern horizon, about 4x the size of venus, and overall brightness roughly that of jupiter - to the naked eye. there were no clouds near it, but cirrus clouds were approaching from the west.\r\n\r\nno camera, so i memorized all i could, and later drew a picture. when i was a kid, i saw one that was all action and no detail. this was the opposite. i'm glad, because i'm tired of pictures of blobs and specks. this drawing is large (~ 1 mb) - if you zoom in, you will see my attempts to represent the following impressions. feel free to copy the drawing; just don't alter it in any way, and don't represent it as an actual photograph. while the shape and placement of the object's features is reasonably accurate, my drawing cannot do it justice.\r\n\r\nit looked like a glowing diamond filled with countless strands of yellow-white light, each strand a string of countless beads of gleaming white, all of which floated in a transparent medium which permitted the sky color to pass through yet also glowed faintly due to its contents. it brought to mind one of those spectacular back-lit pictures of a live jellyfish by national geographic. the brightness of the \"corners\" was more like that of venus, but the interior was of lesser intensity.\r\n\r\nas the clouds began to pass #under# it, i knew it was pretty high up, pretty big, and not attached to a tether. as the clouds began to obscure it, it's light gradually changed from yellow-white to intense crimson, although the corners remained white. therefore i thought the object might be reflective, rather than self-luminous - we get new mexico sunsets. however, after it was obscured for a while and the sky was getting dark, the clouds thinned and the object was a faintly visible, yellow-white glow.\r\n\r\nobject made no sound.\r\n\r\n-end-","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":7921,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.28022,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09152007-0008","longitude":-107.8752767,"occurred":1189728000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone,  Diamond,  Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1189728000000,"summary":"Diamond object south of durango co 2007/09/13","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/7921_submitter_file1__DiamondObject2048x3072.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Durango, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:444073"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Hudson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My 16 year old son brought a strange light in the sky to my attention around 9:15pm on 09/09/07. we live on a very \r\n\r\nhigh part of hudson, wisconsin and have a view of the western horizon. we live right on the border of wisconsin and \r\n\r\nminnesota and the mississippi river is the divide. the msp international airport is 30 miles away, slightly to the \r\n\r\nleft of our backyard view, so airplane sightings in the sky are constant. we have lived in the house for almost 3 \r\n\r\nyears and know what airplanes look like very well, far away, close-up, the paths they took...\r\nthis particular night, what we saw wasn't like anything i had ever seen!\r\n my son was yelling to hurry and check it out, i walked out the deck door and looked straight out and saw this huge \r\n\r\nball of light, flashing colors of light very fast! red, blue, yellow, white, orange, very low to the ground and \r\n\r\nvery close. close, meaning that it looked like it was right above the river which is 11 blocks to the west down the \r\n\r\nhill. the light was flashing at a phenomenal speed, very very bright! it hovered there in the same spot for what \r\n\r\nseemed like 15-20 minutes. as this one hovered it was joined by another similar light, except this one was much \r\n\r\nsmaller, the smaller one was only there for a couple of minutes and departed, first upwards and then to the south. \r\n\r\nmy son and i were so in awe, we didn't think about the camera until several minutes passed. when we finally got the \r\n\r\ncamera it was on its last bit of juice and the battery was dying, we were able to snap 4 pictures, but the quality \r\n\r\nisn't good considering it was dark and trying to set up the camera before it died completely. the light faded and \r\n\r\ndeparted steadily to the south. it was over by 9:30pm.\r\n the next day my head was still abuzz from what i had seen and i charged the camera so that in case they returned \r\n\r\nthat night, i would be ready. around 9:00 pm that night on 09/10/07 they returned...This time further away, but the \r\n\r\nsame exact scenario. they were closer to the airport and over in that direction. the main bigger light hovered \r\n\r\nagain for about 15-20 minutes. this night it was joined by 2 other lights, smaller, they didn't stay very long and \r\n\r\ndeparted south. between myself and my 2 other sons we snapped around 100 pictures that night, the pics are amazing, \r\n\r\nthey don't depict what we seen with our human eye, instead they have an orb shape or round.\r\n we have continued to see these lights every night this week and if we sit out on the deck from 8pm to 10pm, they \r\n\r\nkeep coming back. it is very unsettling and my thoughts of ufos have consumed my whole week! \r\n they seem to be silent, no sound coming from them, although last night, which was 09/14, as i was trying to \r\n\r\ncapture 2 lights in the sky, that were very bright, i heard a low humming/buzzing noise, almost like electricity \r\n\r\nwould sound? but not really like anything i had heard before.(except on \"alien\" movies...) it lasted for about 5 \r\n\r\nseconds and stopped, i recorded the noise on video, but was not able to capture the two lights in the sky, due to a \r\n\r\nbig tree in our yard.  i've looked on the internet and it doesn't look like anyone else besides us, have seen these \r\n\r\nlights. tonight 09/15, we are going to drive to a lookout spot in our town on top of a cliff, thinking about buying \r\n\r\na telescope!!\r\n\r\n\r\nshelly","distance":"501 Feet -

the evening of august 16th, 2007, while staying at our camp in priceville, new brunswick, canada, myself and three (3) other individuals witnessed a very unusual sight in the north-west star-filled sky.  our camp has no electricity, the closest home with electricity is approximately 1/4 -1/2 mile away.  we at first thought the object was a very bright star, until the object began to move, in both vertical and horizontal movements.  our next thought was that the object may be part of the spacestation, or the orbit of the flight visiting the station at that time.  the area of the sighting is in the direct flight route of all aircraft using canadian air-space enroute to europe and other locations.  we have seen many such aircraft and satellites over the years we have visited our camp (over 40 years), and we recognize the difference between a star, satellite, or airplane.  this, most definately, was something different.  when approaching aircraft came into sight, the object would dim and disappear, only to reappear, following the disappearance of the aircraft.  it continued to \"bob\" up and down, and with short quick movements to the left and right.  otherwise, it stayed in relatively the same spot.  we were fascinated with the object, and marveled at its movements.  we were not afraid or aprehensive.  we have seen many signts in the skies above and around our camp.  we continued to observe for about 15 minutes, then went into our camp for the night.  we did not lose signt of the object.  there was nothing more to do so we went into our camp.We watched for the object each night thereafter and did not witness it again until the night of september 5th, 2007, located in the same space, but seen approximately around 10:00 p.M.\r\n\r\nwould there possibly be some answer to this viewing other than a ufo?  i would like to hear from anyone who can respond to such a request.\r\n\r\nmy husband, who was also a witness to this, and i will be returning to our camp in new brunswick next week again (we reside in lewiston, maine, usa on a permanent basis).  thank you, marina f. fossett","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

base with my employees. i was outside taking to one of my operators. after going over a few things that we needed to cover, the operator told me to take a look at those lights in the sky. what i saw was two very bright, silver circular objests, side by side. they looked like a pair of head lights. this direction was to the wsw. we both watch the ojects moving in a ne direction. they were moving quite rapidly. as we watched the ojects move, we both then noticed another object in the sky. the same color and shape. this object appeared to by stationary. the other two objects got closer and formed an arrowhead or triangle shape and then all three moved at the same speed and direction. as we continued to watch, we then noticed approximately four to five additional objects appear. once again, same color and shape. i then called out to two other employees working in the next building to come out over here and take a look at this. now the four of us were watching these objects. we kept asking one another what do you think theses can be? we were all quite amazed. we asked one another and tried to rationalize about the possibilities of what they could be. then one of the people who i called out from the other building shouted what the xxxx! look over here as he pointed to the sw. we could not believe what we then saw. approximately 30 to maybe 40 more of these objects of the same type of shape and color. we all actually became shocked. that's probably the best way to descride it. we began to see a few more co workers passing by on their fork lits and called them outside to take a look. now, during this time  a total of seven people, including myself witnessed these objects. they were all moving to the ne. we all kept saying out load what to you think it can be? do you believe this? do you guys actaully see this stuff? after approximately 15 minutes or so they began to move away and disappear. the sun raising from the east also made watching their movements more and more difficult. midway airport is just a couple of miles away and were saw planes in the area. the pilots had to have seen these objects. we could not capture any videos or photos as no one anything to use. it was rather amazing. all of us talked about it throughout the day telling our co workers.

form of seconds, minutes or hours:   6 minutes place of sighting - county - city/town:   corner of bennett mcalpine road bellingham, wa usa describe briefly the physical appearance of the object(s):   150 to 200 yards across, gray color with a communication type of disk attached to the bottom of it. no lights or noise just hovering there about 100 feet off the ground just under the fog cover.  describe briefly the location of your sighting:  hovering about 100 feet off the ground above a house next door to the car body shop there, showing only half of it���s self (lower half)  while the other half was hidden up in the fog cover.  where were you & what were you doing at the time?:     i was driving to the store in my car to get a pack of cigarettes on bennett street facing east when i say it on my left what made you first notice the object?:   first i noticed that all the lights were out all a long the street in that block and the fog was swirling around the top of this house and then i saw it just above the house.  what did you think the object was when you first saw it?:    i thought it was a military disc or hovering craft, i didn���t know what to think maybe a flying saucer or something. after thinking about it i thought it might be a military craft due to the fact that it had a satellite dish under the bottom of it and it looked a dull gray color like the ships i sailed on during my seaman days.  describe your reaction/action during and after the sighting:  i never been so scared in my life. i shook and trembled and wanted to get out of my car and run away, and for the past two years i feared to report it due to fear of having the military and government come to my house a lock me and my family up.  describe the object and its actions: i only saw the lower half of the ship due to the fog being so low. it was gray painted about 150 to 200 feet across from edge to edge. it had a satellite dish and some kind of crimson red light that i could hardly see shining down from the center bottom of the craft.  how did you lose sight of the object?:  i don���t know because i drove off before it left. i set there and watched it for a few minutes and being so scared of what would happen to me if they found out that i saw them i didn���t want to draw any more attention to me then i   already had. when i came back ten minutes later it was gone. did you

straight for us, explaining the lack of perceived movement.  it was very bright white, like a star.  then, suddenly, it headed to the south for a short distance, at a high rate of speed, and the light
