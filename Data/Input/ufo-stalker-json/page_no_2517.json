spotting a couple of normal ones, i saw a very unusual one. this one���s flight characteristic seemed to be like a butterfly in a strong breeze except very, very high up (high up enough to reflect sunlight at about 4:15am).  it appeared to be climbing in altitude quickly also. it was headed in a southerly direction and headed into orion. as it climbed, it seemed to slow and the just lazily move towards the westerly foot (star name = rigel) of orion. i pointed this out to a passing stranger who showed no particular interest. as it reached rigel, it slowed to a stop and reversed course. it was as faint as a smaller satellite at this point, and proceeded slowly in a northern direction past meissa (orion���s head), past mars and by triangulum. at approximately the star perseus, the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the east and started to slowly accelerate at first. a couple of women with their 2 children came to sit next to me and i pointed this out to them, as they focused in quickly, and the object accelerated  to the point that it went from almost straight above us, to beyond the horizon in about 2 or 3 seconds while the apparent size grew from a small, dim star to a moderate size star.  \r\n i have watched the stars since i was a child, and have studied astronomy for decades. the flight characteristics of this object matched no known aircraft that i have ever heard of as far as fluttering, ability to make an instantaneous 90 degree turn at velocity, or speed. to go from straight above to beyond the horizon at that altitude constitutes speeds that nasa could not duplicate in their wildest dreams.\r\n the weather was clear. a crescent moon and venus were in the east.","distance":"Over One

moved to switzerland in 92 with my family.I was living in a place called wadenswill in zurich.My brother and i were walking back to our apartment complex,early in the day,very few clouds in the sky,sky was blue.I still remember till this day what i saw,i looked straigth above my head,directly above us was a silver triangle.We could see it clearly,hard to tell how big it was,this lasted only a few seconds.In those few seconds we seen it,it was like watchin a plane when it was movin,moving very slow,this was no plane for the record.Planes are not shaped like a triangle.As it moved slowly it shot off,were i dont know.A few years later i was reading a book on ufos,and it mentioned something very interesting.The black triangle,this triangle was seen around europe in the early 90s,just like what i saw,the colour different.This black triangle was seen in these countries france,belgium,holland,germany,england.If you look at a map you will notice that switzerland borders france and germany.Also belgium and holland are a few hundred miles north of switzerland probly more.Strange things happened were i lived in wadenswill,i can only remember one incedent,i was in the tiolet when the whole building started to shake,this happened many times my mother said.These were army planes flying over causing sonic booms,or maybe some triangle ship,i did a bit of research and it all starts to make sense.Since the day i saw it iv never stopped believing that theres something out there..................As mulder and scully would say the truth is out there.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

relieved i had woke up because of the nature of the dream, i didnt want to stay indulging in it. anway i moved my head from the ceiling towards my computer that is located near a window which was open (very warm night). that is when i saw the object. it hovered there right beside my computer, it almost reminded me of a colorful looking childs remote control, sophisticated jellyfish/flying saucer. basically what one would look like in 50 years from now.  it seemed to hover directed beside my computer as if it were communicating with it at the same time watching me as i slept,.\r\ni got a good look at it and that is all i got. i was scared to death. ive always been intrigued of the ufo phenomena and wished to see something in the night skies. this was different though. this was in my home hovering beside my computer and it scared me. so i turned away, wiped my eyes to make sure i wasnt dreaming still and took a quick glance back to see if it was still there. it was gone. im not sure as to what this was. whether from this world or not, but i know that it was high tech, and the scaryiest part, was, how it got through the window screen. almost like it would have been transparent,. \r\nall i know is that im not crazy, and im not on drugs/medication. i saw this thing. it was there. now i wish i would have not turned away, but it was my first reaction to something so different. anyway, i think there is something out there watching us, and i for one want to know what the hell it is!!!!!!\r\nin one sense i am frightend by this incident, but on the other hand i am mystified and want to know more about it,.\r\n\r\ni have included a sketch, sorry for poor quality, but its the best i could do for now. if anyway else has had a simular expierence please help me to contact them,

my basement appartment to smoke a cigarette when all of a sudden i noticed a small white light similar to that of a low flying aircraft moving in the lower sky, normaly i would not pay attention to this because i'm quite familiar with what i see in the sky in this region whether it be stars ( not many here for that matter because of light pollution) or the many lighted aircraft from the local airport, but what caught my attention is that it wasn't moving in a normal way of any kind, it was moving very erratically, constantly changing direction while always staying in the general vacinity, kind of like the way an insect would move when it hovers around, and while this small white light would move around a small blue light would momentarily flash for a fraction of a second right next to it, nothing like any of the night flying aircraft i have observed all my life. after a short minute of observing this object all of a sudden appeared a second similar object, and then a third! all moving in the same fashion as the first object and all moving independently of each other. after 4 or 5 minutes of observation i grabbed my camera bag, got in my car and headed in the general vacinity of where these objects were. having stopped at an overpass i got out my car to see where these objects would be and after carefully combing the sky with my eyes there was nothing left to be seen except for a dozen stars, that did not move! from my perspective i am not easily fooled by any kind of explainable event that would fool most people with untrained eyes, i have perfect vision, i have been an aviation enthusiast all my life and have been to many airshows, i even work in the aerospace industry, i build highly precise scale models and i'm also a semi professional photographer, so what i'm saying is that i have a very developed sense of vision and observation and i could not explain what i saw no matter how hard i tried, i do sincerely think i may have observed something

sociologist by profession and my husband is a ph.D., currently teaching at the local university.  what we describe in the following report is very much the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sighting (and later learned sightings) have been happening for quite some times.  we live in a small louisiana town. this is our story:\r\n\r\n\r\nfriday, september 7th, 5:20 a.M. is when i saw the ���boxed��� shape light, appearing in the e ne sky. the size was about a half dollar held at arms length.  i had had a restless night, battling a headache off and on all thursday night.  finally, at 5 a.M., friday morning, i got up, took something for the headache and tried going back to sleep.  however, sleep wasn���t going to happen, so i got up, put on coffee and went to the back porch to wait on the brew.  \r\n\r\n\r\nit was a very cloudy, hazy morning.  we live on 2 acres, in a very nice subdivision.  i was sitting in my porch chaise and observed something coming through the haze.  we have very large pecan trees (about 45-50 feet in height) and just above, slightly to the left of one of our large trees, was a very bright light.  it started out very dim, lighting the haze with a yellowish glow.  the clouds around the brightness were light and fluffy, with a chevron shaped appearance.  then, all of a sudden, a very bright ���boxed��� shape light emerged through the clouds.  there was no noise from the object; it just sat there.  the bright light became very dim and the hazy like clouds reappeared.  at this point, i ran back into the house and yelled at my husband to come see.  i wanted a witness.\r\n\r\n\r\nhe got up out of bed, came to the porch and looked out over the tree���in the mean time, i retrieved my digital camera which proved of no use because the object didn���t show up in the lens.  my husband observed the bright object, sleepily said it was the moon and went back to bed.(later to learn that he knew it wasn't the moon...Just something to say to calm me down. i was very  excited about the observation and was shouting at him on the porch \"what the hell is that??\"...It was 5:20 - 5:25  in the morning and the neighbors still sleeping was not the time to be loud.) \r\n\r\n\r\nnow i don���t know much about where stars are located and where the moon is suppose to be at 5:20 a.M. in eastern louisiana, but i knew it was not the moon���the sun was about to come up in the eastern horizon.  there was no way it could be the moon.  it appeared again as a bright, \"boxed\" shaped light and i watched it for a few more seconds and it finally disappeared through the clouds.  total time of observation was about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nlater in the morning when my husband returned from the university, we  packed our truck to go to our cabin in texas.  he was laughing at me for getting him up so early, but then later, as we drove to texas, being very serious, he told me something very disturbing.  \r\n\r\n\r\nhe is asthmatic and goes outside many times during some nights to get fresh air and get over his attack.  he told me that he had seen that same ���boxed��� shape bright light many times, located in the same area of the pecan tree, (give or take a few degrees) but had not said anything about it.  i asked him if it was always around 5:30 a.M. and he said no���sometimes he sees it before midnight, sometimes around 2 a.M���he has forgotten how many time he has actually observed the bright ���boxed��� shape light. always with no noise associated with it���always in the same easterly direction. \r\n\r\n\r\ni checked with the local airport to see what time flights come and go in our city.  it���s a small airport and no major flights arrive before 8:00 a.M. from any direction.  \r\n\r\n\r\ni then began to think back from the summer (july through early august) when we had our grandchildren with us for approximately 6 weeks.  the youngest one, who is 7, kept asking me why a bright light would shine into her bedroom window. she had asked that question many times during her stay.  i believed, at the time, it was the night light from across the street.  one night, while putting her to bed, i turned out the lights, pointed to the night light on our neighbor���s garage and asked her if that was the light she kept seeing. she said no, grandma that is not the light.  it is much brighter than that.  \r\n\r\nso with the observation of the ���boxed��� shape light and now knowing that it appears at all times during the night, i am not sure  what ���light��� she kept seeing in her room.  i am wondering if the boxed-shape light has anything to do with her fears.  i don���t know! i just don't know.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

in front of and behind it with it staying still the whole time.  the about 10 minutes after first spotting it a cloud moved in front of it and after the cloud went by it was gone and blue on the other side again.  i do not know what exactly we saw but i have never seen anything like it.  it was much brighter than a star.  it was an amazing experience for both of us.\r\n\r\none strange thing is that when i looked at the picture later there is an odd disc shaped object to the right of the light.  we did not see that at the time but we were focused on the light.  the disc shaped object is almost exactly parallel with the light too.  also, if possible, i would like to have someone else's opinion on this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":7875,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0268373,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09102007-0001","longitude":-110.6904371,"occurred":1188786900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

right to left. it looked like a giant light colored donut flying through the sky. it took about 3 seconds for it to cross over. i looked at my cell phone; it was 5:58 am. i knew that if it was a meteor shower there would be more. seconds later, a bright light shot across the sky heading north. it was just a streak of light.\r\n the funny thing is that the first object was heading east or south east, and seemed to zig zag when it was farther away; the second was heading north.  \r\n  the first object was very strange. i couldn't tell if it as glowing or just brightly colored, like a very light orange. at first it looked like a donut, and then it looked like an acorn, then like a donut again. it was very large and at a much lower altitude than the second one. the second seemed to be far up above me moving fast, like a comet; when the first seemed lower and in front of me, and moving much slower than the second.\r\n the whole thing happened so fast. \r\n it was freaky, and kind

relaxing in a rocking chair talking to her while looking out my many windows. i looked to my left towards the river (north) when i noticed a few stars, i saw this white light which looked like a star moving, then it stopped and went out, then all of a sudden it turned into the \"brightest orange solid ball shape\" all the while staying in that same spot. i screamed to my cousin on the phone what i was seeing. then it went out like you turn off a light switch and when it came back on there wewre three of the orange ball shapes.They would do the same go out and come back on. they really put on a show !! all three were in the form of a triangle.Sometimes, the two at the bottom would go up and combine with the one on the top. i have seen ufos before, so i was not really like \"what is that\"? when it finally decided to move on after staying in this same spot for at least 10 minutes, the two at the bottom went up into the top orange ball like and then went back into a whit light like a star and slowly headed to the southeast. i lived two and a half blocks from the river, and it looked to be right over it.I mentioned this to a few people and found out later i wasn't the only one to witness this sighting.I did leave the phone and go outside to watch this and i heard no noise. nothing we have can do what this ufo did that night that is for sure. one of the other ones i seen was in the early evening coming up through a neighbors field. it was early evening and i had went out to check on my young dog and was looking down the gravel road and saw this \"big saucer shape ufo with a dome and windows all around it\", it was moving very slowly,no sound. i thought at first \"what kind of farm machinery is that\", it was so low to the ground. then the closer it got i knew it wasn't anything from out planet !! i ran to the front door and told my then husband \"come fast a ufo\" !!!! we stood there and watched it still coming up the field (and this field was right across our little gravel road). it started to pick up speed as it neared us while lifting up higher and went past us maybe 15 ft off the ground. then we watched it till it got out of sight. i looked at my husband and said \"now don't ever tell me there are no ufos\". it was the year 1976, and i was 27 years old and i am now 59. i have seen other ufos but not at the closeness as these two were. i know there are so many who don't beleive in them, but if they would ever see one they would. i know what i seen was nothing form this earth. what i seen these ufos do, we could not. there is a place they are coming from , but where?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7873,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0175483,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09092007-0005","longitude":-90.4242916,"occurred":1000612800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

son and i were standing outside at night.  it was dark and clear.  we were closing the garden gate.  a movement in the sky came into view, just over the tress and houses across the street. i saw a v-formation of moving objects.  my initial thought was it was a flock of geese.  i alerted my son to look up.  he immediately saw the formation as well.  we both observed approximately five illuminated orbs in the sky approximately sixty feet over head.  they were arranged in a v-formation.  they flew above the trees lining the street.  they flew in formation in a sweeping forward motion moving up, down and at an angle, but always moving forward and maintaining the \"v\" formation. there was no sound.  the objects were illuminated.  my initial thought was how odd it was for geese to be so brightly lit at night by the street lights below.  almost immediately after i thought this, i realized that the light was wrong and these objects were not being lit from below.  i also realized that geese don't usually fly in the dark nor in the undulating pattern that we observed.  also the silence was unusual.  the light was constant and consistent.  each object appeared to be one large, soft light in a white or light yellow hue.  the light did not give off rays or illuminate the street or houses below.  the formation moved quickly up the street and over the trees at the end of the street.  my view of the end of the street was obscured by trees, and thus the formation fell out of my view.   this happened quickly, with a duration of approximately five to ten seconds.  the formation moved from east to west.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
