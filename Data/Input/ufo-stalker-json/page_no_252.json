went to bed around midnight on a summer night i lived in the country i wasn't asleep yet i did close my eyes for a few minutes then was abruptly woken by what sounded like  military helicopter blades making that low loud sound. i know this sound since my husband used to be in the army. this sound was low above my roof i really thought that troopers were going to propel onto my roof shortly. the sound of the blades whooshing with that low slow sound kept me up. i looked out of my bedroom windows trying to see this object but i couldn't see anything. i noticed no tree branches or bushes were moving. there was no wind at all. this sound lasted a good 20 minutes or more. my husband said he did not hear it. i tried to wake him but he was groggy. after this sound stopped quickly. i suddenly ran out my front door in the front yard stepping back to get a good view of my whole house looking up in the sky. nothing was there just silence. it was a summer clear night out and i could see my house. the next morning while still in bed on my back i was awoken by severe pain. i turned back my cover. it was very painful also with burning pain. i noticed i had several odd shaped indentation marks that looked pressed in. within these shapes i noticed pin holes. i quickly grabbed my cell phone and took four photos. i was baffled by the whole thing. i was scared. i couldn't believe my husband didn't hear it. it was so loud i also thought it's going to land on the roof. i will never forget that night. it was so strange. my bed was vibrating during the event. i just remembered.\r\n\r\nthank you","distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

without any movement. the orange orb then just blinked off and disappeared. i stood there looking in the same area of the sky hoping that it would appear again. then a couple of minutes later to my

could have been the same orange orb that had just disappeared from the right of me. had the orange orb translocated and then appeared to the left of me? the yellow orb was getting brighter and now had a orange tinge to the bottom of it. i quickly took a photograph and with that the yellow orb just disappeared. what could this mean? i believe that there is an intelligence behind these orbs and that intelligence wanted their presence known and each time the orb had appeared they had stay there long enough for me to take a photograph of them. it very strange. the two photograph were taken on the

orange lights that were together in shape of triangle above the mountains toward the east and north of florence az and west of superior az. the lights seemed to be stationary, but would disappear randomly then reappear a few seconds later in the same spot. this went on for about 30 seconds. then i turned north on highway 79. i could not see the lights driving this direction. then i turned east onto highway 60 to go toward superior az and about 1 or 2 miles on highway 60 i  saw the 3 lights in approximately the same spot before, but they were much brighter, still stationary, together in triangle shape, fading out and back in randomly. i watched these lights for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. then all disappeared. i had gone through superior az and turned south on highway 177 to go home to kearny, then about 1 mile on highway 177 i saw 1 orange light to the southeast and observed it for about 20 seconds. this light was dim and may have been traveling very slowly, but i believe it was stationary over mountains south of what is called apache leap. the light disappeared and i did not observe anymore lights on way home, which is 22 miles . this was on the night of april 12, 2017 around 8:45pm.\r\nthen on the night of april 13,2017 i took the same route from san tan valley and observed 1 light again. the time was a little later, about 9pm driving east on arizona farms road toward highway 79 . the light was dim but still orange in color i observed it for about 10 seconds and it disappeared. i did not see any more lights until i was about 1 mile west of superior az and i saw a white light travel from south to north over picket post mountain. it lasted about 5 seconds. i think it may have been a meteor. am not sure. on april 12 and 13th  sighting, i thought it might have been some kind of national guard nighttime manuevers. was not able to confirm. i have an open mind about ufos and am excited about the prospect of a real ufo sighting. thank you for your interest and i truly hope i have not was wasted your time.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

on the left of the second. a few seconds, maybe 5 or so, and the two disappeared.  another 15 or 20 seconds or so passed, when the same looking lights, did the same sequence again, but more to the left of where they were just the previous time. i don't know what these lights were, at the time i was trying to rationalize them out, but they didn't seem like any kind of aircraft i have seen. i even thought maybe they were fireworks, but i didn't hear any sound, and there was not a trail or explosion.  i pulled over, and stayed parked on the side of the road for another 5 minutes or so, hoping to see them again. me and my son (i pointed them out to him and he saw the second set of three lights) were excited, and we were really hoping to see some more. i was hoping to be able to record them so i can show someone what i saw. but they didn't come back when we were parked there.

cigarette. as i was outside i witnessed a large object with 3 white lights. these lights were connected by a very dull grey outline, which led me to believe that they were connected somehow.\r\n\r\nfrom my vantage point, it was a solid round object with three lights on the outer rim. i repeatedly told my girlfriend how huge it was.\r\n\r\nthe object was massive. hold arms in front of you and put pointer fingers out and up 5 inches apart. that was the size.\r\n\r\nthe object was not very bright, but the 3 lights were very solid and consistent. no other colors present. it hovered, and i tried to film, but hit the picture button a took a picture instead of filming video. damn.\r\n\r\ni have a picture. my girlfriend came out to see what i was talking about as i thought i was talking and filming at the same time. i was trying to say the direction and details as i was filming, and she pointed out that camera was not filming.\r\n\r\ni was angry and frustrated.\r\n\r\nat this point i got online to fill out this form to get it all down before my memory failed of the details.\r\n\r\nin closing. the object was huge. not a meteor, planet or satellite. it was  large lights with a true large radius. way bigger than any planet. maybe the size of the moon, but there was three of them.\r\n\r\n-jared","distance":"Over One
