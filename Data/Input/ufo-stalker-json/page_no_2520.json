were driving on interstate 680 north. as we were passing dublin we noticed a strange object in the sky that had multiple lights rotating around on what seems to be a disc. what caught my attention were these lights. it was evident that we were not the only ones that noticed it because drivers were swirving and pressing thier brakes to witness the object. there were a number of cars that pulled over and some were even taking pictures. when i first seen the object i thought it was a blimp because it was hovering and moving slowly. but i have never seen a blimp with lights around it in that fashion. the rotations of the lights were irratic and did not have a pattern. they were yellow and bright. directly above the rotating lights was a single white light situated in the middle. after about 20 minutes of hovering the object began to move away in a quick manner. i noticed that the object then made an abrupt move downward in an angle as if it was going to land. the object did not land but was relatively lower in altitude than when first seen. after a couple minutes the object shot across the sky in a zip zag manner at the speed of a shooting star till it can not be seen. after this event my girlfriend an i were amazed at what we had just witnessed. we are now firm believers of ufos.","distance":"Over One

came outside the object had passed...But i got a quick look at it before i ran inside and got my camera.  i have a 12 power optical zoom on my digital camera and i was able to zoom in and get several pictures.  i wish i'd been there and saw what they saw from the beginning.  it had shining lights.  the kids were outside playing and it came out of nowhere.  tony looked up and saw something very strange and asked debbie what it was.  debbie had no idea.  her husband leonard, who is a retired air force jet mechanic also had no idea what the object might be.  there was no noise, no smoke, no chemical trails, no vibration of any kind coming from the object.  it was very peaceful.  there was a clear window on the object but no beings were seen.  lights shined brightly and evenly and changed colors from white to red to blue to green to pink to red...And the last color was a big bright orange.  at first they thought it might be a helicopter or a remote control plane or a glider because there was no motor.  the object was shaped like half of the yellow submarine from the beatles...With a window on the front and a metal rod coming out of the bottom.  it was silver and metalic bright blue.  my neighbor debbie had been talking about ufos just before the sighting occured.  it floated evenly with a constant speed in a straight line.  we all felt very peaceful during the sighting, and were all shocked and in utter awe,  we'd never seen anything like it in our lives.  the object floated way off into the distance until it was just a spot of flashing orange light and then it

to see so many white fluffy clouds still floating around, the moon was behind one of these clouds so i stood waiting. the moon was full and giving off a lot of light even though it was behind a cloud. i could see the white and blue lights of at least six airplanes at different heights. three going in a north direction and two going south. one a south west direction. then a beam of light shot through the sky from a very huge cloud,i couldn't see a structure just the beam and then a second one.The first beam lit on one of the planes going north then went directly to a second plane going north. the plane turned toward the west and the light beam went back to the other plane,which was pretty far away and had climbed very high, at this point it was hard to make out his lights. the beam of light then immediatly pulled off of that plane and went to a plane that was just barely south of winamac but climbing very high. the beam of light stayed on this plane untill a cloud passed over it, the plane now behind the cloud. i could no longer hear the plane as it had climbed too high, because of the cloud i couldn't see the plane. but the beam of light seemed to stay fixed behind the cloud. the light from this beam seemed to go out but left a trail of mist or vapor or something because after several minutes it began to break up and the light was gone. the thing that got me was the beam of light, when on the airplanes, wasn't shining past the planes.The second beam of light was coming from the same cloud but was shining toward the south and upward on another airplane that was out of my sight in just a couple of minutes because it seemed to be going straight up. the second beam stayed on that one airplane untill it to went out and left a trail of something misty like the first beam. these light beams came on at the same time and went out at the same time coming from the same cloud. i heard no sound from that cloud, it was

town to the city center. i live south of the city center. as we were driving over the causeway, i happened to glance towards the area where my house was. i saw what i first thought to be an over sized balloon. once i took a second look, i noticed that it was cylinder shaped and was perfectly vertical. it looked either silver or maybe reflective. there were no noticeable markings, it looked pretty plain. from the distance, it did not look any taller that 30-35 feet in height. at this point in time it looked as though it was right over my house, about 1 km away. i owned a digital video recorder and asked my aunt who was driving at the time to hurry so that i could get home and film it. as i watched it as we crossed the causeway, it moved towards the south/east direction to another part of town call \"redhead\". the object looked as though it was only 100 feet above the houses at the time. this was my perspective from the causeway. i told my wive that it could not have been a balloon as i first thought because it did not \"tumble and roll with the wind\". i saw nothing hanging from it to make me think of it being any type of balloon and it stayed perfectly verticle as it moved towards redhead. i live near the end of the south end and there is water (bay of fundy?) which we have a ferry to take passengers to nova scotia. so, when i finally got back to the house, the object was still in view but looked as though it was either over the bay or over redhead. i ran up to the house and grabbed my digital camcorder. by the time i got back out side, i tried to zoom in on the object but like most sightings on film, the power lines which run up my street, made the camera hard to focus on the object. the auto focus kept focusing on the power lines.\r\nby the time when i tried to get some video of it, it looked to be maybe a couple thousand feet away. it continued towards redhead and went higher into the clouds. i took what video i had and uploaded it to my computer i was only able to save one frame that had a half decent shot of the object. i ended up sending it to a few of my friends but they really could not make out what the object was. \r\n\r\nrecently while at work, one of my clients was watching a show about ufo sightings. as i sat down with him, i could not believe that i saw the exact shaped object as i had seen a few years earlier. the picture was taken outside of canada. up until now i never talked about it to anyone except family and friends. i'm a very level headed person and even though i enjoy sci-fi and types of documentaries about ufo's, i was a bit of a sceptic up to the day that i actually saw one for myself. seeing the same object on tv convinced me that i was not hallucinating that afternoon.  \r\n\r\nthe photo attached is not the one i took but it looks exactly the same as i saw it. my first view was much closer. over the last couple years, my computer has been formated and any video i had back then has been lost.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

on the history chanel from the 1970's and this reminded me of the event. there were 3 primary witnesses and 2 secondary witnesses. the primary were: robert garner, william grifith and myself. secondary witnesses were rob kaydo and georgia lloyd.\r\n\r\nthe primary witnesses were shooting bats which were flying around a street light which illuminated our yard. our house was located on state road about 1/8 mile north of boughner road in trumbull township south of geneva ohio. we were standing in the driveway under the street light talking when i looked up and noticed a stationary round object hovering aproximately 2000' above us. i would guess the object was 50'-75' in diameter. it was white luminous similar to the street light but not casting light onto the ground. we watched the object for a short time and mr. kaydo who was walking down the road overheard our conversation and also noticed the object. i called to georgia lloyd (my mother) to come out and see what was hovering. she ignored my calls several times before walking out through the covered porch to where she could see the object. the object began to move due north when i first called for georgia to come out of the house. there was no noise and no noticable vapor trail. by the time georgia got outside the house (approximate walking distance 20' the object was barely visable.\r\n\r\ni would estimate the object accelerated beyond 1000m/h in a smooth rapid motion. a very interesting event followed, what appeared to be two f-4 phantoms came from the southwest and took the same northbound flightpath the object took. afterburners were clearly visible in the night sky when they flew over. i am an avid fan of aircraft and wanted to be a pilot when i was in highschool. poor vision kept me out of rotc.\r\n\r\nthe dates are guesses and the year was either 1977 or 1978 as i didn't yet have my drivers license. the night was brisk and the sky clear. i have no idea how long the object hovered over us before we noticed it. it remained stationary for some time and appeared to be observing us. if you can check records from any local airforce bases from this timeframe you might be able to zero in on the exact date, that is if the flight records are available.\r\n\r\ni don't believe the object was man-made. the acceleration rate was too great and the object was totally silent. the 2 airforce jets that flew over were definitely not silent! we were somewhat spooked by the event but i would say curiosity was the primary feeling at the time and still is.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

while on guard at an entry control point in baghdad, some lights where noticed doing unusual things over the greenzone. myself and a number of other soldiers witnessed the event from our post on the 14th july bridge.\r\nthe bridge is a checkpoint which screens traffic and personnel comming into the greenzone from the southern bank of of the tigris.\r\n air traffic is constantly present in the area of the sighting. at any given time one can expect to see various types of helicopters, flares, even rockets and mortars, along with the usual tracer fire. i am well familiar with all aspects of these occurances and there appearance.\r\n as the pace of work on a checkpoint is quit busy, when i first noticed the object i dismissed it instantly. due to the set up of the control point we were facing south into the city for security purposes, having the allready secure greenzone on our back to the north. it looked alot like a flare at first.\r\n a flare can come in many types, the type that this craft most resembled was a parachute illumination flare. this type of flare is quite brite and can hang in the air for up to a couple minutes. typically such devices are luanched via artillary. norally the flare will appear simingly from now where and then gently desend under the drag of its parachute, finnaly dimming out into nothing. close up a parachute can be seen as well as smoke and the noticable downward and side to side movement. farther away these effects are less and less noticable.\r\n when i first saw it i was simply turning around to do something and noticed it at about 800 meters out and 200 feet up, directly over a traffic circle in the greenzone. i turned back around and went back to searching vehicles. about a half hour later i was relieved so that i could eat. i walked back away from the search area to a bunker which was a little removed from the action but still on the bridge. as i dug in to eat i looked up to see the same type of light hovering over the greenzone. it appeared to be in more or less the same position as earlier.\r\n this is when i began to think it strange. a flare would have distinguished its flame long ago. besides at this distance now that i was paying attention i could see it was definately not a flare, or a rocket, or a helicopter, or an airplane. it sat there fixed totally still and silent. i noticed that if i moved from one side of the bridge to the other my perspective changed. it definately had a fixed point in the sky, not to far away. it was at first a pinkish orange in appearance and looked from what i could tell to be the size of a 5o gal. drum. it was completely spherical and seemed to have a sort of illuminated gas collecting around it. as i watched the thing it slowly started to transform.\r\n i got the attention of my nco and asked him what he thought of it. he stated matter of factly that he didn't know. we had all seen some crazy shit thus far and evidently he wasn't all that impressed by this either.\r\nhe dismissed it much as i had when i first saw it. as he went about his business i continued to watch the thing. the pinkish haze that enveloped the orange ball of light started slowly to take on a brighter hugh. it was as if it was condensing. the center of it seemed to get brighter as well. now i could see clearly the thing was changing.\r\n as the hazy shroud began to disapear completely the ball went from orange\r\nto a deep and ominous tone of red, all the while it seemed to shrink in size. ultimately having about the size and shape of a basketball. this was something i had never seen before. something very strange happened as it was doing this too. just as it was about to turn completely from a gasy orange pinkish color into a deep red, it started to woble slightly. it was completely motionless up until this point, as if it were set in stone. but now as it began to wobble the city lights in the area flickered, this of course is totally normal for baghdads broken electrical infrasructure. however the wierd part is our gas generated flood light we use to light up the search area flickered too.\r\n again i called my squad leader.\r\n\"hey, now look at it, its moving!\"\r\nas it floated to the west the lights of the buildings beneath it actually got slightly brighter.\r\nmy squad leader walked over to a hum-v and got out the hand mic. he was calling up the activity to or command. his exact words were, \"theres a ufo in the greenzone\" he was asked if he had enough sleep and if aside from the ufo was everything under control. it was so that was the last we talked to higher about it.\r\n the light began to climb strait up, very slowly in a strait line, strait up. as it ascended i saw what looked like a couple of smaller white orb type things, which were brighter and higher up. they moved like a house fly would, in eratic and jerky movements, back and forth. then as the the red ball got to a hight of about 600 feet it just blinked out. this finally got a little reaction out of my squad leader.Thinking the show was over i went back to my position to relieve the next guy to eat. after the shift we all went back to our compound.\r\n\r\nwhile getting ready to rack out at almost three in the morning we gathered a few of us around a table to smoke ciggarettes and burn of the days anxiety. not everyone saw the thing, some of the newer guys thought we had made it up to fuck with them. all together only 5 people i know of saw it, myself included. each of us saw pretty much the same thing. some saw similar activity at differnt times of the night, but we all agreed it was the same thing. the soldier who sat down to eat after me said he saw it cruise up and down the river only feet of the surface of the water. he said after a few minutes of bobbing around on near the water it stopped a minute and then just shot up like it was fired from a cannon only without any sound or arc to its trajectory.\r\n all the people who saw these things are experienced judges of distances and reliable witnesses, who have far better things to do than look for ufo's especially while in iraq. all of us are also very familliar with all known types of aircraft and pyrotechnics that one might mistake for a ufo. i believe what we saw that night was something not of this world checking up on the war in iraq. who knows mabey bush makes headlines on\r\nplanet x as well as here on earth.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7785,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.33958,"location":null,"logNumber":"IQ-08292007-0005","longitude":44.421169,"occurred":1074232800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Baghdād","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1074232800000,"summary":"Observation

habit of going out to the balcony at night just to view the stars, relax or watch airplanes flying over or just get fresh air. i live in an area where planes fly over all the time as they make their descent towards pearson international airport so i'm familiar with how a plane looks like and sounds like at night.\r\n\r\nthere were a few clouds in the sky and just like any ordinary night, i went out to the balcony to relax and watch this particularly bright star up in the northeast direction. then at 12:10 a.M., i saw someting at the left of the star and i thought it could just be another airplane. as it moved closer, i noticed that there were no lights pulsing / blinking anywhere it and it looked opaque and grayish white. despite some cloudcover, this thing stood out because the clouds appeared reddish due to light pollution. i waited for the typical jet sounds but there was none, it was silent.\r\n\r\nthis thing moved faster than most landing jets. the flying object is almost over me now that i have to tilt my head up. then i noticed that this object   looked oval and it seemed to be rotating in its axis that it looked liked it's triangular-oval. still no signs of lights or sounds from the object. then it made a swift and sharp turn to the left, got lightly obscured by clouds then it reappeared and hovered on one spot. it still looked liked it was rotating on it's axis. it hovered for several minutes then it moved slowly to the left and just simply vanished, not into the clouds but its just disppeared in a small clear patch of sky between the clouds. it was now 12:35 a.M.  \r\n\r\nbefore i decided to report this, i thought of several things that i could closely identify the object with:\r\n\r\n1. a jet or airplane - most jets have rhythmic blinking lights on their wings and tails. this thing however showed no lights or sound at all.\r\n\r\n2. migratory birds - i do see some birds flying over sometimes and i could make out their wings flapping. the object i saw was solitary and it was rotating on it's axis and it hovered on one spot at one point.\r\n\r\n3. kite or some wind-blown object - i ruled this out because it wasn't windy that night at all. the clouds were steady and any wind blown object could not hover and move across the sky all at the same time.\r\n\r\nfast info:\r\naug. 27, 2007 (12:10 - 12:35 a.M.)\r\n\r\nweather: calm with few clouds, stars still visible. clouds appeared reddish due to light pollution.\r\n\r\nobject sighted: north east near a bright star (capella?) just slightly lower from the constellation perseus.\r\n\r\nobject characteristic: opaque. grayish white, generally oval (a bit triangular), fast moving, spinning on axis and has the ability to hover and make sharp changes in direction. no

(=lunar diameter) and 60 minutes.  diameter seemed about 1/10 to 1/12 of length. there were no visible head, tail, fins, wings, etc.; however i had a visual impression of ridges or nodes between each pair of lights.  typing colons separated by capital letter \"i's\" gives the idea,\r\n\r\n                        :i:i:i:i:i:i:i:i:\r\n\r\nbut the nodes had less \"tittle\" (head & tail of the vertical \"i\") and were symmetrically placed, unlike this typing which shows the \"i\" taller than the colons.  while it's possible the nodes were a visual artifact, i'd vote 60/40 for objective vision.\r\n\r\nits ~45 degree straight-line motion was close to due northward, roughly on a line (depending on altitude) from mt. hood to mt. adams, and carried it partway toward the nw horizon into an area of hazier night sky.  i lost sight of it then, after 5 seconds observation, and i'm unable to say whether it faded out in the haze or suddenly disappeared --- a tree blocked view momentarily.  i'm accustomed to aerial observation, have 20/20 vision, do not use any type of intoxicant, was instantly awake and alert for this observation, and have a long track record of rapid, accurate identification of flying birds, aircraft, etc.  i'm fairly confidant in my rough estimates of object and motion arc-length, relative length & breadth of object, duration of observation, and sky location of object.  estimate of altitude (2-10 miles) is much more of a guess and is the main variable in trigonometrically estimating length of object, velocity of motion, etc. the most conservative estimates yield an object length of 130' and velocity of 600 mph; the high end estimates give figures 10x greater.  but without someone else's observation from a different location (allowing triangulation, and correction of observer subjectivity), this is all rough guesswork.  \r\n\r\ni've wondered if this could've been a jetliner with two rows of lighted fuselage windows visible; but such an aircraft would have to fly upside down, or more exactly, with myself directly dorsal to the plane, to make both rows of window lights visible.  most unlikely, and a conventional jet/rocket/propeller driven aircraft of that arclength would've made plenty of noise; and this object was utterly silent.  its wings would've blocked out starfields (whereas i only observed the pipe-shaped \"fuselage\" blocking out stars), & of course there were no navigation/running lights. \r\n\r\ni wrote down my observations in the minutes after sighting.  as this is the second ufo sighting in my life (3/1981 was the previous one), i was not worked up or excited by this event, but it sure grabbed my attention, and i reviewed my visual memories many times.  later in the night,i did have a brief but strange dream.  the rough trigonometry came a couple of days later.     \r\n  ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":7776,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5945645,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08282007-0013","longitude":-121.1786823,"occurred":1186131600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1186131600000,"summary":"Pencil shaped ufo moving due north in straight line, in cloudless starry sky; 2  longitudinal rows of white lights (approx. 9 pairs);  noiseless.","tags":["lights","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"The Dalles, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:446249"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Calgary","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at work (working nights)unloading one of our paint booths i was looking at the sky (which i do from time to time) when i noticed this circle object in the sky. i thought it was a satellite moving across the sky so i kept my eye on it for about 10 secs when out of no where it took off so fast it turned into a flash of blueish green and then just dissapeared into the sky.
