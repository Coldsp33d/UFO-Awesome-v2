about three thrity am, the stars were fully out and we were in an area where there were no nearby lights, so there was a very clear view of the sky and the first ufo we saw was very far out and was traveling extreamly fast it was glowing all kinds of colors as it passed quickly through. we saw at least 10 different ufo's during this particular phase of the moon when it became fully darkened by some sort of lunar eclipse and the sky was extreamly clear to see all the stars.Each ufo we saw was star like, some traveling fast  all were headed in a single straight line, never making any manuvers, some dissappeared as we watched others continued on their own little routes to wherever. the one that really caught everyons attention was just like the others, but seemed to be traveling toward our direction, it was coming along and just flared up firey orangish reddish color very bright, enough to make all of us go \"whoah\" then quickly switched directions, and go back the way it came, glittering as it went. we kept seeing these little stars, some closer than others, all traveling on a single line course, we werent sure if these could be satallites or not, we saw ten or more of these. none close enough to get a good description of the shape of the ufo, but all equally spectacular in itself. the spectical continued until the sun began to rise and the stars faded, and we all felt extreamy lucky to have witnessed all this activity that went on during this three hour period of time.. \r\n

july 2005, 2 days before my 21st birthday.  i was staying at a friends trailer off baseline rd. in boulder, co  we (my friend, i, and another acquaintance) were all drinking that night.  we were bored and decided to go camping.  my buddy had everything we needed already so we loaded up his pickup and headed out to nederland, co via hwy 119.  my friend said he knew a good spot, that's why we went to nederland, but when we got there, he couldn't find it.  we ended up taking a road into the mountains, looking for a suitable camping spot.  about 2-4 miles outside of nederland we found a spot, it was dark but we set up the tent (took about an hour to do)  and started a small campfire. we talked and cooked something on the fire (hot dogs, brats, something of that nature) for a few hours.  i remember my buddy telling me something about satanic cults in this part of colorado that have shrines or whatever in the woods.  then the other guy with us said something like \"holy shit!, look! look at that!\" he pointed to a bright sphere in the sky.  it was about 3:00am when i saw it, it was very bright and seemed to have 2 colors present, white light, and a red or purple.  the next thing i knew we were all sitting around the campfire as before.  i felt very tired all of the sudden, i looked at my watch and it was 6 something am.  i felt dumbfounded, it seemed like i just checked my watch and it was ~2:50am.  i went to bed.  the next morning we discussed it, none knew what really happened, none could explain the missing 3-something hours.  we all knew we had witnessed something out of this world.\r\n\r\nin the weeks after the event i must have gone over it in my mind a million times.  i couldn't find any answers, and i put it out of my mind.  it's only recently that i've been researching what happened that night to a large extent.  i believe my companions and i were abducted by aliens.  i am considering undergoing hypnosis to retrieve the memories, but i'm not sure i want them.  i have since lost touch with the other two men there tonight and have tried in vain to contact them.

(they had) and let my dog relieve herself.  it was predawn and it was partly cloudy. i saw a golden orange light that i thought might be a police helicopter searchlight moving in from the se but the light was too large and the wrong color and there was no sound or other running lights.  the light moved rapidly up and diminished to a size slightly larger than jupitor or venus entering and exiting the clouds.  it seemed to stop relative to my hand(the clouds were moving) for 4 to 5 seconds at one point and then moved higher and to the n-nw overhead to diminish until gone in a clear area of sky. \r\n the only possible thing i thought it might be was a light fastened to a balloon though some of the movements appeared to go against the wind and it moved rapidly up rather than across the sky as balloons usually do when caught by upper level winds. i felt the light was eerie and was strangly thrilled when seeing it.\r\n it did come from the direction of davis/monthan air force base, though.\r\n the date is approxmate but i know it was a friday night/saturday morning and the time is nearly correct as there was a power outage and the clocks were stopped at that time. incidently, the power came on about a 10 seconds after i lost sight of the object.  my girlfriend saw the light once it was higher in the sky until it faded from view overhead.  \r\n last month she had gone outside and saw two stationary \"stars\" suddenly move around each other as if \"they were on a tether\" and then move away in opposite directions.  she called me outside and i only saw two lights

researchers seek 'the truth' \r\n \r\nhttp://news.Yahoo.Com/s/space/uforesearchersseekthetruth;_ylt=a0wtuedosnfg1t8aab8plbif\r\n \r\nif you are seeking the truth about ufo's here it is:\r\n \r\ni am writing to tell you my eyewitness experience of seeing the phoenix lights.  i was driving west on mcdowell road coming over the hills where the road goes by papago park in phoenix, az.  it was early evening, and visibility was excellent as the city throws off so much light.  as i came over the hills i saw them.  at first i thought it was a plane, because like many witnesses said, it was flying in a v formation.  i thought it was odd because it was flying so low and that something was not right for the plane to be flying that close to the ground in the city.  on closer inspection, you could see the v was not perfectly formed like it would have been if the lights had been on the edges of wings.  more importantly, there was nothing material around the lights.  i could see this plainly, and i could see this clearly.  it was more like an uneven formation of flying birds - only in this case lights. you could see different lights from different angles and the same lights from different angles as they flew overhead, and there was nothing material around any of them. many people thought it was a giant flying triangular shaped object because they assumed there was something behind the lights which there wasn't.  whether it was alien or governmental research craft i do not know.  but i do know they were not conventional aircraft of any kind.  the lights were low enough and traveling slow enough that i could have seen any solid objects.  they were traveling too slowly to be conventional aircraft.  if they had been aircraft they would have had to be outfitted with a globular light around the whole craft and then they could not fly if surrounded by a sphere.  the lights did not even look big enough to contain either a comercial or private plane in them. i watched it for several minutes and continued driving on my way.\r\n \r\ni think that if some craft are composed of energy, that could explain their ability to change direction suddenly if they had no mass.  also, if they had no mass and could travel at the speed of light, that would explain there ability to \"appear\" and \"disappear\":  if they shifted to that speed, they could leave your field of vision so quickly that you could simply could not follow them although an alternative possibility is that they have inter dimensional travel.\r\n \r\nsincerely,\r\nrichard a. wolfe      \r\n","distance":"101-500

\r\nreturning from a climb in the sandia mountains, albuquerque.\r\n\r\nwe were returning from a climb in the sandia mountain and when arriving in the foothills of the mountaina i decided to take a panoramic picture of the sandias. at that time i was not looking at the sky. i took a first picture of the mountains to the north west then, 9s later i took another picture of the mountains toward a summit called south-peak. i did not notice anything because i was looking at the mountain and not at the sky.\r\n\r\ni didn't look at my picture before i was back in france were i was living at that time. since 2002, i use to spend vacation in albuquerque were i have friends who are mountains lovers and hikers and good climbers. \r\n\r\nwhen i looked at the sandia mountains pictures, i noticed on one of them a small spot. i magnified the picture (1600x1200pixels)and realized that there was some kind of blue-grey rectangle centered in the upper part of the picture. my first reaction was to consider it as a speckle, this kind of electronic parasites you got sometimes on digital picture. however when magnifying the picture, it seemed that the rectangle had some kind of thickness. then as the sandia laboratories are very close from the sandia mountains, in fact they are located just behind the airport, south of the sandias and close to the manzano mountains, i came to the point that it might be the result of a laser projection test. knowing that the laboratories might be working on high power laser (some of the seniors hikers of the mountain club were former scientists at the laboratory)i thought it could be a reasonnable answer. but another option came to my mind regarding the inversion of temperature well known in this part of albuquerque and that could lead to some weather phenomena...\r\n\r\nso far i don't have a real idea of what this blue-grey rectangle could have been. but i remember another rectangle seen high in the sky of paris\r\nin winter time and that was following a straight path over the house,until i lost it. the celling was cloudy and high and the rectangle was under it. this was at my sister's home and my brother in law concluded that it was probably a sheet of metal or other material flying in the air carried away by the wind; the weather was actually a stormy weather but it was not raining. i had another sighting experience in the sixtees, i was i think in my fifties: spheric and metallic object, no noise, low altitude, took elevation. no wind. other witnesses considered the object being a balloon.\r\n\r\nattached are the picture of the sighting (029), and the picture (028) took 9 seconds before. no picture of the mountains was taken after that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7752,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0901209,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262007-0003","longitude":-106.6465367,"occurred":1115488800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

wide on the oregon california border about 50 miles inland from ocean. it was almost every night during the summer of 1968 and 1969 we would see theses ships sitting up on the ridge in the treeline at least 2 - 5 ships almost every night as a child i didnt know it was abnormal as all the people i was with were into the hippy thing so it was never scary to me . on the night i saw one it was sitting up on the ridge about 2 miles from me and i was riding my bike up the road with a woman who was with me we had left a party and i was riding her home on my new bike. all of the sudden one of the ufos does like a l shaped approach it comes off the mou8ntain and down into the valley and comes right up to us. it sits there hovering above our head for about 15-30 seconds. and then it retraces its path in an l shape backward and to the side and goes back up on the ridge line and sits with the other ships there i want to say there was about 4-6 ships there that night. i have never forgotten this incident and it was a nightly occurance to see these ships everynight all summer long they would sit and watch us . and we would watch them as far as i know we were never harmed although i sometimes wonder if they did do something to us . i never have felt normal like i fitted in with society. but thats my account of the event as i saw it from the eyes of a 7 year old oh its measurement was approx 50-75 feet around and to me it was a big circular globe that had the same irridecense as the moon it glowed bright white like the moon no flashing lights no windows just bright white balloon perfect circle and it was fast it moved 2-4 miles in a matter of 3 seconds. i am willing to talk to anyone about this so feel free to ask me anything. thanks for letting me share my interaction with you. i was elated after it came and looked at us i felt like it was saying hello . i never felt to scared i mean im sure i was but it wasnt a really like screaming crying thing it only lasted a second

to see if i could catch the last few perseid meteors.  i was facing n/ne.  my view was approx 180 degrees.  big dipper was on my far left.  cassiopeia/perseus slight left in my field of view.  arrived approx 8:30 p.M.  caught the last part of sunset and the stars came out.  weather was mild and a clear, cloudless summer evening.  lots of air traffic, all planes, etc. had lights that blink either white or with red lights.\r\n\r\nevent began about 9:40 p.M.  had seen approx 3 perseid meteors (2 quickies, 1 earth-grazer with nice tail.)  approx. 3 satellites, and many airplanes.\r\n\r\ntwo lights caught my eye to my left from low in the horizon at the bottom of the big dipper.  the lights were star-like but much brighter than any other object in the sky at the time.  i thought the lights were possibly air traffic initially, i kept waiting to see the blinking red or white lights that planes exhibit.  no lights ever flashed from these objects.  they moved very slowly across the sky.  they stayed low in my line of sight, moving from left to right across my line of sight from big dipper through the top edge of perseus, etc.  as the lights moved out of the big dipper, they changed position from one above the other (about four fingers width at arms lenght) to one leading and one following directly behind.  \r\n\r\nit was very quiet that night, little wind, sound of the falls clearly heard down below.  sounds of jets and other air traffic clearly heard.  that is what got my attention initially.  these objects made no sound, did not have safety lights flashing, and were not following the air traffic pattern i had observed to that point that night going into and out of the avl airport.  also they seemed to move with a deliberate slowness.\r\n\r\nthe two moved slowly and i felt they slowed even more as i became aware of them, as if they were deliberately trying to engage my senses.  i felt my adrenaline response (fight or flight) surge.  the objects seemed to challenge me in a menacing way.  i am a born-again christian and while beleiving of course in the supernatural, i also fear nothing of satan and his demons.  i do believe that people do see ufos, ghosts, etc. but that they are simply a deceptive tool used by satan to confuse and ensare the unsaved.  i beleieve this ufo deception will play a key role very soon in world affairs.\r\n\r\nin any event, i felt a surge of courage and boldness from the holy spirit within to challenge these lights with the truth of jesus.  i shouted out to the lights that i did not fear them, that they had control over me, that jesus would return soon to establish his kingdom forever, that they (the demonic spirits) would be thrown in the lake of fire soon, and that i was commanding them in strenghth through the lord jesus that they be gone immediately so they may not decieve anyone else skywatching that night.\r\n\r\nstrangely or appropriately enough depending on your view, the lights faded in strength for about 5 seconds and then promptly dissapeared/dissolved  and did not return for the rest of the time i stayed at the overlook that night when i left at approx. 11:30 p.M.\r\n\r\ni felt invigorated by the experience but also needed to calm down a bit too.  i have never in 15 years of a christian walk ever felt like i was directly involved in any kind of \"spiritual warfare\" kind of event.  i was joyful because the holy spirit gave me strenght, calm, courage, and boldness to stand up to ufo forces that often fill people with dread, uncertainty, fear, and anxiety.  the fact that they disappeared from the sky at my command through the lord's power was amazing, but on the other hand i expected to be victorious over the powers/lights of demonic ufo deception the moment i spoke commanding them to be gone form their deceptive mission that night.\r\n\r\nit was an unusual evening.  i have spent at least 3-4 nights per week star-gazing on the brp and at max patch since june 2007 and have seen my share of meteors, satellites, airplanes, jets, props, helis, etc.  i know every microwave tower, cell tower, etc. from the overlooks that i frequent.  the lights/ufos that i saw wednesday were like nothing i have seen.  they were not flashy, hollywood-style ufos.  in fact, most of the jets and other air traffic that night had much more in the way of speed/flashing lights, etc. than the two ufo lights that i saw.  the main thing was that they slowed down intentionally to me, almost flaunting themselves to challenge my rational notions.  they seemed to consciously challenege me mentally.  there were no voices in my head or that were audible, but there was a definite menancing challenge and hubris to the ufo lights toward me.  it was as if they had other plans and people to go out and decieve, and they hadn't counted on me seeing them any more than i had expected to see them when i drove up that night.  it was like two thieves casing a house or something and i was the law enforcement that stumbled in on a criminal act.  we each faced each other down, but my authority given through jesus made them flee at my command.  that part of the whole experience (which lasted no more than 4 minutes) was the most uncanny feeling; the ufo lights dissolved at my command, not before, not after, but at exactly after i commanded the lights to be gone, they immediateley dissolved.

on our yard her tending the flowers i the lawn and trees.About 1:30 pm i was on the noth/west side of the house when my  wife came w/a  glass of lemonade,and we took a break, and started to admire some cloud formations,and tried to find figures in them,(this is our personal game when we travel) also we notice at least six airplanes lining up heading west  to lax for landing,some times we see up to nine, all of a sudden from behind a cloud above us, we noticed a metalic silver sphere it was way up cant say how high but it was up there just floathing, i streched my arm and placed nine of my fingers together above the plane flying over us ,when  the sphere was above the plane,it looked as big as the tail end of the plane,this lasted about a minute and a half,i ran inside to grab my camera when i came back about forty five seconds later,the sphere was shining like a light bulb,just when i turned my camera on and tried to focus ,it moved so fast in a north/ east direction and dissapeared,by the way it came from the west/ and stood there when first seen,it was a sunny hot day and a few white clouds in the beautiful blue sky , i was exited,so was my wife for i had told her that i had seen a  gold colored sphere a few moths back when i was at work in the city of downey about five miles from where we live,this time the two of us got to share this sigthing,this was the fourth or fifth for my wife and the ten plus for me. we have seen the normal cigar ,saucer,a couple of strange shapes , the famous black helicopters with no markings just a red light on the bottom, small super fast  lighted objects about the size of a humming bird ,a meteor looked so big ten or more times the size of what is normaly seen, and now the spheres i wish someone will be able to explain all this some day ,while this happens we will continue to glance at the sky whenever possible.Thank you for your time,","distance":"501 Feet - 1

now. i got angry at my parents because they would not let me go to town. i walked back about 300 yards into the pasture and sat down next to a little pot hole where they dug a whole for coal testing. it was just now getting dark and i could see the stars. i was sitting north and looking at the north star when suddenly i noticed it moving and coming tuwards me and getting closer. i remember thinking that it wasn't the north star, it was something else, and it was getting closer to me by the minute. i watched it for about 10 minutes and it was about a quarter of a mile from me and about a thousand feet above the ground. then instead of seeing one lighted object, three lights came on. two, as if they were on the end of wings and one as if at the end of a tail of a plane. and it even sounded like an airplane. i thought then that it was just an airplane, but it kept getting closer. the next thing i know it was hovering over my head about 10 ft above me. the plane looking lights went off and then there were differant colored lights blinking off and on in a circuler manner. it was saucer shaped. i got up and started to run and run right into a patch of sticker bushes. so i stoped and looked up and it was still above me. then a white light shined on me starting from a small hole and growing bigger. i was now standing in a really bright light about 10 ft in diameter. the next thing i remember the light closed up and the craft started to rise higher until it was about a thousand feet off the ground. i noticed i was not standing where i was when the light started to shine on me. the crafts plane light came back on and it sounded like and airplane again. it went due south for about a quarter of a mile and turned 90 degrees towards the east, then went about 300 yards and turned north at a 90. i was then trying to hide behind a tree and shaking like a scared rabbit. when it got back to where it was almost even with me it took offfaster than anything i have ever seen and left a pure white trail clear up to the end of the atmospher. the people that i have told besides my family, you can count on one hand and they told me after i told my story that they new it was true just by how excited i got when i told it. i didn't tell anyone for about ten years after because i thought they would come back and get me. i'm at the age now that i would almost invite them to come and get me and take me for a ride in space. well, not almost, if they were friendly i would go in a heart beat. i have always wanted to get hypnotized to see what happened from the time the light shined around me and the time it closed up. i am not possitive but i think there was a couple of hours missing in there too. i would also like to see if there was anything planted in me. that is my story and i swear to god it is the truth....Doug...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

is an old report that occurred months before ufos were even talked about, during the spring of, i think, 1947.  i was a young boy walking home from school with four young friends, along a lonely street on the edge of sydney, nova scotia.  suddenly one of my friends pointed to the sky directly overhead, to a very bright dot.  we all marveled at how bright it was, and reasoned that it must have been a balloon with the sun shining on it.  this was about 4:00 in the afternoon and the sky was partially cloudy.  since my friends thought they had it figured out they did not give it much further attention and walked off, but to me it was too bright to be a balloon and i kept staring at it, alone.  then i noticed that this bright dot was sitting in the middle of a very large, circular hole in the clouds.  moving clouds would approach the perimeter of this circle and drift around it.  the inside of the circle was not at all ragged, as one would expect with clouds.  my neck was getting kinked, as the bright dot was directly overhead, and i reasoned there was nothing i could do about it, so i walked a few steps forward with my attention on where i was going but could not resist a look up again.  the bright dot was then gone, and the circle of clouds was just beginning to close in.  months later reports of ufos appeared, and i put the two together but mentioned my thoughts to no one.  mine is the only case i know of where a ufo was seen influencing a second object, the clouds.  no conventional phenomena can explain that in a form so perfect.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7742,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.1400999,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-08242007-0003","longitude":-60.189984,"occurred":-712857600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nova

western edge of the parking lot at the visitor's center where the \"mt. washington auto road\" to the top of the mountain begins. i was taking pictures of the mountains to the west of where i was standing when i noticed this distant object flying around erratically and i attempted to get a couple of shots of it. after i took the photos i completely forgot about them because at the time i didn't have any thought of a ufo on my mind. it was too distant and it appeared to be something like a bouquet of mylar balloons getting blown in the wind in a sort of counter-clockwise rolling motion. i didn't load or look at any of my vacation photos in my notebook pc until returned to maine again in early august. when i got to look at the one that contains the object, i suddenly remembered why i took the shot and zoomed in on it to see if i could make out what it was i had seen. imagine my surprise. \r\nwhen i looked at the second photo, which was taken 3 seconds later, there was no object that appears anywhere in the frame. \r\ni was using a canon powershot a540, without the zoom on, and was holding it at about a foot in front of my face. i have no idea where the object went after the first shot was taken. \r\ni would say that the ridge in the foreground, just below the object, was about 2/5 of a mile away from where i was standing and that the object was much further away than i had intitially thought when i took the photo, possibly a mile from where i was. i would put it's size at about 35-50 feet in diameter. i also noticed when i zoom in on the object in the photo, there appears to be some sort of vertical rod on the top of it. others i've shown the photo to, have said the same thing.\r\nthe whole time frame of my sighting lasted about ten seconds from when i first spotted it, took the two photos, and was no longer able to see it. \r\nmy son and his girlfriend where in the same parking lot, but where about 100 feet from where i was. the sighting didn't excite me and i didn't even mention it to them. as i said, it was distant and it never struck me at the time as possibly being a ufo. who would have thought they'd ever be presented with the opportunity to get a shot of one in their lifetime? i took the photos as a curiosity.
