of drinking and partying going on everywhere and only one instance of \"violence\" occurred that we noticed. anyway, there was a huge line waiting to get into the area near the reflecting pool and the police were searching people one by one for weapons and such.\r\nwhich i suppose was a respectable idea--but not a very efficient one to say the least.\r\nthe police had erected a 4-foot high orange plastic fence all over to divide areas on the mall. a flimsy type of fence that you might see at a construction site to help control erosion. my wife and i waited in this line for about 20 minutes and still had not moved and had noticed everyone complaining about the cold and how slow the police were in searching people.\r\nsuddenly we heard a rather loud ripping sound, then the sound of people cheering and police yelling through bullhorns--for a minute we did not understand what was going on, but then like fans at a ball game doing \"the wave\",\r\nwe could see everyone, and i mean everyone, tearing the fence down and storming out onto the area behind the short fence onto the reflecting pool where already many people already were watching the concert unfolding. at this point naturally, the police threw up \r\nthere hands in frustration and walked to there squad cars not even attempting to stop anyone--i assume for fear of a riot.\r\n    even though things got crazy for a few minutes, all in all as far as i know no one was injured and it seemed everyone was having a great time\r\nand surely had a memorable night. my wife and i continued to walk on and finally decided to stop near a bridge to watch the fireworks. as we waited for midnight we talked together about things\r\nthat we had endured over the past year and kind of had an \"overlook\" at our lives to date; it was a very surreal (?) moment, as if time had stopped, \r\ni guess it was just one of those strange moments two people in love might have--enough of my reminiscing on to the events that undoubtedly changed me\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n    midnight, on the dot, a thousand screaming streaks of sparkling chaos erupted up into the freezing sky and blossomed into a maelstrom of intense fire of muti-faceted colors.\r\nthe fireworks display was one of the best i had ever seen in the many years of my dc habitation--witness to over 20 years worth of fourth of july���s\r\ndown on the mall, to this day i still say it was the best display i have ever been a part of. they wondrous display of explosive mayhem lasted full steam ahead for about 15 minutes i believe.\r\nafter the last streaking missile of falling embers died away in the midnight sky, my wife and i began to walk to the metro to start on our dreaded journey home, as we knew there would be mobs of people \r\njoining us as well. as we approached the metro escalator ( i believe it was the foggy bottom station) we saw a group of officers blocking the entrance stating we all had to wait as even the train operators had been given permission to come topside to watch the \r\nfireworks and were currently enroute back to the trains to take us all home. i later found out that there were over 1 million people that attended the celebration on the mall that night--i cannot put into words how many people that is when you \r\nare right in the middle of such a huge mass of humans. again we waited in the cold night, and people began to huddle together for warmth which really surprised me--people were very happy and helping each other,\r\ni must say i am a cynical person, skeptical, and sometimes dare i say bitter--sometimes my faith in humanity is somewhat jaded. that night shocked me and actually gave me a sliver of hope that one day it could be possible for mankind to be able to call one another brother.\r\n\r\n    as everyone talked while waiting for the police to let us down into the subway tunnels, my attention was called to a young man who had plenty to drink that night no doubt, who climbed a small tree nearby and was singing and generally making people laugh at his antics. \r\nsuddenly i heard a loud snap, i turned back to the man in the tree just in time to see the branch he was standing on break and he plummeted to the ground with a thud. he was helped back up and he cheered and the entire crowed laughed even more.\r\nthat���s when i saw it. i saw...A blimp...Yes it must be a blimp. then i notice people pointing, just a few at first, then more and more, and a hush fell over the crowd. the\r\nsilence and quiet mumbling between people was a sign i decided, as all night the roar of the crowd had been constant.\r\ni looked back at this \"blimp\" i had seen in the distance. more and more people were pointing and now a few people shouted like the grade school game of \"telephone\" as the message was carried off through the crowd \"look at that! what is that!?\"\r\nthen i noticed 2 more \"blimps\" identical to the first. all three were cylindrical in shape and had several lights shining on them. one of them shone a very bright \"spotlight\" down on the ground. i could not see what it was shining on,\r\nas they were some distance away from my wife and i--perhaps 300 yards? maybe more. these\r\n\"blimps\" were traveling slowly across the sky and they were quite large, i���m a bit afraid to guess how large because they were far from us and i don���t remember a reference point--it was a bit exciting and i was \r\nnot thinking about \"measure the size--is this north over here? what is the relative speed estimation etc\" i was in a speechless state.\r\n   the next thing i saw was someone pointing up and screaming \"look up there!\", i saw about 20 triangle shaped \"aircraft\" flying in a mass like a group of gnats on a hot summer day--yet these things were very quick and nimble.\r\neach had 3 lights on them, one in the middle and one on each tip. as my wife and i watched they began to fly in different patterns. people began to call out things, such as, \"those are seagulls not ufo's\" and i was thinking to myself they were stunt kites.\r\ni even remember my wife turning to me and asking what i thought they were, and i told her they were just stunt kites and told her i had seen them before at the beach.\r\nsuddenly the objects began flying in a tight circle very fast and then shot out at incredible speed and disappeared. then about 2 seconds later they flew right back into the circle pattern facing each other and stopped, hovered for a second then formed two groups each group in a line,\r\nthey formed the line two at a time, one from each group until they were all in a straight line facing each other began to zigzag across each other.\r\nat that moment i knew i was not witnessing stunt kites. i was amazed. people had cheered after each little stunt that was performed. the objects were very close and i would say\r\nroughly about 100' up above us. it was the most amazing thing i had ever seen. as far as i know, no country in the world has an aircraft that can move at those incredible speeds, stop on a dime, and be so graceful.\r\ni have seen the blue angels fly when i was a kid, they are graceful, but even a fighter jet needs some room to build up speed--whatever it was that i witnessed that night did not need any room at all--it achieved tremendous speeds from a dead stop.\r\nafter about 5 minutes even the police were watching these crafts flying--they suddenly started ushering people down into the subway, but they continued to watch. every now and then a craft would swoop down within i would estimate 20 feet of the ground\r\nand that seemed to make the police really nervous. for some reason my wife and i started laughing hysterically. a few young ���college ���aged��� guys walked over to where these craft were swooping down to and one guy reached his hand up as high as he could to try and touch one as they came streaming down towards the ground. after about 3 ���crafts��� swooping down, the guy turned and starting ���whooping��� to his friends and ���flexing������he had actually touched one of them! then 4 or 5 police officers that where next to the subway escalators started yelling loudly at the guys ���get back now! get away from there!��� my wife and i also commented on how the police were frozen in place and not moving from there ���safe��� distance, hehe. but then suddenly one officer did in fact, run over and grab the one, obviously drunk kid, and pull him away-- at the same time pushing his few friends back into the crowd as well. when they came close to us again, my wife grabbed the police officer and asked/yelled(as it was relatively loud)��� what are those things?���. when the officer turned to my wife i got frightened for a second, his eyes were so big, it was obvious to me he was terrified, all he could say was ���i���i don���t know miss, please, everyone needs to leave the area immediately!��� and then proceeded to start yelling to the crowd telling them to disperse immediately.\r\n  then i really got a scare, the craft started to dart into different directions very close to the edges of the crowd, then shot back up into the area above the crowd again and continued circling. i feel i must also note that when they did their dives and swoops, you could hear the crafts traveling through the air���like the actual wind resistance. similar to swinging a baseball bat or a stick -how you can hear it ���swoosh��� through the air. other then that noise, we did not hear any sort of motor of electrical noise of any sort. when one of the craft came down it swooped down about a foot off the ground then shot up at an angle to about 4 feet high and stopped, right in front of the crowd edge where my wife and i were (among thousands of others mind you) for approximately 1 second, before flipping over itself up and back into the formation above the crowd again. at that moment i thought for sure i was going to be hit by a ufo at one million miles an hour! but it stopped about 2 feet from me���i could feel the air from it. i could see right inside at the pilot���.\r\n(my wife an i compared notes later on without telling each other���instead we told her grandparents separately and then all sat down in the living room and her grandparents confirmed our descriptions to be the same)\r\n suddenly i heard the loudest \"boom\" and then some other explosions, i thought they were more fireworks but didn���t see anything in the sky except the ufo's. a few people had screamed when the explosion went off--i believe it was not fireworks. why? because we had just witness a good 15-20 minutes of fireworks and none of them were that loud and i didn���t hear anyone scream when the fireworks went off. from this \"assumption/theory\" i don���t believe it was fireworks, but have no proof of what it might have been.\r\nthe explosions only lasted a few seconds and then i heard a helicopter. suddenly the flying triangles disappeared.... i didn���t see if they vanished or flew away but i believe they just vanished. then i saw 3 helicopters fly by to the area where the triangles had been, but continued on there flight path, and no sooner did the helicopters disappear from sight the triangles zipped back above us from every direction and the crowd cheered.\r\n  one guy next to me smiled and said in a drunken glee \"the government can���t stop our party with the aliens, they can���t even catch them!\"\r\nafter about 10 minutes i noticed another strange event. a man in a business type suit came up from the subway while hordes of people were slowly\r\ngoing down into the subway. everyone parted for him to pass by, but he walked right into the crowd of us (remember 1 million people were here) and as he walked by my wife and i he smiled and asked \"if we were having a good time\" my wife chimed in \"yes a fantastic time, look up at the ufo's\" and she pointed at the 20 or so \"stunt craft\". the man smiled at her, looked up at them, then back at us and said,\r\n\"yes they just want to join the fun\" then he slowly continued his walk through the middle of the massive crowd saying hello to people and even shaking a few peoples hands.\r\ni watched him until he disappeared into the crowd, finding something about him a bit \"off\" whereas my wife had gone back to watch the flying triangles again.\r\nlooking back now, one thing i noticed was that this man was wearing a business suit.\r\nwell this is washington dc no big deal right? right. except that it���s january 1, and its freezing!!! yet the cold did not seem to bother this man at all.\r\nwell, i have no proof he was anything other then a man celebrating new years, so i suppose i should just write him off as a business man who had enough drink to keep himself warm. i mean they were only 20 ufo's flying over his head and he acted like it was no big deal, just an everyday occurrence.\r\n   my wife and i watched the ufo's for a total of roughly 35 minutes, and finally she began to tug at my arm and said ���maybe we should leave now?���\r\nand so we decided that we were lucky to witness one of the most important events in all history ever, but if we froze to death it wouldn���t matter much\r\n and we wouldn���t be able to tell the story to our children one day (she was pregnant at the time),so we went home with an unbelievable story.\r\n\r\n(i cant believe more people have not come forward, there were thousands of witnesses! belial418@msn.Com)\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

at least more than two.\r\n\r\nthere was a white light at the front and a white light at the end.  when i first noticed them i actually thought they were stars until it was very clear that they were moving, and in exact unison.  the light was very bright but not at all large.  it didn't blink as a plane's light might or flicker or twinkle as a star might.  \r\n\r\nthere was no mechanical sound heard.  it maintained a steady speed but not at all fast.  it just seemed to move along at a speed i might drive on a city street.\r\n\r\nby the time i realized what i was seeing it was too late to grab my camera.  no other neighbors were around.  i would have tried to call to someone if i had realized sooner that this wasn't a normal object.  i was surprised with myself as i wasn't scared or nervous but curious as i watched.  i think i wanted to prove that it was just a plane or blimp or something i knew.  after the object went over my building i realized how significant the experience was and wondered who to share it with.  \r\n\r\nwhile i'm somewhat a skeptic when it comes to ufos, i just know, for sure, what i \"saw\" tonight was not a plane.

working in qatar between 1996 and 1999 i used to go running in the desert behind my residence.  i used to run most evenings and most days.  my work meant i was out there for about 2.5y so i was very familiar with as an area of about a 5 to 6 mile radius.  my runs took me past a series of buildings and then to an area of the desert that stone, brick and other markers were used to identify plots of approximatly 100m square which eventially gave way to the subka-desert beyond.  the 'normal' run area was bound by a road to an electrical substation at the bottom, a gas pipeline under a raised section to the left (probably west) and the start of the e ringroad in the east.  \r\n\r\none evening something appeared in a very strange place, in view of the nearest building, but hidden from all the roads.  it was on the nearest side of a small rise.\r\n  \r\nthe next bit of this trys to explain as best i can what occured next and sounds a little odd so bear with me!  \r\n\r\ni am not even sure that it registered with me that it was there origially because it resisted both recognition and visual review.  over a period of time (probably a week or so) i fought to look at it from a distance of over 100m(possibly more).  i am not too sure how long it was actually there but it was probably the best part of a month, and over this time i gradually broke the mental barriers down to eventually manage to run around it (again at at least 100m distance).  the following description is the summation of half-looks and a gradually formed picture.  the 'thing' was silver, such that it reminded me of the final section of a building recently constructed on the far side of the e ringroad.  i did suspect at one point that it was some kind of optical illusion and was in fact the top of the building.  it seemed to be circular (though i could only see it from a side elevation), and it was at a slight angle to the horizontal, a similar angle to the rise but not evidently the same angle (i know its odd).  it was not supported by any visible structure but was clearly some 3 to 4ft off the ground, and to be located where it was would have been excessively difficult because of the immendatly surronding terrain.  there were much easier places to put it if there had been a choice, and, for instance a crane had been used or a trailor.  the object actually looked a little like a 'traditional' saucer being raised in its central section, but it also had raised areas, almost as high as the centre section, some were definatly square but others were less easy to identify, all were solidly attached, and all were silver seeming continuous with the rest of the surface.  there were no obvious seams or windows or entrances.  it diameter was probably 35 to 45ft and its height at the centre was probably 20-25ft.  i would not describe it as aerodynamic.\r\n\r\nthen one day i realised the object had gone, i am not too sure i noticed the precise day it left but it took me about a week after the realisation to go and have a look in detail at the area.  this, even after this time, took a lot of  determination and for some weeks after i was very uneasy about the area.  there had been no rain or winds to hide anything but there was absolutly no trace of the object, its supporting structure, or the possiblility of it having been take away on a trailor or similar.  i also checked against areas i knew had been used and confirmed this observation.\r\n\r\nduring this time it never crossed my mind to tell anybody else (it was almost as though i forgot it was there when i left its immediate presence and there was a deep reluctance to even consider it) and unusually i did not see anybody else in the area (which upon reflection was probably even more strange).  the only reason i even remembered this incident was because i wrote the first account about a week after it dissappeared.  this whole incident was forgotten until sometime in 2002/3 when something on the radio (to do with hitchikers guide) brought it back to me and i looked and found a copy.  the odd thing is that i actually forgot the whole incident completly inbetween and it was only the accout that allowed me to recall.  \r\n\r\ni cannot explain the object but it is as much the surreal aspect of the whole episode that worries me to this day.  just to clarify i did not see anything or anybody anywhere near the object and as mentioned earlier i seemed to be the only person around which was unlikely.\r\n\r\nthe actual location is about 1 mile from the end of the airport

included the milky way slightly to the east and overhead.  facing west, my attention was turned upward to movement in the sky at what would be approximately 260-265 degrees on a compass rose.  i looked up to see, at an angle of about 30 degrees, two bright lights (brighter than any of the stars then visible) approaching me at a very high rate of speed, descending in a \"swooping\" motion much like a military aircraft on a strafing run.  it was as if the lights were on the opposite forward wing tips of an aircraft, but there was nothing between them to block out the background sky/stars.  i immediately saw that the lights were rotating clockwise (as they appeared to me), as if an airplane were in a roll to its left.  there was no sound whatsoever, but it was very clear that whatever they were, they were headed directly at me, on a glide path (if one can call it that) that was rapidly closing, and i experienced the momentary fear that i might be under attack. as i watched its approach, i called to my girlfriend, who was in the hosue, to come out.  after about one-and-a-half revolutions of the \"object(s)\", it/they suddenly stopped moving towards me; the light that was then at the top of the circle they were describing broke off and headed east, still at a high rate of speed (much faster than the satellite we observed a few minutes later), while the second, lower, light \"parked\" where it was.  by now my girlfriend had joined me, and we both watched as the first light streaked across the sky eastward.  as it approached the center peaked portion of our roof, we moved several steps to the east to pick it up visually on the other side of the peak; it never reappared.  when we looked back to the location where the second light had stopped, it, too, was gone.  neither of us heard any sound or felt any phyhsical sensations at any time during the event, but we were both amazed at what we had seen. i, especailly, was taken by the event, as i had seen much more of it.  i am still wondering what i saw, of course; there was and is a mix of feelings, from fear that this might be some sort of an attack to wonder at the incredible precision of the movements and speed at which they took place.  i never dreamed that i would personally witness such a thing, but, in retrospect, it was an amazing, enjoyable experience (enjoyable once i realized it was not an attack, of
