like a satellite, it was small, i would guess 15+ miles away, appeared high in altitude at about 45 degrees elevation, though no trees or anything to compare size to.  it looked to be moving at least as fast as a jet and perhaps as fast as a satellite but looked a little oblong or bullet shaped. i say satellite because i have seen satellites on several occasions and the color yellow relflected and size shape and movement were similar to a satellite in orbit.    i started wondering if it was a ufo and suddenly the craft began to slow down to approx 1/4 speed and it started increasing in intensity until it was by far the brightest thing in the sky and very white and looked round.  the brightness would be equivalent to one of those whitish bright headlamps on brights setting at one block away.  the color was the same color as a large meteor burning up through the atmosphere, a brilliant white, which i have seen on several occasions.  then the craft turned down or off the bright white color and it was dim yellow again as it started gaining speed back to the original speed. i had binoculars with me and quickly looked at the ufo.  it appeared slightly bullet shaped and by the time it had reached north northeast it was too far away to see with binoculars. if it was above 35,000 feet it was moving much faster than a passenger jet, at least 5 times as fast. i dont know what could be that small at a lower altitude, but it would have to be smaller than a passenger plane.  there was no sound, very little wind.  there were no clouds in the sky to the entire east during the sighting.  the perseids were pretty disappointing since i only saw four decent meteors, but i did see a couple other small shooting stars as well as the moons of jupiter.\r\n\r\nit was not a meteor because it slowed down - got bright - sped up- all in a straight line tangent to the atmosphere\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7674,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.49672,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08142007-0005","longitude":-82.887374,"occurred":1186896600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,

been seeing e.T.V. / u.F.O.'s for many years . however this year especially since march the number and frequency of sightings has caused me to report these events. this week 13/08/07 i even filmed them on my camcorder. you can see it here. feel free to download it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Archive.Org/details/e.T.V.U.F.O.August13th2007\r\n\r\nthe weird thing was the lamp / lights. i have never seen them this bright. instead of looking like street lights they looked like mini stars, flaring sort of. and i missed at least 3 other flyby. as soon as i put the camera down they flew past again. the orbs were huge at least 3 of them. the triangles were amazing really low. i got two filmed but typically the lowest & best i didn't get to in time as the battery was on charge. also as i said before there was some kind on membrane either side of the street i can see it but i'm not sure if it will be on the video. the only analogy i can think of is the look of the liquid you blow bubbles with combined with t.V.Static. this membrane sort of vibrates and runs the length of the street both sides behind the neighbours house. i'm thinking this could be some sort of shield so that other people in the town can't see the vehicles or it could be an opening into another dimension or even a shield from the prying eyes of military satellites. now i think it was all of the above.\r\n\r\nas you will hear from the tape there is little sound.Only a few slowed jets noises.The birds are silent and here seagulls are never silent. the neighbors behind were in the garden drinking and chatting. they were oblivious.\r\n\r\nthe noise of the coast road which normally has taxis on sounded literally like out of a sci-fi movie. the sound of a space ship. these sounds precede the filming. in fact that is how i know they are coming. i always here these very very slowed down jet noises. but they are not jets more just like a slowed down video tape or sci-fi effect.\r\n\r\ni'm not used to the camera so i zoomed in and out a bit to start with. but there is over 13 minutes so far. i could have got at least a couple of hours but my camera is 7 years old and the battery needs charging often.\r\n\r\nanyway here is the link for the full 13 minutes of video footage. the best part is after 6 minutes, however i would suggest watching the whole thing first time.\r\n\r\nas an intelligent person i can assure you these are not commercial or private aircraft or helicopters. the u.K. has very strict rules regarding flights over urban & suburban areas. the speed of these vehicles is very slow only as long as i am observing them. the seem to continue to the horizon where they vanish. they vehicles always appear in an instant. the triangular ships also have morphing or cloaking capabilities. i have not been able to confirm whether they are the same as the orbs or whether they are the same. perhaps there is another larger mother ship nearby disguised as blue sky i would never know.\r\n\r\nthe police helicopter is possible at the end although i didn't hear it. often when these sightings occur the police helicopter or the coast guard helicopter turn up. living on the coast i hear & see these all the time. i didn't hear them or see them. the footage is of the ufos . the first piece of footage could have been two hours long. i observed it for more than two hours. i didn't film it because i just didn't have the battery's charged. there's no way a helicopter is going to sit above my neighbours house hovering for two hours or more in silence !!! however sometimes these e.T.V.S turn on their sides flip over charge shape completely & even morph. so i'm not sure. all i know is that since i reported this incident the sky has been sprayed very heavily with chemtrails up to 8 aircraft just last night. now we have gone from warm 80 degree heat to winter weather in less than 24 hours. its raining / flooding again and very windy. of course this also means no one is going to look at the sky and watch ufos.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

direction going home. i was approx. 3 miles from my home when i noticed something, a \"greenish colored star\", way up in the sky in the south west. i honestly do not know what made me notice it more than any other star in the sky that night, but it just looked different. i kept looking up as i was driving. there were a few cars on the road that night, but they all turned off shortly after i turned onto the road to my house. i was alone on the road. i kept looking at that \"star\", and suddenly when i was probably one and a half miles from home, the \"star\" went from the southwest sky, from the size and appearance of a star, to directly ahead of me, going across the highway, in about 3 seconds!!!!!!!!This triangular object had a brilliant greenish white laserlight on the tail. brighter than anything you have ever seen. it made no sound at all at any time....It went across the road about perhaps 15 feet above the road and landed in a field next to a grove of trees, with the laserlight glowing the whole time. the object was about mabey 60 or so feet across, and 100 feet long. a triangular shape, with a sort of rounded nose. the shape was triangular, but with the wings rounded sort of. there were no markings except for lines, deep grooves running diagnally under the craft. round green glowing lights were spaced evenly under the craft next to the lines. no other markings were on the craft. when it came down and went across the road, i was petrified. i floored the gas and put my car into reverse and went backwards, i don't know how far. then i stopped. i saw the craft slowly rise up and turn slowly and stop and just hover atop the trees. the greenish white laser was on the entire time it performed this maneuver. the trees were perhaps 60-70' high. i did not know what to do. i could'nt think. i did not have my radio on at the time, but just a cd playing. i shut it off after i slowly pulled into a driveway, and turned my light off. my car didnt malfunction. i sat without breathing or moving and watched out my window/sunroof in my car. i did not have a cell phone at the time. the object shut off the laser light after it turned and lifted to the tree line. it hovered there for awhile, and then began to slowly move to where i was parked. i was parked mabey 30 feet away from the tree line. it moved so it was directly above me and stopped. i was losing my mind, i couldnt believe this was happening. i didnt know if i would see my family again. i was afraid they would see me. i did not move. i thought that anything that could move that fast, and never make a sound could do anything they wanted to. they were directly above me and stone still. the green lights beneath it were on. then it started to move slowly after about 15 minutes, and headed out across the field toward the northeast. it was about 40 feet off the ground. the color of the object was a solid dark brown/black color. it was smooth. no dents or markings, rounded wings. i waited about, i don't know, 15 minutes before i could move, and drove like a bat out of hell home. one month to the day of that incident, i had a heart attack. i was 48 years old, with no history of any cardiac problems, no cholestorol or bp issues. i couldnt sleep for a whole month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n","distance":"21-100

while driving home.\r\n\r\na mile or so before cold creek canyon, my wife and i seemingly both looked to the east side of the highway, approximately 100 feet up, at the exact same moment.  there was

disappear. i made a few reports about them here at mufon. i kept seeing them, sometimes as a balloon and sometimes as a light in the sky. i tried to talk to them in my mind and sometimes i thought i heard them answere me. then in june i went on vacation to marbella spain. the night before i left i went out on my balcolny and looked up into the night sky and i saw small points of light move flash and disappear, i told them i was leaving to spain and asked them to come with me. then i went to bed and as i lay in bed i heard a voice say \"we will come\". then while i was on vacation i would see the same points of light at night move and flash and disappear,and one night i heard a voice say \"you have to help us find more people like yourself, people who can help us\" and i asked, help you do what? and the voice said \"help us make this world a better place\" and i asked, how would you make this world a better place and the voice said \"make your people become more like us\" i asked for more clarfication but the voice just kept repeating the same thing. when i returned back to southern california i decided that i must have invented the voice in my mind and that it was all imaginary. then one day about three weeks ago i was folding laundry and i heard a voice say \"you are very important to us\" and i said to the voice that i'm just talking to myself and the voice said \"no you are talking to us and if you come outside right now you will see us and know that you are talking to us\" so i went out and stood in front of my garage and looked up into the sky and saw nothing but i heard the voice saw \"wait and you will see us, you have to be calm to hear us and patient to see us\" and after a few minutes a small pink light appeared in the sky and i took some pictures (the first posted with this report) then another white and somewhat larger light appeared below the pink one (second photo posted) then i went back inside and sat in the bathroom where it's quiet and tried to listen to them and the voice said the same thing i had heard in spain about finding more people like myself and i told them my wife would never believe this (i had told her about the balloons and she had not believed me)and the voice said to bring my wife outside when she got home and they would show themselves to her so that she would believe me. so when she got home i told her what had happened and took her outside to see them (along with a pair of bioculars) and we stood in the same spot i had before and i told them in my mind that we were ready and after a few minutes a small white light appeared above us and i gave the binoculars to my wife so she could see them better (third photo posted) and she agreed that it was quite amazing. so i told them in my mind that i would introduce them to my father who used to work for the government and that he would be a better person to help them. so the next day i flew to washington dc but when i saw my father a voice said in my head not to tell him about them and that i was in danger and had better leave the capital right away because other bad aliens were trying to \"scan\" me. and then things started to get really strange (maybe i'll write a book about it if i live long enough) and i left my dads house(leaving him with the impression i had totally lost mind)and spent three days running for my life trying to get back home to so cal. and the voice started telling my to do things like \"swallow your tongue\" and other things that would do serious injury to myself and to make very long story short my oddessy ended with me punching a cop at lax and being locked up on a 5150 at ucla medical center. i was diagnoised as haveing a \"psychotic episode\" anyway i just wanted to tell other people who might be seeing strange balloons that they probably are more than just balloons and if you want to talk to them you probably can, but i warn you that, ignorance is bliss.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7651,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.782881,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08122007-0007","longitude":-119.4164224,"occurred":1184482800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1184482800000,"summary":"I

sky.\r\n\r\ni felt it was someone looking at me and as i lived far out from the city with no close neighbour was it a strnge feeling.\r\n\r\ni looked were i felt it come from and looked up on our roof and there it was , it was so black so it was a huge different from the darkblue sky and the black triangle spaceship.\r\n\r\nthen i fins myself laying with my back in the windows and my body half out in the window and my nose up to the sky.\r\n\r\ni was lifted up and i tried to look in the windos of the spaceship but it was only dark the windows and i try to find anumber or text on it.\r\n\r\ni was use with airplane because we had an military airport 7 km from where we lived.\r\n\r\nthen did i come back to stand in the window just before it happen but i felt it was a time-wall i had coming out from, the sound from my tv and my daughter and her father in the next room was the same.\r\n\r\nnext day did we wake up early of sounds like heavy traffic.\r\n\r\nnot of wheels but sound of wind when something is going very fast in the air.\r\n\r\nit took some minutes for me to get up as it was about 7 in the saturday morning and we wanted to sleep longer.\r\n\r\ni looked in the same window like the last night and i told my husband it was much cars going up in the forest so he had to see it too.\r\n\r\nwe started to watch tv but my husband was curious as he had lived in the village for 15 years so he said \" i can't understand who has so big 50ths birthday party.\r\n\r\nit's only 10 families in the village so he and our daughter drove up in the forest.\r\n\r\nthey come back and said they didn't met or saw any cars and at the road the drove on ends in th forest and then do you need to turn back the same way.\r\n\r\nthe cars was all metallic gray and it was at least 300 car driving up there.\r\n\r\ni know where the mothership was because after the abduction was i frigthen to go to a special area in the forest when i picked mushrooms.\r\n\r\ni wasn't interested of airplanes or

his job.\r\n\r\nbut in august 2000 when my husband was in texas did god come down to my daughter and me.\r\n\r\nhe was talking from the air, we never saw a body.\r\n\r\nmy daughter joined a church next day and have been working for god since then.\r\n\r\ngod make me leaving my husband and go back to usa for 3 and half year.\r\n\r\nand after god come down have i seen some of the characters in

some faster than others. this was not the first time i have seen these lights, but it was the first time that my husband was home. i called him to come outside.\r\n\r\ni told my friend to look to the east/northeast sky so she could see them, too.  though i could not measure distance, it was quite apparent these pinpoints of light were not within our atmosphere.  my husband came out to look, he saw one and then went back inside.  my friend and i, however, continued to watch.\r\n\r\none of the lights would appear in one place, track slowly and irregularly off in a northeasterly direction and seemingly disappear. after a very few minutes, it would reappear in the same 'starting' spot and track off in a slightly different direction. this continued; however, after about 10 minutes, there was a very bright flash and about one second later, one of the pinpoint lights was going very rapidly across the sky from the direction of the bright flash (as its starting point).  after the fast one flew its course, another and then another of the slower ones appeared; one seemed to make some kind of turn because the light of it intensified about 10 times briefly before it turned again and became the 'normal' amount of light.\r\n\r\nshortly after the light of the one intensified, my friend made a sound of surprise and said \"did you see that?!\" i told her i didn't see anything different and she said \"no, it's something huge and it looked like it let out a pink cloud-looking stuff like an emission system or something.\" we continued to watch the pinpoints of light move. the most i saw at one time was 4 or 5.\r\n\r\nabout 5 minutes after my friend's exclamation, something huge passed overhead. i cannot accurately measure the distance of it, i can say, without hesitation, that it was flying lower than the airplanes fly. it appeared to be a very dark grey color and, had someone not been watching, it likely would have passed over completely undetected. it made no sound at all. it showed no lights that i could see. the shape of it is difficult to describe, but it was somewhat the shape of a boomerang; more accurately (and this is the only way i can accurately describe it), imagine that you are looking up watching a hawk on a wind current. remove the head of the hawk and all portions of the body below the wings: that is closer to the shape of what this huge thing looked like.\r\n\r\nif i am anywhere close to judging the size of it, based on how close it appeared it might be, i would say that each side had to have been about the length of a football field.\r\n\r\nit was though it was just gliding through the air. as i said, no sound at all. there were no lights showing, either.\r\n\r\nwhen i described it to my friend on the phone, she said that was exactly the large thing she had seen that had emitted the pink \"cloud.\"\r\n\r\ni don't know what any of that was. as i said, it is not the first time that i've watch the pinpoints of light move randomly and slowly. it was however, the first time i have seen the huge thing.\r\n\r\ni would be interested in knowing if anyone else saw what i have described or anything similiar last night, 8.10.07, between approximately 10:15 p.M. and 11:30 p.M. and possibly knows what it is.  thank you.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":7643,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.3562201,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08112007-0004","longitude":-95.2958824,"occurred":1186809300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1186809300000,"summary":"Star-sized points of light in night sky tracking slowly in erratic pattern followed by very large flying object","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Tyler, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:448420"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2524}
