of thinking what possibly could've made my power momentary interruption, i instinctfully, without prior thought, grabbed my camera and went outdoors to photograph the daturas in my garden.   i am a semi-professional designer and amateur photographer and have been recently posting photos in a flickr.Com account.    as i began to set up my slr-type sony cybershot dsc-h5, i saw a flash in the nw skies, toward jackson, mi (it is now about five minutes after the power flicker).   i set the camera to auto and 'burst' two series of five photographs.   immediately i viewed them through the camera's 3-inch lighted view screen and saw one image with a definite black dot infront of a small cloud.   at that point i went indoors and downloaded the images onto my computer and found that there were at least two objects, one definitely metallic and disc-shaped, flitting about the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\ni seem to have been missing about an hour's time while outdoors between the power interruption and photos.\r\n \r\ni thought that the photos were taken around 2pm.   i recall that when the power was interrupted, i looked at the battery-operated clock on the bathroom wall it was about 1:45pm or so.   i went outdoor right afterward and began to photograph my garden's flowers.   i dodn't feel that i was out more than ten or fifteen minutes.   when i looked at the computer clock and saw that it was well past three.   i became very confused and slightly agitated.  i looked at the digital photos and they were all stamped with times after 3pm.    \r\n \r\nthere is no way that i was outdoors for an hour or so... the 'segueway' was seamless...I do not recall the 'jump cut'...Like when a movie is edited back together after snapping.    you're in one place or whatever and suddenly you're somewhere else or doing something or you're just standing or sitting and completely confused.     i don't recall any of that happening.\r\n \r\nmaybe the flashes of light i saw in the sky were some sort of indication of the 'experience' being underway or ending???\r\n \r\nwow...\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7642,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.1663244,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08112007-0003","longitude":-84.2415416,"occurred":1186869900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1186869900000,"summary":"Power

1 in the morning when i was sitting at my computer playin a video game(dota). as the game was over i had to take a piss, i have these 2 doors right next to my computer so i opend one of em and stepd out onto the steps to take a piss. well when i came outside i see this thing.. it was to the left of my house about 100 ft in the air,right above the tree in my neighbors yard, it was moving, made almost no noise expect this high pictch sound as it felw by very slowly,(i thought the sound was my a/c running later to realize it wasnt on that night) like 5-10 mph. this obeject was huge like almost a football field metelic like metal and had the biggest 3 windows spaced out perfectally in the middle of the craft with the brightest wite light comming from these 3 square windows. when i saw the craft i was stunned. i thought it was a plane or a helicopter or even a blimp but it was verywindy and was too low to be anything else and made no noise really. while i just stood there in aww it was slowly moving away from me. i stodd there for about 5 minutes and watced it as it moved to the next street than turned left to go twards the woods. the left turn it made was instant like noting i have ever seen before. i saw the same side the whole time. it slowly made it way twoards the woods and i lost it behind the trees. i went inside after that and went to sleep wonderig what i had just saw. i told my friends about it the next day and non of them believed me. it was like nothing i have ever seen before in my life.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

people, on the way from watertown, wis., to waupun, wis.\r\n\r\ni was driving home from a visit to my parents in watertown. the trip takes about an hour. i had stayed later than i intended, because the family had rented \"pan's labyrinth,\" directed by guillermo del toro, and i stayed to watch the movie.\r\n\r\nas i approached burnett from the south, i saw a white light resembling an asteroid or other falling cosmic debris, but lacking the characteristic tail which accompanies such events, travelling at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet and decreasing.\r\n\r\nthis happened during a period when wisconsin skys are constantly lit up with air traffic: the eaa fly-in in oshkosh draws aviators from all over the country, and planes of various makes and models travel north along an air coridor over dodge county to get to oshkosh.\r\n\r\nhowever, this light remained constant, and lacked the slow on-off cycle characteristic of planes, which is why it caught my attention. it also appeared to be falling rapidly to earth.\r\n\r\ni have seen meteors and other natural phenomena along the same road. i travelled 26 between watertown and waupun regularly when i lived with my parents and commuted to my job in waupun. i have since relocated to waupun, and so the commute is only occasional.\r\n\r\ni kept my eyes on the object as it continued to fall to earth, passing over my car and becoming obscured by trees as i entered burnett. as i drove through downtown burnett, a bright flash, like lighting, lit up the northern horizon. there was no accompanying sound of thunder. there was no sound of impact or explosion. there was no sound of a sonic boom.\r\n\r\nthe event lasted in entirety perhaps 30 seconds to a minute. the evening was clear, without clouds or thunderstorms. \r\n\r\nstill, on that evening, during that time of year, i was worried it was an airplane crash. a crash of any kind in dodge county would be news, and so, upon returning to waupun approximately 12 a.M. monday morning, i immediately went to the office and called local county sheriff's dispatch operaters to see if anyone was working a plane crash.\r\n\r\ndispatchers in dodge county, fond du lac county, columbia county and green lake county all said no such crash had occurred. the dispatcher in fond du lac county referred me to the media line. an eaa aireventure-bound t6 trainer plane had made an emergency landing near fond du lac regional airport earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nthe emergency landing happened at approximately 7:45 p.M., hours before my sighting. i called back to see if anything had occured more recently; nothing had.\r\n\r\ni am thus at a loss to explain exactly what i saw in the sky over northern dodge, southern fond du lac counties that night. i mulled it over for several weeks, and only recently discovered mufon (i at first thought it was a construct of the writers of the x-files, of which i'm a fan) until i was reading livescience.Com and saw the organization actually existed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

about 4 o'clock in the afternoon i decided to take a break and layed back in my lawn chair, for it was hot and the sky was clear. my chair was facing east and i looked up about 90 degrees and saw a jet contrail. the jet itself was about the size of a pinhead and shiney. the contrail indicated that it was traveling almost due east. i looked to the right and saw another jet (same discreption as first jet) moving from southeast to northwest. it was just above my treeline. they were both very high and seemed to be at the same altitude (altho i know each direction has an altitude to fly at.). i wondered where in the sky their paths would cross. as i looked in front of the east bound plane i saw a very large round object, about as big as a dime at arms length, and it was barely visable as if it was camoflaged like the bottom of a b-52, and there seemed to be a thin layer of cirus clouds underneath it. this object was also traveling east (no contrail, nothing) infront of the first plane at about the same speed. it was approaching the intersect point of the two planes. i looked back at the east bound plane, then at the northwest bound plane, then at the round object. the object had changed course and was traveling north east. i ran to get my camera but by the time i got back they were gone.\r\n     i first thought that this was an object in orbit and wondered what do we have that big up there? til it changed course. i would like to know what it was and have spent alot of time looking up since, hoping for another glance of the

\"look it's back!\" which it was back at around 4/5'. our route of travel was direct from kpdk -> klro via gps/autopilot navigation. at my estimation later after thinking about what was that, is that

adams, wa. we were skywatching around 9:30 pm and waiting for the lights to fire up on the mountain. we noticed a large bright, glowing, sphere-shaped object in the western sky and checked it out with our spotting scope.  we saw clearly that this object was undulating, moving like an amoeba or jellyfish.  it contained what appeared to be thousands of teeny brilliant lights inside.  we got out the camcorder and started to tape what we saw, although the camcorder didn't record exactly what we saw in the scope, it was still brilliant in the camera viewfinder.  astoria kept the object in her sight with the scope and i ran the camera as best i could.  once i got the camera settled on the tripod, i did not move the telefoto in and out, but yet the object appeared to move in close and move out without the benefit of the telefoto.  we asked other conference attendees who were camping by us to look at it.  they saw the same thing we saw, a glowing object that was moving in and out, close to us then far away.  it didn't look like a plane, or a star, or a satellite.  there was a square shaped apperature in the middle that moved like an 'eye' up and down and all around. this 'eye' movement was clearly visible when the object moved in close to us.  after about 30 mins, astoria saw lights coming out of the top of it, then the larger object went out of view, appeared to drop out of site.  we also saw a smaller 'ship' that was at 2:00 to the larger object, which when viewed in the spotting scope, appeared to be doing the same undulations and was filled with bright lights, as well, although it looked to be much further away than the larger object.  through the spotting scope the object appeared to divide into large brilliant lights, but in the camera viewfinder it wasn't as apparent, although the lights were still visible.  this occurred between 9:30 p.M and 10:20 pm.\r\n\r\nafter we lost sight of the object, we began to focus our attention on the lights on the mountain.  while we were viewing the western sky object, other conference attendees were watching mt. adams (which was to our right, or north) and their whoops and hoots could be heard on the tape as lights fired up on the mountain.  we did tape a few of the mountain lights but  they flashed on and off so quickly that it was hard to tape them.\r\n\r\naround 11:30 pm, we grew tired and went into the motor home to sleep.  around 2 or 3 am, i was awakened by a bright flash, like someone was outside the motor home and took my picture with a flash camera through the window.  i raised my head up to look outside the window and neither saw nor heard anyone outside.  i looked at the mountain and saw lights going off all over, left and right, above the tree line.  i laid back down and then saw a tiny brilliant light near the ceiling of the motor home.  i watched the light move three times before i called to astoria to wake her up and ask her if she saw it, too. this was not a frightening experience for me.  the light didnot emmanate fear.  if anything, i felt a calming, loving presence, which is why i wanted astoria to see it too. but, when i spoke .. called her, it just disappeared.

south of oregon state highway 22 (santiam hwy.) 70 miles east of salem and 60 miles northwest of bend.  i was getting ready to join four   of my friends shortly (who were still asleep in their tent) for a roped ascent of mt. washington whose summit is at 7,400 feet four miles to the southeast from big lake where we were camped along the road.  i was standing at the left edge of the gravel road gazing at the milky way.  at 4000 feet elevation you can see your hand from the reflection of starlight. polaris was to the north and some 45 deg altitude.  suddenly, i noticed what seemed like the trees were on fire low in the fir trees north along the left side of the road.  there were huge erratic flames lighting up the terrain.  in the next instance i realized there was no fire but a solid rectangular object.  its path being continuous, it appeared to rise, then veer to my right at an altitude of two-thirds the height of polaris to the horizon. the flames ���went out��� from its leading face - the narrowest of its dimensions, but were instantly replaced by two extremely brilliant ���tails��� or sheets of solid yellow- white ablation trailing behind the object that had the appearance of being ���turned on��� as it now streaked easterly some distance below polaris. these thin ���tails���- one for each edge, near and far- were like the lower part of a kite below the horizontal spar. the rectangular solid shape���s height was twice its width and the width was twice that of its thickness. this object was tilted with its top to the right (about 10 degrees) and somewhat away from me so that i could see its bottom. this orientation was maintained throughout. the white hot ablating ���kite- like tails��� lit up the entire area like daylight for a brief moment - about a second.  there was bright blue sky and the surrounding trees, road and campground were just like broad daylight.  the sky returned to dark with the stars in the background being blocked out by this object.  the white hot tail with trailing orange brown smoke ���turned off��� but the object continued on its eastward path its shape being clearly discerned by orange glowing lines at all of its visible edges. the space in between the lines was a dark gray brown. i could clearly see an orange seam across its middle as well.  finally, there were a few orange sparks curving backwards from its leading edges.  then the object disappeared into the night sky with only a wisp of trailing white smoke perhaps catching the first rays of the sun before dawn would bathe the campground sunlight in an hour and a half.  total time of sighting, 4-5 seconds.\r\n     please see the full report filed with ufo evidence in the archived reports for 1983. this object���s length was more than twice that of the diameter of the moon or 7/16th inch. (this my final assessment from using pencils and a template with various circles, sighting the moon, mt. st. helens (elev. 8600 ft.), 35 miles north, to mt. hood, (elev.11,240 ft), 70 miles east and various buildings i can see downtown five miles nw from my house. this object was under the apparent influence of earth���s gravity.  in the first moment low in the trees the object may well have been some 90 miles in altitude which is when the space shuttle begins to turn into a ���fireball���.  if you divide 90 miles(h) (and using a 30 deg angle from my eyes by the cosine of 60 degrees (the angle between the line to the object and down to the surface), you get 156 miles from my eyes to the object when it first encountered heavier air. let���s go back to the last sentence of first paragraph where i said that its tail was a ���wisp of trailing white smoke���. i did a little investigating of noctlucent clouds that have been observed before and after sunrise or sunset.  they are commonly about 50 miles altitude.  assuming the white smoke is similarly receiving the first rays of sunlight, at say 30 degrees altitude and 50 miles in height, so taking 50 and dividing by cos 60 deg, the distance of the object to me is 100 miles when its streaking eastward. then if we project from my eye a ratio of 7/16th   to 24 inches to ���l��� @100 miles, that gives 1.82 miles- the length of the object.    \r\n\r\n     my background is that of a land surveyor and associate engineer with my father who���s practice was in eugene for many years. i���m retired now.  my hobbies include mountaineering, backpacking, astronomy, weather, classical music, and ufo���s ���back to 1947.  i���ve obviously had plenty to think about this the past twenty-four years.

venus appears.  \r\nit didn't flash like anything i've ever seen in the sky. it only blinked once and went out, but for some reason it seemed to do so with purpose as if someone were behind it, flicking a light switch on and off.  it went dark quickly and there was nothing in the sky after the light was gone.  no distant star, no plane or helicopter.  just space.  it made my heart race.\r\ni've been trying to find out what it might be in terms of rational science and the closest is venus.  this wasn't anywhere near venus.  or the moon.\r\nthis may not classify as something you would note as a significant sighting, but in my 37 years on the planet (earth, by the way) i have never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\njon","distance":"Over One

spent manny evenings in the back yard to see if i would see one. this happened in garland, tx in the summer of either 1992 or 1993. as i remember, the luminous circular object came over the small, single-story house we lived in.  the house initially obstructed it from view but as it slowly moved over the house the object was entirely visible.  it didn't make any sound at all. it moved until it was directly overhead and then instantly was gone as if turning off a light.  i ran into the house to tell my parents and there was a \"special report\" by one of the local tv stations asking anyone who had witnessed the ufo to call in.  i believe the reporter was bob gooding.  my parents didn't call it in.  i don't have any way to estimate the size but it was a clear night and it had to be reasonably low in altitude since the house obstructed it initially.  i would discount the sighting due to my age at the time but it made a big impression on me and it still seems like it happened yesterday.  also, the \"special report\" should be easy to verify as far as the date.  i've done internet searches trying to get the date but i've never seen any other accounting of the sighting. i did hear many years later that it was a meteor that crashed, but i can tell you that doesn't fit the object i saw which would have caused substantial damage because it was the size of a 10\" saucer at about 8 feet.  so if you extrapolate that it would have to be at least 50 to 100 feet across.  there would have to be many people that saw it.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Las vegas, nv -- july of 1964 -- 7 months pregnant\r\n\r\ni'm in bed but can't get comfortable -- then i remember i've forgotten to take the water pill my doctor just prescribed. my grandmother had given me a lecture on how important it was to take the pills and i pull myself up reluctantly. i get up and go to the kitchen.  i see it's bright outside, through the curtain, and i think there must be a full moon.\r\n\r\ni take my pill and just as i put my glass on the counter the room begins to shake.  i've been in after shocks in california and i think it must be a quake.  it lasts for just a short time and i'm excited.  my husband has slept through the quake and i will have something to tell him the next morning.\r\n\r\ni start back to bed when i hear the noise.  it's like humming telephone wires but different, more insistent.  i check the oven, the refrigerator, the toaster. i listen to the telephone wires in my backyard, but it's not them. then i realize the noise is coming from outside.\r\n\r\ni go to the front door and open it.  my front door faces south onto a large vacant lot with more undeveloped acreage beyond that.  my front door does not face the homes across the street which are east of me. my duplex is on a rise with homes (east) and one home above me on the hill to the west.  it's quiet and a little isolated.\r\n\r\nwhen i open the door all these bright lights are in my face.  i can't see so i keep covering my eyes with my hands and keep trying to peek out.  i imagine there's been a car accident on the hill above me but there are no sounds.  when the lights dim there, in front of me in the vacant lot, sits a flying saucer.\r\n\r\ni don't believe in flying saucers.  i think i go into shock because the next thing i remember is standing in my living room with my hands to my sides clenched in fists.  i have no words.  i am fighting to get words. my mind is a blank slate and its been wiped clean. i am fighting so hard i can feel a fine sweat break out on my forehead.\r\n\r\nfinally i have words.  flying saucer and then flying saucer again.  i have words.  i go to the front door.  it's just sitting there.  red, white and green lights form a halo near the top and they are flashing on and off in rhythm.  it's humming.\r\n\r\ni watch it.  i look at my new princess phone -- but don't use it.  i think of waking my husband -- but don't.  all that separates me from the saucer is a tall wooden fence.  i go to the fence and peek over.  i can see the rim around it but i can't see the bottom.\r\n\r\ni look at all the houses around me.  no one is out but me.  i am alone, intrigued but afraid.  i go to the end of the fence but become afraid and go back.  i look for windows or doors on the craft but don't see any.  it glows from the inside. the lights keep going on and off and it keeps humming.\r\n\r\ni close the door, slap my face and open the door. it's still there and i keep watching.  i find myself leaning relaxed and comfortable against the door frame.  i am alarmed.  something is wrong.  how could i be so relaxed!\r\n\r\nthen i go to bed.  the next morning i think i tell my husband i saw some funny lights outside.  i avoid walking in the vacant lot which i used to use as a shortcut to a small convenience store.  perhaps i avoid it because i'm so far along in my pregnancy and there's a hill. \r\n\r\ni have a beautiful baby boy in september.  the next month i'm on my way to my surprise baby shower with my husband and another couple.  the woman said she had just read a book about flying saucers.  no sooner does she say the words \"flying saucer\" then i break out with my story.  they all look at me like i'm nuts.  this is the first time i remember seeing it.\r\n\r\ni try to find newspaper stories about the month of my sighting to see if anyone else saw it, but don't find anything.  i am a busy young mother and now i read everything i find about saucers.  seven years later i decide to see a hypnotist.  i tell him i saw a flying saucer and want to remember it.  he tells me he doesn't believe in flying saucers but thinks there might be a problem, something traumatic i don't want to remember.  i say fine, i think i saw a saucer but if you can show me differetly let's do it.\r\n\r\nlittle happens the first two sessions.  i am not a good subject and i get so nervous before the appointments that i'm almost bouncing off the walls.  at the third session i really go under.  he has me imagine i am walking down a corridor of offices.  my name is on one of them and when i get to it i am to open it and see my problem.\r\n\r\ni see myself walking and i see my name on the door.  i'm hesitant.  he tells me to open the door. i put my hand out to open it but then a hand, just a hand, comes out from the right and slowly and methodically erases my name from the door in a slow circular motion.  he keeps telling me to open the door and i begin laughing.  i tell him i can't open it because a hand came out and erased my name.  he tells me i have a \"mental block\" against remembering.\r\n\r\ni decide not to go again.  first i'm too nervous.  i become a nervous wreck before each session and i'm wasting money.  those are the reasons i use not to go again.\r\n\r\nas the years pass the feelings of nervousness subside, coming about once a year around july, the month of my sighting. i tell my family doctor and he says he knows me to be an honest, normal person and there are some things we may never get the anwer to in our lifetimes.\r\n\r\ni do not know about the concept of \"missing time\" until i read more books on the subject of flying saucers.  i am not a flying saucer nut.  i attend no conventions or tell everyone about it, but i know what i saw.\r\n\r\ni am divorced and working for the court system in las vegas.  i run across a web page from someone called bob bigelow who is collecting information and i make contact.  i end up telling my story to one of his people and he asks if i would consider further action like hypnotism.  i say no.\r\n\r\nnow i'm 63 and watcing the larry king live show and they're talking about flying saucers.  i decide to contact mufon.  i feel time is running out to get this resolved and i've come to believe it's possible that my incident had missing time.  perhaps, on the small chance my incident might reveal more information, i decide to call.\r\n\r\ni can't say that i believe i was abducted.  i truly hope i wasn't, yet something is wrong.  why is this still affecting me so strongly and why did i go back to bed?  why was i leaning against the doorframe when i should have been on the alert?\r\n\r\neven as i write this i vacillate. part of me wants to find out and the other part is frightened.
