california state highway 46 between lost hills and wasco, around 2:00 am, i saw lights that appeared just like the lights at the end of wings of a 737 or 747 airliner.  they were fairly low to the ground, especially for a large airliner...Maybe 100 feet up, and i was not aware of any sizeable airports in the area.  the lights were solid white, and there was one at either end, and then one in the middle (looked just like the lights at the tips of an airliner's wings and one on the main fuselage itself).  what caught my attention is that the object then rotated itself 180 degrees, as if the plane did half a barrel-roll and was now flying upside-down.  this was a slow rotate...Took probably 3-5 seconds.  the object then dipped lower to the ground.  when i was at a vantage point to see the object again (about 10 seconds later) it had vanished.  i then saw lights of the same configuration quite a ways away in the same direction.\r\n\r\na few minutes later, i saw the same set of lights again.  this time, however, they were much closer to the freeway, and on the opposite side.  the object maneuvered slightly in the air, and the white lights on the end of the wings must have lined up and shone right at me for a brief moment, as if i were simply in its line-of-sight for a brief moment as in maneuvered...Not as if it was necessarily done intentionally.  these lights were very bright, however...Not enough to cause any kind of disorientation or loss of vision, but definitely brighter than any light i've ever seen on an aircraft...Especially from that distance (probably a 1/4 mile or so).  this object then did the same slow 180-degree flip.  this time, there was a bit of ambient light beneath the craft.  as it flipped, you could see an obvious triangle-shaped body.  the middle light did not look to be on the main fuselage, but on the 3rd corner instead.  each of the 3 lights appeared to be coming from a recessed area on each of the three corners, and the lights looked to cover a large circular area.  each \"light\" was probably about 5-10 feet around.  the object then dipped lower to the surface, as did the first object, and out of view.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7608,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.6014838,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08062007-0010","longitude":-119.3360757,"occurred":1185606000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1185606000000,"summary":"Triangle-shaped

bark, opened the kitchen door, and almost directly over my head were these red, green, orange, and blue lights, literally changing positions in the sky. i stood and stared at these lights for about two or three minutes, not comprehending what i was seeing. there was no sound. i had the impression the lights were were connected to something that was fluid like. i then ran into the house and grabbed my digital camera, and went back outside and took some pictures. the object seemed very low in the sky, and didn't seem that large, but in the pictures it seems alot farther away. i took about 15 pictures in total. i could hear other people in the neighborhood observing it. after what seemed like about ten minutes, all the lights suddenly \"snapped\" into a v shape, and the object just \"slid\" across the sky. i heard the neighbors also observe the transformation. the object then hovered briefly, and then moved off towards the southeast, in the direction of the city of lancaster. to be honest, when i first saw it, i thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me. then, i thought maybe a ballon with lights on it. then i thought maybe a laser. then i realised, this is like nothing that could ever be duplicated, with any technology that i know of, and i was scared. i am still shaking. as for how the object moved, initially, there didn't seem to be any pattern or design to the order in which the lights were configurd. it was just twisting around. but when it snapped into the v shape, it had a \"sringiness\" to it, kind of like if you unfolded a hand fan, but it kind of bounced back on itself. after the object moved off, people in cars stopped and asked me if i had seen it too, and which way it went. apparently, lots of other, including my neighbors, witnessed this

the following: the larger \"mothership\" was zipping around then stopped, hovering almost directly high overhead. three(3) smaller spheres dropped out of the bottom,lit with multi-colored flashing lights running around the outside of their bodies. these three went in all directions, zooming, it was absolutely stunning.This lasted about two minutes and i asked the nasa fellows--\"now are you going to tell me these are little paper lanterns with candles inside?\" the three \"babies\" lined up beneath the \"mothership\" and one at a time went back up into the \"ship\" and in a blink it zoomed out of sight. the nasa people said they were just there to keep a check on weather. when i asked them what they thought these were- \"well, we can't deny what we saw.\" it was not paper

tonight. and again... my puppy scrambled for the back door to let her in. it was identical to the previous sighting of the other night. \r\n\r\nunfortunately... my previous report reads that it was traveling sw, which is incorrect. i was so shook up, that i meant to say it was traveling south east! i also meant to say in my previous report that the full moon was also located in the south east, not sw.\r\n\r\nagain, i will say it was 5 lights in a triangle formation. this time i truly observed that it was just above the tree tops, not 1/2 a tree higher like i reported before. again, the size of the lights do not conform to my aviation knowledge. again, there wasn't a sound to be heard.\r\n\r\nwhat i (thought) i noticed the other night was that there was no cricket noises. but i couldn't

silent, crickets and all.\r\n\r\ni would also like to add that back in the 80's i lived on a usaf base, and my ex was an air traffic controller. plus, considering my past work history of working for

skies.  it's been active again.  i was watching what few clouds that were forming when i caught out of the corner of my eyes two objects coming from behind a small sparce cloud.  at first i thought it was two helicopters, side by side.  they came from the north out of the cloud then turned to the east.  they were very high in the sky, much higher than the normal airplanes we see.  my guess is about 20,000ft or higher. they flew very prescision and the turn was not normal...Too tight & smooth.  no sounds or trails, silent.  the color was gray/white, no glare or reflection.  we went to get a better view point, when we looked up and they were gone or out of sight.  they were fast! this lasted approx. 10 seconds.  when discussing this with my husband, who has better eyesight, said they were more of a cylinder shape, not at all like a helicopter. \r\n\r\nmy background is that i have always watched the skies for many reasons.  due to many personal sightings and living next to the north

kids experienced and was not going to report it at all as i did not and still do not want to be clasified as a nut.\r\nuntil i saw a special on i think it was news channel 5 about mufon and  kim shaffer.   i had to tell someone of this experience, could not hold it in any longer, and found out i could post without giving contact information have decided to post this for others to see.\r\n\r\nbelow are the original text of what happened in murfreesboro some time in the fall of 2006 sent to  mr kim shaffer\r\nmufon tn state director\r\n\r\nhi kim,\r\n          i don't really know if you want to hear about this as i have\r\nno actual pictures of this incident.   i still am kicking myself in the seat of the pants every time i think about the fact that i did not film this incident, when right inside the house not 75 feet away, a fully charged video camera was available.   this happened in late 2006, had to be in the fall, as the temp was just perfect.   i got home from work and as usual went to the tv to check out today's news.   shortly after that, i would say around 5:15 in the evening, i got up, went into the kitchen to just look out the window and check on both my sons age 10 years and nine years.   i looked out the window both my boys were standing beside each other not even moving a muscle looking up in the air, they were both just standing there looking up.    so i bent down lower so i could look out the window to see what they were looking at, wow, i thought to myself, what is that, a jump jet maybe, but hovering in our backyard, hold it, if that's a jump jet, where is the noise, there is no noise and this thing is hovering at or less than tree height.  that was what was going through my mind, this house cannot possibly block the sound of a jump jet, so i immediately headed toward the back door and opened it, stepped out back, looked up, and at this point i will have to apologize to everyone in the world for not going and getting the video camera or\r\nany camera.   i am so stupid for not getting a camera but you have to\r\nrealize, i am looking up at something and my mind is moving a million\r\ncalculations a second trying to figure out just how and what the hell is hovering over my back yard.   my thoughts, were going crazy, looking over every square inch of this thing just amazed, amazing.   i went on down the steps to where the kids were, watching this thing the whole time, its chrome color, definitely metallic, not a balloon or any lighter than aircraft, this thing was metal and large, this thing is not moving, not moving i mean not moving!!!. \r\ni was so amazed by this,  i love technical things, i could not take my\r\neyes off it.    one reason i could not take my eyes off it is its close enough that i know this is metal, but incredible, well, how can explain it, lets say parked.   but parked in the air, that's a better\r\ndescription than hovering, no sound at all, and i am watching this thing and looking as hard as can for any movement and i mean any movement, but there is no movement what so ever.     so again i am still kicking myself for not going and getting a camera, but i guess i was so amazed by what i am seeing, a metal object, almost chrome in color, the shape like an oblong cylinder, size about the size of a greyhound bus, and it is parked in mid air.   and i do not know how to get this across more clearly, this thing was parked.  in mid air!!!\r\nand again i think over and over and over again and apologize to everyone and anyone interested in stuff like this for not even once thinking about getting a camera while this was going on, but kim, this thing was so perfectly parked in mid air,  i was just in awe of how it could do it, and i think my mind was just trying to figure out, oh, who knows what my mind was trying to figure out, i was just standing there  gazing in unbelief of what i was looking at.    this was like this for i guess about 4 minutes from the time i first saw it out the window, from the time it started to move.    standing there so close looking at it parked in mid air, no sound, no wind, metal object not making, well, you could have heard a pin drop.   no side vectoring from any secret military, this thing was right at or just below tree level and there was not a leaf one moving.    then the object just all the sudden started to move.   still no sound at all, this thing was just sliding along, i cannot explain how perfectly sliding through the air at a very low speed toward our back yard then at the back of the yard turned so cool, what i mean is it turned direction in such a cool way, i knew this thing was getting ready to leave here.   so knowing it was getting ready to get out of here, i kept my eyes on it and started yelling for my wife to come out, the back door was open, i kept yelling at her to come out, she took her time, i still watched thing sliding through the air going toward nashville super speedway. my wife finally got outside, i got her to go around to the front of the house with me, she saw this thing leaving but the object was so far off by this time, she said what was it a plane. so she really did not see what me and my sons saw.   i guess what drives me crazy now, is i wonder, as i know, or i think i know we do not possess anti gravity technology.   and all the stories of people i use to think were crazy, well, i don't know now, i have to revisit every story i ever heard, and some of the stories i use to think were nuts and no way, well, not so nuts or crazy anymore.    i know what i saw, and both my sons saw it too, what we saw was defying gravity, there is no other way to explain it.  and i do not meaning hovering or lighter than air, i am saying this object could not have been anything less than anti gravity.    the way it turned when it started moving could not have turned that way by any other force than gravity, the turn was to smooth and swift non stop and this object was then going in another direction. i cannot say this thing was from a different world or planet, and i cannot say this thing is from a different time as in time travel, i cannot tell you this was a military secret aircraft.\r\nwhat i can tell you is this thing was metal, chrome color, defied\r\ngravity and there is no doubt in my mind that this was anti gravity, and that this thing was under intelligent control, and me and my kids were so amazed watching it we could not blink, much less think about getting a camera.          so, if your interested, i guess now i join the crazies, all the stories i use to hear and say man that guys lost it, well, i know i haven't lost it, and to others that think i am nuts with this story, all i can say is if you see one you will know.   and if you have not seen one, yes, you will think this is nuts.\r\nwell, that's about all, if you would like to talk to me and my boys\r\nabout this sometime, that's cool, guess we could have coffee sometime\r\nand you could kick my butt for not grabbing a camera.   god, if i only\r\nwould have got a camera, i would have had the best, closest, clearest\r\npictures of this craft than anyone in the world has have ever seen.\r\nbut i will have to live with my stupidity of not.\r\ni am a believer now, and so are my kids.   there is some kind of anti\r\ngravity craft here on this planet, not an illusion, a controlled craft, we have seen it.   who's it is, could not tell you.  but it could only be anti gravity craft, there is just no other explanation, none you could convince me of that could have allowed this craft to do what we saw. well, that's it, for what its worth, that's our story and i'm sticking to it. \r\nhave a good one kim, \r\nbelow is info for you only, please do not disclose my contact info below to anyone else.\r\nthanks \r\n\r\n(after more email correspondence with kim, i sent a follow up email with some details i left out of original)  \r\n\r\nquite different indeed, \r\n i am going on 47 years old, have seen ufo shows, clippings, etc..\r\nalways fascinated by these shows, but in reality, when watching, thought were just nutty people and or really good pranksters with digital media. some did fascinate me, but still had nothing but doubt every time i watched one of those shows or specials. and some of the videos i have seen over my life, i would say, bull, that's not real, but is an excellent hoax. now though, after seeing what i saw, what do i do now? i find myself revisiting some of those old stories and film clippings, some where the objects were just perfectly still in mid air and think, maybe not a hoax. or what about the guy, can't think of his name, but said he was hired to reverse engineer alien craft at roswell, i thought what a great made up story, that guys nuts, but a good cool geeky story.  all those things looked and sounded like someone had lost there ever loving mind. but now after seeing what we saw, your mind starts to question, which of those many sighting, stories, pictures, are real. i know there is still allot of real nuts out there, but not all of them. as if i had grabbed a camera and actually shot video of it, it was so amazing that anyone watching would have said what i use to say, wow, that's really cool, pondered it, maybe even rewind it a few times and watch it again, but in the back of there mind they probably would have been saying how the hell did he pull off such a good video hoax. ha....Ha, reminds me of what my dad use to say, what goes around comes around. anyway, you are correct, if i have been on this earth for near 47 years, and this was first time to encounter such an amazing feet of technology that as most people know does not exist, i should just treasure the moment as if it took 47 years of my life to see it one time, odds are not very good at ever seeing something like this again in my life time. one very important thing i left out of original, as if i already in the nut club might as well tell you this part too. the object, when it was stationary, no lights nothing, but when it started to move and then made that fantastic turn at the back of the yard, just after it turned a light started flashing, now after it turned this craft was, i would say no more than 25 to 30 feet off the ground, now its going behind my trees at this altitude but while sliding along it is slowly climbing, the light was, how could i say, a real neat greenish \r\nyellow light. remember, this is in bright daylight, this thing is\r\nflashing, flashing around the same tempo as any airplane strobe would\r\nflash. that part of it has me thinking that this is some kind of\r\nsuper high tech military aircraft of some sort.  but that's my brain\r\nsaying, why the hell would aliens have a strobe to warn other aircraft. (*** i remember what i told the kids when it was all over and we settled down from the experience, they asked, dad, what was that. my reply was, son, i don't know, we do not have anything known, or that i know of, or heck anyone knows of that can perform what we just saw. i will say one thing, if it is some kind of secret military craft, i sure hope its ours.***) well, you can keep me on record as reporting this, nothing else i can add, and i do not care if this info is read in discussion, radio, or net, but keep my name confidential, just replace my name with, (a man and his two sons from murfreesboro saw etc.... etc.... etc..\r\nbut for the record, wanted to go on record for whats its worth and\r\nreport this for documenting. and if ever the need arise, i swear to\r\nyou i could pass a polygraph on everything i have told you in this email and the prior email.\r\nout of curiosity, if these things are able to move about and be\r\nstationary in mid air, just how often and how many are around not even\r\nbeing seen, what i mean is, after seeing this, for the last year since\r\nseeing this, now when i am outside, driving, going to and from here to\r\nthere, i am always looking at tree top level now hoping to catch a show like that again, but then you start to realize, geesh, our line of site is not very far at all if the craft is flying at, just above and or below tree level. just an amazing memory of a once in a lifetime event now?  i sure hope not, but thats probably the fact jack. \r\nthats it this time, promise, from one nut to anutter, later nutty\r\nbuddy. \r\nbelow are some interesting facts of what we saw, not all sent to kim in email.\r\n\r\nobject can remain parked in mid air with no sound at all no movement.\r\nwhen turning, the front of this object popped up slightly, i know this because the sun was behind me, and when it popped up slightly i was in a position that allowed me to see the sun reflect off the top front of this craft.  before the front of the craft popped up in the front, it had already stopped at the back of the yard, so popping up had nothing to do with it stopping, so not sure at all how it even stopped.  the popping up of the front was more to do with the turn and at the same time it popped up in the front, the craft also tilted to the left, and started to slide into its new trajectory loosing altitude as it did this.\r\nafter the turn and in new trajectory, a brilliant greenish yellow light started flashing located center top of the craft is the best i can remember location of light.  this light and color is hard for me to explain as i have never seen anything in my life flash so bright and the color, well, greenish yellow does not give the color of the light or its intensity justice.\r\ncraft when on new trajectory is gaining altitude while maintaining level flight...  meaning,, the front of the craft not pitched up at all from what i could tell but craft still slowly gaining altitude while sliding along with absolutely no sound and absolutely no indication of any power source at all.  at one point i was even wondering if it was going to clear the second set of trees it was headed toward because i could see no pith in the craft to indicate a climb, but it did clear them and continue on.\r\ncolor of craft best i could descripe would be steel or stainless steel, somewhat same color as the old mig fighter jets steel.  dark color steel but very polished shiny.\r\nthis was a very close encounter approximate distances while viewing, 125 feet from actual object at the most while stationary,  300 feet from object when it exited the other side of the wooded area behind my house.\r\nso anyone trying to debunk this, i ask, if you were standing 125 feet or less from a greyhound bus, could you tell if that bus had wings at this distance?    i actually think at one time we, (we being both me and the boys),  were less than 75 to 80 feet from this object.   sorry to the debunker's, but there is know way and i mean know way you can debunk what me and my kids saw.   but i can understand why you do not believe, as before me and the kids saw this, i believed you, you being the debunker's.     but after seeing this craft at a close distance, i am telling you your wrong.   there is something going on, and even though some can be debunked, i am here to tell you that something is going on and you cannot debunk mine, never, sorry, i was to close to this, it is real.  my regret is that i did not film this as this surely would have started a serious investigation if this craft is not military.  \r\ni did finally take some time to draw a series of drawings of the craft so that my kids would never forget what we saw that day.    kim is holding, i asked kim to keep these drawings private as while i have been doing my own investigation of this, have found no other craft or picture of craft of what we saw.   my thinking on asking kim not to show these pictures, as again, this is real, surely someone else will report this object, so told kim if these drawings were made available to the public, how would we know if the next reporting of this craft would be real.   so that is why i made decision to ask kim to keep the drawings private for now.  there are some other details that kim has that i have decided not to add to this report for same reason.  when other people come forward and describe this object, it will not be because they have seen this craft posted somewhere else.  \r\nkim has honored this request.    and may i add it was a pleasure speaking with kim who takes this matter serious.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

my first sighting by any means.  if one pursues this case i shall speak all that i have experienced.  lastly i want to be put in contact with stanton friedman and linda moulton howe.  if anyone else poses as him or her chooses to investigate this besides stanton and linda there will be problems.  i am a scientist will not trust none scientists or non professionals.  this cannot be made public at this time please!!!\r\n\r\nthe description:\r\n\r\ni and my girlfriend had gone to my mother's house who lives in oldham county.  we live together in jefferson county together.  my mother, (do not by any means contact here unless i otherwise say so!  she is a witness to nothing.) needed help with work around the house and we also saw it as a good chance to get some laundry done.  \r\n\r\nafter all of these events had concluded i began carrying bags of laundry and else out to the car with my girlfriend.  then after having put the items in the car i noticed how clear the sky was.  it seemed odd to me.  yet i live in louisville and it is always poluted with things that blind the night sky from us usually, key word usually.  my girlfriend asked me about the constellation peering through the trees directly toward the south.\r\n\r\ni told her that it appeared to me that we were looking at sagittarius.  we both commented on its brightness.  we both stood facing the southern sky for about 4 to 10 minutes.  she began to walk back toward the walkway leading to the front of the house.  the street runs north to south upon where it ends abruptly. \r\n\r\nat this time i noticed that a star at about seventy degrees ascension to the the right of of said constellation was in fact moving from its position in the northern direction.  i asked loudly of my girlfriend if she can see what i am seeing.  she confirmed that indeed she saw a star fly across the sky.  it seemed to exit the atmosphere at about the same ascension on the opposite side of the sky in the northern direction (north east).\r\n\r\nwhen we both began to focus on the sky more intently we then noticed three more objects in the sane area do the same exact thing.  i noticed that the stars began to occasionally blink with unusually long intervals.  during the third flying star another object seemed to move over us.  its lights strobed between three locations in the object.  it also had a red light that danced about it as well.  when it was directly over head its lights seemed to strobe most intensely.  \r\n\r\nyou cuold clearly see that the object was triangular and much darker than the sky itself.  i will say it was blacker than black.  it made no sound and seemed to be looking for something.  we noth watched this happen four more times.  we believed they were four objects like this at that moment.  yet it could have been less because not all four were in the sky all at once.  i should like to note that planes were also flying in the sky as the do every night.  these latter objects were sometimes higher than the planes but more frequently beneath the plane altitudes.  \r\n\r\n what i had not fully noticed until this point was the hum coming from the woods.  i have noticed this hum quite frequently as well.  yet it was coming from a feild that has only cattle.  like i said before i have had many experiences with this and have alot to say to stanton friedman if he contacts me.\r\n\r\nwe walked down the street and determined that the hum was in the field even though at the prior position it seemed indeterminant.  i saw that some light with no source seemed to illuminate the field behind the trees.  at that momemt i did not want to put myself in danger and began to walk home with my girlfriend.  i went in my mother's house and said goodbye to her. \r\n\r\nthis is where i became certain that what we saw was not standard.  we got in the car and headed out of the neighborhood.  at that point i realized that one of these objects were right above us to our right soome hundred feet obave the distant trees.  it slowly and silently moved and lowered in behind our car.  i got out of the car and looked at it.  it turned on all three white lights as it passed very close, almost tree level over the street heading north west.\r\n\r\nwhen we got to the neighborhood exit i saw it to our right and it flashed a light down below it that resembled lightening.  in otherwords the light seemed to have a nervous sytem.  and as usual ...This time we had no cameras.  \r\n\r\nwe were followed by a brand new suv with black tinted windows until we got on the expressway heading east.  the vehicle then put on its breaks and pulled over after we were gone.  \r\n\r\nthere are many other details to this case that when i get either stanton friedman or linda moulton howe i shall say.  i have been silent about these mattersa for so long.  i feel that its been long enough.  please forward this to these investigators as soon as possible please.  i want to help just as i need help.  lastly i need to be protected.  i am employed by the university here.  i hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nthank you.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

coming from the west.  it's elevation in the sky was slightly lower than the elevation i usually see commercial aircraft flying at.  it was brighter than the brightest star in the sky by a magnitude of 2 or 3.  at first i thought it was just an aircraft coming head on and the landing lights were on.  then as it came closer i noticed no navigation lights at all....No red or green flashes and no strobes.  as the object passed in front of my view, i watched closely for any sign it was a conventional aircraft.  there was no contrail, and absolutely no sound.  as it moved away from me, the light was just as bright from the back as it was from the front of the object.  i estimate the speed at about 450 to 600 mph flying at about 15,000 to 20,000 feet.  the object was about 2 miles out in front of me and traveling due east coming from the west.  it traveled in a perfectly straight line.  there were no elevation changes and no lateral changes.  i watched the object until it went out of sight about 30 seconds after i first noticed it in the sky.  i have over 30 years of being an aviation buff and can recognize many aircraft by their sound and shape alone.  this was no aircraft i have ever seen.  since the night was very clear and temperatures at 5,000 feet are around 60f, there were no clouds or other visual obstructions.  shortly after seeing this object go out of sight, there were two separate commercial jets that flew over.  both of these jets made the usual rumble and i could see their navigation stobes easily.  my wife was with me at the time and saw the object almost as long as i did.  although i have seen strange things in the sky before, and things like satellites reflecting the sun as they pass by, this is the first time i have felt confident enough to actually report a ufo sighting.  i hope there are others who reported it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

talking.  my wife noticed a star that seemed to be moving in the low eastern sky.  she pointed it out and i after a few seconds it started to move up and down.  we both confimed with each other that it was moving.  we watched it changed it's movement from up and down to left and right and reverse, diagonal and reverse, and a lateral zig-zag pattern from left to right and reverse.  each time confirming with each other that it had moved.  i know that if the human eye stays fixed stars for over several seconds, they will start to oscilate, an optical illusion.  but all the stars you stare at will move as a group due to this optical illusion.  i came to the conclusion that this object was not a star based on that fact.  this object moved independly within a small cluster of about seven stars that did not move when this object moved about.  what was even more fasinating was that as this cluster of stars moved slowly across the night sky, this object remained in the proximity of the cluster and continued to move about.  during the time period we observed the object it seemed to flash some soft light to the south; white, white, red, white, white, red, white, white in intervals of about five minutes apart.  after observing the object for approximately ninety minutes, it stopped moving and seemed to take its fixed place among the small cluster of stars.  we also came to the conclusion that this object had to be outside of earth's atmosphere and the distances it must have been moving within its proximity had to have been hundreds of miles or more with each jump.  it seemed as though this object was disguising it self as a star and it was having problems stablizing its position in the magnetic field around the earth.  of course,that's only speculation.  but, it definatley was a ufo.
