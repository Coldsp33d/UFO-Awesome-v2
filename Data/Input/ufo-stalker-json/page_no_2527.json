northern virginia. we recapped the day by watching one more cycle of news and then retired upstairs to read stories with the children at about 9:00 (i believe).\r\n\r\nat that time, we lived under a normal approach vector for iad (washington-dulles int'l airport); the silence without air traffic that evening was remarkable.  we had been reading with our boys for 15 or 20 minutes when the sound of a high-performance jet engine could be clearly heard approaching from the east at very high speed; in a moment it roared over our neighborhood at about 2000 feet (i could see its nav lights and beacon through the top of our arched window). several seconds, perhaps as many as ten, went by and before the jet's engine faded away another could be heard approaching at the same pace. it too roared past on the same heading as the one before it.\r\n\r\ni excused myself from reading, picked up my vhf/uhf scanner from my nightstand, and activated my preset bank of military frequencies.  in the absence of other chatter, i picked up the two aircraft almost instantly.  their identity was easy to determine because they were identifying nearby landmarks as they established a reconnaissance pattern. what was clear was that they were searching for an unauthorized aircraft that was eluding them, dulles approach, and the regional faa center. the pilots seemed to establish sporadic visual contact with the aircraft but -- within a minute of my listening -- lost track of it.\r\n\r\nlistening to the scanner, i left the house and within two and a half minutes ascended a man-made hill that rises to tree top level and above the roof lines of the nearby houses. from there i listen for another seven to nine minutes to the ensuing radio traffic.\r\n\r\nas i recall, the military pilots briefly reacquired the aircraft on an eastward heading and then lost it again. during that time they discussed what type of aircraft it might be but were unable to draw any conclusion.\r\n\r\ntwo military helicopters dispatched from dca (washington national) joined the operation. they were identified as \"eagle 1\" and \"eagle 2\". i believe that the jet pilot in command radioed eagle 1 saying, \"we'll try to drive him to you.\"  my recollection is that the choppers were between arlington and falls church, virginia when they spotted the unknown aircraft. they both commented on its speed and then eagle 1 asked eagle 2 if he could id (identify) the aircraft.  eagle 2 replied that he could not and that he had \"never seen a light pattern like that before.\"\r\n\r\nat this time, an aircraft controller broadcasting from a frequency used by andrews air force base announced that an observation aircraft had just achieved operational altitude. from subsequent chatter it seemed to answer the description of an awacs platform. the awacs crew announced that it was fully operational and \"could see the heat plumes coming off the [generator] stacks on the choptank [river].\"\r\n\r\nvery shortly after the lead jet pilot asked eagle 1 if he was still tracking the aircraft. eagle 1 replied that it was \"headed for the [potomac] river\". the jet aircraft had by then overtaken the choppers and the jet wingman asked his lead \"do you have it?\" there was a pause and then the tense reply \"it's directly over the capitol\" and then words to the effect of \"i'm on it.\"  there was a pause and the wingman asked, \"you got it?\", the leader replied, \"no, i lost it -- i think it's headed south down the river.\" the leader asked the awacs if he was tracking any southbound aircraft. \"negative\" replied the awacs, then added something like \"it's clear from here to richmond [virginia].\"\r\n\r\nthe controller on the tower frequency asked the lead jet pilot if he could identify the unauthorized aircraft. the pilot replied, \"negative.\" the controller paused and asked, \"are you declaring a ufo?\" there was no response. the controller asked again more clearly but the leader only replied with a quiet \"no.\"  eagle 1 and 2 declared their return to dca.\r\n\r\nwhat was singular in this event was the very real frustration and anxiety of the pilots in dealing with an aircraft that was both unknown and operationally superior. i have never heard anything to substantiate or validate this experience. i can only assure you that my hearing is excellent and i am not given to exaggeration or falsehood -- indeed, it has taken me six self-conscious years to log a story that most people will likely regard as fiction.\r\n","distance":"Over One

they saw, they saw the same thing that i did. i then asked atc if they had an aircraft at 39,000' and they said no. i told them that i would likely be departing my altitude and heading soon. they asked what i saw and i told them. they asked if it was showing lights and i told them that i didn't see lights. there was a flying tigers 747 and a western dc-10 below me at 33,000' and 35,000'. i

they said no. \r\na weans airlines b-737 was eastbound and we saw it and it was showing it's lights. the 2 airliners asked me several times if i could help them see it but it was difficult because there were no clouds or anything that i could use as a reference. plus the altitude difference made the task more difficult. finally, after asking several times, the atc asked them if they saw it and one of them was in the process of saying no when someone in their cockpit said, \"there it is, it is something solid\". then they pointed it out to the other airliner. i can't remember which one saw it first. it looked somewhat like a straight line or cylinder that would tilt to the north but not move from it's course and then it would sometimes appear to be round. i'm only guessing here but if he had been disk shape and tilting away from our path of flight, it would appear to be a straight cylinder but if it tilted away or toward us, it would appear round. i simply do not know. atc said that they would send someone from elmandorf afb to check. awhile later the thing seemed to disolve. if it fled away, it did so at such a tremendous speed that it seemed to shrink to nothing. all three

to witness ufos.  about 2:00 pm stan romanek (one of the featured speakers at the event) was near the parking area outside the presentation building and was excited as he told me about the ufo he had just witnessed and taken some pictures of.  he was really excited that he got pictures of it.  he pointed out a spot above a patch of clouds near where the object was about 4 fingers (at arms length) above the distant mountain horizon in the northwest sky.\r\n\r\nhe mentioned what he saw to a couple other people earlier and walked across the field to the rv he was staying in about 1:30 pm.  he was going to put the image on his laptop computer and bring it back so we could all see what the picture looked like.  he returned and set the laptop up on a table outside under the shade of a canopy of an rv set up to serve food.  as he got the computer set up i continued to scan the skies, especially in the area he had seen the object.  we were excited to see that he did get a picture of it.  it was white in color and although it was a digital image at a distance you could make out the classic saucer shape with a bubble protrusion on top.  a few of us were taking turns looking at the image because the brightness of reflection of the sky in the monitor made it difficult to see well unless you stood directly in front of it.\r\n\r\nwhile about 5 or 6 people were marveling at the picture stan had just taken (with a nikon coolpix 6 mega pixel digital camera) i saw what appeared to be the same object in the same location off in the distant n/w horizon.  i would guess the distance to be at least 35 miles away based on the distance of the mountain range it appeared to be over.  it was very white and was dramatically accentuated by the darker blue sky background.  it was also about 4 fingers (arms length) above the distant mountaintop to the northwest about the width of my pinkie finger above the white cloud bank below.\r\n\r\ni described the location as i pointed to the object for the others to identify also.  they were as excited as i was to realize for themselves how fascinating it was to watch.  you could easily see that the object was not a cloud, balloon or plane.  it stood perfectly still and the distinct sharpness of the edges eliminated it being a cloud as you could compare it to other clouds in the area.\r\n\r\nwe all watched as the stationery object defied cloud movement and all other rational or logical cross references we could use.  someone noticed an identical object about a pinkie width directly above the one we were watching.  the one above slowly moved downward toward the original object until it was directly over the other nearly touching it. \r\n\r\nafter watching the object for a minute or two to eliminate any plausible explanation for what i was witnessing i went to get my camera and took 3 pictures.  the 5 mega pixel kodak photos were not distinct as the ones stan took and only showed a white spot with no definition.  at that time i

window to see what he was barking at. shocked to see a large well lit top-shaped object flying west to east over our farm and just south of our house heading over the rideau river. was too upset to wonder what it was. just stared. object was well lit in relief by the full moon behind it. originally thought dog must be barking at the moon but he never really barks and being a bulldog really can't that well ... its a lot of effort for him and he is always quiet which is why i even got up to see what he was on about.\r\n\r\ni would guess the object was quite large, quite high up - 2000 feet? - could not really tell - was large ... object was greyish where the moon was illuminating it - definitely darker than the surrounding sky, had many bright lights on bottom in rings - random big square yellowish lights - and had a few red lights and other smaller white lights sprinkled over the surface randomly. could not see the top of it from my angle. no lights blinked. object did not spin, windows were wide open last night and object made no noise. moved very slowly eastward. watched it for about 5 to 10 seconds but seemed longer. i was really upset at what i saw .. i remember saying wtf out loud and went to another window on the other side of the bedroom for a better look as tree blocking my view from first window i viewed it from but object did not reappear on other side ... i continued to look for a few more minutes but saw nothing ... my dog stopped barking after i lost sight of the object and i went back to bed. looked at the clock and time was exactly 12:54 am so i saw something at 12:52-53. really upset me to see this, have no idea what it was and i had a lot of trouble going back to sleep. really tired today. searched the internet today to see if anyone else saw something last night and found this site to leave this message.\r\n\r\nthe object was not a plane - too low for that - shape was all wrong. shaped like a child's top but did not spin .. had a lot of

10:05 pm.  as we crested coyote summit we noticed a glow above the horizon to the southwest (later identified as the glow of the lights of las vegas).  while conjecturing about the source of this glow we noted a white flash of light about the size and brightness of a bright star approximately 3-5 degrees above the mountains about 10 degrees north of the glow on the horizon.  initially we thought it might be an airplane but quickly discarded the idea due to the lack of conventional lights and the time lapse between flashes which were about four seconds apart.  after about 3 flashes a second source of light appeared about 10 degrees to the north of the first one.  at this point we pulled to the side of the road and watched the lights.\r\n\tover the next five minutes or so we watched as several others joined the first two flashing lights.  as they grew in number the lights began moving west along the northern horizon just a few degrees above the mountains.  the only change was in the frequency of their flashes, which began to speed up to about one to two seconds apart.  \r\n\tsuddenly, a red ball of light about three times the size of the white flashers and much brighter, flared into being just north of the glow on the horizon.  the red ball was a steady glow that lasted about four seconds as it slowly descended toward the horizon but winked out just before dropping down behind the hills.  \r\n\tthe white flashers continued to increase in number and at one point we counted seven observable at a time; there may have been as many as 14 - 21 in the sky at the peak of this phenomenon, but do to their blinking nature, we could only count seven at any given time.  we also noticed that the white flashers seemed to begin pairing off, with the flashing alternating within each pair.  also, the flashing of each pair changed speed so that each pair seemed to be on a different time frequency from its neighbors.\r\n\tabout five minutes after seeing the red flair, we observed a second red light, identical to the first, which repeated the same maneuver a little farther to the north.  to this point, we had been watching this aerial show for about ten minutes.  during this time, the white flashers had been moving north along the edge of the sky.  we continued to observe these lights as they traveled across the northern skies to the west, then, about fifteen minutes into our observation, they reversed their direction and began moving back to the east.  \r\n\tas the main body of these pairs of lights reached a point in the northern skies just to the east of us, we observed three more of the bright red lights, but this time the maneuver was different.  the red lights all maintained a horizontal flight.  the first red light flared on, then, about a second later, another appeared just to the east of, and in front of, the first. as the two traveled east, they were joined a second later by a third appearing just in front of the second.  at the same instant that the third light was flaring on, the first was fading out, so that only for the briefest instant were all three visible.  a second later the second faded out followed shortly by the third.  the total observation time of these three red lights was about five seconds, and they appeared to be precisely spaced and timed in duration.  the three red lights traveled at about the speed of a small plane.  after the last of the red lights went out, the white flashers continued traveling east and, over the next 10 minutes or so, they too began winking out.  as the last pair winked out, i checked my watch.  it read 10:35, the total observation time was about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n       after about five minutes we became aware of a second glow, far down the valley; below the mountains and much smaller and fainter than the one on the southeastern horizon and much closer.  an inverted cone of light shot up toward the sky from the glow.  finding my binoculars, i could see there were actually three distinct sets of lights, each one appeared similar to the other two.  on the bottom was a band of white light topped by two pulsating balls of light, one red and one blue, side by side.  emanating upwards from this was the inverted cone of white light we had noted without our binoculars.  all three sets of lights were the same, except that the cones of light seemed to be waving about the sky like searchlights, all sweeping in different directions.  \r\n\tthey slowly approached our position.  as we watched, the white band of light on each object coalesced into a pair of lights.  a few moments later, as they streaked by, we could see that they were three, white \"jeep cherokee\" type vehicles carrying light bars over the cabs with red and blue flashing lights and small spotlights, the latter aimed up at the sky.  all in a moment they were there and gone, disappearing from sight behind us over coyote summit.  \r\n\twe discussed the trucks with their searchlights and decided they must either have come from the air base or possibly a local law enforcement substation.  either way, we couldn't see how they could not be connected with the aerial display we had witnessed.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

and at night; and watched the sky for a couple minutes before i saw a steady white light in the sky in the east.  i first thought it was a plane, so i trained my camera on the light, viewed it and decided it didn't look like a plane.  i decided i would film it and see what i had captured after uploading it to my computer.  i pressed rec and started filming. i tried to keep the object which was blinking and moving about, centered in the viewfinder and followed it until it disappeared completely.  the object looked like a circular light, then yellow and red in the viewfinder. after a few seconds, i pressed rec again to stop filming.  i couldn't hear any plane sound and i have no idea how far away it was.  it was a distance because i zoomed in to get the pictures i did. i captured these stills from the video i took.  one shows an entity inside the disk. now my feelings and reaction after viewing them on the computer as stills is total shock, fright and

told my wife to take pictures of them to. the ones in the sky above us seamed to be waiting on the outher ones i know it sounds crazy but thats what it looked like. when they where all together the moved away towards the east they went behind the clouds and we never saw them again. i reported what we saw to the local press the ran a short stoey on them,outher people saw them to. i also reported it to the m.O.D. here in the uk,they said that they had not herd anything or any reports of strange objects in the sky. i dont know what it was we saw but they made no sound and where not aircraft

appeared to have stopped working, i was able to turn my phone on after the ufo left. i searched for the object that the ufo dropped but all i found was an empty field. when i first saw the oject i thought it was a comet but its movements and the lack of parts breaking off it made me think twice. my first thoughts were \"cool a comet\" but then i figured it was a ufo so then i thought \"cool a
