sky-watching, and i saw what appeared to be a half-deflated mylar balloon.  this is a fairly windy area, and i have seen many things float by.  things such as balloons, both helium and mylar, newspapers, spider webs, plastic bags, and paper bags.  birds sometimes appear to be inanimate objects.  \r\n\r\nin other words, i make an attempt to identify the objects as 'ordinary things' first.  therefore, i was fairly convinced that this was simply a mylar balloon which was losing its helium.  \r\n\r\ni had my binoculars (16x50) but could not focus on the object.  it was silver, and through my binoculars it looked to be somewhat shaped as a 'hershey's kiss' on its side.  or possibly an acorn.  it was hard to focus on it, as it kept turning or reflecting light or giving off its own.  i don't know.\r\n\r\nanyway, i kept looking at the object.  it was stationary at one point for about 3 minutes.  then it gradually came to be about directly overhead.  then it passed to my left, and i lost it.\r\n\r\nabout 1 minute later, it appeared again, but this time on my right, and then gradually went again over to my left.\r\n\r\nthen it did something no mylar balloon of which i am aware can do:  it started 'bouncing'.  that's what it appeared to do; bounce up and down as if on a yo-yo string.  that's when it disappeared.\r\n\r\nbut then something happened which let me know for sure this was no mylar balloon.  about 2 seconds after it disappeared, 4 lights immediately appeared.  then another.  and another.  possibly another, it was hard to tell as they were then moving in a perfectly straight line and going awfully fast.  it was hard to focus and keep count at the same time.  but at least 6 cylindrical shaped objects moving at a high rate of speed in a southeasterly direction.  i was able to keep then in view for about 15 seconds, after which time they disappeared.\r\n\r\nthis was approximately 7:40 in the evening.  no clouds in the sky.  still light.  some haze, but not much.  \r\n\r\nthis reminds me of the sighting earlier this week where someone reported two rows of 100 craft.  this was one row, and only 6.  but it was still something to see.\r\n\r\ni do have a queston:  is there someone who would know if the earlier 'hershey's kiss' was possibly a beacon or locator of some type?  it's just kind of coincidental that it disappeared exactly when the other objects 'popped in'.\r\n\r\n\r\nas to more events, i'll keep you posted.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

it was a clear summer day. i noticed a reflection in the sky to my left. i looked over and upward and saw a flying disc in the sky. it was moving in such a way as to not be hindered by gravity, momentum or inertia, moving as easily and quickly as shining a flashlight on a nearby wall. the craft was flying towards a cessna aircraf'ts windshield. it moved forward and back. it was extremely close at times. the aircraft's pilot reacted by diving the plane and trying to avoid a mid air collision. this game went on for several seconds as my mom aunt and i observed. it was pretty horrific watching this. the craft, as i call it, had a sort of pulsation coming from it. kind of like an unknown power system was engaged. i don't remember seeing any ionization. i saw the craft clearly. it was silver or almost bare metal in color. it was bigger than the aircraft. i saw it from the side as it never turned on its side. i assume it was round, but don't know for sure. i knew in my head that what i was seeing must be what many people had said a ufo or flying saucer must be. i'm now 37 years old and have been wondering if we can find the occupant or occupants in the airplane. now, that would be a real interesting interview at the other end of  the sighting. \r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\ni quickly became a believer and a researcher in the ufology field.\r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\ni also have a second story to tell you. i'm not sure if its e.T. related, but i believe so. i go to a wooded area called russell park in the town of ilion located upstate new york from time to time, to walk on the trails. one night i snuck in late past visiting hours as i had done many times. it was december, about 3 a.M. when my friend and i decided to leave. we both were carrying flashlights. it was cold, maybe 20 something degrees. we were on one of the trails off of the main road when all of a sudden i felt a tremendous heat barrier. it was like being instantly thrown into the south carolinian countryside in august, and believe me i know i used to live there. my friend and i immediately took our coats off and were perspiring. the ground around us was bare mud and not snow and ice. the snow was melted in a circular pattern maybe about 12-15 feet in diameter. i made a joke to my friend that we must be in some sort of alien force field. i bent down with my flash light and saw footprints. i dont mean people and i dont mean animal. i've seen many animal footprints and nothing looks like these prints did. they had an instep and 3 pointy toes. i was pretty excited about it because i know nobody would be playing a joke on anyone in this remote area. my friend and i walked forward and were instantly cold again and had to put our jackets back on. i stepped in and out of this strange field. going from approximately 23 degrees farenheit  back to over 100. i took my hand and placed it in and out of this field. \r\n \r\ni decided to come back the next day to get one of the footprints. i remember there were about 20 or so. they seemed to stop as if something walking was talken back up. the tracks stopped in the middle of the snow. some of the tracks were in the snow and some in the mud.\r\n \r\nwhen i came back the next day with my girlfriend, it was raining. most of the tracks were washed away to almost nothing. i found 1 track. i tried to dig it up with a shovel. it completely broke apart. i was very upset. now no one would believe me. i could show you where this took place if you ever wanted to see. or i could video my story at the place. \r\n \r\ni'm trying not to overwhelm you with my stories. i do have one more i can tell you in the next e-mail, one that took place in south carolina.\r\n \r\n if you want to talk about these instances you call give me a call. \r\n \r\ni'm home in the early evenings everyday......\r\n \r\n315 894 8224\r\n \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My event happened several years ago...I have not reported it to anyone yet but friends and family members and thought i would talk about it now. this took place in phoenix, az in 1986. it was in the month of june and the time was around 2:30am, not sure anymore of the exact date. my wife and i were working at the warehouse for fry's grocery unloading (lumping) trucks. we had been doing this for about 8 months. at that time i was in school and we were working nights to support us. we were sitting outside the front gate of the warehouse waiting for the next truck to arrive, sitting in our car. the gate was about a 1/4 mile from the road. we relocated to california in 1987 and have not lived there since. \r\n\r\nit was early morning around 2-2:30am and there was a guard in the guard shack and one other worker, who was asleep in his vehicle. i was awake and relaxing, listening to the radio and my wife was sitting next to me in the car. at the time of this event i was smoking a cigarette and went to flick the ash out the window when i noticed a flash of red light that came from behind me at about a 45 degree angle. there were two buildings around 150-200 yards away from us. the two buildings were side by side with a driveway in between them. there was a parking lot in behind the buildings with a telephone pole set in about the middle of the lot toward the back end, this pole had a parking lot light on it which illuminated the lot. i looked over to the lot, where the flash came from and saw a glow coming from the ground. it was an orange-ish, reddish glow. at this time i was still sitting in my car with the window partially rolled down. my initial thought was, that there was a fire in the grass near the parking lot, so it caught my attention very quickly. i called to my wife and told her i thought there was a fire over near the buildings. just then a ball of fire (the only way i can verbalize what i had seen) shot out of the air and hit the area of the ground right near the orange/red glow on the ground. it appeared to come from about 100 feet in the air. as a recall there was just a partial moon that night and the sky was black, so at first, i did not see anything...This time i yelled at my wife that something was going on over there and did she see it. i said it was a ball of fire coming out of the sky and hitting the ground. just then another ball shot down from the sky and hit the ground again in the same area. that kind of scared me and i jumped out of the car and yelled at my wife to get out of the car, that something really weird was going on over by the buildings and could she see it. at that time i was now standing by the side of my car and was really looking hard to see where the fireballs were coming from. and then i noticed it...And just then it shot another fireball at the ground. \r\n\r\nnow just to mention that there was no visible signs of a fire, just a glow on the ground about maybe 5 feet high and 10 feet wide and was orange/red. there was no explosions or bangs heard. there was actually no noise at all. and then i really saw it...It was a craft about 50-100 feet above the ground. it was pure black and had no lights on it at all. it looked like a top hat...Yet it was a disc shape but with a center portion that kind of squared off and rose about 6-8 feet. i would guess that it was around 25 feet wide. it was hovering over the parking lot and the light at the lot was somewhat illuminating it. by this time, my wife was out of the car looking over toward the buildings and the it fired off another fireball. to describe these balls, i would have to say that they truly looked like a fireball, maybe 3-4 foot in diameter. just then my wife kind of yelled and said \"what the h*** was that?\" all i could say was that i didn't know. she walked around the car and held me as we gazed over toward the buildings...I then asked her if she saw it. she responded with \"the ball? yes! i did.\" and i said \"no\" the craft. she said, \"what craft\" and i pointed into the sky just about the buildings and said \"there\", \"do you see it\" its a ufo. just then she grabbed on to my arm and said \"oh my god, what is that??\", all i could say was that i didn't know. it then shot another fireball at the ground and we both jumped in fear. i asked if she saw that and she stated yes. i asked her if she saw what i was seeing floating above the buildings and she said \"yes, i see it...What is it?\" all i could say at that time was \"it's some kind of space ship.\" oh my god what were we looking at?? i/we had never seen anything like it before in our lives. \r\n\r\njust then while we were staring at the craft, it started to move toward the road that came to the guard shack at the warehouse. i said to her, \"it's starting to move, do you see it?\" yes! was the response. it started to slowly move in a southernly direction, when it got to the road we were both frozen in fear and shock and disbelief. just as it reached the road it turned westerly toward us and started coming right at us. it was so low that i could of hit it with a rock...It traveled toward us and my wife started to panic and i told her to stand still and don't move. she was so scared...And was grabbing on to me really hard. as it headed toward us i became aware that there was no noise what so ever...It was absolutely quite. everything started to go into slow motion at this point, and i remember looking over to the guard shack to see if the guard was seeing this and he was in his booth with the door closed and the light on. it was only moving about 1 mile an hour if that, and it continued on toward us.\r\n\r\nas we stood there in disbelief and amazement it flew directly over the top of us...No lights, solid black and amazingly quite. i could not see any windows or landing gear or engines or anything...I remember thinking that i was just frozen stiff and didn't understand why. i considered yelling at it and decided against it...Didn't want to make them mad or something i guess. it flew over our heads and flew down over the fence line of the warehouse. it seems like it got to just the about end of the fence line, around                                       500-600 feet away and turned to the left and then just shot up at about a 45-50 degree angle into the nights sky and was gone in nothing flat. again it made no noise what so ever. it took off so fast i couldn't believe it...Maybe around, i don't know, like a bullet being shot out of a gun or something like that...Just extremely fast....And then it was gone. strangest thing i have ever seen in my life...The reason i am now writing about this is because for years i have been reading articles and watching tv and videos about the subject and have never seen or heard about in the past a ufo shooting fireballs at the ground before...And i am most interested if anyone else has ever seen anything like what i have described. i believe i have seen pictures of a similar looking craft before and could still draw it our if needed.\r\n\r\nabout five minutes after our sighting, a truck pulled in and we jumped on it and went into the warehouse and unloaded it...Once we left around 7am we were to scared to drive in behind the buildings to see if we could see any burned spots or anything...It is something i have always regretted not doing.\r\n\r\nand this is my story of what we saw many years ago...\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

almost dusk and the sun was setting. there are hills and trees here which make a nice back drop. i had been visited on several occasions before and had recently had an encounter up close while my husband was at work. i reported this incident to 911 emergency and the female dispatcher said it was just after midnight. i explained the bright white and red light hovering over the grass then. i was scared and said, \"maybe it's deer hunters. the female dispatcher said, \"they wouldn't be hunting this late at night.\" i was scared but for reasons i can't explain i felt foolish and said well never mind. i just forgot about it an went to sleep. when it happened again this time i wanted my husband to acknowledge the sighting with me. i got a feeling and on hwy. 269 i asked my husband if he could see this large ball of light. he said yes he could.First he said, it is probably just an airplane or helicopter from fort campbell. i watched it as we came down patterson rd. then it was coming straight for us toward us! i told tom then what is your helicopter or plane doing now? it was quite large and bright now and lower in the sky. much lower over the tree line and a white luminous like a star and was hovering in place. tom said, \"it's just one of those whisper jets that don't make any noise.\" i asked him to listen for a sound before. we came up to the circle at carolyn lane and went to the end where we live. it sat now in front of our home. i asked tom if his helicopter that makes no sound but has a bright light follows him. he looked up at the light and said, \"ok, it's a ufo, let's go in.\" i was shook up and don't remember much after that but i know we both took a nap which is odd for us until late about 11 pm. i went to the large window near the fireplace and looked out right where i thought the ufo would be. it was there hovering. i told tom to please come outside in the backyard now with me and to look. tom came out and acknowledged that the ufo existed. tom made me go back in and as we went back inside, i saw the white light jettison a red smaller light out and up which flew away and was followed by another. then it was gone. vanished in the night. you asked

perhaps wnw), approximately the size of a thumbnail at arm's length (\"apparent size,\" in the astronomer sense, so a thumbnail or penny or so actually meaning very large). it was too dark to see any structure to the object, just the light it was emitting. it was also impossible to guess its distance, and thus altitude, but it was 30-40 degrees above the horizon for the duration of its visibility. obviously, i've never seen anything like it or even close. it moved against the winds to a ssw bearing as it grew smaller and eventually disappeared over the course of 3 or perhaps 5 minutes but maintaining a similar degree-elevation throughout. because of how large and bright it initially was i was struck by the conspicuous absence of any noise whatsoever. i tried to look at it through my telescope but it was moving too quickly to track, although still slowly enough for its size to have a floaty look to it. i'd estimate its bearing changed 30-45 degrees in the 3-5 minutes it was visible. i grabbed a pair of binoculars and was able to see it through those, but with no more useful detail. \r\n\r\nas i watched and tried to figure out what it could possibly be i had very few ideas. its size, silence, and brightness ruled out pretty much all aircraft, and i haven't thought of anything feasible all day today either. i have read about comets of startling size and brightness, although this object had no tail and its movement was near perpendicular to the ecliptic. i also don't believe it could've been debris burning as it fell to earth because its motion appeared to be at a consistent (if indeterminable) altitude. \r\n\r\nthe fact that it was so large and bright and mysterious was a little spooky, but mostly i was just completely fascinated. at first i just stared at it for a minute or so. then i tried to track it with my telescope a few times. unable to, i grabbed binoculars that were just inside the house (running, for fear it would take off suddenly) and looked at it through those. \r\n\r\nwhen it disappeared i remember it fading in and out a bit when it was very small and dim and i could barely see it, which i remember reminding me at the time of an ember burning out, although i thought it was actually the same brightness but simply moving too far for me to see, or perhaps obscured by clouds i could not see. i don't know what the visibility was last night, although i suppose when looking at a light source all bets are kinda off on \"visibility\" distances anyway. \r\n\r\nthere were actually very few clouds and seeing was good, although the transparency was poor as if the high humidity went to the edge of the atmosphere. for what it's worth, there was enough of a slight haze to obscure any real detail viewing jupiter although sharp lines could be made out on the moon, so it wasn't foggy either. i hope that gives some frame of reference as to the sky's conditions. \r\n\r\ni told some friends and emailed my mom about it this a.M. and she later found a site called myufo.Com which had a sighting in st. clair shores, mi with a very similar-sounding object, also for the last night (the 27th), at 9:30p- so approximately 1 to 1-1/2 hours before i saw. i can only believe it was the same object. although that sighting reported flashing lights on the object, which i did not see. it also reported a turtle shape and other detail but, as i said, i could not see anything but a fiery orange light. \r\n\r\nalso, i would describe the shape as not really round, but not really square either. it's almost as if it were square but it was hazed over enough that i couldn't resolve even that much detail (something i hoped looking through telescope or binoculars would help with, but didn't).

was approaching from the east. as i watched it it veered toward the north. the color was a striking flaming-orange and looked totally unusual and out of place, so i looked at it through my 7x35 binocular which was on the bookcase near the window. i was able to see that under magnification the object was a group of lights surrounded by a halo, or oval ring that had depth to it. to the naked eye the object appeared to be a rather fuzzy, flaming-orange-colored circular mass. it was traveling horizontally, just above a wispy cloud cover that was moving in. it was moving quite a bit faster than an airplane, but nowhere near fast enough to be considered a meteor of any sort. it did not appear to be falling. at one point i noticed a bright star-like object which was near the object but traveling in a direction away from it. it appeared to be at the same altitude. i think it may have been released out the back end of the fireball object, but i am not sure. the orange object faded from view as it entered a cloud bank which was moving into the northeast quadrant of the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Although the skies cleared quite quickly, i first noticed something through the cloud cover. as an amateur astronomer, i'm quite used to looking up at the sky from my back garden in carlton colville (south lowestoft- uk) and as a smoker, i generally spend a lot of time there these days. \r\n\r\nwhat struck me at first was that this was a very bright star nw of my house, due to it's brightness through the cloud cover whilst no other star was visible. a few months ago and a few hours earlier in the night, i would have taken it to be venus; although in late july and at this time of night this seemed unlikely, so it piqued my interest. the cloud moved on revealing a clear sky and it still looked like a star, albeit a bright one and one that was moving. i immediately revised my opinion of it to be a satellite as it moved with the  kind of speed and with the appearance of one, although i was surprised at how bright it was. then it stopped... \r\n\r\nthis seemed to blow my theory that it was a satellite and my thought then was that it was a helicopter. there seem to be a lot of helicopters around this area at night... the police have one to cover the area and there is a heliport about 10 miles away just outside of beccles. i waited for it to reveal itself as such. after around five minutes had past however (the time it took me to smoke another cigarette) it didn't move at all and for all intensive purposes looked just like a star. when it began to move again, this time at a slower pace than before, i wondered what it could be. it stopped again, although it seemed to be moving ever so slightly every now and again in a subtle but somewhat erratic manner. if it were a person sitting on a seat, you would say that they were fidgeting.\r\n\r\nevery now and then it seemed to move very slowly in a ne direction and occasionally make adjustments. as i watched, i looked at the other stars around it to try and judge how quickly it was now moving. i noticed two stars above it that were quite dim in comparison and formed the shape of a triangle alongside the bright star. when it appeared to move again though, the two dim stars appeared to move with it. it was at this point that i realized that the triangle pattern was moving in formation in relation to the other stars. it continued to move about for a further 30 minutes, although by now i had begun to doubt what i was seeing. \r\n\r\nas my eyes adjusted to the light (i'd spent around 40 minutes in the darkness by now and my garden is quite sheltered) i thought i could make out edges that joined the three stars. it appeared to be a black triangle shape. as it continued to move erratically for the next hour or so, i could not take my eyes off it. it appeared to be about 500ft up and would have been directly over marshland and the broads. although i am not accustomed to estimating altitude, i had a good reference fresh in my mind as i'd spent the day at the town's annual seafront air festival. seeing a variety of planes flying over the sea gave me a good yard stick in this instance. \r\n\r\nalthough i had appeared to witness definite movement, i began to wonder if i had indeed imagined it. after craning my neck for such a long time, i was keenly aware that my eyes may have been playing tricks on me at this point but every time i convinced myself that i wasn't seeing this at all and that i should go to bed, it made a larger movement again and hooked me in. it was almost like it was teasing me into staying to watch.\r\n\r\nthings started to get a little stranger after that. at one point, cats started to scream and dogs began to howl. i've never heard such a chorus before and i felt a bit scared at this point. this seemed to go on for a few minutes, throughout which my own cat peered out of the cat flap quite apprehensively. as suddenly as it had began, the chorus stopped and i was back to staring at this enigma again in complete silence. \r\n\r\nat one point a cloud passed over it again and there seemed to be a flash of light emanating from behind the cloud. by this time, i had been watching it for about 1hr and 45 minutes. throughout this time i had continually doubted what i was seeing, but i was suddenly utterly convinced that what i was witnessing was something extraordinary. it was then that the ball of light appeared. \r\n\r\nit didn't seem to come out of the triangle, rather it appeared slightly below it and to my eyes was instantaneous in it's manifestation. this was a  real 'bloody hell!' moment and i was utterly mesmerized by it's luminance and size. bright like a flare, it seemed to be white in the middle but    orange around the edges and it moved very steadily down from the triangle and began to move directly overhead. although it at first seemed to be a ball, it was actually a little fatter in the middle-- a squashed ball if you will. at this point i freaked out and rushed into the living room to get my camera. although fumbling through the drawer for the camera felt like a lifetime, it couldn't have been more than 20 seconds and by the time i got out of the house it was directly overhead, above the house. it now appeared like the shape of a jelly bean from my vantage point beneath it. \r\n\r\nunfortunately, my digital camera's a relatively cheap model and by the time it had fired up to take a picture, the object had gotten a little more distance, although was still relatively close to the house. as i took a picture, the flash went off and i cursed as i quickly tried to change the picture setting to one without the flash. by the time i'd gotten the camera sorted, the object had moved quite a distance, faster it seemed after it had left the proximity of my house. by this point it was quite small and finally stopped somewhere in the distance. i really couldn't say how far away it was now, a few miles perhaps? maybe less? there it seemed to stop. as i turned back to the triangle, it was no longer there. i watched the orange ball for a further twenty minutes during which it seemed to ascend very slowly. finally, after about 30 minutes, a cloud obscured the ball of light which at this point was about the same size and coloration as mars, which was shining to the se of the object.   \r\n\r\ni have included the picture i took with the flash on as i staggered out of the house. at first, this looks like a black and empty picture, but by turning up the brightness and the contrast of the image it appears to have a little more structure. i'm well aware that the picture is almost laughable as evidence and is a very poor representation of what i witnessed, but it's better than nothing... i've also included an enhancement in which i have increased the brightness and the contrast.  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

and attempt to brighten up the pictures a little to see if there was anything i missed, as the original seems to just be all black with only a small indication of anything in the lower left hand

and amateur astronomer and astronomical illustrator, so watch the sky for weather and air traffic. we are in the approach area to large airports oakland international, sfo.  we have seen these or similar on several occasions, some corroborated by friends across town, so always try to scan when out.\r\n\r\nat approximately 6:35pm i noticed a white spherical object due south at 45-50 deg.  distance and altitude hard to determine.  i then saw a second, then a third smaller by 50-75% but both at about 20 deg. of arc from the original object. one at 11 o'clock the other at 5 o'clock.  i could detect no movement but an imperceptible drift north as time passed.\r\n\r\ni observed them by eyes only with correct distance glasses while my wife went for my watch, camera and video cam.  at one point i thought i saw one of the smaller secondary objects split, but could not be sure.\r\n\r\ni started shooting with my digital slr (pentax *istd) with a standard macro zoom f-lens 1:4 /70~200mm.  i took 45 images jpeg at 6 megapixel resolution and 3 in raw format that did not resolve well enough.  i could not see structure through the lens.  only a fairly indistinct sphere.  my zoom was at max (200mm) most of the shots, but took several exposures at wider field including a set showing an aircraft, passenger airliner at high altitude in a sky lane usually for routes la to seattle.  this one from south going north.  taking those particular exposures at 1-2 seconds apart.\r\n\r\nat this point i called  mufon nor cal director ruben uriarte who is a couple miles from me, but could not get him.  i next called another mufon member (don) a friend about 4 miles west of me to see if he could see the object and we could triangulate, but he could not see them with naked eye or with his telescope.  he did tell me he saw earlier a similar object that split, and was positive what he saw was not conventional objects.  he stayed on the phone so we could continue to observe and discuss.\r\n\r\nafter i felt i had good images, i changed to my hi8 sony digital handycam with steady shot and super night vision.  i got approximately 6 minutes of video.\r\n\r\ni was not able to resolve detail in the low-res video cam viewfinder, although i could see some structure artifacts in the video on review.  i continued to watch as several aircraft went overhead at what seemed a much lower altitude.\r\n\r\ndon told me the clouds (fog from coast) covering view from his position.  we where still clear skies from our own observing position, but prevailing winds would carry them this way.  i continued to look but i saw that the object had traveled a good 40-50 degrees of arc and viewing angle was now at 50-55 degrees and would be obscured by the large liquid amber tree on the street in our line of sight.\r\n\r\nwind was about 5-10 mph at ground, but as the coastal fog clouds came in from the north moving south at what looked like 500ft at 10-20 mph and was crossing over the more distant object, again that was moving north at a very slow but deliberate rate.  i was able to keep the object in the viewfinder as the clouds crossed over it, giving me a good indication that the object if a balloon was in a much higher altitude with calm winds moving north, against the lower level.  possible but lower probability.  when the object went into the tree i changed position, but could not see the object after that.  i shot a few seconds in case i could resolve it in review but could not.  i recorded then my position and viewing angle in video for the record.  by then coastal fog clouds had covered us.\r\n\r\ni immediately reviewed the images (i am a digital graphics specialist) and found that the slr digital camera had resolved structure, but amorphous or changing shape.  it could be construed as a bunch of balloons, but was not consistent therefore unlikely.  the shape was somewhat like a center spire protruding vertically and top and bottom with spherical shapes around it, sometimes in a horizontal orbital configuration, but changing second to second.  if a bunch of white balloons where being buffeted by wind that violently they would also be moving faster in the sky, and, with prevailing winds likely.  don came right over and we ran some filtering to see any hidden details or other objects, but that was largely inconclusive.\r\n\r\nafter reviewing video i found that details where less striking but did record cloud movement in relation to the object and at one point, saw the secondary object moving non-relative to the main object.\r\n\r\ni have available 39 good exposure stills in jpg and 6 minuets of video in 3 formats.  1 format was direct to dvd and the other two are direct to mpg from cam and dv video files.  i will archive on a dvd data disc.\r\n\r\nvideo not ready for transfer as of this report date, but will be added later.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
