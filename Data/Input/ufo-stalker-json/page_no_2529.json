blinking light to my right. at first i thought it was just a cell phone tower till we came to a clearing in the trees and it was a little to high for a tower. i watched the red blinking light till we get to the light to turn onto rt 90 going east. when we reached the stop light, the red blinking light then turned into two three lights,. it looked like three small lights, red, wight and blue, but my husband said it wasn���t blue that he thought it was green. the lights just stayed still in the air, that is when i thought it might be a helicopter. my husband then turned on the entente ramp to the highway and i figured i would never see it again. i watched as we drove out of it���s view. i was amazed at what i saw and stared repeatedly looking for it. withing a minuted it came into vew again and was now heading down rt 90 east. as i watched it, it was now just the red light again, then it changed to a bright white light. it was now moving very fast and almost caught up with the car and i thought it was going to fly right over us, then the light flared and became very bright for a second, i watched it the whole way home. my husband was looking at it from the rear view when we saw it flare again. we reached our exit and stopped at the stop sing. i couldn���t believe it, but the light also stopped. as we turned off the ramp onto the road i watched the light, it had stopped and was just sitting there in the sky, i could now see the red light again with the white. i took a drive back up to the highway about 30 min later to see if it was still there and it was gone. i need to know what that was. was it a helicopter or a ufo. please let me know.","distance":"101-500 Feet,

freeway to go south then taking the garden grove freeway going west to long beach me and my girlfriend saw a strange whitish light that looked kinda like a sphere.  later we could see different colored lights on it and on (2) occassions could see a small light come out of the craft and move under the craft.  the lights off the craft would appear to go out once and awhile then within seconds laterthe lights would come back on and the sphere would be in a different position in the overcast sky.  \r\n\r\non one occassion the sphere was slowly descending straight down.  the sphere or craft did not move in manner like a commercial jet or a helicopeter.  it looked like it was floating then would disseappear and re-appear shortly later in a different position in the sky and not show how it got to the new position in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe sphere with lights seem to be fairly large and seem to have also as\r\nmuch height as it had width and was at least a few miles away and \r\nmay have been over the ocean when we saw it.  at first i thought it might have been part of the moon shining thru the overcast clouds but my friend said definetly not.  then i thought it might be blimp but it moved too strangely with lights of different rows so it was not a blimp either.  we could not believe what we were seeing and it seem to hide itself within the overcast clouds and somtimes we lost visibility for a short while then we would see this object again a few minutes later.\r\n\r\nclearly it was not something you would think of as a normal type of\r\ncraft.  i am very interested in knowing if anyone else in orange county \r\nsaw this craft on the night of sunday 7-22-07 between 11:30pm and \r\nmidnight also?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7509,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.779331,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07232007-0020","longitude":-119.4101124,"occurred":1185172680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1185172680000,"summary":"Sphere

13 miles from my house.It was about 4:30 p,m, in the summer,we think in 1973. my two daughters, about 9 and 12, were with me.We were traveling down valle vista rd in lakeside, about one half mile from the riverside dr.Intersection, when i saw a movement out of corner of my left eye. i looked to the left and saw a long,large shiney cylinder, domed on both ends.I could see it above and beyond the trees that lined the roadway.It's hard to say but it was maybe fifteen hundred feet high ( it crossed rattlesnake mountain and el cajon city engineers told me it one thousand,one hundred and  ninety-eight feet high) and maybe one thousand to fifteen hundred feet away. with nothing in the air to gage the size and distance, this is a guess, but it was large and close to the ground.It kept pace with my car, no more than thirty-five mph.I parked at riverside dr and shut off the engine. there was no sound from the craft and it was eerie to me.I said,\"what's a military helecopter doing out here\"? my oldest daughter said,\"dad that's no helicopter, it doesn't have a propeller\".That's when i got the shock of my life. it had no wings,motors,propellers,vertical nor horizonal stabilizers.I was in awe at this thing.It was traveling north to south from lakeside to el cajon ca.The evening sun was shining on just the middle of the body where there was a narrow shiney band from the front dome to the back dome.We could not see  windows nor anything but a shiney smooth surface from dome to dome.We watched for maybe fifteen to twenty minutes. it finally disappeared beyond rattlesnake mountain. we went on to the dental office and told my wife and the dentist what we had seen my wife belived us but the dentist scoffed at all three of us and said we were crazy or seeing things. no amount of talking would change his mind. i called a friend that worked at the sheriff's office but no one had made a report.If anyone saw it they may have gotten the same flack i did.I saw you on larry king live and decided to make a report.Every word is true.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sky as i always do, because i like to look at the stars. i noticed a deep red light that was becoming brighter and then dimmer. i called my daughter to come and see. we both stood out on the porch and watched the object for around 6 minutes, trying to figure out what we were seeing. the object seemed to be changing shapes. it looked as if it were breathing and pulsating. it would expand from the shape of an egg shaped circle to a tall enlongated object, then it seemed to flatten out side ways into an enlongated sideways object. it changed into many different shapes as we watched. i told my daughter to keep an eye on it and ran into the house to get a digital camera and a video camera. in the minute i was gone my daughter said it just disapeared. she said it didn't move away, it just disapeared from the spot it was morphing in. when i came back outside and looked where the object had been a momnet ago, there was a whitish cloud kind of lit up  where it had just been and then in a few seconds that disapated. the distance of the object i would estimate was at least 5 miles from us, although not being able to tell how large it was, that's a rough guess. it was south west of where we stood. we live about 5 miles west of havre, so this thing was probably around ten miles south west of havre montana. i thought at first that i was seeeing the moon just rising through some light clouds, then i noticed that i could see stars behind the area we were watching. i went back out about every 10 minutes after the sighting to see if the moon was rising, but it never did. i was happy i guess to see yet another starnge anomily in our sky. i have been noticing other strange lights that don't move around like satellites. i always call someone else out to see and they are as stupped as i am about the speed and eratic movement of what looks like stars on many nights. i reported a very strange sighting my daughter had a few months ago to mufon, in which she lost the electricity in the brand new truck she was driving as she was having another experience with a light that was dividing and traveling at great speeds, and then rejoining the bright red light it had split off of. this is getting pretty strange here. that sighting caused great fear in my daughter and when she finally got home she burst inot tears it scared her so bad. she was driving alone late at night for that sighting","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

saw a large bright light or silvery object in the sky approximately 15-20 degrees south and 3-5 degrees east as i stood in front of my house.  i first thought the object was a airplane with full landing lights on but then it came down further twards the earth and moved more northward and grew to about two or three times it's original size.  at this ime i was thinking satilite or space junk hit by the sun.  i have seen satilite orbits from south to north from time to time and i know what they are.  the object had grown to about 8-10 times it's original size and i could not see any visible landing lights nor hear any sound.  it was still moving down and twards the north at a 30 degree angle getting larger and brighter and still more silvery. it was larger than any fixed wing air craft i have seen because the stealth bomber flew over during a fly-in event and also a-10 warthogs practiced in our rolling hills for the gulf war years ago so i know the differences in size as to altitude. we also have the eaa fly in close by and i have seen large and crazy designs.  the object then vanished completely as it appeared with no trace or trail or sound or anything.  i'm not convinced that this is an et ufo. this is the same area that, maybe 10-15 mi. north of here yet, that x-files considered a ufo hot spot along with a genuine ufo bar in dundee. i have lived here most of my life and farmed a lot of this country and until now never seen anything i could not explain. i am an unbeliever but i thought you may have an explaination for this or may find this interesting.  i am not prone to histereics nor am i shaken very easily.  this was plain and simple an interesting happening.
