the left. i gazed at jupiter after that and tried to forget about it for personal reasons. i went to bed at about 1.Am i then for the second night in a row heard high pitched noises that sounded like morris code but really fast , that had woke me up but it felt like it was something trying to get my attention as i was looking round my room i noticed that white and black tubes where receding of my bed and the tartan pattern on my bed sheets was also doing this. i was scared and felt an urge to scream for help but at that moment i seen four black egg head shaped shadow figures varied in height size standing at the end of my bed and i then panicked and went to get out of my bed but at this moment a voice entered inside my head and told me in what i can only describe as a robotic voice, we won't disturb you from other people,it then said it again. although the voice was deep and scary i felt comfortable to lie back and ask to see my mum again, at this moment my room was filled with orbs and stars that felt like they were passing through me and i felt like i was getting closer to my mum as if my room was traveling through space and time. after about 2 minutes the orbs disappeared with the stars gradually a few at a time and then the pattern was back on my bed sheets and everything felt normal i got out of my bed turned the light on and everything was as normal. i felt highly emotional but grateful to be back i don't know where i was but they whoever they were obviously didn't hurt me and calmed me when i felt disstresed. today is the day after. today's date is 13/4/17 and it is becoming more clear as the day goes on that i was abducted but with my room as my surroundings and these beings that did so did not want to hurt me or scare me but because i was so scared they did not continue with their intentions and brought me home. i feel sad and  thankful but have a feeling that every thing will be ok but also feel that they are gonna come back when they think i can

sky. i was sitting in my car in the  driveway at 9pm, shortly before moonrise.  the sky was completely cloudless and dark as i watched planes and satellites etc. fly overhead. suddenly a very bright solid white light appeared moving from the north horizon due southward, about 30 degrees off the horizon.  the object was about 5 times the size and brightness of jupiter.  i thought about trying to get a video, but then dismissed it as just a medevac helicopter that frequents the skies in the area (also my cell camera is pretty much useless in low light).  i listened closely for the expected engine and and/or rotor sounds, and looked for the ever present strobe lights, but it had neither.  it traversed from the north horizon to about mid sky at i would estimate 150-200 mph until it abruptly stopped.  not slowed to a stop, but slammed to an instant stop.  it was stationary for a very few seconds, then in the span of less than 5 seconds the light steadily decreased in size and intensity until it was a just pin prick and then gone. it was then that i realized the light had rapidly shrunk and disappeared because the object had shot off at an incredible speed directly away from my vantage point.  less than 3 minutes later, two aircraft (strobes, contrails, and jet noise) flying a tight echelon right formation came screaming across the sky (i would estimate about 3x the speed of airliners that fly over every few minutes 24/7, maybe mach 1.5 or 2 considering how much of the sky they covered in a short time), from the west horizon to the exact location and path taken by the object after it stopped and took off.  a minute after the two jets flew overhead, an identical aircraft (or maybe 2, since it was at a much higher altitude and at a lower angle than the previous pair, i couldn't discern how many sets of lights and contrails) came screaming across the sky as fast as the other two jets from the north, following the exact path of the object, and then banked left a little past where the object had turned, until it was flying east behind and just off the right flank of the first two eastbound jets. the planes continued on the same path the object shot off in until they were out of sight.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

paper for a garage sale down the street so we went finally one afternoon. us and another little kid-we got some money and went and had seen many people there before that. suppose there was a car in the driveway of course-did not pay any attention to it! the entity drove it daily seems like later in the day. the garage was filled with shelves with stuff on them for sale. strange stuff! we wound up buying romantic gift items the entity said was given to her and made for her by guys or whatever! also, some other items which our folks threw in the trashcan right away! the entity told those romantic stories and it appeared female, but it has to be an alien in disguise. so it is very strange. we apparently wound up with a dried primrose flower deal! we never seen anything like it although it comes up in alien stories sometimes at least. we have seen many such entities who appear about the same. so it's a type they appear as and like to appear as. we were at this entities house and could see in. there is something odd about that. also, you see them in the kitchen often cooking. so it's kinda weird the whole thing like almost kinda romantic or could be. i mean they say it's kinda got traditional to go out to eat or something- the guy takes her out or something. but just being with one in the kitchen cooking is kinda odd- we have done it before and we were in a romantic relationship with the alien. it's kinda odd. it's kinda romantic especially if the alien is. so we saw a store aliens had with a kitchen set up like another aliens house. sure he owns it all. but it's kinda romantic. they sold romantic items and the whole place was over romantic. it seems odd. they had a similar item on sale kinda like the flower deal. glass you see thru it the stuff inside. is it romantic to aliens or what. it's romantic somehow? something about that stuff maybe. we were told not to listen to the alien guy but he did say where did we get that item. now, his 2 alien friends were watching us buy the stuff!  so it shows they're together very much and friends or something- just something very strange. anyway-whatever. he also asked us where we got that flower thing before and said it was kinda weird. that we had some kinda weird stuff in our room and he asked bout that item. out of all of our darn junk! what else is weird in there? well, who knows- we tried to decorate! so we went over and the alien got on the phone and we heard him saying- they're over here now... ... ... later another alien came over to our house and was on the telephone saying- i'm over there now! ... ... ... she's getting out of the shower- i gatta go.  ? so the alien seemed to plan for us kids to go to the garage sale. they knew that when they did it and she said that we could go over to that garage sale anytime!!! it is like a store! anyway, we never did go back because a garage sale seems like an advertised deal. it was an actual store! the alien knows that, too. in there with all of that stuff!!! we could see the alien entity in there with that stuff all the time but you don't see the stuff from the street in the garage. the house was very similar to our ex's house- that alien one. the one who was with us more- not that 2nd one who was on the phone to his friend/s. it was like that house and not by coincidense either probably. it's kinda changed around, but similar. there were things in the house that like all the m alien houses it looks like it appeared there rather than someone put it there.We thought the dogs played with that scarf! not a lot of junk in the house- maybe a tv. but it is romantic kinda that the alien said that- you can come over anytime. the gifts. another was flirting with a girl. they tend to scare the heck outta us. he flirted and he was very active and visible! when others aren't so much although they did land in flying saucers!!! that's pretty active, but we saw that car- his car out at night that time, too! we didn't get to see the flying saucers, but we saw that! it's that one who was flirting with her surely! and he terrorized a woman next door to him! he surely did it on purpose. so very strange- romantic or what? he sounded amazed to flirt with that girl who was in 5th grade at the time or what 6th. they are aliens! nothing even came of it, but he was flirting with her. or she got the hints that we missed. they do threats. it appears that aliens standard mo is to scare girls first in the romantic encounters. they do something like this -although these encounters didn't lead to anything physical between the guys and girls involved. it was like a first thing they do!!! 1st they scare you kinda or it gets there fast. ? it seems the one we were with did that all the time or sometimes at least. he scared the woman next door we heard- do not know what she saw! sounds like disappearing stuff like our folks saw in another one's house before! they talked the same they said no uh uh! coz the stuff disappeared! that's what the woman said about whatever the woman saw at that guys house. he is smart and active alien- he does seem keen on meeting girls among other things or something. so the idea of hanging around aliens is odd. you are in the kitchen with them! it's strange coz aliens are strange and it can be romantic. they could use it to get closer to woman maybe where before they were somewhere else. maybe it can be strangely romantic. it's always lit and private  or yeah kinda and they are right there - outta sight but near kinda. maybe they have a romantic kitchen area. or just being around them's strange. maybe not too romantic but just odd to be with them. we have noticed that they seem to  represent if you get with them lust?  if you get with them you gatta be prepared. also, aliens seem to lie all the time. we put craft stuff from the area-at night and day ther's stuff. odd cars. ufo's landing. strange entities there. the other alien we saw in the kitchen moving around- something like a ghost sighting. the other one who scared his neighbor really bad seems the woman said she blocked her view of his kitchen window or something. another was always cooking a-lot all day in his large kitchen. well, one appeared as a woman cooking apparently also. typical! people cook! they get up and plan what to eat for dinner and if they know how to cook they can just take all day making stuff. we do not know how to cook from scratch like that! another guy hinted at aliens and humans (he's human, but he's friends with the aliens) being in romantic relationships! so it shows that his alien friends love this! apparently he knows this well. he knows how his friends are and how our ex is. we have heard him described as a devil though. aliens didn't say it, we heard a woman call him that. she doesn't even know about his alien friends surely. we kinda saw him with them kinda like or something. well, with our ex! so who else is he with oh there was another guy - another alien with him!!! yup! yes he said stuff about his friends. we know the guys' an alien! we have seen them around enough to know that that guys friend is an alien. non-human entity. he was using a little bit of dirty jokes. not too much! but yes some type flirting stuff -kinda goes with our ex and what he was doing at the time! they are friends apparently and mess with not only that girls' mind but maybe ours, too. oh the entity moved like fast looking- no not a woman at all- not human! watching us! at the garage sale! we were talking about dogs and things and cute toys and things at the garage sale. they say they show people things like that - we know the mafia does this! aliens, too maybe like our ex! he'd come over yelling at us and it is scary! so he starts to talk about kids! ? maybe to not be so scary? but they do show you things like that- i mean that was a weird place! that was there but nothing else was there- many ghost houses. there's some more aliens appeared round when we began to say- where's all the people! it's a ghost town. we moved out of that town! there was this crazy man for one thing and aliens made the job not work although they offered tons of cash they didn't take it! went outta business and with the crazy man- he was always nuts! moved to get away from him and he followed! voices said get him to act nuts, but he was already nuts so they didn't do it really! he was acting nuts before that! moved outta texas! and they didn't care to go back and hang around coz of him! they said there's a crazy man! we said there is? and they said yes! he may be at the mall they said. we wanted to go or something- go somewhere. we just didn't hang around there. sure, when we went back - didn't pay much attention to nothing really. there's ufo's at night there and you hear voices and stuff. there is a strong alien presence in their house at night!!! you can hear it talk to you or it gets you up or something! very strong! our folks said there's something in the house! yup! we didn't spend the night there much! but when we did something was going on there for sure!!! a strong alien presence and ufo's almost every night or every night there. you see cars go by and they are the ufo's apparently and everything.  same aliens all same still going. we might have been the only ones to ever see a car go in next door in the morning over there, but we don't really recall too well. if it was there we paid it no attention. but no one has ever seen anything out at that house. so it would've been something  if we saw it. seems it goes in fast and almost he appears things like the door and all and goes in so fast- no wonder no one's seen him! our folks said don't you know someones in there looking out that window! you can see in houses and it's always a couch and all but no one in sight! so they may be in there looking out only invisible! strange!Couch set up for a good place to look out, but invisible people in there. so when we saw the one we felt he's more like a light although he looked solid. he goes in and vanished no doubt and an invisible man did live in that house. we saw or heard him in the kitchen where he appeared things around. we heard the water appear on and off all the time from our bedroom next door in preschool. it's on then off it doesn't turn. you can hear that water is on then off- no turning the  knob on the sink. people saw things appearing around in there, but we were so little and couldn't see out the window or anything. we did see him though sometimes. no one else saw him, although the woman across the street said she didn't- she was lieing. i mean she's lookin out the window to see him land and go in the garage! she's lieing! we saw him! she did witchcraft. she's rub a pan 3 times backwards when she got mad. so that's odd. she had voodoo dolls. we don't know maybe every thing about witchcraft, but that's odd that she did that with the pans. we read a little bit to know something is going on besides doing dishes. she didn't want them over disturbing her and her visitors! they loved to visit friends, but they weren't welcomed there obviously. weird. if she is gonna have voodoo dolls with pins stuck in them - do you really wanna go over there? maybe they don't care- maybe its  not a big deal. they want to go there. she hated us so much and said  with the rock music we listened to and dressed like we were a witch and would get a voodoo doll all the time and dress it like us and all. so it takes one to know one for sure! we had no idea what she was talking about. but she hates us a lot.Yes, that music is!

remember the year exactly). i was outside in my parents' backyard in nominingue, qc, on a summer evening. it was after sunset and the sky was getting dark, but not dark enough to see stars yet.  i had been by myself putting things away in the sheds for the night and on my way back to the house, i got a glimpse of something in the sky. i stopped to observe it.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was a luminous circle west of me at an elevation of about 30 degrees. the circle was light blue and about the size of a light bulb seen from 10 feet away. the object was self-luminescent, but not very bright. the best way to visualize it is to imagine a circle of daytime blue sky in the darker sky.\r\n\r\nthe object was rising slowly at about half an inch per second from my point of view.  since the shape was not changing, i assumed it was a sphere. there was no noise at this point. i got to watch the object for less than 10 seconds and then, it exploded. it broke apart in chunks that started tumbling in free fall, leaving turbulent trails the same light blue as the original object. the trails faded within a second.\r\n\r\na few seconds after the explosion (i'd say 3 to 5 seconds), i heard the muffled sound of a blast, much like the sound made when someone ignites a gas stove. i deduced from that that the object couldn't have been too far away. there was no sound or vibration related to ground impact.\r\n\r\nthe funny thing is after seeing this, i just casually went inside the house and never spoke of it with my parents even though i used to talk about ufos with my father once in a while. he had a few sightings of his own in his younger days.  i didn't even ask if they had seen it.  in hindsight, it feels has though i had been influenced in some way not to discuss it or that i somehow forgot it right away and that the memory only came back afterwards.  also, i can now remember the details of the sighting quite clearly, but the memory of when the sighting actually took place is fuzzy.  i always found that to be quite peculiar.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

single reddish-orange glowing ball of light moving well above the tree-top line but below the clouds in the nw sky that looked to be approx 1000 ft in altitude moving at approx 100 mph.  the light seemed to move at a steady altitude and speed traveling toward the se then making a turn toward the north and moving out of sight.  i thought the object was a helicopter at first but it didn't make any sound.  this made the sighting somewhat puzzling and had my attention.  my wife and daughter witnessed this with me as i had quickly brought it to their attention.\r\napproximately 10 minutes later a group of 5 lights identical to the first one came from the exact same direction and traveled the exact same path.  the group had three lights in a row, approximately 50 to 100 feet apart then the last 2 were traveling side by side approximately 50 feet apart.  once the group was out of sight approximately 10 minutes later a single light exactly like the others came from the exact same direction and followed the exact same path as the 6 lights that preceded it.  \r\nthese lights made no sound as they moved across the sky.  based on the fact that there were lots of clouds and these lights were seen between the clouds and the tree-tops i estimated their altitude at approx 1000 feet.  it should also be noted that our location is almost perfectly aligned with the hartsfield-jackson airport flight path for incoming airplane traffic from the nw into atl.  these lights traveled well underneath that normal flight path crossing it then taking a sweeping left turn to go north.  having flown lots of hours in a cessna 182 i have a decent reference to air-speed and altitude but those numbers i've referenced are just estimates.  the sighting left me, my wife and daughter feeling anxious and puzzled as to exactly what we'd seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

home with a anonymous man but (mankind) with a kind of the carrier (like moped).He took me with him , i spoke with him a few times but he did not answer to me. it seemed he and i were mesmerized. by the way , i do not know why i was sitting on the vehicle contrary (my face was in front of the street). we arrived a non-urban area and we got a quiet way. it was a bit strange. because foliage of the trees was too close to the ground. and i was worried when we would passing there my face be injured. i talked with the man about my concerned and why this area is so? he did not answer me once again. suddenly, from that area we were by a by-way we entered into a street with two line drive to right that was one-sided. we were in the middle of the street , who first attracted me a strange plane with a glossy black surface and white under. it was without lights. when i saw it i referred to it by the hand, i said the man,'look what interesting and a new aircraft. he was still without attention. upon saying this sentence, that strange aircraft that was looks like a triangle at the speed of a blink it was over my head with hairbreadth. i unconsciously found myself defenseless. a powerful resource and a great deal of energy , electromagnetism and magnet conquered me. and then leaned my head and neck. i was incapable to look at the spacecraft. my hands were stretched involuntarily forward.I heard strange sounds at the same time , and i was looking at my hands. first they loaded to my left hand semi-curved shapes and math like with white color.They have taken other symptoms geometric from my right hand with red color like dna. work of loading and grabbing took some minutes.Then the sound of a great roar and non-typical power saw and heard.When they ended it with me, they said me with a sort of telling or telepathy to me we will come back again. and i felt that i am dead and fainted , but at the same time i felt in my whole body the yellow giant energy with shaking , and i heard a special strang sound that so far i have not heard like that. afterward my eyes opened and i was alive again.I was shocked. i thought that about my experience should not talk to anyone.I was in doubt until midnight. but i couldn't sleep. finally i said to my partner. later that day, every day a strange pain in the head and almost all of my body i have. i've never had headaches in my life. i feel a movement and liquid pain in my head and body, which is like an iron or something like that.","distance":"20 Feet or
