around 11:00pm, as i was unwinding to some light jazz on the radio, i noticed what i thought was venus as it really stood out against the stars. it was very, very bright, more so than any other night. for some reason i kept watching it as i continued on i-96 heading home. something about it just seemed odd. i can���t specifically say what was odd about it, only that my feeling was it was not as it seemed. traffic was very light at this time so i was able to concentrate more on the light as i was driving. after a little time of watching it, by the time i crossed over the bridge (grand river underneath i-96), i noticed this bright white light was not venus, but was actually moving at a steady pace across the night sky heading north. ok i thought, it���s got to be a plane, but then i thought how could this be a plane, it was too darn bright. so i kept watching, waiting and watching for the blinking lights to verify that this was in fact a plane, but there were none. no blinking lights anywhere. it was a solid bright white. now, as i am getting closer to it, or it to me, it moves across i-96 in front of me still heading north, but now has changed shape slightly into an oblong, bright white light. as i���m watching this i���m still looking for the blinking lights to verify this was a plane, although it in no way resembled what a plane looks like at night. as i get closer yet, just rounding the curve at granger landfill, heading to yet another bridge that runs over i-96 i can still see it, but it���s now way to the right of my windshield and is getting bigger in size, and lower in the sky. after maybe five seconds of staring at it i had to look out my passenger window because it was no longer visible through my windshield. at this point i was now looking out my passenger window at this v-shaped solid white light. that���s all it was���a solid, bright white v. no blinking lights, no strobes, no breaks or circles of lights, it was a solid bright white flying v in the night sky. i was in disbelief watching this until i nearly ran off the road, the rumble strips brining my attention back to my driving. i then did a quick check in my rear view mirror and looked to the lane next to me for cars and there were a few. a spurt of traffic had caught up to me as i was now only doing 45mph. when i looked over again out my passenger side window, after passing underneath the bridge, the trees blocked my view and i could no longer see the v. i immediately phoned a friend of mine who lives in the area this thing was heading. she answered the phone very keyed-up and told me before i could say anything that something huge just passed over, next to her house. needless to say i told her what i had just seen and we both were on the phone as i now took my exit ramp, then made my way over to her home searching for this thing. i took a couple of side roads, drove by her house, and then drove around the country roads, but it was gone. soon after i returned home, which was now around 11:40pm she hung up with me to call the airport to ask them about air traffic and if there was anything in the area around the time i had seen this, and the time it passed near her home. the person she spoke with in the control tower said at that time they had noticed nothing on radar and then even asked the person a chair over who also said they had seen nothing on radar. this person said that it wouldn���t be until next week before they would be able to have any more information because it was a friday night. they said they would check the radar returns over the weekend and the person she needed to talk with would be in next week. as soon as i get this information i will report their findings. \r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nupdate:  as i was getting ready to file this report today my friend called to let me know she had spoke with the faa at the airport. the man said there was nothing there. no one had left him any messages on any of this and that was it. he offered no help of any kind.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Todays date:  7/17/2007,  my name is  ruben  sierra, male hispanic, former united states  marine,  this instant case was  first  investigated  by  the late  dr. j. allen hynek,  founder of (cufos) center for the studies of ufos, who in turn, gave the  case to the late, idabell epperson, director mufon southern california, & her daughter marylin epperson, both field investigators for mufon. i ruben first sighted the ufo hoverning near our government housing project apartment unit, which was near a hilly area, the ufo then floated over the service drive, at which point i  brought it to the attention of my older brother, & 2 male cousins, one older & one the same age as myself.\r\n     i was 6 years old at this ufo encounter, the ufo then came to rest at the base of the hansen dam, built by the army corps of engineers, a federal body, as was the federal housing project were this all took place (emphasis added!) the community at this time and place called this location a ufo landing base, and i feel the community was built for the purpose of studying ufos and working hand in hand, with them.  moreover, it should be noticed that the los angeles unified school district built a school for this government housing unit which is very odd to say the least!\r\n     the ufo while over the service drive came to a complete hault in the air, my brother and 2 cousins, and other children waved at the craft an the crafts occupants return the wave back to us.  the ufo/craft the flew over the playground area, an came to rest at a 45 degree angle at the foot of the hansen dam. my brother & cousins, & other children followed the ufo to the dams base, where all became afraid and returned to the housing units, but i ruben remained at the crafts landed sight, as the craft was at a 45 degree angle, i approached it, an remember the smell of something similar to battery acid!? i remember walking on the gravel of the dams base, an placed one knee on the lowest point of the ufo which was at a 45 degree angle, and i crawled the circunference of the ufo, until i was at the opposite site of the craft, and i saw a small opening, where i saw beautiful lights of magenta, red, blues, yellowa, pink, and gold, lights, which seem to draw me to them, (emphasis added!)\r\n     i fell downward into the craft, an have screen memory which was brought out under hypnoist, after i came out of the craft i return to the housing units where the children were playing a game of (hide and seek), so i went into my apartment unit where i was in a state of confusion, as my mother was combing my sister hair, at which time i asked my mother if my sister was chinesse, being my family is hispanic, mexican american, i was in a state of confusion. moreover, at this time my mother sent me to my room as she was agitated with me for not reconizing my sister, i asked my mother if my sister was chinesse, as in elongated eyes, i believe from my experience in the craft i have no other explaination! other than the alien beings had wrapped around elongated eyes!\r\n     after i went to my bedroom, i sat in my red sofa chair, at which time i levitated upward to  the ceiling, and i felt the curtain rods, the ceiling light bulbs, as my feet dangled downward, i then floated downward to the red sofa, an came to rest on it.  i told my mother what transpired in the bedroom and she said you need a plane ticket to fly, an became more agitated and sent me outside to play with the other children.\r\n     the children were playing hide and seek, an as i was late coming to the game, i had to seek them out, i was instructed to count backwards from a 100 at a light post, at which time i feel into a stupor, at about 75 count, when i awoke i found myself at the roof of the 3 story apartment units, and i found the children one at a time in this method of some how levitating to the 3 story apartment roof top, hearing where the children were hiding and levitating downward until i stood in front of the children, at which point the children became afraid, saying how did he do that, i don't want to play anymore!\r\n     by this time it was now dark outside, and the adults were outside caring for the children, i remember a man pitching a baseball into the sky and catching the ball with his glove, it had to be a full moon as i could see the ball as he caught the ball, on his third toss, i glanced upward, and saw a ufo the size of a basketball, follow  the baseball downward, then circle the housing unit at which time it shape shift to a giant ufo over lapping the roof tops of the 3 story apartment units, with the same colors of magenta, gold pink, etc. as in the day time sighting.\r\n     at this point the adults took the children into the apartments, and i went into my aunt and uncles apartment, as my parents were grocery shopping. when my parents return they took us home, an it was at this time i had my childhood ufo abductions, of abducting me from my bedroom apartment, and taking me to the same location of the base of the hansen dam, this transpired 3 times, and i told my parents, my mother then told me if i were to be taken into the craft again, as i reported to my parents of being seated in a chair in front of a large picture window, looking out into the blackness of space, and seeing millions of stars pass by at a great rate of speed, then the chair would shift into a different position, and the process would repeat itself.\r\n     my mother got the idea of tearing the white bed sheets into strips, as she said if you fly tonight you'll take your brother, she then tied my hand and arm to my brothers hand and arm, and my leg to my brothers leg, an turned off the bedroom light. the childhood ufo abduction repeated itself again, at approx. 5:00 am my mother was making my fathers breakfast, and peeked into the bedroom, only to find the ufo aliens were not infalliable, as i was not tied to my brother but rather i was tied underneath, the bed itself, and my arm and legs were tied to the bedpost legs underneath the bed!

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My girlfriend and i were driving on highway 89 in vermont in the early morning hour on may 6, 2007. we were about fifteen miles north of the first exit to burlington, heading south, when i noticed what i first characterized as a hot-air balloon floating in sky to the south of us. because it was a considerable distance away, i made little attempt to make a greater analysis. however, immediately i had the sense that something was not quite right about my assumption. (some background info will explain why: i once commuted each morning at the crack of down south along highway 29 in california, which travels through napa valley. every morning at certain periods of the year, hot-air balloons would appear on the horizon south of me as they generally launched in areas surrounding the town of napa, but not exclusively there. i would typically have about a half-hour of travel to the backside of the town of napa during which i could view the balloons from far away and close-up vantage points.) my brain held quite a catalog of memories as to the details of a hot-air balloon and after a few more looks at this object in the sky in vt, i could easily discern differences between it and the common hot-air balloon. (moreover, it was quite chilly that morning and at the altitude at which the balloon was travelling, the temperatures would make open-cockpit ballooning very uncomfortable so it didn't seem likely.) of course, at that point, i was still quite sure that the object was identifiable and that i just wasn't reaching a final conclusion as to what it was because as we traveled down the snaking highway, we would alternatively gain and lose sight of it, and our vantage point would change from eastern to western perspectives of it. finally, however, it was in view to the west of the road directly for about five miles of travel, and then i regarded it more thoroughly. once i was sure that it was not a hot-air balloon, i became very curious. when it was finally located directly to our west and we had a clearing across which to view it, i pulled the car over, and we got out to look at it. i took one photograph then with my digital camera, my girlfriend having taken one from her seat soon after we stopped. i concluded that we were looking at an unidentified/able flying object. all i could keep saying to myself and out-loud was,\" what the hell is that thing?\" we left after a few minutes to continue on our way. it was not there when we returned north along the same road that afternoon.\r\n\r\nokay, now to the observations:\r\n\r\n1. it was stationary; absolutely no apparent movement to it at all; it did not appear to move in the sky (neither vertically nor horizontally) and nor did it appear to rotate;\r\n\r\n2. it was shaped much like a hot-air balloon (teardrop-like), but there was no obvious basket suspended from it (that fact coupled with #1 above ruled out the possibility that it was a hot-air balloon of the same design of those used in northern california for recreational purposes; moreover, after a few minutes standing in one place watching a hot-air balloon it is a very simple task to conclude that it is moving, even if it is moving directly away from you);\r\n\r\n3. it was huge; that is, it appeared to be huge; watching it over the course of fifteen minutes of travel (at 70 mph) towards it, it never appeared to change in size to any great degree; that is, it never seemed that we were getting closer to it, and this reminded me of the effect that i experienced in alaska, where i have sea kayaked a few times: you could paddle towards the mountains in the distance (or away from them) for hours, even days, and they would never appear to get closer or father away (larger/smaller); we called it the mother-f***ker effect; the mountains are just so huge that no change in size is discernable by the human eye on approach or retreat; the same with this object: it appeared to remain the same size from start of viewing til we traveled away from it;\r\n\r\n4. it appeared to be a silvery object and we could not see the redness that is so apparent in the photo because its metallic surface reflected so strongly in the morning sun; it had a very steel-like metallic quality to its surface, or rather to the white surface band in the \"middle\" of it did; the edges of that band against the larger body appeared quite sharp and so seemed to extend out from the surface at a right angle to it, enough of a distance to cause a shadowed effect against the larger body (though i could not see that shadow really until i looked at the photographs later);\r\n\r\n5. there were no lights visible on the object;\r\n\r\n6. there was no audible sound coming from it.\r\n\r\n\r\ni think the realization that this was not an identifiable object to this individual was quite exciting, but it also had the effect of numbing me a bit, and i did not realize until later that we had actually seen something extraordinary. (thus only two photos were taken and no further attempt to view it was made.) in fact, i completely forgot about the photographs until the day of this submission when i stumbled upon them while organizing files; i was surprised to find that i could see slightly more detail in the photos than i could while viewing them with a naked eye, and that was exciting. but, looking at them did bring back the very eerie sense that i had had that day that i was viewing something otherwordly. as often as i have thought that it would be a great experience to witness such an unknown phenomenon, it was quite taxing to my brain to try and make sense of the object and the experience. it was perplexing to me.\r\n\r\nconsidering that in that area are located two potential sources for weather balloons or advanced aircraft of one sort of another (those being university of vermont and the plattsburgh, ny air force base), i would not rule out that possibility. however, the obviously large size and apparent stillness of the object (to the point of being unnerving) make it less likely than a skeptic would hope. \r\n\r\ni hope i have clearly and thoroughly described this sighting to you, and if you have any questions, please feel free to email me with them. and please, if anyone can identify this object, please inform me with supporting evidence or reference. thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":7460,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.81028,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07162007-0006","longitude":-73.15222,"occurred":1178459760000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1178459760000,"summary":"Early

inside because i'd finally wore myself out. i walked outside and happened to glance acorss the street above my neighbor's house. my eye caught upon something i thought was a very bright star... but there were two problems. one problem was that sirius, which usually appears in that direction, was never ever as bright or large as this object had been,and two was that it was wobbling in a loopy sort of fashion. it was not staying still in the sky. i  thought maybe i was swaying because i was tired, so i sat down and observed it for a little while, and it was still wobbling and swaying, like i was looking at a super bright star drunk out of my mind or something. i decided to walk out into the street to get a better ;ook at it, and as i passed the tree at the end of my driveway, i happened to glance up through the edge of the tree and i saw yet another very bringht neon blue star-like object. i rushed out into the middle of the street, and pretty much as soon as i got a good look at this thing, it did the most amazing arial maneuver i'd ever seen. i went from being pretty much stationary to doing a quick spiraling motion, and then shot straight up into space towards a very small orange lightvery very high up in the sky. at that point, the orange light twinkled and disappeared, also. the other light was still hovering over my neighbor's house. it could've been there for an hour, 15 minutes, a whole day, i can't be sure because i went inside shortly after the second \"craft\" shot away up into space. i've seen a few other strange vehicles in the sky, but this sighting stick out the most because i actually saw full propulsion capabilities being used, whereas most of the other times, it was just hovering stationary or floating away slowly and disappearing.\r\nthere's

coast to coast am, so i've had no way to report this until now.\r\n\r\nplease feel free to contact me at my e-mail or phone if you would like.\r\n\r\nwitt best regards.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

residents shoot off fireworks.  i noticed a large yellow-orange light in the sky, but passed it off as a star.  i went to do some camp activities and return no more than an hour later to where i had watched the fireworks and noticed thaat the light had moved to a different region in the sky.  i called a friend over to look and described to her what i have just written above.  we watched the light and saw it getting dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared from sight.  it was around some trees, but not behind any, as we could make out the outline of the treestops (the light did not seem to be close to the trees).  it quickly reappeared in the same spot and again dimmed and faded.  it then reappeared above another group of trees about a foot to the left (distance based on my reference, were i to point from one part of the sky to another; i do not know how large the object may have been and so cannot say how far to the left it actually moved).  the light was now more of an orange-red colour and appeared to be spinning counter-clockwise and possibly changing its basic shape (it remained a sphere, but i could see the edges changing).  we did not see the object move; it disappeared from one spot and reappeared in another.  the object slowly started to sink below the tree line; at this point we called over another observer to view the object.  eventually the object was below the tree line; however, the foliage was sparce and we could still partially see the object.  however, when i would change positions to get a better view, the object would move and \"hide.\"  there was no wind to speak of that night, nor a breeze, and so the leaves were not swaying to cover the light.  for several minutes the light would move itself when i would move to better view it until eventually it fell behind where we could see.  overall, the incident took 45 minutes at the most.  possibly unrelatedly, the next morning i had a nosebleed; they are rare for me, but i was feeling a cold coming on.  it was most likely a coincidence.  unfortunately, the light did not return any subsequent night.  the other witnesses and i were definately freaked out; not scared, but curious as to what we were watching before us.  on a final note, i was told the morning after the sighting that the harford county, maryland newspaper, the aegis, had been reporting on ufo sightings in the recent weeks up to my own sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":7453,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.6393033,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07152007-0013","longitude":-76.202916,"occurred":1183955400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

with a friend a very strange light emanating from a cloud near my house in vaudreuil,quebec within a few kms from montreal. \r\n\r\nfirst let me start by saying i am very experienced with auroras (been tracking them for years) i am also an amateur astronomer, i have experience with aircraft and flight and have a sound knowledge of weather. what i saw along with my friend that night i cannot explain.I ruled out lights from a plane,fireworks,auroras,lightning and static discharge.\r\n\r\nit was around 11:30 pm, we just finished looking at the moon through my telescope and i was looking out at the night sky when i saw this cloud southeast from my home,it looked close and had just been over the house so i know it was a low cloud by the speed it was travelling.I thought it was pretty against the light of the almost full moon. all of a sudden, the cloud turned red with a little orange tint then pulsed to blue and then changed to green. it lit up the whole cloud telling me that whatever was creating this light was big. the light lasted about 4 seconds and turned off. i then yelled to my friend to come see what i just saw and miraculously the light re-appeared just in time for her to see it. the second view also lasted about 4 seconds and pulsed from red with orange tint to blue to green almost mechanically. having seen it twice and having the same light pattern rules out a natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\ni have been pondering coming forward for awhile now but decided it was the right thing to do.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

for the last 30 years. on july 10, 2007,about 9:25 pm, i was taking sunset pictures from my deck. i was facing west, and there was a cloud. the sun was down on the horizon behind the cloud. i took 10 to 15 shots. i came in and put the camera down. i was using my digital. i watched tv for about 2 hours, and decided to look at the pictures before i went to bed, to see if i got anything worth keeping. i wondered what in the world that big white spot was on one of the pictures. i loaded the pictures in my computer, so i could crop and zoom in on the subject. i also used a solarizing technique on it too. i'm going to try to send the picture on here so you can see it. i do not remember seeing the object as i was taking the picture. it must have went in and out real fast. i also have a picture (the one right before the white light)\r\nthat shows a little faint spot that might be the same thing behind the cloud, but that is very questionable. it was midnight when i found the light on the picture, and didn't go to bed till 2am, and then couldn't sleep at all. i had a sighting on may 24th, which i posted on here, and this light, looked to be the same thing i saw before, but alot closer. the other sighting, was at meijers in kokomo. when i see the picture, i just can't believe i didn't see it through the viewfinder on the camera at the time i took it. it's so obvious. it's just weird, to see something two different times in like 6 weeks. now it's kind of taking up alot of my time, because i keep looking west at the same time every night, and have a feeling of being watched. i spend alot of time now researching, that i didn't do before. anyway i hope this picture goes through for you to see.\r\nif anyone has a good explaination, i'd love to hear
