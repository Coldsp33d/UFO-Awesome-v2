listioned to radio got bored by it so i got out of my car i looked up the the left of the sky while i saw a bright round glowing object getting going from btite to dim off and on while the object unbelievable to my eyes it was about 12:00 clock high in the night sky moving around in a clock wise postion,while slowly it was moving it then moved to 6:00 oclock postion while moving around in circles at that postion,while the glow of object still intermitting glowing, then it moved to 9:00 clock postion still spining around clockwise then it spent a little time there moved next to the 3:00 clock postion in the sky then then continued with intermitting glowing getting brite to dim then disapeared in the sky i would say about 220 degrees south west i know the direction was right when i last saw it cuse my satalite dish is pointed to 220 degrees south west, also id like to point out here very important it was moving around in circles clockwise while traveling to the south west area in the night sky at same time i was so amazed to see this site when it was at 12:00 clock high it dropped stait down like a direct line from 12:00 postion to 6:00 oclock  postion i was wow also there was no sound of the object so i got phone called 911 police came filled out report but object was gone before they arrived but i saw the object for good 30 min still im amazed what i saw also i i know all about ufos so i knew what i saw was not an airplane was a real ufo space ship one last point it seemed maybe the flight patterns was due to maybe navigation problems or was having problems cuse it was moving around oddly as if it was having trouble on board or something , but i got the feeling what ever ufo piolet who was running ship i feel was maybe trying to send message with the cirlce flight patterns it was making in the sky, but yes this sighting of mine did happan ill never for get it cuse stars dont move but this ufo was awesome to see.","distance":"Over One

sky. when we had found a comfortable spot on the forest floor we lay on our backs and looked at the stars through the open canopy in the trees. this is when we saw what looked like a star but moving very fast and changing directions instantly. it could cross the whole night sky in a blink and was very graceful. there is no way this was a satelite,plane or anything else of that sort as its speed was immense and its agility like nothing else. my husband had seen these earlier with a co-worker in langley b.C canada but i had missed that experience so it was a delight to finally see them for myself. i think we must have watched it dance in and out of our line of vision for a very long time as we fell asleep talking about it. part of me didnt 100% conclude it was anything alien until a few years later when i read other peoples descriptions of what is sometimes referred to as fastwalkers. it was exactly like those. since then i have noticed them at on at least two other occasions in bc

home made kites since my childhood  so ever since i can remember i have been seeing this ufo's so i use my kite as reference to spot them more easily  so my last sighting happened when i was cleaning the front porch after a while took a break with my binoculares began to just scan the sky within ten minutes i spotted them by theway it was quite windy  so this objets  were no ballons  i know if you watch them long enough you can actually see them change shapes yes i said shapes even colors from bright red to orange from white to silver and some times something drops from them i dont know what it is but is sphere shaped but smaller. if anybody is curious about what i am seeing please contact me any time after 4pm i'll be glad to talk to you.               as to what i was thinking  all i could say as i was watching them was wish tracy could come and see this tracy is my girlfriend she has seen them quite often also she could tell you some stories about the same objets that i see when i first met her i told her obout this things that i have been seeing so one time me and her went to a nearby school to fly one my kites she stayed inside the van reading a book  while i flew my kite obout ten minutes later i called her  to come over to where i was laying on the ground i asked her to look with the binoculares  at the kite then i told her to look just to right of the kite i asked her what do you see her jaw dropped then she asked me what the heck is that joking i answer her i dont see nothing then i said to her that is what i have been seeing all the time now you know thank

if i held my hand up toward the windshield, it would have been around the size of my thumb. after the bright flash stopped, i thought i was looking at a large metal blimp but then, as i was looking at it, it disappeared. a second or two later, the flash happened again, this time when the flash stopped, it looked like a disc shaped fling saucer or something. i became scared a bit, but put on the brakes anyway to watch it. it didn't seem to be moving during the whole encounter until now the front end (or the end on my left hand side) rose up a bit. it seemed to drop down a little. after that,

5:06 pacific time, i saw was outside our house having a smoke and a bright object in the northeast caught my eye. i thought it was a glider or hot air balloon. when it moved to the south after 15 minutes of watching it, i thought it was a planet. i checked the 'day' sky charts and no planets were in that area. when i went outside 10 minutes later it was gone. i attributed it to high cloud cover. then, i went outside again after 30 minutes and i saw it move from the area i last saw it and it streaked southwest within 5 seconds over the horizon. 5 minutes later it was where i last saw it. it moved 3 times to the south west from the original position. the fourth time it did this, it was approaching the horizon, then it moved upwards towards my zenith and disappeared. the next time i saw it, it was south of south west, then it did the same thing 3 times as before. it kept moving west. so, i asked my son to come out and look at this object at least 4 times during all of this. he saw it and asked, \"what is it?\" i couldn't give him an answer. we saw it move to the south west twice. i decided to look to the west and my son and i saw at least 12 different object flying around \"near\" the sun. the brightness they gave off was unusual because most objects, like birds, planes, etc have shadows when you view them against the sun. my son has better vision than i have (he has 20-10 vision from the last eye exam), and he saw 3 engines on each of them.\r\n\r\nwe watched these objects dance around. two objects were rectangular and rotated as they moved. the last time i saw one of the objects was around 8:11 pm pacific time.\r\n\r\nthere were so many of them that we lost count. based on the behaviour of these objects, i can only deduce that there was a conscious force involved because all the \"fluffies\" floating around near our house was not moving as the same as these objects. the wind speed was near nil. a lot of these objects moved and disappeared to the south. from the first one that i saw, almost all were located in the west. i kept checking all around the sky to see if there was any other activity going on. there was none. these objects congregated around the vicinity of the sun in the sky.\r\n\r\nthere have been reports of crop circles in our area over the years, especially around vanderhoof, bc.\r\n\r\nif anyone has connections here in my area, please look into it. it was unreal that these objects were brighter than the sun and any other objects i saw in the sky. one thing to note. a single propeller plane flew northwest over my house and one of these bright lights looked like it was intercepting the plane's course.\r\n\r\nthe last time i encountered something like this was when i was 5 years old. the bright object flew over our truck as we were driving home, late at night. it didn't have a sound at all and it was moved very

the backpackers parking lot around 10:00pm and hiked for about 1 hour into the forest.\r\nnothing unusual was happening, we set up camp and ate our dinner. my friend was playing his guitar and my nephew had already went to sleep in his own tent.\r\naround 11:30 i started saying to my friend \" i feel very strange, i feel as if something enormous is about to happen in the world\" these were my exact words and i felt very strange almost dizzy and light headed.\r\nwe then hear coyotes yelping and getting very close to us, then silence and as i shined my flashlight into the woods i could see their eyes reflecting the light. this really spooked us since i had already felt  strange prior to hearing the howling of the coyotes.\r\nthey did not harm or get close to us but we were still spooked so we decided to get into the tent to go to sleep.\r\nwe were sleeping top to tail, i was at the opposite end of the tent and after a few minutes my tent mate wakes me up saying that he saw lights (headlights) shining through the  top of the tent and that my face and chest were specifically illuminated. we both get up and open the tent window to see a bright amber orange light shining directly at us about 20 feet away. i panic thinking someone is here to cause us harm and then i notice the light begins to slowly move upwards into the tree tops and i then noticed 2 more lights of the same color but were smaller. \r\nthere was a large center light and 2 smaller lights on each side of the larger center light. i get out to take a closer look and i notice that as this thing comes down again it is actually small car tire sized little craft of some sort slowly moving up, down to the left, right and sometimes hovering in place for a few seconds and then moving again.It's movements were very slow and smooth as if gliding on ice.\r\nat first we were both almost frozen with fear but after a few minutes i got the feeling that everything was ok and that whatever this thing was it was not going to hurt us.\r\nwe continued to watch if for about 1 hour and at then we became so tired we went right to sleep. the very next morning we wrote down and drew pictures of what we had seen. we both saw this thing and it was clearly a small little craft with 3 lights. i don't know what it was or where it came from but i saw it.\r\ni am not looking for any kind of attention i just want to

happened in the late afternoon/early evening. \r\n it was on a street in medford, oregon. i was almost at the end of the street. where i was walking i could see the natural geological formations, the table rocks. i was looking around, enjoying the day, when i saw the ufo.\r\n it was disc-shaped with 5 large windows going horizontally across it. it was just hovering in the sky. it was not close; however i'm not a good judge of distance so i can't really say how close it was to me. \r\n i wondered if it was indeed an ufo. perhaps it was a reflection off of a mirrored surface, i just don't know. i've come to believe it was an ufo but i understand completely that i could be wrong. i try to not let my x-files dvds bias me.\r\n the craft just hovered there. i thought it might be a helicopter but this thing wasn't moving at all. a car was turning onto the street i was on so i had to quickly grab my dogs' leashes. when i looked back, i swear that the craft had managed to move about 100 ft. in just a few seconds without making noise.\r\n the ufo hovered for about 3 minutes total then from the two most outer windows it slowly vanished. i've thought that maybe it was just a reflection of sunlight, vanishing because the sun was going down. but the sun was still quite above the horizon.\r\n during my viewing of this craft i felt excited and curious. i wasn't afraid. it seemed to pose no threat and, like i said, it simply disappeared. i've only told 3 or so people and now i'm 15. i still live in medford, or. this has been my only personal viewing of an ufo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":7418,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3319452,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07122007-0003","longitude":-122.8729849,"occurred":1101801600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1101801600000,"summary":"Disc-shaped

bend, kansas on the north end of morton st. one night in 1964 or 65, i looked out of the kitchen window and saw a white cube that glowed like a light bulb. it was a perfectly shaped cube and not at all blurry. it had a red light glowing on the inside of it and the outer surface seemed to glisten. there are or were quite a few radio towers there and one huge tv 2 tower farther to the north. the cube shaped thing flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb of all things, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower. i ran to get my dad but he said don't brother him right now. so i ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come here. when i got back to the window it was still flying near the tower. just before my brothers got to the window it came across the field then towards me and it started hovering around 75 feet above the ground maybe 200 yards away. that is when my two brothers made it to the window and started saying what is that, what is that? also, i might add that the red light was fading on an off like the tower light was. i believe perhaps it was trying to communicate with it. then it spun so fast that it turned into a ball and in a white streak it went almost straight up but at a little angle towards the north west and was gone. we saw what we saw so because of that i know we are not alone. sure makes you wonder why that thing was flying around that radio tower? i can also tell you that well we did anyway, still had black and white tv as it was still the early years for tv. the large tv 2 tower first broadcast was nov. 28, 1954. just for the fact that signals can travel at the speed of light and maybe it too could travel at or near the speed of light too. then maybe it could have came from a near by star system that would be within 5 or 6 light years from us? but if it was a craft or a type of probe that was just passing by then who knows where it could have came from? another possibility is that, what if it was some type of life form itself? and it roams the cosmos like the buffalo roomed our prairies long ago? i have done my homework on about everything it could have been and my conclusion is that it was extraterrestrial, why? because the thing i saw showed intelligence and there is no doubt about it. i know it was looking at things by the way it was behaving. at the north end of the street was a wheat field then to the north edge of that about 1 mile is the dry walnut creek and on the north edge of that was the radio tower. the radio tower was around one and a quarter mile from the kitchen window where i first saw it. the houses including ours 15 houses or so lined up along the wheat field east and west. the houses that are there now in the field were not there back then. here is the part that i did not include, when i got back to the window it just moved off the tower and was spinning (like a white glowing box spinning) it was spinning towards the south southeast towards town. then it turned toward the west very quickly and staying over the field run along the row of houses staying out over the field around 200 yards or so and up in the air like i said around 75 feet. when it saw me looking out the window like i said, it stopped and that is when my 2 brothers made it to the window and started saying what is that, what is that? to me that shows a form of intelligence don't you think? it was about the size of a small box truck like but it might have been a little smaller? this is all a true story and i wanted to share it. we were young when we seen this but we knew it was very strange. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

very bright light in the sky in the direction of the venice municipal airport. it first appeared to be a planet like object similar to venus in the night sky; however, much larger and brighter. i stood starring for about 5 minutes until i realized it was moving away from me as it began to drop below the tree top level.\r\n\r\ni ran inside to get my binoculars and returned. it had moved only slightly. viewing it through 6 x 30 binoculars proved it was not an aircraft (i see small aircraft with their red and green running lights every day & night since the venice airport is home to many private craft including jet aircraft).\r\n\r\nalthough in the direction of the airport i could easily determine that it was well beyond since i could see small craft landing during the event. i then decided to take a picture and ran back in the house a second time for the digital camera. by this time the object had moved some distance from the original sighting position so the pictures were barely discernible. i ran the pictured through my graphics software enhancing the object. it was circular in shape and emitted a bright glowing light as if it were a glowing white ball and appeared to be much larger than the small craft flying in the area. the event lasted approximately 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nover the years i have seen many of these kinds of object including bright orange circular craft as well as black triangular craft beginning in 1955 to present. i have many ufo stories much stranger than the most recent sighting.

 i didn't know which one it was!  i kept looking around (about 5 to 10 min.)and was enjoying the beauty of the heavens.  when i looked back to my right, i noticed a brilliant light that hadn't been there.  it was definitely within our atmosphere & wasn't a star.  then i noticed that it seemed to be coming my direction.  it was clearly an aircraft of some sort, not a shooting star, meteor, fireworks, flare,  etc.  i looked for the flashing lights that accompany a helicopter, jet, airplane, etc.  there were no flashing lights.  as it came into view, i could clearly make out 3 very bright white circular lights on the bottom only of the craft. no other lights on the sides, top or elsewhere.  the lights were arranged in a triangular shape.  the one light in the front was in the direction in which it was going, with the other two lights behind it(one to the left & one to the right: thus forming a triangle arrangement).  they were evenly spaced from each other & were so bright!  it only took maybe 20-30 seconds? from when i first saw it: being a small bright light to being clearly visible and flying towards me. it came from the south and flew to a slight northwest. (i'm judging the directions based on where the sun comes up and sets here, it may not be exact.) i was freaked out and scared to death!  here i was about 200ft. away from the house(the house is up a hill too) & i was all alone.  my husband wouldn't be back for another 15 or 20 min. and he had no idea what was happening!  i didn't turn on my flashlight because i did not want it to detect me & end up directly over top of me!  as i sit on the ground, i turned to watch this thing.   i watched it come closer and it kept on flying at an even speed, with no dipping or turning.  it was clearly flying at an even distance from the ground, not like something falling from the sky.  it continued on passing to my right.  i had decided i was getting the hell outta there!  the last time i laid eyes on it, it was passing behind the trees (but still clearly visible and was still heading in the nw? direction).  it was still up pretty high, as high as a high flying helicopter i guess. (i'd say at arm's length, it would have taken a quarter to have covered it up.)  as i started out of the fenced lot, it was still visible and i could hear the low sound of it flying through the air.  i was too panicked to take the time to see if i could make out an outline of the craft.  i ran as fast as i could to the house.  when i made it in the door i was saying \"oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!\"   (we are temporarily living with my parents) & everyone was asking what was wrong. \"ufo!!!\" i managed to spit out and i started to cry.  i was so shook up. i felt stupid, but i know what i saw and the extreme fear i felt was real!  my heart was racing, not just from running, but from being so scared. i managed to make a sketch of the lights i saw, although  my hands were shaking like they've never shook in my life.  my heart continued to race for another hour & a half.  i was hot, shaking, my face and neck was splotched red, and i also felt like i needed to throw up.  it took a couple of hours before i calmed down.\r\ni would like to know if anyone else witnessed this, but i'm afraid to notify local authorities about it. it would surely be in the local newspaper!  and i'd rather not have that kind of attention!  the time would have been approx. 1:30am on july 8, 2007.   \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it made no noise whatever.  conditions were sunny and dry.  there was an intermitant small breeze.  the object approached to within 50 feet of my location and was about 50 feet up.  it seemed to have yellow reflectors at each corner which caught sunlight.  the object made small jerking motions and revealed itself in profile as well as full face.  it was thin, probably no thicker than an inch.  there were no wires nor strings attached.  at the point closest to me, it seemed to hang in the air.  i kept waiting for it to fall, but it did not.  finally, it moved beyond a tree line and i saw it no longer.  it was one of the most odd things i have ever seen.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with

quiet....Like it was floating. it seemed to make a slight turn coming from the east to west, and then heading north west. there was no con trail. it wasnt very high, probably 2000 ft. hard to guess, but it was below some clouds passing by. \r\n as it proceeded to cross the sky / horizon it shinned white bright, like clean snow. but the middle was pitch black, with what seemed like highlighted

sphere silently float along from the hills in the distance toward my back yard at a height of about 100 m from the ground, the sphere moved level with me at a distance of about 100 yrds away and carried on in a straight line toward the other horison a distance of about 20 miles. i went to my upstairs room to continue watching the object,\r\nit was about the size of a compact car (bmw mini sized) and completely silver (possibly brushed steel appearance) it was un affected by wind (gentle breeze blowing) and made no noise.\r\nit moved in a staight line from when i started to observe it.And did not change hight from the ground or speed.(height and speed were constant)\r\nalthough the dog did not see the object , he bayed to go into the house and scratched at the door i was standing by (which was closed) to go in the house. just prior to me loosing sight of the object and going into watch from an upstairs room. something i find unusual as the dog usually gets pre occupied sniffing for cat evidence in the garden, he is usually keen to stay out as long as possible, not wanting to come in when called.\r\n\r\ni have seen the same object many years ago and recall seeing this or a similar object in the late 1980s while on holiday with my parents in southern england, while travelling on the highway (motorway).On this ocasion it passed over a service area in a similar quiet constant speed and height fashion, only being seen by my family, several hundred people at the area did not notice the object. and i do recall it passing over the motorway over a truck which must have created huge draft at high speed, but the object was un moved.\r\n\r\n\r\ni live in a densly populated area,in a row of old town, terraced houses.(the houses are around 200 yrs old an all occupied.)\r\nthe incident happened aound 15 mins ago.I could hear neighbours talking at the time through an open window about 2 mtrs from where i was standing.\r\nwe have had thunder storms today although there are none at present, the weather is breezy and cloudy.It is fairly dark and the moon is the other side of the house to where i saw the object.\r\ni noticed several high altitude plains travelling with landing lights flashing which were much much higher than this object.\r\nthe onject did not appear to have any effect on local street lighting which it passed over, however i noticed at the time that several evening birds suddenly stopped tweeting as it passed by.\r\ni could also hear a police siren in the distance on the busy main road about 500 yeards away and heard the 11 oclock train pass by on the rail line about 200 yeard from my home. \r\nthe time outside lasted around 45 seconds then i watched the object from upstairs for maybee another 20 seconds , before i lost sight of it.\r\ni have just noticed that all the digital clocks in the house, microwave , cooker,and the video have started flashing as though there has been a power outage although i didnt notice this at the time, and may be unconnected.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7404,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":52.9225301,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-07092007-0006","longitude":-1.4746186,"occurred":1183878000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1183878000000,"summary":"Silver
