i would never put my address on a picture. i don't want people knowing where i live.\"\r\n\r\nhe said, \"well it is on the window of the trailer under the full moon. you sure you didn't put it there?\"\r\n\r\nafter discussing the weirdness of the picture, he went home and i went to bed. i kept thinking about what he said, so i got up and went to take a look for myself. chills ran up and down my body for a full 30 seconds when i confirmed what my friend had told me - my address was indeed on the photograph. how? there is no address even close to mine in christopher creek!\r\n\r\ni should point out that i own a home that is zoned for three structures. and while we had confusion with the city of phoenix over the true address of our home, the address in the photograph is part of our property.\r\n\r\ntwo pictures actually have the same reddish area on the trailer which was part of the cabin owner's property, and located just east of our cabin rental. while the picture i am attaching has that area naturally blurred because i was focusing on the two objects under the full moon, the part of the picture i am not attaching has my street address clearly written in box-lettering, much like those letters you buy for your mailbox, except in a glowing reddish color. it looks like this: \r\n\r\n\"000 n 00rd st\" - i am a little freaked out...\r\n\r\n\r\ni have sent the third picture cropped without my address to show you the location of the full moon.\r\n\r\nnote to mufon: i will gladly share the picture with my address clearly written with stipulations. you can confirm the address, but i don't want the world to know my address - fair enough?\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7396,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.3375729,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07082007-0006","longitude":-111.0420123,"occurred":1180418400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1180418400000,"summary":"Objects in front and back of a rented cabin","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/7396_submitter_file1__Copyrighted2ndPicMay282007.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/7396_submitter_file2__PaysonMay28007-27copyrighted.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/7396_submitter_file3__croppedaddresspic.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Christopher Creek, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:456617"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Wolcott","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside with my two buddies making a donation to the wilderness urination station at about 10:30 p.M., we were admireing how well you could see the stars that night when i saw what looked to be a satilite moving through the night sky, then i realiezed...Satillites dont blink, it was blinking and moving pretty quick. it went to a solid color, continued to make a big arc in the sky, slowed down then dissappeared into the darkness of the night. during it both my buddies and i were trying to think what it was, it was blinking then went to a solid color then dissappeared, we were saying that it was way to high to be a plane and way to fast and eratic to be a satilite. after it dissappeared i was chilled to the bone...I didnt know what to think, did we just see a ufo?

partying not to hard mind you but partying when i noticed what looked like headlights very far off in the distance just above the tree tops i got my friends attention and jokingly talked about the flying car from the movie flubber starring robin williams doubt your firmiliar with it quite a stupid movie but anyway the flying car off in the night sky was creeping very very slowly maybe 10m.P.H. toward us and was making no more than a quiet humming noise we instantly knew this wasn't right nothing man made is as quiet or able to move as slowly as this craft did without falling out of the sky so we got exciteable as we have both seen things before but nothing quite as up close and personal as this anyway the craft kept moving closer until it was just 75 feet (estimate)above us it was shaped like a thin hexagon in relation to it's length maybe 25-30' long and 10-15' wide there were 2 lights on the front of the craft placed basically just like a cars headlights there were small steady red lights an every point of the hexagon except the front my friend \"bartel\" was going to attempt to shine a flashlight he had at it but i wasn't having anything of the sort (tempting unknown forces)so i smacked the flashlight out of his hand and quietly said no and we both stared slack jawed as the craft slowly flew away from us until it was out of sight it didn't feel real we just stood there for at least 15 minutes more shaking our heads wondering what the hell had just happened like i said earlier we have both seen things before but nothing like this i'm not a conspiracy theorist at all generally they sicken me but it just screamed government but obviously influenced by higher technology. i don't wan't this posted but i would be happy to answer any questions you may have

over to my inlaws which also live in levittown ny.,  for a barbecue appx. 12pm est., there were about 10 adults and 8 preteens gathered in the backyard just playing, talking and milling about. i was talking to my brother in-law and happen to look up behind him and noticed bright cylindrical object in the distance high in the sky, as i kept looking up i saw the object was in the southern sky  and was in a tilted angle, using a clock as a reference of point, the object was at appx. 11 and 4 o'clock position and was stationary,i had pointed it out to everyone,and we all started looking at it. the object seems to have been stationary and as time passed, every hour it was moving away with the horizon, by about 6pm it was pretty much out of sight,i possibly thought it was the space station that i saw, but most articles said that the space staion was not visible to the naked eye, and that week i scoured the papers for any mention of it but saw none, all the people at the barbecue saw it so i assume other people had to have seen it.Only once did i find a small mention of it on the internet, but it didn't say much about it. as to how i felt, it was an exciting moment for me, i always wanted to  know if that was the space staion that i saw and if not well then i can say it was a ufo. my daughter was seven years old at the time and now at 16 still remembers seeing it. i also thought it might have been the hubble telescope, but from the distance that we were viewing it i don't think it would be big enough to see. the object i would guess was appx. 2 to 3 inches in length from where we viewed it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":7389,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7289336,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072007-0007","longitude":-73.5114921,"occurred":873489600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

appeared to be slowly moving up in the sky. i originally thought it was just the night sky taking its place, but one of my friends confirmed with me that the light was moving up, and at a faster pace then a celestial body would be.  after we got the attention of the rest of us (5 total) we watched as it started to move in our direction, by this time moving faster. the craft reached an distance at which it would have been id'ed after a few minutes, a which point we could clearly see three lights on the bottom of the craft which was triangular and silent.  the triangle moved past us, still without noise or lighting that would have tipped me off to believe it was a plane.  this was like no other \"plane\" i have seen before in our area of central pa, we have no bases nearby which even an experimental craft would launch from.  i was excited to see the light rising in the sky, but as it closed in and flew by i was very fearful of it, which is unusual because i'm usually very excited about events like this. no one else in the group reported the same response. the clock read 11:11 when the event was over.\r\n\r\ni have a video, but we were not set to record such an event and in the

sky and informed my family. there are about 6 other witnesses to this event. the object would shine very bright, like a plane approaching the airport upon landing with its lights on, for 30 seconds to a few minutes. the object would then gradually fade out entirely. minutes later it would gradually build in intensity until it was bright again. at one point in time there was an object to the right of it that was not quite as bright , but also faded in and out. it is hard to approximate the distance between these objects but when i held my thumb out in front of my face, my thumb fit perfectly in between. the points of light in question were about twice as bright as the brightest star in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe visibility was cloudy in certain areas of the sky but this did not seem to affect the objects intensity. \r\n\r\nafter about an hour and a half the object that was dimmer than the other vanished totally. the first object continued to shine and fade. i continud to watch as family began to freak out about what it was. the objects appeared to be about 40 degrees over the horizon. my compass was pointing west at the time.\r\n\r\nthis was clearly not power transmission lines, safety lights or anything terrestrial and it most certainly was not a fireworks display or mirage of some kind. this really happened and i have multiple witnesses to backup my story.\r\n\r\nside note: the object moved in a northwest fashion after the first 30 minutes or so. we noticed this as the reappeared in the sky after fading out.\r\n\r\nthank you","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

had brought along my binoculars to scan the milky way during the dull points. i had watched a few satellites go overhead in the binoculars, all of them appeared as small spots of light. i noticed this one \"satellite\" come up from the south horizon and when i looked at it with the binoculars it looked like a large dark triangle with white lights on each point and a larger yellow/golden light in the center. as this object reached straight overhead, a second object just like the first came up from the southern horizon on the same path as the first. as the first object reached the northern horizon, and the second object was straight overhead, a third object just like the first two came up from the southern horizon on the same path as the first two. as the second object reached the northern horizon, the third was straight overhead. finally the third oject dissapeared over the northern horizon and i didn't see them again. i didn't think much of it at the time, just that they must have been very large, but later while watching an episode of \"sightings\" on tv, they showed a picture of an obect seen in belgium that was very similar to what i saw, and called it a ufo. i haven't seen anything like them since.

gray and just barely stood out against the night sky. no lights, no sound. it was heading due south and we could see it almost until the horizon and then no more due to it being night and it would just fade out. then the same thing in about 2-3 minutes. then the 3rd one was a little to the east but still heading south-southeast. then 2 more and then nothing. i do not think they were alien craft but definitely ufos maybe from hafb or military bases to the west of slc and some advanced aircraft. my neighbor came over and asked if i wanted to see what he and his brother had seen 2 nights before on 7/1/07 at the same time of night. 3 of us came out of my house and all witnessed the same thing along with my neighbor. the area is about 5-10 miles east of slc international airport and directly over downtown slc ut. we lost sight due to the dark skies and no lights on the crafts. they appeared like a plane with no body, only wings, appeared very large and not extremly high altitude like a jet (much larger) but no noise or any kind or contrail that could be made out.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,
