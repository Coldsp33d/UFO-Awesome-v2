still throuout the sighting, not moving, just pulsating.  i cannot explain what we saw.  i will attach the video clip as soon as i get it downloaded to my computer.  as i write this, i am only about 2

the sky and pointed it out to me.\r\n\r\nthe sky was very clear with only a small amount of whispy thin clouds dotted about the sky , visability was excellent , my friend pointed to a very bright shinning object that was stationary and making no sound at all, i cant be exact of the height of the object but it was approximatly at a 60 degrees angle from the ground and we were facing roughly north to north east .\r\nat first it looked like a very bright star but having never seen a star during full daylight and to be honest i dont know if it is possible to see a star in daylight, i dissmissed the star idea , my friend sugested it may be a satalight in very low orbit but we had been observing it for over 3 minutes and it had not moved , then a small thin cloud moved towards it then passed behind it , the cloud was definatly at a higher altitude than the object so then i relised it was no satalight and was definatly now not a star , because the sun was shining so brightly even though it was behind me it was still hurting my eyes staring up at this object so i went into my car to grab my sunglasses , i then remberd i had a pair of small binoclears in my glove box, i grabbed them and went back to my friend who was still watching the object , id say over 5 minutes had passed and the object still had bnot moved .\r\n\r\nquickly i focused in the binos on the object and was totally amased at what i saw , i had the focus perfect and could see it very very clearly , the object was an absolutly perfect sphere , white in colour with no markings what so ever , i could clearly see the sun reflecting on the upper left side of the sphere and it was slowly rotating in a clockwise direction , i watched for a moinute or so then passed the binoclears to my friend who watched the object for a short time then handed them back to me , as i watched again in amasment at this strange object it just suddenly vanished before my eyes , one second it was there next it was gone , no movement left ,right or up or down just totally stationary in one spot although it was rotating , then just vanished , this whole thing lasted about 15 minutes but it could have been there much longer before my friend noticed it .\r\n\r\nafter it was gone i observed 4 passenger jet aircraft pass over the same part of the sky at the same 60 degrees angle , i looked at the air craft through the binoclears so to get some reference as to the size of the sphere , as the passenger jets were flying at aproximatly  the same altitude  as the sphere , i estimate the sphere to be at least 40 feet in diameter or more , roughly speaking 40 to 60 feet in diameter , i have seen weather balloons and this was not one of them , through the binoclears my view was excellent, the fact that it simply just vanished was the most impresive thing for me.\r\n\r\nthis sphere was very mutch within range of newcastle airport and i feel sure they must have saw it on there radar.

live in quinton which is approx 4 miles \r\nfrom birmingham city centre. i have had \r\nan interest in military aircraft since the \r\nage of 14, i'm now 32. i know the signature \r\npatterns of aircraft and helicopter strobes \r\n and flight dynamics so the identification \r\nof an aircraft i can make instantly. \r\ni have been an amateur astronomer for \r\nover 10 years and own my own 10\" \r\nnewtonian telescope with observatory \r\nso even the faintest satelite or space \r\nanomaly i can identify. to put it short, \r\nmy eyes are quite well trained and not \r\nas easily fooled as the untrained eye. \r\ni have had a keen interest for most of \r\nmy life with ufology and have read many \r\n if not most of the ufo literature available. \r\ni have read many case reports and \r\nsightings so i know what  could be \r\neasily described as a ufo when a logical \r\nexplanation is available. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nheres my sighting, \r\n  \r\n\r\ni was standing by my patio door having \r\n a cigarette and my wife had just gone in \r\n the bath, whilst smoking i noticed a black \r\n object in the sky approx 3 miles away from \r\n my home, at first it could be confused with \r\n a hawk hovering at close range, but over \r\na heavy populated area at approx 3 miles, \r\n i think not. \r\n i continued to watch the object as my mind \r\n was trying to rationalise what i was seeing \r\nto an object i could relate to, i couldn't. \r\nthe object was black, no lights no sound. \r\nit seemed to be oval shaped and on \r\nocassions changed to a triangle shape. \r\nvisibility was very good, clear sky with a few \r\nrain clouds to the horizon and a few brillant \r\nwhite clouds which were being illuminated \r\nby the sun. \r\n i watched for an estimated 1 min 30 secs \r\nbefore accepting that this could be a ufo. \r\n\r\ni have a 9 month old daughter and when \r\nshe was born we decided to purchase a \r\ndigital hard drive camcorder to film her \r\ngrowing up. i decided to fetch this knowing \r\n more than likely that when i return the \r\nobject will have disapeared. \r\ni returned with the camera and noticed \r\n the object was still there, only now it was \r\non the move. \r\ni powered up my camera and started to \r\nfilm the object. the digital display on the \r\ncamera is approx 3 inches in size so \r\ni couldn't tell if i had the object in view or \r\neven in focus, but i continued to film. \r\nthe object moved over the trees and towards \r\n the horizon and finally disapeared behind a cloud. \r\nmy ideal reactions would have been to notify \r\nthe local police of a potential unidentified \r\nobject within a flight path and even contact \r\nair traffic control. \r\nreading as many ufo books \r\n as i have i know how important recordable \r\ndata is, but strange enough i did what most \r\ngeneral public do, i thought how strange and \r\njust sat down going over in my mind what i \r\nhad just witnessed. \r\nthe only plausable thing \r\n i did was to email timothy good straight away. \r\nalthough the obect was quite far away, with \r\na trained eye i could just about identify its \r\nshapes. we decided to watch the video to \r\nsee if you could see the little dot in the sky \r\nand to our amazment we captued \r\n2 mis 32 secs of the ordeal, and the footage \r\n is very clear","distance":"501 Feet - 1

\"sky-glow\" this night would only make photography an effort in futility.  i was staring at the eastern sky for a few minutes when, out of the corner of my eye, i spotted a very bright light shining behind a tree line in the distance.\r\n\r\nsince we live in the heart of farmland, i thought i might be looking at the light of farm equipment, until i realized that this light was far brighter than any farm equipment that i know of, plus the fact that this hour was not compatible with farmers.\r\n\r\nthe light was stationary for a short time, and then began moving very slowly in a northerly direction.  it appeared to be on the ground, and then it started to rise slowly, while moving forward.  this light appeared to be three-quarters to one mile away.  the light first appeared to me near the southeast corner, and was slowly moving toward the north.  i was awed by the brightness of this light.\r\n\r\nwithin thirty to forty seconds, this light slowly rose above the tree line and began to turn in my direction.  at this time i could not distinguish any shape or design; just a powerful light that was illuminating the trees and turf as it approached.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i moved to this location in 2003.  i had had an observatory on our other property, which i disassembled and reassembled here.  we live sixteen miles from a nuclear power plant, and while building my observatory, i seemed to have sparked an interest from the military, because military helicopters circled and observed my project on two occasions.  therefore, i began to think that the military might have a renewed interest in what i was doing.  i decided that this object was probably a helicopter in search of something, or perhaps someone.  i was waiting for the sound of an engine and rotor blades, but there was none.  this object was moving in my direction, so low and so slowly that i was occasionally able to discern objects under its bright light.\r\n\r\nmy neighbor has a maintenance shop and warehouse on his property, directly in front of where i was standing.  as the object began to approach my neighbor's property, its light went out.  many seconds passed, and i thought the thing was gone.  then, suddenly, i was confronted with an enormous object clearly defined by ambient light just above the roof of the shop.  it was so low, moving so slowly, and heading straight for me; and i actually thought it was crashing.  as this thing began approaching me and my observatory, it began to rise a little.\r\n\r\ni was so stunned by what i was seeing that i was preparing to run.  this thing was barely moving forward now, and could not be more than 200 feet above me, probably less.  i could make out incredible detail.  if there were rivets or bolts in its construction, i would have been able to count them.  as the object's rounded nose began to approach me, i was really taken back by its brightly lit windows.  there were none on or above its nose, but i was almost shocked to see a figure (humanoid form) moving as if it were pacing back and forth, in the large port window.  i could see no other shapes or shadows in any of the other windows.  of the many ridiculous thoughts that were dashing through my nind, one in particular was, \"there's no one at the controls.\"  as this larger window got closer, the figure moved away from the window toward the center of the craft, and disappeared from sight.  i was actually startled by how slowly this thing was moving, because it appeared to be getting ready to hover as its open hatch moved directly over me.\r\n\r\ni have to admit that i was entertaining some negative thoughts regarding my own safety at this time; but at the same time, i was so entranced by this object and this event, that i just kept staring.  details of this object are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) at least two stories high (that which i could see)\r\n(2) two larger windows, port and starboard\r\n(3) several smaller windows\r\n(4) a rounded nose\r\n(5) a shadowy figure in the large port side window\r\n(6) three opaque light type structures (there were no active lights)\r\n(7) two large turbo type structures (somewhat larger in diameter and shorter in length than what i am used to seeing on commercial aircraft)\r\n(8) eight flap or stabilizer type structures aft\r\n(9) a very large, square, black container type structure protruding off-center from its underbelly\r\n(10) an open hatch\r\n\r\ni know that there were other bulky geometric shapes that i saw on this object, but for some reason, i absolutely cannot remember what they looked like or where they were.  i remember thinking of this thing as being huge, thick and bulky, with an incredible amount of drag, and that it could not be an aerodynamic possibility.\r\n\r\nalmost immediately i felt a surge of static electricity.  the hair on my head and arms was moving, and i could feel a gentle tingle on my face.  i did not take my eyes off this object at any time.  as its tail section was about to pass over me, i quickly spun the dome.  as i was spinning the dome, while continuing to stare at this thing, it was gone.  no turbulence.  no sound.  just gone.  i continued to do a 360 degree search for a few minutes, but nothing was there.\r\n\r\ni must add that when the object was passing directly over me, it was making a sound.  the sound was too faint to be heard in any enclosed structure such as a house, shed, car, etc.; but nevertheless, it was there.  the best way i can describe ths sound would be a low-pitched roar or drone, similar to what you might hear a mile or so away from an airport, when a jet lands silently and its reverse thrusters are activated.  also, this sound was superimposed with another faint sound, much like the sound of bacon sizzling in a frying pan.\r\n\r\nwhen i spoke with a mufon representative over the phone, i mentioned that some of the equipment in my observatory had failed.  shortly after this event, i had major surgery, and it was about one and one-half months before i was able to re-enter my observatory.  what i discovered was that the micro-processor in the telescope itself appeared to be \"fried,\" along with another piece of equipment.  i replaced the panel board in the telescope, and all is well.\r\n\r\ni am well aware of what static electricity can do to a micro-processor.  is that what happened?  so much time had elapsed from the time of the event until i went back to my observatory that i feel it would not be accurate for me to say for sure that this is what happened...Just probably.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i did tour the area, as well as the surrounding areas to where i believed this event took place, and we found nothing out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7359,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.427337,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07042007-0004","longitude":-75.2340768,"occurred":1160682300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

finished dinner and i began driving down kaltz toward our home. before reaching the stop sign i noticed in the sky a red glow thinking it was a firework, and i told my husband, who was next to me in the car, to look at it because it wasn't reacting like a firework that disappears after it burns out.  i pulled up to the stop sign and got out as i did i called 911 and reported that the ball of fire was headed north toward van dyke the whole event lasted about 45 to 50 seconds.  the 911 operator asked my location and discription of the object and i explained to her what i was viewing.  another couple, who had pulled up to go around us, had stopped as i pointed to the sky, and they also saw the object.  the 911 operator asked me how big and how far away the object was and i told her it looked about the size of a small aircraft, though not an aircraft and was at a low altitude and just floated over me as i was speaking.  she said she would dispatch some one and i told her all they have to do is look up in the sky and they would see it.  i ended the call to 911 with the feeling that nothing was going to be done and that my call would be filed away as a prank.  i got back in my vehicle and proceeded to go toward van dyke but the object had disappeared.  i watch the sky all the time and i know an aircraft or a star or a fire work when i see one, and believe me , this was no fire work.   i hope someone else besides the couple who was in the other vehicle, my husband and myself saw what we did las night.  it was really spectacular.  it floated, no sound, just floated across the sky and right over our vehicles it was like a red fireball, it moved slowly and it was very low altitude.  \r\nthank you for your time, i didn't know where else to put this report but

swore my mother and i to secrecy when it first happened because he was very scared by his experience and didn't want to be ridiculed if details ended up in the public domain.  over a year later, he's finally agreed to let me share details of this incident with mufon because i've convinced him it should be recorded *someplace* publicly, even if he doesn't want to go public himself.\r\n\r\non may 1st 2006 my father had to drive from chester, england to porthmadog, north wales, for work reasons.  at approx 4:45pm on the return journey, he was driving south, approaching the village of gellilydan when he became aware of a \"silhouetted cigar shaped object\" flying 'gently' below cloud level in an easterly direction about two miles ahead of him.  he lost sight of it a few times due to the landscape, but having passed by the village, it became apparent that it was flying slowly north (towards him). assuming it was a 'regular aircraft' that he couldn't quite visualize properly, he was more interested than concerned at this point, and due to its apparent flight path over the open countryside, he figured it would clear him by less than a mile to the west when it passed.  so, his interest was piqued (\"is it a helicopter or a plane?\" he wondered) and he reduced his driving speed to approx 20-30mph in order to get a better view.\r\n\r\nas the flying object approached a point about 3/4 mile south west of his vehicle, he realised it was actually 'cylindrical'.  it had a reflective convex base and a very subtle (barely noticeable) \"electric blue\" aura.  he could only really see the underneath due to its angle.  this took him back (\"my heart rate accelerated\") and having a camera on him, decided to pull over onto a grass verge and take a photo. as he did this and scrambled for the camera, he realised the object had accelerated in his direction (it was very high up) and a huge shadow enveloped the area for about a mile around.  \"it was like a very dark thundercloud was right over me.\"  he pushed his head forward in the windscreen and looked up (awkward angle) - and to his horror could see that this thing was about 1/4 mile wide and just hovering beneath cloud level directly above the part of the road he was on.  he said it had huge tiles on its convex base.  he had never seen anything like it in his life.  it was \"impossibly enormous\".  he realises -- due to the sheer size of this thing -- that he probably underestimated how far away it was previously, but in relaying this event we've decided to use distances as he \"perceived them\" at the time.\r\n\r\nanyway, his heart was pounding, he was truly terrified because he couldn't make sense of the object and he was in the middle of nowhere (snowdonia national park) and decided to get the hell out of there.  he hastily started up his vehicle and pulled off when he noticed the shadow just disappear, \"like somebody flicked a switch and the thundercloud vanished\".  he looked around as he drove, pushed his face into the windscreen and looked up but he could no longer see it.  then (within sixty seconds), as he passed the trawsfynydd twin nuclear reactors, he became aware of it hovering above some high ground to the west.  the camera was on the passenger seat so without stopping the vehicle he just instinctively picked it up, snapped, then accelerated to 70mph intending to get out of the area as fast as possible.  he was overjoyed when he realised this 'object' had appeared on the exposure because it proved he wasn't going mad and he *had* actually witnessed something very unusual.  if it hadn't, he says he's not sure he'd have told my mother and i the story in case we thought he was cracking up.\r\n\r\never since, he has been scared of driving through rural areas alone, and won't drive at night time at all.  (not that it was night time when this incident occurred.)  i can understand that.  it's a good job he had to retire last summer really because he'd no longer be able to do his job due to the amount of driving involved.","distance":"501 Feet -

hard to say 300 to 500 meter ? - there was no rain. \r\nit was an unusual light environment, which i would explain as to be the clouds to be very slim or so. it wasn't dark, more some sort of yellowish twilight short before a thunderstorm. actually i don't remember wether it rained later that day or not, but i think it didn't.\r\n\r\nfrom the balcony you have free 270��� view over the city towards the harz-mountains south of braunschweig.\r\nvisibility below the clouds was good, so far.\r\ni don't know how long there was this orange light in position observed in about 45��� or higher (elevation) directly in the south of my position, but it catched my attention when it started moving southeast.\r\nmy first idea was that there might be a helicopter or a low flying plane in the clouds, but there was no typical sound.\r\nit appears to be something hidden in the lower layers of the clouds, and i saw it first accelerating at moderate speed heading approx. 135���.\r\nit continues to accelerate faster and rapidly changed course to approx. 225��� and seconds later again to approx 190���, while my direction of view was straight 180��� south.\r\nthe acceleration between first and second course change was fast, and so it remains a mystery to me how something manmade could have performed a sharp turn at that speed without disintegration. \r\nbetween first course change and second its flightpath covered the length of my underarm including hands if holded up into view.\r\non its second turn it stirred up the underside of the clouds or peaked out of them and a darkish structure or fuselage became visible for fractions of a second. while it was partly visible it appeared like 'burning'. but not 'burning' in common sense, i would say burning from color composition and from some glowing above the visible part of the structure reflecting on the clouds it passed through.\r\nthe structure came out a few times on its southbound course but just for fractions of a second, not long enough to be completly visible or to tell its shape.\r\nwhile i observed it i yelled into the apartment to make a friend of mine to come out to see it, but he was busy, or didn't hear me. however when that thingy sped off southbound i ran inside and got my friend out. \r\nwhen we returned on the balcony it was gone and he didn't see it.\r\n\r\ni must say, i regulary stand there and enjoy the good sight over the southern part of the city. i often see planes or helicopters flying at that altitudes, therefor i think i can say that it wasn't a helicopter or plane, cause of the silence during observation, and for its speed and capabilities to change course in such a manner.\r\nfrom its looks i would conclude on observing a meteorite, but those tend to fall in a straight line, and also do not perform multiple changes in course like that, or accelerate like that.\r\nthe object remained in one piece, there was no additional smoke, and it wasn't a light reflection of some sort as far as i can say - i observed it without looking through a window. \r\ni can rule out the possibility that it might was a strong light on the underside of the clouds, cause i clearly saw this darkish structure, and it wasn't dark during observation. \r\n\r\n\r\ni put this on file cause maybe someone saw it too\r\npossibly south of braunschweig, wolfenbuettel area, salzgitter area, harz mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

after sunset.  i took about 10 sunset photos and 5 of the moon.  i looked at my photos today and noticed 2 large strange illuminated diamond shaped objects appear in one of them.  at the time i took the photo i saw nothing, neither did anyone else.  it's probably just a strange camera effect, but nonetheless interesting.  if it is some camera effect/error, no wonder we have so many ufolike photos around!  \r\n\r\nafter zooming in on them on my computer i also noticed a small white and silver sphere object as well.  the diamond shapes seem very similar to other ufo pictures i've seen and both objects appear similar, but one is at a different angle.  after another inspection it also seems there is grey exhaust type trail behind each of the large objects, but they appear to be heading in different directions.  the small round one reminds me of the swarm of ufo's captured in mexico by a news crew, but more likely it is venus or another star...This object appears in another photo in the same location and looks boomerange shaped, but the photo is blurred from being on a rocking boat and i now believe it to be a star.  the small one is directly in a line between the uppermost right large object and the moon.  there are also two large circles of different shading, one very big below the object and a smaller one just to the right of the moon.  i suppose this could all be some weird camera effect, but it doesn't appear in any other photos and i've shot over 1,000 photo with this camera and never had anything like this appear.  there are a few dropped pixels in the picture as well.  i have made no alterations to the files, they are directly off the camera.  the camera is an 8 megapixel olympus sp 350 and the file size of the image is 1.5 megabytes with pretty good resolution.  the first photo may have been with the flash on, and the second two i think i turned it to off from auto.  perhaps they are insects illuminated by the flash??  any photo anylysis or possible explanations would be appreciated.  i'm including 2 of the other moon shots where nothing appears for comparison...(except the small object i believe is a star).  the camera records all 3 photos as taken during the same

lights up ahead in the distance. they were odd-looking enough to get joking comments from me about it being a ufo. as we got closed, we realized it was moving very slowly, practically hovering.. as we got even closer, it changed directions from traveling south west eventually east. as it got closer and closer, we were very surprised to see how slowly it was moving. it seemed like maybe 40-50 miles per hour. the \"wings\" were large - the size of 3 or 4 passenger plane wings. there were lights beneath these wings. as it traveled east directly above us, i opened my window to get a better look. i didn't hear anything. it was a few hundred feet above us. we should have heard something. i got the best look at it through my moonroof. it looked exactly like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Ufocasebook.Com/newstagvee.Jpg\r\n\r\nif i would have drawn a picture of it, it would have come out a lot like that picture. it was absolutely not a plane (it had no body) or a

don't know why i didn't decide to follow it more. i suppose i didn't really believe that i saw what i saw when i was seeing it... i could have turned right and followed it a little longer, but i didn't. we're both shocked that we didn't look further into whatever this was...\r\n\r\np.S. it was flying beneath the clouds. the clouds were greyish white - making it very easy to see this

were sitting out in our back yard patio around a table talking when my brother jumped up and said \"what the heck is that!\", looking up at the sky towards the north from our home in independence, mo.  my daughter and i then jumped up to look and we saw a very large, very bright white circular object traveling from west to east.  this was two-three times the brightness of venus, and the size of approximately 4 747's, or three-four times the size of venus.  there was a smaller, less bright object following approximately 500 ft behind and slightly left of the larger object that did not change position. i guessed them to be at about 1000 ft.  we noticed a jet airliner way above these objects.  the ufo's were moving at a fairly fast clip - and we ran across the driveway into the street (about 100 ft) to catch sight of the objects through the trees but lost them.  the sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds or slightly more.  i found out the next day that the iss was traveling in the same area at nearly the same time, however, these objects were way too low and too bright to have been the iss and shuttle. \r\n \r\nnow for the really strange part: a couple of minutes before this happened my husband told us he was going to the warehouse to check on something. i thought it was odd because it was so late, but i thought he would be right back.  i was mad that he missed this sighting by two minutes -he always seems to miss stuff like this.  now when we ran through the driveway i saw his work van there and so thought he had not left yet.  after we lost sight of the objects, the three of us moved out of the street into the driveway and were talking about what the objects could have been, when i noticed that my husband walked from the driveway up the porch steps to the side of the house. it was dark outside, but not pitch dark-- and light was coming out of the sliding doors on the porch so the area had some illumination, but what i could see was as a black outline of a person and he was walking strangely.  then i noticed that my car was missing. i said \"wait a minute, where is gene?\" to my brother and daughter. they said \"he must have left in your car.\"  at that point, i got a very creepy scary feeling and actually started to shake.  now i don't scare too easly, but this was different.  as i thought about it i realized that whatever it was had long arms down to the knees and swung his arms in an odd manner, more like what an ape would do, and i realized at that point that it could not have been my husband that i saw! \r\n \r\nthe three of us collected ourselves after a couple of minutes and decided to go inside to look in every room in the house but nothing was there.  i realized that it was probably not a human being, and chills ran up my spine. \r\n \r\nmy brother needed to go home, and since he had been dropped off after a training meeting at the police department where he is a volunteer, he needed a ride.  my daughter took him home and i went along because i did not want to be alone in the house.  after dropping my brother off we stopped at my daughter's house to see the work that her husband had finished building a fountain and patio, and i stayed for a while talking with them because i was too afraid to go home yet,  then she took me home at about 11:25 p.M. mh husband was not home yet, so i got a big kitchen knife and turned on all of the lights outside the house and on the lower level, locked the doors, then went to the living room to read and wait for him to get back. i did not turn on the t.V. so i would be able to hear any noises. \r\n \r\nsighting #2: 11:39 p.M. maria had to drop of some important mail at the post ooffice in downtown independence, and when she came out of the doors something caught her eye over a building on the square that was 1/2 block from the post office in a northerly direction.  she said it looked like something the size of a streetlight, a very bright white light, and fell-- free-fall-- from a height of about 60 ft above the building.  there was no trail of light behind it.  she thought it must have fallen into or just behind the building and was going to go check on it, when she saw a silver truck parked at the side of the building with someone sitting in it. for some reason, she thought that was odd at that hour and decided not to pursue finding the object. note: the building she saw this thing over happens to be right across the street from our two businesses. \r\n \r\nmaria called me and told me about this. we were both incredulous that a second sighting could happen to her on the same night.  i told her i was a little concerned that my husband had not yet returned, and it was getting late.  a few minutes after we hung up he arrived.  when asked why he decided to go to the warehouse so late, and he said he needed to move some stuff around for new stock coming in.  i still thought it was strange, though. i told him what had happened and he was amazed and mad that he didn't see it. i was so stressed out that my neck hurt and i told him i wanted to get in the hot tub on the porch but i wanted him to stay downstairs so i wouldn't be alone.  he went in the living room and fell asleep on the couch while i got in the tub. i did not feel a presence of anything around, but was still keeping an eye out. maria had suggested that i meditate and and ask what was going on with all of the (extremely) strange stuff that night.  i did so, and to my surprise i heard four strange voices talking - it was conversation from an air base and i wrote the entire conversation down right after hearing it!  basically, it was about a bogey appearing on radar and they sent a jet up to chase it. note: i am not adding that down here but if anyone is interested i can send it. i don't know what all of the jargon means - i don't have any experience with planes, but i got the impression that this was a real ufo event. \r\n \r\nsighting #3: now i came out of it and did not hear anything other conversation going on although i felt that was not the end of it. i got out of the hot tub, looked skyward, and saw a bright whitish/yellow object the size and brightness of mars go from eastto west.  it had a trail like a shooting star, however, at this point i wonder what it really was!\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

1976.\r\n i was outside making snowmen in my parents backyard,as a kid i was 11 years old. it was a bright sunny day with little cloudcover and cold. i had a great view of the landscape as many farms surrounded our place in the country. \r\n something caught my eye to the south and i looked up to see a rectangular object travelling slowly from my left to right. it was a thin object with no portholes and seemed metallic looking. i could see it clearly (it was around 11 am) and had a checker board pattern on the bottom red and silver/metallic. it appeared slightly longer than it was wide. \r\n i watched in amazment for a few seconds, i would estimate its altitude to be around 500 feet high flying level to the ground. at its closest approach it looked to be within 1000 feet of me but it did not slow down as it passed me. i had no idea what the object was as it did not resemble any of the aircraft i had observed which occasionally fly by (at higher altitudes) to halifax airport. also the airport lies west of my location and it was flying north. this object was not aerodynamic; it had square edges! i have attended many airshows (us and canadian) since and nothing resembles it! \r\n the object,which was solid as i could not see through it, continued for a few more seconds and then blindingly accelerated off continuing its trajectory that i had first seen it on. it looked like it did not climb but maintained altitude, possibly disappearing over the horizon several miles to the north. it was difficult to tell exactly where it went due to its amazing acceleration/speed, it took maybe half asecond to go several miles, \r\n(it had been travelling approx 60 mph before this) it did not make any sound. no exhaust was seen either. no sonic boom. it was then and is now a complete mystery. i never saw it again even though i still visit that spot frequently,30 years later. \r\n unfortunately i believe i was the only witness to the event, the rest of my family was in the house, and it is a lowly populated area. i remember telling my dad who was asleep on the couch but he really wasn't open/ interested in these kinds of things and besides it was already gone.\r\n soon after the event (and not before) i became keenly interested in the subject of ufo's, reading any and all books on the subject. began watching tv shows on the subject and still do to this day. its still a mystery. i believe there are unknown , intelligently controlled objects out there. the government would be 'foolish' to ignore them. i believe they do not, no matter what the press releases say!\r\n as a final note i went into engineering after high school possibly due to the feeling that was left with me. i just had to know how things 'worked'. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

walked a half mile (south) past a large curve in the road that bends to the west and then south. on our nightly walks it was not unusual to see headlights from the cars coming around the curve. we saw lights coming and based upon the distance (1/2 mile) i knew i had about 20 seconds to get off the blacktop and walk on the shoulder. as i looked back to approximate the rate of closure the lights accelerated and a blinding flash went off over our heads. i winced in the expectation of a thunder clap (or something)for about a second, then looked up to see any sign of an air vehicle passsing over. there was no sound produced during the flash and i saw nothing in the sky. it was a perfectly clear (starlit) night and snow was covering the ground. the flash reminded me of the old poloroid
