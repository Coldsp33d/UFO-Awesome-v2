around 1984 - i was woken at about 01h00 by my hound who wanted to go outside. it was a magnificent night, no haze, no wind, no noise. i sat on the front porch idling listening to the hound sniffing around in a flower bed some 20 feet away. her sniffs carried quite clearly on the still air.\r\n  i was looking at the stars, entranced by their brightness because of the lack of haze. i was facing south-east when directly above me two objects moved in close formation travelling from north-east to south-west. their formation was exactly the same as the leader and the wingman would be in a tight two-ship fighter aircraft formation. they were shaped like five-sided \"triangles\" as below.\r\n\r\n                       ^\r\n                     /   \\\r\n                   /       \\\r\n                /             \\\r\n              /                 \\\r\n            /                     \\\r\n           /                       \\\r\n          /                         \\\r\n         /                           \\\r\n        /                             \\\r\n       /                               \\\r\n      /                                 \\\r\n     /                                   \\\r\n     -------------------------------------  \r\n\r\n  their outline was identified by a pale-blue neon-like light and the rest  looked black. they blocked out the stars as they moved. there was no blocking out of the stars beyond the blue outline which seemed to indicate that the blue was inded the outer shape of the objects. without the blue outline i doubt if i would have seen anything at all.\r\n  i have been an aviation \"nut\" all my life and am a keen birdwatcher and i am confident that these objects were neither aircraft, as i know them, nor birds. many hours trying to identify birds and high flying aircraft have trained me to observe all aspects of what i am looking at. any ornithologist would know what i mean.\r\n  the air was exceptionally still and these objects made no noise whatsoever nor did they exhibit any movement other than forward as, say, a dassault mirage iii would make in normal straight flight.\r\n  i know what a 747 moves and sounds like at 1,000 feet and at 30,000 feet. i also am totally familiar with a mirage iii at around 1,000 to 2,000 feet.\r\nbecause i had absolutely no indication of the size of the objects - they looked mirage iii size at 1000 feet moving at say 250-350 knots - yet they could equally have been the size of a city block at 40,000 feet and moving at 10,000 knots (assuming that they did not burn up at that altitude and speed!) -  i do not have a clue. i can clearly remember the number of stars they blocked out as they moved but this still did not assist my judgement of their speed and size. i could not guage any height of the objects from their back elevation as they disappeared to the south-west which may indicate that they were big and flat and high.\r\n  obviously \"ufo's\" crossed my mind but i was intrigued by the fact that these objects did not look like the \"traditional 'flying saucers'\" i had, or have, read about.\r\n  i never bothered to tell anyone about them for years knowing that people are usually either completely gullible or totally skeptical about any such occurrence.\r\n  i entually dicussed this with a friend who is a member of the skeptics society (and a great admirer of james randi - i may add). we covered all sorts of possibilities but came to no rational conclusion.\r\n  perhaps i was dreaming, perhaps it was an illusion but what i can reiterate is that these objects were not birds and they were not aircraft known to me (and no - they were not the planform of the now familiar stealth fighter or bomber). during the time they passed overhead i continued to hear the hound sniffing - indicating to me that the objects were not emitting any sound that reached my ears. (i have recently tested my hearing and it is perfect.)\r\ni am sensitive to feelings, particularly \"hostile\" or \"negative\" ones but felt entirely peaceful during the experience, no excitement, no apprehension, just a feeling of \"calm awe\".\r\n  i leave you to make up your own mind what could have taken place that night - i simply do not know.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7327,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-33.9248685,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-06272007-0005","longitude":18.4240553,"occurred":439027200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Western

heritage���.  price $29.95 + s/h \r\n\r\nthis book covers your starting point in time and space. akashic records, the start of your journey which would be considered your home planet. the separation process, inner earth, abductions, contacts. star seeding charts. it goes into great detail about the many planets, star systems what role they play in your evolutionary process. who lives there and their trials and progress in time and space. it gives you a wider outlook of where you came from and your many journeys through the many universes. if you ever wonder how you came to planet earth and where you were before, this book will help you discover the truth about the your role and your galactic heritage. this newly revised book has a lot of rare photos taken by me. on the cover of the book is a photo of the space ship 7th dimensional of scientist from polaris, the alien being on the cover of the book is from haldar the cat planet.  also the truth about planet x. or the 10 planet.\r\nwhen the movie roots came out everyone started to wonder about their own heritage. this was the beginning of parents looking for their children and children looking for their birth parents. others looking for their lost loves, brothers, sisters and families from war torn zones of years gone by. sadly to say with the on going wars and natural disasters this searching is on a daily basis with much sorrow despair and feelings of abandonment. a new industry was build up from this great yearning which nothing seems to fill this void, even after finding them. people started doing their own genealogy charts, searching around the world for their roots. their search did not go far enough looking for their real families. \r\n\r\neach planet and star system has it's own goals and learning, they want to experience. polaris wants to explore what addicions does to the physical body, the spirit and the soul. therefore we find many from polaris on earth with addictions. earth is a great place to work on this or that. sadly to say when they die they feel they have failed because humanity looks down on them for drinking, smoking, and taking drugs which may have caused their death. but this is what they came to learn about so they have not failed but have succeeded indeed. some of my guides who are from polaris said that many do not go back to polaris when they die, for this reason. when in truth they are welcomed with much love and respect on their return. they do not need to punish themselves and keep reincarnating life after lifetime. if these words hit a cord with you please take it to heart.  in my book the truth about planet x and the 10th planet. if you have any questions about my work please feel free to contact me. \r\nmy ufo contacts, let me know when they are in the area. i never have to looking for them. i use mostly a kirlian camera, at times just a regular 35mm or a polaroid camera. see more unusual photos on my website.\r\n\r\ncaroline

spotted a red-orange object beneath dark, heavy clouds. it made it's way toward the lake from the south, having either come over the city heading north, or had dropped out of the clouds. it was a bright object and formless looking at the distance from which i spotted it. being familiar with the area (ie, city lights, towers, etc) the light caught my attention immediately. not to mention there was a dense, low cloud cover and it was approximately 11pm, so very dark. as it got nearer, through our mutual shock and original attempts to explain it as something else, we both noticed it was vaguely diamond shaped, & looked to wobble on an axis. straining to hear a noise, we heard nothing coming from the craft, which was moving in a northerly direction at a fast pace. being dark and uncertain on the height of the ceiling of clouds, i could only guess how large or fast it was. i grabbed a flashling and tried to signal it with timed pulses directed toward it. at it's closest point, it was close enough to one of the shores to see a reflection of it in the water. that specific shore was perhaps 350 meters to the west of us. not long after i flashed my light at it, it seemed to speed up and bow to the east further over the lake, hover, then changed course heading west, southwest. as it hovered, a hole in the clouds opened two or three fist widths in diameter and i saw something very large, grey or black in color with multiple lights. through the clouds around the hole, four or five yellow lights filtered in, these seemed to move with this second craft and i think were a part of it. whatever it was, it filled the small hole in the clouds and then some, meaning it would have had to been enormous. this second craft was moving above the cloud cover in a southwesterly direction and was gone from sight through the hole in a matter of seconds and the yellowish hazey lights faded. looking back to the red-orange object, we watched it hover for a moment, then take it's new course as above mentioned, to the west southwest and stayed on that course below the cloud cover before speeding over the horizon. it seemed to be moving much faster than before as it left the area. the whole affair couldn't have lasted more than three minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stricken with the fact that i could not identify what it was.  judging by its distance from me, it would likely have been 5-10 metres tall.  it was cylindrical and tapered in shape, with a flat top and bottom, although the diameter was smaller at the top.  it had a brilliant mirror shine to it which is what made it so striking.  there are no aircraft in my area made with that kind of material, and few that fly in from or around that area (the far south west of the city.)  it hovered directly south of me as i entered the intersection, and i jumped out of my vehicle once i was around the corner to continue watching it.  a lady joined me.  after hovering still for a moment, it began to glide silently to the west, at a relatively fast pace. shortly after, it began a very gradual descent.  we both lost sight of it behind some trees and were not able to spot it again.  niether one of us could think of a rational explanation for what we had seen.  it could not have been a balloon based on the initial, perfectly stationary movement of the object, and it had a very distinct shape that i would attribute to a jujube candy or something of that nature.","distance":"501 Feet

the front door saying dad hurry you have got to see this. i jumped up ran outside and he pointed to a star like figure in the sky. to my astonishment it was moving at what i would seem to think was a very high rate of speed being that it appeared to be at a high altitude, it also was making several directional changes which led me to belive it was of intelligent orgin.It also seemed to me to be pulsating or flickering like a sparkler slightly . this object appeared to be about the size of an eraser head on a pencil at arms length, it looked very similar to the star or planet in the sky at the same time that evening that was located in th south east sky from where i was standing,the time it took for this object to cross the sky to the eastern horizion from directly above when i first saw it was probably  less than one minute and thirty seconds.The most interesting thing about this sighting was not the actual object to me but was that as we stood in my front yard and watched this object fly over head and pointed and commented about it several people walked by or jogged and never onnce looked up see what we were talking about ,see i just figure that it is some kind of new goverment technology but later thinking about it ,it just seemed strange how many times do things like this take place just above our heads an we dont even take the time to look up and notice it. also later thinking about it it went down right around seqouia national park where i had heard there had been recent sightings.  my son saw the following prior to me going outside:\r\n\r\ni was lying on the grass in my front yard looking up at the moon when i heard a fire alarm blare a few blocks over.  i glanced across the schoolyard that is adjacent to our house and then looked back up.  the sun was just beginning to set and their were few stars out save the bright ones in the west.  that was when i noticed that one of them was traveling at an unusual rate of speed.  it was too fast to be a plane and there were no colored or flashing lights.  it was out of place because it was so bright.  there was no com trail or distinguishing features that would have led me to believe it was anything ordinary.  as it got directly overhead, i noticed it began to drift rapidly from side to side.  not like a turn but more like a skiier drifting side to side.  i was astonished at how it managed to maintain it's forward speed even while drifting.  i'm not one to believe in aliens or anything of the sort but it was highly unusual.  i then thought to tell somebody and quickly got my father.  everything i saw was listed above in my father's statement.  the most interesting thing for me was that i had not noticed it sooner.  it almost seemed to come from nowhere in the quick glance i had made.  thank you for your time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

to gaze at the half moon and stars. the moon was fairly bright & somewhat low over the southwest horizon. it lit up the mountains to the south. the northern and eastern sky was much darker than the sky to the south and west. many stars were easily observable to the east & north.\r\n\r\nin the eastern sky, two bright orange-yellow lights appeared about 30 degrees over the horizon. i viewed them with binoculars and managed to get a photo of one of the lights. these lights hovered for approximately 10 minutes before slowly descending below the horizon. they were barrel shaped, bright orange, with a lava like red belt running across their middle. they emitted an orange glow. they appeared to move independent of each other. after they disappeared over the horizon, i could still see their glow, leading me to believe that they weren't that far away, 5 to 10 miles maybe was my guess.\r\n\r\ni waited about ten minutes longer hoping to see them again. then, the lights slowly rose above the horizon again and hovered for about another ten minutes before they descended below the horizon again. i stayed up about another half hour but the lights did not reappear.\r\n \r\nthis event took place out in the east central wyoming countryside, 8 miles from town, in an area that is remote and sparsely populated. since this is where i live, i am familiar with the terrain and whether seeing lights in this area would be a common occurrence or not. it is not a common occurrence to see any lights where these ones were observed.\r\n\r\nsince i viewed similar lights in this location several years ago at about the same time of year, i was not all that surprised to see them again. i've never seen anything like them and can offer no explanation as to what they were. could this be an astral

object in the sky. at first, he thought it was a new billboard advertisment because it was so bright and low in the atmosphere. when he got closer to it, he realized it wasn't a sign because it was flying. he followed it until he was as close as a half mile away from it. other people were driving down the road and my boyfriend reported noticing others pointing and looking out their car windows.He left it to come home to wake me up as a witness and to get a camera. at 2:45 we started driving toward toledo. it was so low in the sky that trees and buildings blocked our view. we finally got out to the country with no obstructions and i got my first look at it. it was by that time at least 15 miles away from us over the skyline of toledo. it was huge and glowing a pale green. it seemed to be spinning (slowly) becuase at times it looked like a disc (sideview)and at times it looked narrow light (front/back view). there is no way this object could be mistaken for a plane, star, satellitte, etc. it was too low in the sky and too massive and glowing green! the only possible explanation we could think of to explain it away was that it was a blimp because of its size and position in the atmosphere. online, we looked up commercial blimps to see if any of them glowed green in the sky. we didn't find anything that looked like what we saw. also, why would a blimp be flying that late at night and why did it appear to spin? my understanding is that blimps don't move like that. this object was so large and noticeable, that others around the monroe and toledo area

our ability to catch up with it. my boyfriend tried to take a picture, only to find when we rushed to get the camera, there was no disc inside.

sky was very dark and cloudy. there had just been a massive thunder and lightning storm.  my kid & i drive by there all the time, dulles international airport is nearby so seeing flying objects is not uncommon, except we saw a set of 3 lights that were were flying vertical as if the craft was flying in a \"standing\" position, except once we looked closer, it was 3 globes of white light perfectly parallel over each other, but were individual.  so i thought, :wow\" another ufo...(my daughter & i seem to attract them)i've never taken a picture though.  but as we came into the nighborhood, where there are barely any street lights & is very dark,(as u will see in the video) we noticed a very large, glowing ball of light which was obviously not a star!!! at first, i felt weird and sort of uneasy, like we had been \"followed\" or \"watched\". my daughter seemed very excited. we were further away from airport flight traffic by now. i pulled the car over, (there were no other vehicles present) and placed the camara on top of the car to take a picture, my camara has a movement focus setting( i take a lot of concert/sport event pics which action snaps still & focused as if the singer or athelete was standing motionless). i didn't realize it til later but i actually got a short video as i was trying to set the camara & you can hear my daughter commenting,\"there's the ufo\".  the video was shot @ 2154hrs & the first still picture at 2156hrs. i snapped 6 pictures, not moving the cemara from its place, the pics are about 30-45 seconds apart. the last picture was at exactly 2200hrs when the glowing sphere just dissapeared.  i thought the pictures would all come out w/a black sky & a white dot in the center, but when i got home and examined the pictures, they show that it moved positions, changed shape, and the last picture i'd have to say it had to have moved incredibly fast because it looks elongated.  after, we got back in the car, i still felt uneasy, like it was still there but invisible..  it was the first time, i actually got one on camara. first one i've ever reported. let me know what u think. my mufon name is

or less, moving in erratic patterns, and at unbelievable speeds! when i first spotted the objects, they were grouped together, so perfectly that it's almost safe to say that the objects made a complete 360 degree square. all of a sudden, the objects just shot down, then to the left, and then up again. i stopped looking at the objects, thinking that it was just probably nothing, but i became curious, and happened to look up once more. and with luck, there were the objects, making the same maneuvers that they had the first time. i started to think, \"wow! i think i'm really seeing an ufo phenomenon!\" so i put down my binoculars to put my glasses back on, looked up again, and the objects were gone! after the event, i ran inside and got online to report the ufo's. what really got me to notice the objects in the first place was the unbelievable speeds at which they moved. when i first saw the objects i thought that they were just a simple star cluster, but apparently i was wrong.

dark circle, aligned with the jet, flying the same speed as the jet & not leaving a jet stream. i stopped walking. i could not believe what i was seeing. i've seen things before but only for split

flew far out in front and above the plane, leaving no jet stream. it then suddenly became a silver cigar shaped object only for a second. it returned to the dark sphere shape and flew back behind and lower than the plane. once again it turned this silver cigar shape for a second and then back to the circle shape. i reached into my car, pulled out my cellphone & called my friend. when i looked up again it was gone. i continued to watch the jet until it was no longer in sight.  2 more jets passed within the next 20 minutes, but with no objects following them.
