what looked like an extremely bright head light on a jet approached my house from the west.  i live on powell butte, a point in the pdx flight pattern that jets use to line up for the air port.  as it came closer it did not reveal the normal details of a jet and just as i was about to write it off as reflection, a commercial jet came into view at lower altitude and just behind the ball.  then the ball and jet passed almost directly overhead.  at no time, or angle, did the ball exhibit any detail other than light, it was completely consistent at all angles.  it was clear to me that the pilot of the jet was carefully pursuing the object at an altitude and angle that allowed them a visual through their front windshield.  as the two of them continued east, another very large jetliner appeared out of the south at very low altitude, almost at the tree tops, and was obviously avoiding a collision as the other jet and ball of light passed directly over it.  at that point the first jet veered out of the normal landing pattern.  there is no way that the airline pilots of both planes did not get a good long look at this thing, and considering it flew right down the middle of a major pdx flight pattern i'm sure the tower saw it as well.  this is not the first time i have seen this thing/s but because of the reference the jets provided, and the actions they took, i am certain it was

the mothership\", and we stopped what we were doing and watched the sky. since my last experience in january, i always scan the sky in the evening when i'm out of doors. i noticed a few planes high overhead with flashing lights as usual and there were a few coming in to our airport as usual with their headlights on. i also noticed a commercial craft in the western sky bound for europe i suppose. this plane was high, maybe 35,000 feet or so with it's lights flashing. the international airport is approximately twenty miles away in a north easterly direction and cfb shearwater is most likely the same distance from us but in a south easterly direction.\r\ni became aware of a bright light in the west just above the tree line as though a plane was coming in to land at the airport, (this is a common occurance out here in hammonds plains to see a single bright light in the sky turn into two landing lights),and a short distance behind it i noticed a reddish point. i watched to see if the forward light would become two headlights as is usual for a plane coming in to land but the light remained singular as the light grew in brightness and the one following behind it quickly gave up it's reddish tint and grew bright and starlike also. these lights were almost as large and bright as the planet sitting in the western sky.\r\nmy wife and i watched for some minutes as the two starlike objects moved across the sky maintaining the same speed and direction (wnw to sse) and altitude until they passed beyond the treeline in the south southeast. there were no engine sounds or flashing lights associated with these objects. they were still very bright as the approached the southeastern sky.\r\nmy first thought was that they might be military aircraft going to cfb shearwater or overseas. i've seen military craft escorting other craft before in the daytime sky, maintaining the same distance from one another.\r\nmy wife and i were puzzeled to say the least and were hopeful someone else would have seen this and that it could be explained. we were a little excited but not fearful in the least.\r\nif anyone can explain this \"happening\" please do.","distance":"501 Feet -

unidentified flying object.(unidentified to us) we had never seen anything like it. we were sitting on our back porch talking when my son says \"what the heck, is that two stars chasing each other\"?That description got my attention and i looked in the direction he was pointing which was tree top high and to the left of our view of the western horizon. my son's description was apt.  the  lights were some distance apart and they were rising up  vertically. we yelled for my daughter to come outside to see because i knew as soon as i saw it that it was definitely not like anything i'd ever seen before. we walked from the porch to our yard to keep watching and it kept moving steadily with no sound at all and the lights were steady and bright. it looked to me to be only about 200 ft or so above us as it passed over although it seemed much farther away when we first spotted it. i am of course only geussing but it seemed to be at least as long as a football field but my son thinks it was much larger. the reason i decided it was two lights that were part of a vehicle of some kind is because as it moved the space between the two lights obliterated the stars from our view and also the two lights although far apart were moving in perfect sync. my son, whose vision is better than my own says that he could make out the shape of a long horizontal daimond with the lights positioned at each corner horizontally. i asked my daughter to run back inside to get the video camera from my bedroom .It was almost directly overhead when she brought the camera outside. while she was frantically trying to get the battery on the camera it continued to move in an easterly direction almost directly overhead . i asked my daughter to give me the camera so i could try to get the battery in place finally. i had to look down to do that but i didn't want take my eyes off of it for a second.  i slammed the battery in and looked up to see it's position and it gradually faded away behind some thin misty clouds. i couldn't even tape it's disappearance because i slammed the battery in upside down!! my son said that he could still see it faintly behind the clouds still moving in the same direction and at the same speed but it was gone completely from my sight. i was a little embarrassed but i called the local sherrif's department to report it and also to find out if anyone else had reported anything.  i can tell you one thing for sure it was a very exciting experience. my kids and i feel a little differently. they think it was an alien space ship and are a little scared because after all , why would the aliens fly over their house in particular? i am of the opinion that it was more likely some top secret millitary aircraft and  it makes me angry that the millitary would try to scare their own citizens by performing an alien spaceship flyby. i hope i didn't leave anything out and sorry for the lack of paragrahs. please let me know if anyone else reported a similar sighting or if you can explain to us what it actually was that we saw. thanks in advance if you have any helpful info and also thank you for the opportunity to describe our experience without feeling

2) there was no engine sound; 3) they seemed moving at an incredible velocity [assuming they were very high in the sky]; 4) the lights faded away on a clear night.  if they were airplanes, they should have been visible all the way to the horizon. 5) they were very bright, much brighter than typical aircraft lighting.\r\n\r\nmy second thought was that they were satellites reflecting sunlight.  the way they appeared to disappear in the night sky was certainly reminiscent of satellites moving into the earth's shadow.   i am not completely satisfied with this explanation either. first, the lights were larger an much brighter than any satellite i have seen before, and i have seen many.  also, i have never seen satellites that appear to move in tandem in a collinear fashion.  \r\n\r\nfinally, i wondered if we had seen the space station and shuttle reflecting the sun's light as they orbited overhead.  i just checked the nasa website which reports possible sighting times for both, and it appears that this is very likely what we saw.  both were supposed to pass overhead from nw to ese last night at approximately the time i thought we saw them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":7272,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.3128769,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06202007-0008","longitude":-105.5889907,"occurred":1182313800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wyoming","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1182313800000,"summary":"Two bright lights moving wnw to ese across the sky","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Laramie, Wyoming","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:457800"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Ionia","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Last night at approximately 11:30pm i was next to the house talking to my son and daughter-in-law when i decided to go back in the house. i casually looked up at the stars while i was walking, and noticed 2 bright stars that seemed to be traveling slowly in tandem across the sky. i then noticed an almost invisible shape surrounding the lights in the form of a blimp shape, or fat cigar. the shape was hard to detect unless you were concentrating on the lights because it blended into the dark sky almost perfectly so as to almost appear invisible. the object was large-the size of 3 or 4 full moons side by side. the object was traveling in a south easterly direction, and had it been a plane or helicopter, the engine noise would have been easily discernable at the height this appeared to be at. this object was totally silent. i quickly told my son and daughter to look up and pointed to the object--they also saw it. they continued to watch as i ran into the house to get my binoculars so i could see it better. by the time i came out and put the binoculars top my face the object lights were already becoming quite dim in the distance-i put the binoculars down in time to see the lights disappear and the object was no longer visible, like it had completely disappeared. there were only 2 white lights at the bottom of the object - almost double the brightness of nearby background stars. no other lights were seen--no colors, not blinking. it was totally silent and large, easily the size of a passenger airliner or bigger.
