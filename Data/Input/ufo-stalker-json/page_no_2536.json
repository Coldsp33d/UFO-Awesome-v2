in the fall/winter of '89.  my mother, my two year old brother and i were returning home from my brother's god-parents house on 14th street.  we lived at that time in caballo street.  caballo used to be the last street in that sub-division, with only a about 15 homes built.  our home was right in front off where the empty lots started.  just to give you a mental picture of the location. picture this:\r\nfrom mary lou drive turn right onto caballo.(like i said before caballo was the last street. windlake loop did not exist nor did alambre dr. these streets were barren lots.) our home about the 7th one on the right side of the street.  in front of the house there were no homes yet, just barren land as far as the eye could see.  as we approached the house my mother, about to pull the cadillac into the garage, asks me if i was seeing what she was seeing.  to the left of us(in front of the house)over the empty lots and about 50 feet up and maybe 100 yards away from us is some kind of craft. all we could see were two illuminated squares that appeared to be windows, and red lights next to them. just hovering!  our first reaction was to think, border patrol helicopter.  my mom rolled down the window, no sound!  my mom turned to look at me with disbelief.  we turned our attention back to the craft and it seemed to turn over on its belly.  like flipping a tortilla over you know?  we opened the doors and stepped outside to see if we could hear a noise. nothing.  all of a sudden the craft started to move slowly to the left of us(back to the direction of mary lou dr.)  we got into the car and turned it around to follow it side by side.  the craft was now about 50 yards behind the houses.  when we, the craft and us, got to the end of caballo st. the craft flew over to what is now windlake loop and seemed to land.  we slowly drove along mary lou dr. to see if we could see and or hear anything.  after a couple of minutes my mom said \"ok, this is strange.  its gone, lets go home and we'll tell your father tomorrow.\"  we got home, my mom pulled the car into the driveway.  we got out to open the garage.  we did not have and electric door.  it was manual.  as soon as we got out of the car. my mom screams, \"look its back!\"  she a was pointing towards the start of the block.  the craft all of a sudden shines a bright white light on us.  the front of the house seemed like it was day light.  we just stood there mesmerized just looking into the light just thinking why is there no sound on this damn thing.  after what seemed a couple minutes, it turned off the light. in a blink of an eye it jetted upward and disappeared.  we stood there, my mom had here jaw at the floor.  \"did you see that?\"  of course!  when we went to bed i kept imagining an alien peeking in through the windows. needless to say i slept in my parents bed that night.\r\nover the course of the next few days, my father a doctor, returned from the hospital with a weird contraption.  it was a little yellow box with a handle and a little sliver prod connected by a cord.  the yellow box had a gauge.  my dad said it was a radiation detector.  a friend that worked at the hospital lent it to him.  we went to were we thought it had landed.  nothing, no radiation.  i was upset because i know we had seen something a few days back.  after all these years i still don't know what the hell that was and i want answers.  i have never done drugs, physically fit, good mental health.  you see it does not end there with my family.  after this happened my parents told me a story that years before i was born.  they too had seen something that seemed to be flying next to them as they traveled down the dark highway.  fast forward to early 90's and once again my mom and myself saw weird craft where we live in pepper lane.  \r\nthank you for taking the time to read this.  if anyone in the del rio area has seen something similar please let me know.\r\n\r\nsincerley,\r\na

be adding more to my photobucket album, as time allows. \r\n\r\ni have included cropped and auto-enhanced copies of the original photos here, in my photobucket album:

was not the first instance as they have been seeing this for a few years in various areas.\r\ni realized a star when it becomes unstable and dying will exhibit these same attributes.  it will also emit nebulae which will appear red and blue. our sun is a medium size star.  i copied the following as this isn���t supposed to happen for 10,000 years.  but reading stories and viewing the many pictures on mufon it appears to be happening now.\r\naccordingly this is what i copied from the net: as we viewed our home galaxy, the milky way, we would see these \"planetary\", or ejection nebulae flaring and fading all the time, about one per earth year, much as the flashes of cameras at a sports stadium at night. at any given instant more than 10,000 nebulae are visible in some stage of their evolution.\r\nplanetary nebulae make the milky way come alive. from afar the milky way would resemble a scintillating galactic christmas tree. a red flash appears here, and another there, as planetary nebulae form. for a few thousand years each nebula brightens and turns from red to green.\r\nthanks, bonnie bell

daughter, and i were out on my deck (3 12 ft stories high) looking in the sky talking about the degrees of the angle my bf's daughter saw the ufo, which was a blue bright light...Along comes a new siting!  we were pointing to venus and talking about the area and angle the other ufo was seen when we looked away for a minute at airplanes in the distance flashing going into pdx in their normal flightpath, when we looked up overhead again.  there in the sky was a huge bright light bigger and brighter than venus by about double.  it was 10:22pm, because we looked at the clock this time!  my bf and i were alone watching this really bright light moving from the west heading southeast high in the sky and we yelled to his daughter to come quickly and look!  she was across the house and came running and it was still in the sky very bright and still moving.  it was way to bright to be a satellite.  no flashing lights, no colored lights and at 10:22pm it was good and dark outside and lots of stars and airplanes were out.  this thing was huge, and it moved across the sky like a satellite, but it was brighter than anything in the sky and venus was very visible.  it just kept heading southeasterly until it was completely out of sight.  it seemed like it was high in the sky, because shortly after that a real satellite passed over and it was a speck in comparison and about a 32nd as bright as venus.  this thing all three of us saw had no tail, trail, smoke, sound, or colored lights.  we weren't really sure if it's path was all that straight.\r\nit was just one big bright light like a double sized venus or more, and it just kept a steady nice speed across the night sky, but we thought it wobbled a little bit at one point.  we all 3 saw it.  we are all disgusted at some of the ridiculous reports that are here on mufon that make the rest of us look like crazy lunatics.  what is with all the lame reports like coming out of bars seeing things, and things coming out of tv sets and killing kids?  why publish this junk???  come on people, if you want to report a ufo...Make it worth all our time and tell the truth or get your head examined.  the truth is out there...Look up, not at your tv tube or while you're stumbling out of a bar!  oh, we tried to take a picture of this thing, but all we got was the movement of the light that made it look like a smoke or rocket explosion with a star in the background.  the star was still, the thing that was moving blurred.  i'll enclose it anyway.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

folks retirement home, as there is a fence where i can let the dogs loose to run, and have some fun for a few minutes. while walking around with them, i noticed, the moon in crescent form, and the two thirds of it were a black disc, with the crescent moon lit up nicely. now, positioned down from the moon, and out a few degrees, was another object, very bright in the evening sky, and i attribute this to being one of our local planets. it is as bright as a football stadium light, with all the other stars shining out more like a small flashlight. \r\n\r\ni turned to the dogs to pet them, then i looked up, and once again, thanked god for bringing any astro beings traveling who would like to say hello, to stop on by, or to make themselves known in their travels here to earth and on by. i looked up, as something caught my eye from by the crescent moon, and down at about the same position as the bright shining planet i just described, and noticed another light, moving across the sky, heading right for me directly. it seemed to sway to the left and then to the right on it's straight line, on an easterly journey. by now it is 10:10pm or 10:25pm. it was about on top if me. now i was in a very quiet spot, and could hear nothing at all. not a whisper of noise, no engine, no prop no small aircraft noise, no green and red navigational light. all i saw were a set of two or three bright lights in the middle, shining down, and the flicker of lights running around the rim, as if it were round. i stopped, waived at it, and tried to take a cell phone picture, but i could not find a way to capture it on my cell phone camera. i tried to find it several times, but i could not find a light in my camera lenses at all. just black sky.\r\n\r\nit was at this time, i looked up at it, as it had move quite a distance by now, probably half way from here (tanasbourne area, to downtown portland), and it just went black, as it never existed before. i thought it might be the new space station, but no way, this was a lot lower than that. i would say maybe traveling around 30k feet or so. it flew right over me, stopped for a moment, then slowly proceeded on. when i looked at my watched, i noticed about 20 more minutes went by, and the dogs were much further apart than they should have been. i never let them out of my sight, i had to corral them back to me. they did not want to come near me for some reason. but they did. then i kept trying to piece together the time. it wasn't a lot of time, but that much time had not gone by. i called my partner to tell him about it. here we go again.  ok so that was cool. i would love to hear from you again if ok.","distance":"Over One

always on the charger. these objects traveled at a impressive rate of speed, we have alot of military aircraft from mcas yuma that fly around our house, these flew faster than a helicopter but slower than a fighter jet. i was able to get photos from far away but they traveled at least 60 miles in between my digital camera resetting itself for the next photos which takes about 15 seconds. then as they got closer my camera went dead.I then went for my kodack camera which had been on the charger for 2 days, it powered on but as i tried to photograph these lights the camera shut off and the battery died. i ran and grabbbed my video camera which has been charging for 5 days and ran back out of my house , by this time the objects were over my house , my son and i could see the shapes clearly even in the darkness.They were six oval shaped objects that seemed to slow to a hover over us at i would guess 2000 ft above us. i tried to video tape them and my video camera turned on then

very dark without outside light sources, as we like to gaze while soaking.  i am very familiar with all the normal aircraft approach and departure of dia aircraft and also the usuall fly over pattern so we see the jet and general aviation all the time.  as i was simply looking straight up more in a northerly direction, (the big dipper was two the northwest as i was looking up) at the extreme of my vision being able to really discern a light, i saw a very small (or perhaps very extreme altitude distant) light traveling at least 3 times faster than the jet traffic i am accustomed to seeing traveling south to north in a straight line and constant velocity.  the sky in that area was very clear, with no discernable cloud cover. \r\n\r\nmy first inclination was that i was seeing a sattelite passing overhead.   the movement caught my attention and i watched it for maybe two or three seconds duration when it seemed to stop, and then immediately the light intensified to at least the same size and brightness as venus, which i could identify in the west sky.  this really got my attention!  this \"pulse\" for lack of a better description, only lasted no more than 1 second, followed by it returning to the original observed size, continuing at more or less the same constant speed and tragectory but faded from view completely within another 1 or two seconds.\r\n\r\nseveral minutes later,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Well, this is my second attempt at relaying this story to you since the power just inexplicably went off during my first attempt.  i have kept this sighting secret for close to forty years.  this was mainly due to fear.  i will explain this at the end.  at the time of this sighting i was a college student at the university of toledo.  it was a cold, overcast saturday night in january, 1968 (it did snow later that evening).  i was on semester break.  i and two of my fraternity brothers were on our way to a camping trip at one of the other brother's parents' cottage located in the irish hills of lower michigan.  we were headed up route 223 out of toledo, ohio and had just driven through the small town of rome center (near adrian, michigan).  i was sitting in the back seat of the car on the passanger's side when i felt a sensation of light coming from behind me.  at first i paid little attention to this thinking it was just bright car lights coming up from behind us.  however, after it happened again i paused then turned around to look out the back window of the car to discover that there was no other car on the road behind us.  puzzled, i continued to look out the back window.  then, approximately 500 feet in the clouds,  the outline of an oval shaped blue light with a similar beam of blue light came on to engulf the small town which we had just driven through! we were driving up a small incline, so it was very easy to discern the oval shape of the blue beam of light.  it was so distinct that i could clearly make out the oval edge of the beam in the darkness of the night (there were no street lights!) again, it was the most intense, beautiful blue i have ever seen!  but strangely, i could look at the light without squinting.  i cannot say enough how i was awe-struck by this beautiful blue light!  however, there was a definite on-off pattern to this light.  it reminded me of a \"gigantic\" flash bulb.  and, it was huge!  i would say that the size of the ufo, when closest to our car, would compare to a pineapple held out at arms length.  as i continued watching, the ufo came on again, but, this time directly over the road behind us.  it was definitely moving in a se to nw direction.  why it reminded me of a huge flash bulb is because the blue oval shape in the clouds and the beam of brilliant blue light came on at the same time but then, the beam of light would fade back into the oval shape in the clouds and then go off!  if i was a betting man, i would say that this ufo was taking pictures of the area!  now is when things start gettting a little strange.  the next time the ufo appears it is directly over our car.  i distinctly remember looking up into this light.  but, it was no longer blue but instead a very intense white light...I remember that it hurt my eyes!  the next thnig i remember is sitting down in the back seat, looking out the front window of the car and hearing the driver say \"i'm gettin' the hell out of here!\"  with this, the driver slammed his foot onto the gas pedal and left the area at a high rate of speed.  i caught one last glimpse of the ufo going on again approximately 1,000 yards in the distance.  now, this might seem to be a normal reaction from the driver, but, i never said a thing to anyone in the front seat about what i was observing out the back window.  yes, the driver could have become alarmed observing the ufo through his rear view mirror, but all the while i was watching this ufo, the driver and his front passanger were engaged in conversation.  and, how did the ufo move that far away from my vantage point in such a short time?  well, when we arrived at the cottage, all the lights were out and everyone was asleep!  by my watch it was past 1:00 a.M. we were not that far from the brothers cottage when i observed the ufo...Why did it take us another hour-and-a-half to arrive?  also, upon arrival, no one in the car mentioned the ufo.  to this day, it has never been discussed among us.  not too long after this my headaches began!  they have continued up until this day although they seem to be getting less severe as i age.  \r\n\r\nwhat happened to me a few years later made me stay quiet regarding this ufo sighting.  i was now a teacher at a local high school in toledo.  although i lived only a couple of blocks from the school i still drove.  one morning i was backing out of the drive-way when i noticed an old-style black cadillac parked in front of my house.  i pulled away from my house and this black cadillac starts following me...Right into the parking lot of the school where i taught!  the cadillac proceeds to pull-up in the parking space right next to mine.  needless to say i was very concerned about who this person was and why they were following me.  when i looked over to see who it was, i was met by a pair of icy, glaring eyes.  to this day, i will never forget how these eyes starred right through me!  he just kept staring at me!  i say he because, i think it was a he!  he wore a white overcoat with the collar turned up all the way around his neck and mouth with a white brimed hat turned down so all that i could see were his eyes and nose (which appeared to be very thin and narrow).  the eyes reminded me of two black coals!  the skin of this guy was \"whitish!\" i stared back at him for a few seconds but then quickly walked into the building where i taught hoping to catch a glimpse of his license number.  mind you, i am constantly keeping the cadillac in my peripheral vision all the time i am walking to and entering the building.  on entering the building there was a door immediately to my left that i entered where the room included windows all along the side facing the parking lot from which i had just exited.  it took me less than 5 seconds to get to the window to observe this cadillac...But it was gone!  i do not know how he got out of the parking lot in such a short amount of time without me seeing him!  besides that, other cars were driving in...And this was only a \"single\" drive way.  he would have had to wait for the other cars to pass before he could have driven out!  as a side note here, you should know that i was getting ready to put together a complete report of my 1968 sighting prior to this visit from the black cadillac!  \r\nalso, so you know i am not some kind of nut, i hold three degrees including an industrial engineering technology degree .  as a result of what happened that evening, i have been studying the phenomenon of ufo's for years.  however, i have never come across a report similar to mine.  if one exists out there, i would certainly be interested in reading it.  also, over the years, i have come to the realization that something happened to me that night in 1968.  i do not know what.  but i have to find out!  thank you.                                \r\n\r\ndan

orbs of light mainly above the wells fargo skyscraper in downtown minneapolis. it started when i was out in my back alley and just happened to glance up at the night skyline. the objects were bright enough to jump out at me, but likely wouldn't have been noticed had i not at least been looking in that direction. it looked like a couple of glowing balloons, but it was the way they moved that really caught my attention. the lights would sit still for about a minute, then suddenly shoot off behind another building only to suddenly re-appear directly over the wells fargo building. the objects would zip back and forth at high speed, moving and stopping abruptly. the lights have appeared regularly each night. they seem brightest when the city lights seem brightest, but are still able to be seen after the lights downtown are turned off. birds have been ruled out due to the agility, the speed of the objects, and their apparent luminosity. it is unknown whether or not there were possible weather experiments being conducted on top of the wells fargo building during the times in question, but this also seems an unlikely explanation considering the speed and movement of the objects. there is, of course, a large international airport nearby, but this makes it that much easier to distinguish planes from other airborn craft. being a large city, minneapolis has helicopters with spotlights that occasionally circle the sky, however their appearances have been far more frequent since these objects were first noticed. there have also been loud military jets tearing directly over downtown that look as if they are coming from the airport, but only c-130s fly from that airport as far as i know. watching these things made my heart race. it was very exciting, and very beautiful in a strange way. i've tried to convince myself they were anything other than  ufos, but after a lot of thought i don't know what to think. believing they are ufos is way more fun, anyway. perhaps there is a simple explanation for these things, but it has at least one minneapolis neighborhood completely baffled! i'm sure we'll all continue to watch the skies until we find out its somebody with super-fast radio-controlled airplanes on top of a skyscraper, or something like that.
