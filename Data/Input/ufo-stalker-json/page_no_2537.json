past 20-25 days i have seen lights in the sky appearing to have the same flight pattern as birds would...Sometimes flying in v like formations (up to seven at a time) i am a smoker so i often go outside and will gaze at the stars...I have never in my life seen anything like i have the past month.  i have been viewing the moving lights over the newport bay.  i have seen the lights moving in different directions most of the time along the coast in both directions.  some nights i will see maybe 10-15 sightings a nights in increments of about 2-5 minutes...While some nights i may only see 1 or none.  the lights appear to change speeds.  it is pretty much impossible to guess the speeds or distance of the lights because i see the lights at night and i can not see the figure of the object. i only see the lumination.  i have seen the lights at times change dirctions once i saw one flying alone make a u-turn and immediately following the turn the light vanished.  i would defenately say that the lights are within the atmosphere and sometimes the lights may appear very close while over the bay.  on occasion i will see 2 flying together as well.  now i can not say that what i am saying is alien, but i am having trouble identifying them.  1 out of 5 lights i see will appear to flash once or twice while in flight.  while visible i will see the lights in the sky for about 5-20 seconds. the best description i can give for the object would be that it looks like birds flying in the sky that give or reflect light from the belly area.  while it is day time i will look at the birds and there patterns to give me reference at night sometimes the lights at night seem to be moving much faster than the birds i will see during the day.  the hardest part i am having is explaining the light i see. i have never seen a bird emit light before.  the first time i saw it i immediately thought alien. i saw about 7-10 the first night.  it had my heart racing.  they seemed to move so fast...Maybe because they seemed farther away than they were...I dont know. i tried to video tape the events for two of the night but was unsuccessful the camera i was using was no where near capable of capturing the objects mostly because getting the object in focus at night while moving was impossible.  thats pretty much it...If anyone knows what it is i am seeing please let me know","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

approximately 2200 central time. the lights were observed in the wsw at approximately 35 degrees above the horizon while i and one other person were stargazing. the lights initially appeared as three separate lights horizontally level in relation to each other. i was able to observe the lights through binoculars and and each individual light appeared to be two separate rectangular lights spaced closely together. i was also able to discern a third, faint, strobing light near the two rectangular lights. when the lights faded out the rectangular light on the right went out followed immediately by the rectangular light on the left. the lights apparent size was that of pea held at arms length. it was impossible to estimate the altitude or the actual size of the lights. no noise was heard, however the sound of the surf would almost definitely masked the sound of any distant aircraft. at the time i thought that they were possibly the exhaust of jet fighter aircraft as the aircraft were flying at level flight at an angle directly away from my position, however the lights reappeared three or four times in approximately the same position over a period of several minutes. this, in my mind, rules out that hypothesis.\r\n\ta few minutes later, a single light appeared slightly to the south of the original lights at roughly the same angle above the horizon. the light remained stationary for approximately 2 seconds and then expelled a similar light from the left (my left) which quickly descended approximately three times the width of the original light as if it were in free fall then both lights faded out simultaneously. initially, i thought that this might have been a flare dropped from an aircraft, however the short duration of the light is not a characteristic of a military-type flare. one or two minutes later another similar light appeared in roughly the same position as the one previously described. about one second after it appeared the light seemed to streak to my left (east) a short distance and then quickly faded out. when the object moved it produced streaks of light behind it (opposite the direction of travel). that marked the end of the observation. nothing further was observed. afterwards, the other witness and i discussed the possible explanations of what we had just seen. we considered the possibilities mentioned above, meteorites and space junk reentering the atmosphere. however, we concluded that none of these possibilities could adequately explain what was observed. we both agreed that what we witnessed was unlike anything ever observed by either of us.\r\n\ti am a captain in the army with 18 years of service, have served in combat and i have a b.S. in geology. the other witness has served in the military, is a combat

the light did disappear for a few months last year, it has returned.  everynight it appears around dusk in the north western sky of cincinnati, oh.  it is always the brightest light in the sky.  it first appears high in the sky and slowly descends behind the horizon.  it takes about 2 1/2 hours to make this journey.  it's the same thing everynight for the last two years, besides those few months when it was not there.  one time, however, i did see it do something differnet from it's normal course.  a few weeks after first spotting the bright light, i walked outside as usual to watch \"my light\" as i have come to call it.  it was around 20 minutes from dipping behind the horizon.  not even a minute after sitting down and gazing at \"my light\", it increased it's brightness for a second or two, then returned to it's normal brightness.  it then proceeded to move off to the east, taking it's time.  after about 20 seconds it disappeared from my field of view.  this proved to me, \"my light\" is not a planet or star.  i admit, it could be a sattelite, but i don't think so.  i have showed the light to numerous people, and no one has any explanation as to what the hell this thing could be.  i showed it to a buddy of mine, who used to work at our local airport, and he shrugged it off as a plane coming in for landing.  he's not into paranormal stuff, so he refused to watch the light with me as it slowly descended.  he had more important stuff to do. i'll admit 'my light\" does resemble a huge airplane light, but that it is not.  all i want to know is what this thing is and i figure your network would be the best place to get my question answered.  thank you for your time.\r\n\r\np.S.  about a year and a half ago, i was in north carolina, and there was \"my light\"

the southwest in the sky appeared an oval ring of bright blue light that appeared out of nowhere and stayed visible for a few seconds and then disappeared in front of my eyes.  it was a very clear and cool night.  we had gone out on the deck to just chat and stargaze before we went to sleep. the deck is three 12 foot ceiling high stories and the townhouse sits on a hill with a big view of the sky and rooftops below.  there is a \"hill\" behind us with tall evergreen trees and beyond that is farmland. we are up pretty high.\r\nwe had just been looking at a bright star (probably a planet), and the object appeared about 10 minutes later above and to the right of the bright star or planet we had just been looking at before i saw the object.  i grabbed my friend's arm and said...\"oh my god! what the hell was that!?\" and she said, she saw a flash of light out of her peripheral vision to the right of her.  she's been a ufo buff for about 35 years, and i have thought it was all kind of a bunchy of hooey, but it also scares me the things she tells me she reads about, but i don't want to believe it.  when i saw this bright oval light appear out of nowhere and then disappear again, it made a believer out of me!!!  my friend said she was jealous she didn't see it, but only saw what she described as \"like a flashbulb going off in the sky behind me\".  i know what i saw, and it was an oval ring of blue light with a dark hole center.  it had no tail or trail like a shooting star or a comet.  it made no noise.  it was just there, and then it wasn't there, and it was so bright and blue and such a weird shape against everything else in the clear night sky.  this was no ordinary or natural light in the sky and no reason for it to just appear.  it didn't come from a direction or leave in a direction.  it was just there, and then gone a few seconds after i saw it.  just long enough to scare the heck out of me, and freak me out.  i had nightmares about it that night, and i couldn't get to sleep for the longest time. my friend laughed and told me not to be scared of ufo's or aliens, because she said if they wanted to harm us, they'd have done it ages ago!  i am still

object was  about 150 feet (approx) from my window and moving very slow north. i noticed there were two flashing white lights on the back of the ship and each time they flashed i could see they were round. i could tell the shape of the back the best and it was shaped like a boomerang. there were light panels all over this craft.I could also see a seperation or space between the panels. it was lit up so much i could not tell if the craft was round or pointed at the front. the bottom was flat, the back was pointed, i could see a shape on top that slanted down toward the front. \r\n   i was trying to figure out what i was looking at, trying to make sense of this. planes can not go this slow, planes have red and green lights. planes make alot of noise. helicopters make more noise than a plane, i was trying hard to make sense of what i was looking at. \r\n   i did not see any red or green flashing lights. i also did not hear any sound of a engine. but there was a a/c unit running in the bedroom.\r\n i watched the craft fly slowly northward from behind the tree, into a clear area with no limb abstructions. the craft continued moving very slow northward a short distance then was just above the white pines on the other side of my driveway. at this time it went out of sight, only because it was just above the tree tops. if it would of been higher i could of seen it longer. i observed all i could for the time i had.\r\n  since i have seen this i have felt different. it is hard to explain, but because it did not fit into anything i know, then what do i say it was? i have

least that's how it seemed) to divide into 2 separate objects and then return to one. i saw that happened twice. during this time an airplane took off from our local airport  flying over us taking away any doubts that the unidentified object might have been an aircraft.My daughter had ran in to get her video camera but as much as each of us tried to focus in on it, the object would not show up on camera. we could see it with our own eyes but when we looked through the camera the object could not be seen.My daughter tried, my husband tried, and i tried but nothing. then another aircraft went by close  to the objects i don't know what they're called but we see those often, the ones that leave that smoke trail behind.Anyway as that passed before it got close to the object the object flat out disappeared.I did not see it move in any direction just simply disappear from sight.At this point there were no clouds anywhere near it to have hidden in.It was a clear blue evening.I don't know what it was i saw, maybe there is an explanation for it,and we do have an airforce base nearby but i've never seen any aircraft move like this.By the way, i'm not a member i'm not even one who goes out looking for these kind of incidents so my own sake can anyone tell me if they've seen anything like this in the del rio area or if there is an explanation please share ?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7205,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.3801957,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06122007-0005","longitude":-100.8884374,"occurred":1181545200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

desert.  i had brought my telescope and we had just viewed saturn, venus and jupiter as well as some deep sky objects.  the sky was clear and the moon was not up.\r\n\r\nthere were two somewhat unusual events preceding the actual sighting that i will include in this account.\r\n\r\nfirst, somewhere around 10:00pm 6/9/07 we noticed unusual bright strobe-like flashes coming from the southern horizon.  we could not see the actual source of the light, only the glow in the sky.  this happened at least three times.\r\n\r\nlater that evening, i caught a glimpse of something in the northern sky that appeared like a shooting star that traveled about a quarters diameter held at arm's length.  it then stopped and shot off as a red streak at a new angle so that the entire flight path resembled a v with the object coming in from the top left, stopping as a 'star' at the bottom of the v then accelerating like a red laser to the top right and disappearing.\r\n\r\nbecause the event happened so fast i was not able to look directly at the object and only made a passing comment to my friends that i had seen something odd.\r\n\r\naround 12:20am sunday morning, something relatively high in the northern sky pulsed with a very bright white light (out-shining even venus).  the pulse was bright enough for all three of us to see it peripherally and train our gaze on it.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared stationary and as the initial pulse faded, the center of the object became a very red point of light enveloped in white light.  within one second, this point of red light began emitting 'beams' of red and white laser-like light (mostly white beams, i only saw one red beam).  these beams came to a stop as tiny white points of light.  these 'baby' stars (at least four or five of them) then began to pulse very bright white light all around the 'mother' star until all faded and the portion of the sky became ordinary again.\r\n\r\nagain, all this took place within an area of the sky that could be covered with a quarter at arms length.  this was also quite possibly the exact same location of the first object i saw.\r\n\r\nthe impression was that the object/objects were very far away, at least outside the atmosphere.  one friend thought it may have been a star exploding into tiny pieces (though i explained that supernovas are very rare and probably could not be seen with the naked eye).  i had absolutely no idea what it could be.  i have observed the night sky for years.  i have seen satellites, planets, space stations, rockets, you name it.  whatever this was, it was very unusual.\r\n\r\ni was sure that the 'mother' star was still visible but back to a normal subdued radiance.  i grabbed the celestron 'sky scout' and determined that the star in question was polaris, the north star.\r\n\r\ni was certain that the performance would repeat, and i stayed up for at least another half hour watching the same place in the sky but the desert air was dry and windy, my contacts began to bother me and eventually i had to close my eyes and sleep.","distance":"Over One

window.  i tried to ignore the sound until several minutes had passed and it still had not subsided.  i decided to investigate and went out on my 2nd floor balcony, which faces northwest, only to find nothing within my viewing range and the sound fading to nothing.  directly across from my balcony is another condo complex, approximately 75-100 feet away.  the two run parallel and there is a long grassy lane that runs between them.  i have a good view of the northwest sky and an extremely bright star (i���m not sure what it���s called, but it isn���t the north star because it moves beyond my viewing area late at night.)\r\n\r\n     i decided to smoke a cigarette while i was outside, and after several minutes i could see two objects in the distance, which i thought were planes because i could see red and white lights.  i continued to smoke until i noticed that the lights were closer and appeared to be much lower in the sky than i originally thought.  i watched the lights move toward me, to the south, and when the closest one broke the plane of the twilight i could see a silhouette of a black sphere shape with 4-5 lights on it.  i did not hear any sound or see any headlights or green lights, and i my adrenaline was pumping as i tried to make sense of what i was seeing.  i live near sfo airport, so planes are regularly flying overhead.  i then noticed that the second set of lights also appeared to be on a sphere shaped craft and both craft were flying in the same direction at aproximately the same altitude.  i watched as both craft appeared to fly in a straight line due south until they passed out of my view.\r\n\r\n     as i lit up another cigarette, i reflected on what had occurred and attempted to logically explain what i had seen.  not even two minutes later, something else caught my eye further north.  a triangular craft that appeared to be slightly larger than the spheres came into view from behind a tree.  it looked black (but it was difficult to tell with the twilight fading) and it had the same red and white lights, but the white lights seemed to be arranged in a rectangle from my viewpoint.  i didn���t notice any sound, although i may have been too distracted to notice.  i watched it head slowly toward the direction of the two spheres flight path.  as it passed out of view, i frantically tried to call friends that lived south of me, but none of them picked up.\r\n\r\n     i genuinely hope that someone else saw this or can explain what i did see, because after talking with my friends, i know that i won���t be able to talk to people about this without some kind of corroboration.  i have no photos and no other witnesses, just an unbelievable story.  all i can do is post this everywhere in the hopes that someone can verify what i saw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line
