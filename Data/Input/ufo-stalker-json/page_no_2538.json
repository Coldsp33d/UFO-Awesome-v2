evening and stood still for a moment just outside my house tracking an object flying silently directly overhead in a westerly direction with two blinking red lights when suddenly there was a flash (similar to a huge camera flash or a stroboscopic flash) in the western sky at about 70 degrees up in the sky in my right field of vision. immediately thereafter i observed a \"swarm\" - and i say \"swarm\" because that is the closest thing that what i saw resembled - of tiny lights moving very rapidly from the north (near where the flash in the sky had occurred) in a southerly direction. there were many tiny lights - perhaps as many as fifty or more, though i cannot say for certain how many, there were as many as the idea of a \"swarm\" came to my mind to describe what i saw. the lights moved in an atypical manner as compared to common aircraft in that the individual trajectories of the lights criss-crossed one another in a manner similar to living things - a moving swarm of insects, a flock of birds, or a school of fish. though moving very rapidly, they did not appear to collide or combine with one another. the lights seemed to have volition, that is - they seemed conscious of their movement and direction. the lights were very tiny pinpricks of white light, and appeared, based on the plane that i had been observing flying overhead just prior to seeing them, to be flying at a very very high altitude. i observed them for perhaps 10 seconds as they flew in a southerly direction in general towards the bright star or planet that presently dominates the southern sky in the evening hours until they disappeared from sight - not behind an obstruction in my field of vision, but when they got too far away for me to see them any more. the line of trajectory within which i observed this swarm of lights flying was not more than one foot in the sky from the time of the flash until they disappeared from sight. there were no sounds, and to be honest, i was so shocked at what i saw, that i totally forgot the aircraft i had been observing, or what happened to that. i am sure that the pilots on that aircraft must have observed what i saw. this event occurred directly over the monterey bay. the weather conditions were the sky was clear and very dark with a few wisps of fog or clouds at a low level. it was cool and silent and visibility was excellent. this is what i saw in its entirety. i did not get any bad feelings from what i saw. at first when i saw the flash, i was confused, thinking perhaps a camera flash had gone off, but in a moment i realized that was not what had occurred, and that i had seen a flash in the sky. when i looked back towards where the flash had occurred, that was when i observed the swarm of lights. i never have seen anything like this before, and do not know what it was. there is plenty of military in this area and there is a nasa installation south of here near big sur. i would be very curious to know (probably we will never know) whether these objects or lights were observed by nasa or the military, or if anyone else in this area observed what i saw last night.","distance":"Over One

nc on hatteras island. we had been star gazing for about 10 minutes or so and i spotted what looked like 1 moving star. i pointed it out to my wife and my mom and they started watching it too. the moving light looked just like a star but i thought it may have been an airplane. the thing about it was that it did not have any blinking lights it was a solid light that looked like a star.\r\n\r\nthe light was moving from the north to the south in the night sky. the light had been moving for about 30 seconds to a minute when it passed by another star that was stationary and kept going. the star or light that was stationary started following the 1st light. when the second star or light started following the first light the first light changed direction from south to north to a east direction which made it look like it was loosing altitude. the 1st star or light stayed on this course for maybe a minute and then started moving north across the sky again. as the first light switched direction from east to north the second light turned south follwoing the path of the first light. the first light continued north and disappeared and the second light disappeared around the same area that the 1st light turned north.\r\n\r\ni only saw the one light following or chasing the other but my wife was telling me that she saw a third star or light follwing the second and she said as the second light disappeared the third light became stationary and looked like a dim star.\r\n\r\nabout 30 minutes later as we were getting ready to walk back to the house we were still looking at the sky to see if we could find any more moving lights. i noticed another star and it was probably the 3rd brightest star in the sky. it was directly east of us over the horizion of the ocean and was stationary. this star or light did not have any blinking lights as well and we only looked at it because it was so bright. we watched it for a few minutes and this star or light got dim and started moving south across the sky. i was thinking that maybe just maybe this was a plane that had changed direction but there were not blinking lights on this object either. as this object started moving south it just disappeared. \r\n\r\nright now i don't know what we watched. i don't believe that the first siting with the stars following the stars were planes. however i kind of lean toward the fact that the second siting may have been a plane that changed direction. i don't know though because it did not have any blinking lights. if someone could pull any kind of radar logs or something i think they could either prove or rule out airplanes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

in the sky at about the 40 degree position in the sky.  since i work only about 10 miles from metro airport, i thought it was the landing lights at first of a airliner, but dismissed that thought as it was at a higher altitude for a normal approach to the airport.  then i thought maybe it was the space station or something like that?  it was a lot larger than a normal star, so i thought maybe it was some planet passing close to earth.  i then went about doing my work, and kind of forgot about it.  my location at the time of the sighting was on the west side of our building.  i was driving a fork lift while preparing the trailers for the next loads.  at about 2330 i was waiting for a tractor to come for fuel on the north side of the building when i noticed the orb again.  it was now about at the 20 degree point in the sky, having now almost traversed half the sky.  i seen another employee come by a overhead door to have a smoke.  he started telling me he was a tomato grower, and was worried about the weather lately.  so i said \" have you ever seen this star when you have been outside\"?  an took him out a few  steps so he could see it.  he said no. then said he would look tomorrow with his brothers telescope on saturday night for it.  another tractor came at the fuel island about 15 minutes later, and i asked the driver if he had ever seen this bright star before. as i pointed at where it was last time i seen it, it was gone.  later when he came back to the yard, i was driving a tractor out of the wash tunnel when he flashed his lights to tell me that it was \" all over the radio about something in the sky\".  i told him what i saw was not a shooting star or a comet, but a large star like object.  the same white as a star. i don't know what it was.  it moved from south to north from about the 40 to last i seen the 20 degree mark in the western sky. what i heard on the radio after work did not describe what i saw.

i was out to run my little dog with the light pen and to do some sky-watching--not really thinking to see much over the suburbs of sacramento...When i looked over my rooftop to the eastern sky and this \"thing\" which was flying low at a moderate rate of speed come across the sky.  when i say \"low\" i mean it was flying at about the height of local helicopters when they buzz over your house and it was fairly large, so that's how close it was.\r\n\r\nduration of encounter:\r\ni counted the seconds (7) from the moment i saw it and followed it through my backyard as it passed across the skyline out of my range of vision as i have large trees in my backyard.  my backyard length is about 110 feet, so do the math.\r\n\r\ncolor and shape:\r\nit was light grey, oval-shaped, but not defined--as if you took a picture of a cloud, imported it into photoshop or other photo program then cropped out an oval shape and filtered a gradient from the center to the edge, giving it a three-dimensional hazy appearance.  it had no visible lights.\r\n\r\nground lighting:\r\nthe sky was almost completely dark.  there was ambient light from local businesses, but we have a tall fence, so most all of the light is filtered softly through the trees or appearing just over the cusp of the fence-line to the west of my house.  the encounter was to the east.\r\n\r\nflight pattern:\r\nit flew in a straight line from a south-eastern heading to a north direction: from my home it would be from orangevale/fair oaks, over citrus heights (where i live), heading towards roseville, ca.\r\n\r\nsound:\r\nit made no sound.\r\n\r\nmy reaction was one of disgust in myself because i had my video camera, set on night vision, but my dog was bugging on me to play with the light pen so i sat the camera down.  that is when this \"thing\" appeared.  my feelings about it were elation; my rational mind said that it was quite unusual.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

southern sky caught my eye.  i looked up and saw a round, very, very bright light moving in a northeasterly direction.  i watched for a few seconds observing the object.  there were no flashing lights, no strobing lights, no identifying lights as seen on the many planes that fly in our skies (day and night)from our local county airport.  there was no trail of any kind either.  it appeared to be a circular glowing bright light - not something on fire or burning.  i quickly went to the porch, opened the door and called to my 14 yr old grandson to come look.  he came out and observed the object as well.  he said, \"gram, get your camera!\"  i said, \"what is that?  it is so bright and moving so fast.\"  the light never changed in brightness or appearance as it approached me, passed over us, or moved away from us (the object was entirely enveloped in bright white light - i noticed that there were light rays eminating from it as though the light source was internal).  it appeared to be traveling at a low altitude and at a very high speed.  there was no sound to be heard as this object approached, flew over us and flew away from us.  before we lost sight of it beyond the trees, my grandson was observing it with the binoculars:  i said, \"look there is a plane headed in its direction (the plane was heading north and was in the eastern sky).  the plane must have been at a much higher altitude and further away from us as it appeared as a pin dot, but you could clearly make out the flashing red and white lights.  the unknown object was very large in size in comparison to the plane and to the stars that were out at the time.  i have never seen anything like this before in my entire life.  one other note:  the object seemed to zig-zag a few times as it was moving away from us.  my grandson and i both noticed this.  the object did not appear to be falling at any time during my observation, but navigating. this was a very odd experience!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

off from his job on march 29, 2007.  he slept in that morning and moved through the remainder of the day in a casual manner.  in the afternoon, he stepped outside for a cigarette.  the sky was fairly clear, just a light haze, accented by isolated high altitude clouds.\r\n\r\nlooking up at the sky toward the south from the back porch of his apartment, he noticed an object moving through the sky.  he stated that he often looks toward the sky whenever he gets a chance in order to iden-tify objects such as airplanes, helicopters, etc.  this particular object caught his attention because of its unusual shape and movement.  as he focused on the object, it changed shape, sometimes appearing as a ball shape, sometimes as a little more elongated, perhaps an arc, then back to a ball with a dot circling around the larger object.  he didn���t recall seeing more than two dots or balls at any one time; it was either a big ���blob��� or separated into two objects hovering around each other.  he also stated that there was no sound associated with the passing of the object.\r\n\r\nat this point, he had been watching it for about 90 seconds and the object had moved from east to west.  when it started to disappear over the neighbor���s house, he  ran up stairs to retrieve a pair of small binocu-lars, a nikon travelite iii, 7x20.  his significant other asked, ���where���s the fire?  what���s the deal?��� \r\n\r\nmr. fox replied, ���i think i���m seeing a ufo.���  he ran back down the stairs, out the back door, and down to the street corner where he could continue viewing the object.  he stated that the object, through the bin-oculars, looked like six or seven little objects ���flocking��� together in the same direction, but very close to-gether.  he estimated the altitude to be at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet and appeared at about a 45 degree angle.  he watched the object until it was just a ���pinprick��� and disappeared off to the west.","distance":"Over One

inverted y from the back and front. thoes ships landed in a clearing while three more flew overhead. the three were black with a blue outline on the hexagon wings. from the front view, they looked like a h with a ball in the center. the ones that landed were white with white blinking lights, such as an aircraft on earth and a contuous blue light on the back. their two wings on the bottom folded up making a w shape as it landed, making a deep moan and a whine as a jet engine. when that happened, 6 ramps, two per ship, opened up. i couldnt believe it. then, several human like creatures came out. they were white with black joint areas. then, one took off his head, but it was a helmet. it was human! he caried what looked like an automatic weapon of some kind. the weapon was black. it looked like an earth weapon. there were dosens of the aliens! some were talking, some were unloading boxes. they spoke english. it seemed like they were military, but not ours. i got a peak in the only window on the ship closest to me. a human wearing a space suit such as our astronauts and a black helmet just like the white guys. so as soon as the ships left and the white guys were gone, i got the hell out of there.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"03:07:23","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Insignia,  Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

of my car in the garage because i hit a raccoon the other day and i have a big road trip im going on tomorrow. after im done banging the dang thing out i get this urge to go outside and check out the stars, the night was really clear and i just had this weird urge to do just that. normally im pretty scared of the dark outside and rarely go outside after turning the outside lights off. so i go outside and can clearly see venus, very bright lower in the western sky. i also see a low flying plain to the north of me that is very easily noticeable as a plane... red and blue lights with a flash every once in while. so i look back to the western sky and i notice this orange light heading in a north-east direction. i thought it could have been a distant plane or a satellite at first but as it got closer it wasn't flying in an orbital path (it was going straight) and it certainly didn't have a red and blue light with the occasional flash. so this light is getting closer and closer (id say probably about 1,000 to 2,000 feet up, but its hard to say with no reference). so as this thing is approaching i suddenly get this feeling that something is watching me from behind, and right as i turn around (looking south-east) there is a  very bright white (that comparable to venus) light moving south and another less bright white light moving in the same direction (basically follow-the-leader). as soon as i see this light i feel that it knows im there, some sort of deep down feeling that was pretty much indescribable. so the bright light shrinks down to the size of the light infront of it and they continue to move across the sky beyond the tree line at the same speed in the same direction one behind the other. this is when i knew something was weird. so i look back in the direction of the orange light and its just sitting there in the sky. and i all of the sudden get the same odd feeling that it knows im there. and right when i got this feeling the object began to head north east heading towards erie. pretty intense. overwhelming fear at the same time i felt comfort from my deep down need to know that something else is out there. and that it is real. and that its probably watching us.
