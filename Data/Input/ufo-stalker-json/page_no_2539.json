well that's what i thought it was and i ignored it.\r\n\r\na few minutes later, i was still thinking about it because there were no cars around so it couldn't have been a reflection of light onto my window. there were no stars in the sky because it was partially misty and the stars were unable to shine through. as soon as i started thinking about it, a brilliant bright blue object much like a star shot extremely fast in to the sky and stopped dead still at what i imagine to be 1000ft or more. this object was a very bright blue ball of light that seemingly made no noise. after it shot in to the sky and came to a dead stop instantly, it then started to lower itself down to the ground whilst pulling very large circles as if it was spirally back down toward the ground. at around 500ft (or there-a-bouts) it stopped again, instantly. moved off to the left at a high rate of speed, stopped, pulled 1 or 2 more circles (horizontally) and stopped, darted back off to the right, pulled one last circle before it shot off out of sight.\r\n\r\nat this point i couldn't believe me eyes and this object made me all awe-inspired. so i ran downstairs and woke my mother up who was sleeping at the time. i shouted through the door \"mum, come upstairs, i want you to see something\". she asked me 'what?' i said \"quick, there's some strange blue light flying around outside\". so she got up as fast as she could, and we went back upstairs to the window and gazed outside.\r\n\r\nfor two minutes this object did not appear. i refrained from telling my mother what i had seen, and i was beginning to get frustrated at the idea of telling her what i had seen (however unbelievable it was) and she might or might not believe me.\r\n\r\nsure enough, 2 or 3 minutes later this object instantly reappeared and shot back up into the sky and stopped dead still at around 1000 ft. exactly the same thing it did the first time, only this time i had a witness who could verify what it was i was looking at. as soon as it did this my mum let out a whale, almost as if she was not expecting to see this object appear in this way. after stopping at 1000ft (or there-a-bouts) it started lowering its altitude very quickly (almost free-fall speed), but at the same time as its altitude was decreasing it was pulling large horizontal circles. large as in, 100ft or so, but seemingly effortless. it again stopped instantly, darted off to the left, began lowering its altitude once more whilst pulling these large yet swift horizontal circles, stopping dead still, darting off of the right, pulling yet more circles. it stopped for a final time before zipping off extremely quickly, almost leaving a tail behind it as it shot out of sight.\r\n\r\ni for one am very pleased that my mother was there to experience the same series of events, even though the two events were only 2 to 3 minutes apart. i felt as if it would be pointless if i tried to explain it, and perhaps looked at as a nut-case (even from my own mother).\r\n\r\ni did ask her what she thought it was, she too didn't think it was a helicopter, or a plane. it made absolutely no noise. this object was half a mile away at best. if it had been a combustion engine powering this thing, we would have heard it for sure. but it made absolutely no sound, not a whisper. it also moved in a way that i didn't think was possible. it almost seemed to be flying on air, effortlessly moving itself from side to side, pulling circles and traveling at a high rate of speed with the capabilities to stop at will in an instant.\r\n\r\ni hope this description of this incident is clear enough for you to draw up your own conclusions. i did however speak to some friends of mine once, recently. we were discussing ufos over a program called teamspeak. the conversation didn't begin with ufos, but it sure ended up sending a chill down my spine. why? because my friend claims that he has seen exactly the same object (probably not the same one) but another just like it, performing these same aerial stunts, in the same series of events. witnessed by both him and his friend who live a few miles in opposite directions. they two were on teamspeak. one discussing what was going on, the other listening (as we all were). my friend mike who was discussing what he was looking at, at the time, asked his friend who was a few blocks away if he could see the same object. they both gave running commentaries about the same object, both of whom described the same object i had seen a few nights before.\r\n\r\nhowever, they're in california and i'm in england. so it can't have been the same object... can it?","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":7159,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":52.038601,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-06052007-0004","longitude":-0.757072,"occurred":1174542300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1174542300000,"summary":"Blue star-like object","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Milton Keynes, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:461939"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Kingston","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My two older brothers and myself decided to go fishing one sunday afternoon on the great cataraqui river(rideau canal)a few miles north of kingston, ontario, canada. we were about half-way between kingston mills locks and the locks at washburn.\r\nwe had rented a 12 foot boat at mount chesney(sunbury)at a local marina and rowed a mile or so into the river to fish the shallow waters for bass and pike.\r\nthe sun was quite hot that day and the sky was clear as we fished and chatted.\r\nwhile fishing we noticed several craft hanging in the sky some distance off(perhaps a mile)we could see about five of these objects lined-up going away from us to the south-west. these objects appeared to ne at different heights at the time but i realised later that this illusion was probably caused by their distance apart. it was impossible to gauge the size of these craft, due to the unknown distance they were from us.They might have been anything from 25 to 100 feet across but in the distance they looked smaller than the latter. these craft one-by-one faded from sight over the next hour or so.\r\nat this point in-time, 1958 - 1960 there were many reports by newspapers of ufo's being sighted around the world. we did not see anything too remarkable about these craft at the time. other than a casual mention to our parents when we returned home we never gave this much thought.\r\nit was not until many years later that i realised the significance of this sightings and described it in a letter and interview to the local newspaper. my revelation was greeted by the public in the usual way that ufo reporters have to endure.

describe the events being mostly afraid of the sure-derision, that would follow.\r\nthis meeting(?) with these beings has changed my life significantly as i finally realised that the god that my fore-fathers worshipped back into biblical times is really one of these beings with only a much-higher, developed technology than our own. i joke with people now and tell them that although i 'have never met god, i have seen his mode-of-transportation!'\r\ni trust that you at mufon will find this useful - - i might add that i don't believe that there was any abduction involved with myself or my two brothers during this incident. the only thing i observed in later years was that they didn't appear comfortable talking to me about it. one of my brothers involved passed away six years and, of course, we are all getting older. i would like to see this ufo phenomena fully explained before i go back to the elements.\r\ni might also add that i think it is a huge mistake to insist that these beings come from far-off planets and galaxies. with the enormity of our planet - in and under the sea and with the ability that these beings possess to hide-at-will, there is likely lots of room right here for an unknown civilization. unfortunately(?) it will probably be up to these beings when they want to be discovered by those lesser- beings that we choose to call 'humans.'\r\nthank you, and good luck,\r\nglen e smith","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

this sighting is what keened my eye to my last sighting ! i seriously dont think these were shooting stars or satilites because they were flying over the land in a straight level line and then when i

along california i-5, somewhere around corning.\r\ni noticed a very bright light coming from behind us, and turned around to see what i thought was a very large plane trying to land on the freeway about a mile and a half behind us. the object dipped it's right wing tip as it came down below 50ft or so, just as if it were a large jet. the object had no lights pointing foward but was very brighly lit from behind. there were two red sphieres following, but not attached to the wing tips. my friend and i both watched for more than 15min. while the object slowly made up the distance between us. we both thought we were going to be in the way of a emergancy landing. the object caught up to us about the time we went under a overpass. the object had to pull up to make it over the overpass and was about 50ft of the ground when it went over us. about this time we both realized that this was no plane, my buddy asked if i see the spaceship. we were moving at about 65mph, and the object maybe 70-75mph. it was a dark triangle wider than a four-lane freeway, and approximately 40ft thick. there were four round very bright lights accross the back, and a row of dimely lit windows accross the top-half of the back behind them. the two red sphieres took positions about 100yrds off each side, and followed along with the triangle. the object passed directley overhead, and moved on approximately 1/2ml. than took a stationary position about 100ft. above the ground off the shoulder on our side of the road. the red sphieres held stationary positions about 1/4ml. off each corner of the triangle. we stopped and got out right underneath the object. it set thier motionless and silent with all lights out for about 5min.. it than without moving foward turned on it's center axis and moved at walking speed north along the edge of the freeway. i wanted to stay longer but my friend was really scared. i felt as if we had been the sights for someones tour bus. i also got the impression that who ever was at the controls, were confused about where they were at, or going.","distance":"21-100

a clear night and the moon was not out yet, so many of the stars were alreaqdy eluminated. immediately up in the southern night sky i observed a bright redish-orange circular type object traveling from the south-southwest towards the north-notheast, at what appeared to be a constant altitude.\r\n\r\nalthough i felt excited and somewhat in disbelief at what i was witnessing, i tried to make sure i remained calm and not get too over excited as i watched the object flying across the sky. i wanted to go grab my binoculars that were in my car, which was at the front of the house, but at the rate of speed this object was flying i knew i would not be able to get back in time before it flew out of sight. \r\n\r\nwe live less than 1 mile from our local airport and are 4 miles from eglin afb (\"as the crow flys\"). i am an aviation enthusiast, so i have a good idea what an airplane looks like and sounds like. there was no sound or any navigational lights on this object as it moved across the sky.\r\n\r\nbased on my observation angle of the object in relationship to the horizon, i estimate the altitude was between 5,000-10,000 feet.  at those altitudes even small engine airplanes can be heard.  but what struck me as odd, other than the fact there were no navigational lights, was the speed at which this object was traveling.  i estimate the object was crusing at over 1,000 mph and although the trajectory was basically in a stright line, the object seemed to vary its speed (almost like short hesitations or jolts in speed).\r\n\r\ni watched the object travel to the north-northeast (towards the vernon & defuniak springs, florida area) for about 60 seconds and then out of sight. this object was too low to be considered a space satilite and had no elluminated vapor trail to be considered a meteor.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Just before 5am i was passing by a south-facing window on the second floor of my house. we are on a high point and can see the horizon. to the south of us are two radio towers with blinking red lights. between and above them i saw a light that at first i thought was the rising sun because of its pink-red color, and its crescent shape-- round towards the top and curved in at the bottom. after a moment, however, i realized that it was in the wrong direction for the sunrise--south--it was probably too high off the ground for it to be the sun yet, and also, it was overcast. as i watched it for a few minutes, it stayed in the same place in the sky, but changed shape from crescent to oval to circle, (in no paticular order). when it was in a round shape, another small dot of light appeared just to the right of it, the same red-pink color, probably 5-10x smaller than the initial light. the second light moved from the upper right side to the lower left side of the first light, but was visible the whole time and i don't think it actually crossed in front of the light, rather moved underneath it. now on the left side, the second light sat there for maybe half a second, then moved towards the bigger light and was absorbed into it. then it turned back into a crescent shape and faded out until it disappeared. \r\n\r\ni stood there for maybe a minute, waiting to see if it would appear again. it did appear-- all of a sudden, no fade in, in exactly the same spot and exactly the same color, in a crescent shape. i watched it for a much shorter time, maybe thirty seconds, and then it disappeared again. i can't remember if it faded out or totally disappeared. \r\n\r\ni thought to run downstairs and get binoculars during all of this, but i didn't want it to disappear while i was gone.\r\n\r\ni've been trying to rationalize this and there are only a few answers i can come up with. one, is that there is a municipal airport to the south of us, as well as the boston airport to our northeast, and we often see planes from either airport over our house. however, it was overcast and there was no break in the clouds as far as i could tell that would allow aircraft to be seen. i also didn't hear an aircraft, though it probably would have been too far away to hear. the light also didn't move. it seemed too low in the sky for it to be an aircraft that appeared not to be moving because it's so far away. \r\n\r\nthere is no way i mistook the sun for this light, because as i said, it was in a southerly direction. i also checked the sunrise time yesterday, which is listed as 5:09. as soon as the incident was over i checked the clock in my room, and it was exactly 5 am. my clock might be a little off, but i don't think it's off that much. it could have possibly been the sun reflecting off of something in the sky, but again, the sun wasn't up yet and it was overcast. which, by the way, raises another point-- it seemed as if this object was far away. i don't know how high the clouds are when the sky is overcast, but if i saw everything correctly, either te clouds were high and this object was far away, or the object had some quality to it that made it look far away when it was really much closer, beneath the clouds. if the light was really just a hole in the clouds, letting through the light of the rising sun-- again, i'm 95% sure that it was before 5am when i saw it, and even if the sun was starting to come up, i don't think the color of the sky would be that intense pink-red already in the south. \r\n\r\nso thank you very much for documenting this... if you try and contact me about it, please only do so by email.
