the sky is clear. i always look at the stars, and i use google sky maps pretty often. what amazed me tonight, were the brightest stars that were flickering in the sky, wasn't on any star alignments in the sky. so, i stopped everything i was doing and just stared as hard as i could. after noticing this one star that was glowing a bright orange color, i noticed it was moving in odd ways. i kept looking to see if it could have possibly been a airplane (because i live walking distance to an airport), but i've seen the usual airplanes flying near it, and the bright object would flicker and move near it as if it were watching the flights in the sky. paying more attention, i've started looking at the other flickering bright stars in the sky and they were doing the same movement as the others. they were all moving in odd circular and zig-zag movements, just hovering in the sky. i've always noticed these bright flickering odd-colored stars (i've seen purple, red, blue, white, orange, and yellow), but never really taken my time to sit there, and watch them. watching them move in odd directions versus the planes that were either flying towards the airport, or away from the airport has given me proof that i've been looking at ufos this entire time. when noticing the movements, i felt like i was in shock and the more i've watched it, i felt as if i were being watched as well as if i were gaining acknowledgement that they knew i was watching them. i didn't lose sight of it at all, all five of them are still in the sky, and it's been nearly two hours now. i've always heard stories in town about sightings, especially in the norfolk and fort eustis area. i can say i've never looked hard enough to notice it until now. i can also say that these flashing/sparkling/pulsing objects are in the sky all the time, looking as if they're a part of the stars as

there' and he said ' what?' but i thought nothing of it because i wasn't wearing my glasses so i said ' nothing it doesn't matter' and went to the bathroom to get my glasses and went to bed, i thought i'd just have a look out the bedroom window to see what the bright light was, and i was just absolutely confused by what i saw. i thought it was an aeroplane, but after five mins it didn't move or the light intensity didn't change, but it was just very bright. in the isle of man there is just a whole lot of nothing, we have one small airport. very few planes cross us. when they do, they are never this bright. i got my phone to take a picture and my first thought was that it will disappear as soon as i get my camera but it just stayed stationary in the sky. i took a couple of photos then started recording. i still wasn't sure what i was recording so stopped. it was just very very bright. once recording it though i zoomed in and out trying to get a better idea of what it could be. i wanted to watch my video whilst the object was still statinary in the sky to get a better idea of what it was. i zoomed in and i'd see it looked like a fireball, almost like it had a ring around it, i looked up again to see it still in the sky, it then after about another 30 seconds pulsated and drifted to the left and shrank in size then disappeared. i still didn't really think i had caught anything that great, i was trying to be logical, i watched the video over and over, after several times i noticed to the left of the orb in the video there are small flashing lights right next to it, that flash randomly throughout the video. i showed my husband just today and he is usually sceptical but he thinks i've really caught some thing here, and i want to share.

dinner, which was around 8:00 pm. my dad, brother and i went outside and were watching the planes fly over. we have always been very intrigued with aviation.  my brother lives very close the detroit metro airport as well so we frequently find ourselves outside watching the planes landing and taking off. at the time there were about six jets flying in different directions and at various altitudes all with visible contrails.  \r\n\r\nwhile we were standing in the driveway we noticed a jet flying from north to south at a very high altitude due to the contrails behind it.  we started talking about it and was estimating it was moving around 500-700 mph at an altitude greater than 30,000 ft. they continued to talk to about planes while i surveyed the sky in curiosity. at this point, this is when i noticed a shiny star-like object just above the contrail the plane had just left. i stood there glued to this object because it seemed to not move nor did it look like a star, it was too shiny. i am always on the look out for strange events and decided i should take a photo. i tried retrieving my phone without taking my eyes away from it but i couldn't get my camera on my phone engaged, so i looked away.  \r\n\r\nit only took a few seconds to get my camera ready and when i looked for the shining object i couldn't find it, which was strange. at this point, i asked my brother and dad if they had seen the star-like object above the contrail that i was looking at and they, unfortunately, didn't see it.  my brother insisted that it was probably a satellite reflecting the sun. i told him that would be impossible because of the time of day and that the object wasn't moving at all,  i personally just thought it was a star. so, i looked around for a few mins scanning the sky like some houdini just pulled a fast one on me. it was about three mins after i noticed it was gone that i took two photos, only one had something interesting.  \r\n\r\nafter i snapped the shots i looked on my phone and obviously didn't see anything. so, kind of blew it off for the rest of the night. it was after i got home and opened up the photos on my computer i noticed something after enlarging the photo, i had picked up two black triangles in the same location of the star like object that i had seen before.  \r\n\r\nwhen i took this photo, all the planes had flown off and there were no birds in the sky that i could see. i also do not think that birds would be visible from the distance these objects are seen. if so, those are some big birds and we have a totally different story! i'm really happy to have picked up something because i was feeling a bit annoyed that i was the only person to have seen the object in the sky. now i have some sort of proof that i wasn't totally losing it, ha.  \r\n\r\ni attached the original photo along with a copy with the red circles where the objects can be seen. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

going on around us so i felt we had a good chance of some kind of envounter so we drove for about 10 minutes into the bush until we came to the first lake of 3 i parked my car and we sat for about 10 maybe 15 minutes talking about all the occurrences happening and trying to piece together our puzzle . i was looking out the front windshield out over the lake and almost simoltaniously me and my girlfriend noticed a strange light over the horizon on the other side of the lake maybe .8 of a kilometer away. we watched and questioned the appearance vigorously trying to find anything to meet this description first thought was it must be a helicopter then a remote control drone or something of the sort then it started moving closer and 2 other ufos came behind it. we now had no doubt in our mind's that what we were witnessing must be ufos. the 2 new ones flew in not right beside each other but defiantly not far apart they all 3 started moving to different sides of the lake one was about 500 feet north east of our position just off the point of somebodys bay and another to the right and probably 400 feet apart and the other adjacent to the first north east making some kind of triangle formation they hovered for a short time and slowly retreated back the way they came. i know what i saw and it could not be some kind of helicopter when close enough we could make out lights all the way around the craft somewhat pulsing but in a soothing order i was not scared nor was my girl friend and our friend fascination would be a better way to explain my emotion at the time.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:12:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

half-way between the two towns i saw what i initially perceived to be a blimp over holland.  as i got closer to holland i could see no visible cabin underneath and then was thinking it must be a balloon because the chevy dealer in holland often would fly various objects over his place of business.  \r\n\r\nthe day was crystal clear other than scattered cumulous clouds inland from the lake mi shoreline.  it was the clouds that gave me a better perspective of the size and altitude of this object.  all the while to this point the object appeared to be stationary and a passing cloud shadowed the object and made it obvious the thing was much higher and larger than a tethered balloon.  as the cloud passed and i was closer, i could see a shape that was flatter and thinner than a blimp, but what struck me as really unusual was the whitish color—it was the brightest, pearly, silvery white i’ve ever seen on a physical object.  a cloud or 2 passed over it again as it was near but below the clouds, so ~ 6,000 feet.  just about the time i realized i was observing something quite extraordinary it started moving very slowly due north.  a moment later, and the can only way i can describe it, in a second, the object zipped straight north and out of sight. \r\n\r\ni did not report what i saw to any authority or airport, but called a few friends and watched the news but did not hear if anyone else seeing what i saw.  then kids and a busy life i didn't follow further.  a local expert recently suggested i report even though the event was in the 1990s in the hope someone else may have seen what i observed.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

many cars on the interstate yet.\r\nwe rounded a. end and topped a small rise and that is when i first saw it.\r\nat this distance it was low to the horizon it was a silvery light so bright i could not stand to look at it.\r\nmy son was doing something with his phone (playing a game most likely) when i made him sit up and asked him what is that? he tried to look at it as well but you cannot believe how bright this thing was.By now we had halved the distance to it we were traveling at a little above the speed limit maybe 75 or so mph it was i'm guessing about the size of a full size car if you were looking at one from above. it was so bright i just couldn't look at it straight on i had to look at a spot near it and see it out of the corner of my eye it looked almost like it was boiling and was like two circular masses and had a  connector between them but they were closer together than what i picture as a barbell. the larger part was on top and the lower mass was probably 2 thirds or three fourths the size of the top. then i told my son to take a picture of it he said of what(my son is a high functioning autistic with asbergers) he said of what so i said of the ufo to which he said where and i pointed to it and said hurry! he held his phone up and i thought he was taking pictures or video of it for several seconds and asked are you getting good pictures and he said no i can't even see the ufo because of the shiny thing and i told him the shiny thing is the ufo which started a short argument as he told me that's not a ufo(i think he thought all ufos were flying saucers) anyway we topped the next rise and our view was obscured i intended to take the next exit and go back. it ended up the next exit was several miles down the road so i gave up and didn't go back. so even though i saw this for a few minutes i didn't get a picture. i have always wondered why people don't get get better pictures or have better recollections of what was going on at times like this and then i didn't even think to stop the car and video this.My best guess is at the closest we came to this it was maybe three or four hundred yards west of us and i'm guessing four or five times the height of the trees over the ground either hovering or moving very slowly as we passed it similarly as we were roadside signs. i couldn't believe what we were seeing it was very surreal that's why i was upset he hadn't gotten a picture and now i can't show any one what we saws were still hours from home and that's all i thought of since. however my son went right back to his phone and just moved on.\r\nthere seemed to be a bright glow or reflection all around whatever this was and like i said you cannot believe how bright this was it left blue dots on your eyes even when you closed them if you know what i mean.\r\ni wold really like to know if anyone else saw this. thank you for your time","distance":"501 Feet - 1

afternoon; a shining orb (possibly silvery too) which toggled throughout the above clouds which i summoned with a friend who witnessed. this one appeared at a higher elevation than the earlier in the s x se sky at approx 5 pm.\r\n\r\nalso summoned with a ten day period were: \r\n**two sepsrste ebani appearances (three together were red and looked like semi-inflated mylar baloons, and one on another occasion was green, elongated, and shining with an undulating drift). all these were strait coursing from e to w. \r\n**there were as well several white orbs. on one occasion captured on cell phone vid were three of this type in a triad formation (see submitted video below), \r\n**one strait coursing dark orb at night which turned around and went away, \r\n**a pulsar-bursting orb in a stormy night sky which emitted a plasma-like field which sucked in on itself leaving a fast fading dark spheric impression, \r\n**one low-flying, strait-course, toggling white transluscent orb, \r\n**and one flashing object of unknown shape (possibly had an appendage) which came from the n x nw sky and slowly approached our location directly overhead until disappearing in the clouds.  \r\n\r\nthere were a few others which may have been actual too but were seen only in perifory and for a brief moment. my viewing area is not so good; there's a fair amount of tree obstruction.

pickup in the morning.\r\n2.  i just had a feeling to look up in that direction, and it was a beautiful, clear sky, with an almost full moon.\r\n3.  looked like a star at first but it was moving, so i watched to see if it had telltale lights of an aircraft or exhaust and saw none, so i kept watching as it was definitely not flying like any \"known\" aircraft that we have on earth.\r\n4.  it

with me so i could see to take out the garbage so i flashed it several times, it seemed to slow down as it became closer to me and seemed slowest as it was directly overhead, after i flashed it.  i felt that it acknowledged my presence.  i thought, if you visit me \"i will remember you\"  i'm not afraid of you.  i felt excited, confident that i will remember anything that follows and not afraid, agitated mildly and resolved to handle anything if anything occurs tonight.\r\n6.  it appeared to slightly speed up until it changed velocity heading slightly south and got smaller and then just

chop chop than the normal helicopter noise.I looked in the direction it was coming from and was taken by complete surprise at what i was looking at .I lived for a long time around a military base and have also done military time so i knew what i was looking at was not in any classification of a man made aircraft.First of all it was about the size of a school bus only maybe a little smaller than a full size bus .It was rectangular in shape and had no discernible windows . there were protrusions more like  squares from the front to the back but to be honest i could not really say what the design was . i instantly thought of getting the camera but i knew the way it was moving i had no time to locate and get the camera up to running to catch a picture. i observed it go straight west to east crossing a road at about i estimate 300 feet from the ground and probably 500 feet from me .I turned but not at an aircraft would with a banking motion.It simply rotated from left to right about 15 to 20 degrees  as it crossed the road .There were no exhaust ,no wings ,no tail , no windows that i could see and no way of possibly staying in the air since there was no propellers ,no engines ,no balloons ,no heat signature of any kind and the only noise i heard in the beginning i can't remember if it was still present as it was moving .To me it appeared as if was searching for something the way it moved from straight ahead to the right ,after this movement it completely changed direction from  going west to east after crossing the road to the direction of east to north.There were clouds in the north direction and it headed upwards and at one point it tilted from the left side upwards and i could see the top of the ufo and it looked very much like a flat slightly yellow rectangular surface ,again , no visible anything to suggest it had a power system of any kind  .It went into the clouds at about a quarter mile from where it changed direction.I lost sight of it at this point and quickly cussed at myself for not having the time to get a picture of the probably only time in my life to see a ufo or what ever it was as close as i had experienced .I did not report this as it would have had to have been observed by people on the road i know and at the time of day that it was there was a 99% chance no one would have seen it as quickly as it happened .I don't know where it came from because i only saw it as it was almost directly north of where i was standing and watching after i saw it . the next day i heard this same chop chop noise but where i was in the house i could not tell in what direction it was coming from and by the time i got to the back door i no longer heard the noise. i have not heard this noise since.I do hear helicopters going over the house and also checking on the power lines .And i can honestly say they are not the same noise as this craft was making .It was a lot more pronounced noise .I was thinking it was a good impression of a helicopter but not 100% the same noise .The thing that struck me the most was what ever i was looking at should no be able to be in the air .You simply cannot have a large rectangular anything and have it move in the air and change directions with no observable power system of any kind . i don't know what the ends looked like because it never moved in a way that i could see the ends ,the only way i could tell it was rectangular was when it moved into the clouds so that i could see the top it have a very definite rectangular shape .I could estimate it was probably 5 feet by 20 feet but since it was a quarter mile from me at that point of estimation i could be way off .I have seen other strange things but never as close as this one was.","distance":"101-500

from my west to my south. i watched it for about 90 seconds in disbelief and shock, i've never seen any thing close to a ufo. i want to think it was a group of helicopters but i couldn't hear any propellers and i don't think it was a group of planes because the lights were so close to one another. the way it glided threw the air and how the lights kept their shape. at this point i realize just what i'm looking at, i run to get the camera but when arriving outside again its moving south fast so i took a little jog towards the ridgefield dock but it was gone, over the ridge to scapoose, its across the river. now the first thing i did was check \"flightaware\" to make sure its not a plane, nope no flights in this area and the flight path makes no logical sense as pdx is to our se and its going sw.\r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time? finished a movie and letting the dogs out to go to bed. 3:10 am.\r\n2. what made you first notice the object? it was a large

been dimmer. it looked like it was over the refuge or the columbia and heading towards scapoose. \r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. cigar outlined in orange yellow red
