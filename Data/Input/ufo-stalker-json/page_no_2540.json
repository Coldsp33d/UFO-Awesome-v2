these objects in the sky to the nnw on a bright sunny day with absolutely no clouds. they would have been well above the horizon, but not more than about 15���  from horizontal. these 5 or 6 pure white geometric shapes (circle, square, triangle) were in a straight line horizontally with space between them and with no visible connection. they appeared to be cut out pieces of white paper. it is difficult, with no other reference  objects, to estimate how distant they were. i had the impression that they were perhaps 1 mile away or more and if i would have held up my hand vertically at arm's length it would probably have hidden them. i can still visualize them as clear as ever.   \r\n\r\nthese objects were not moving and as it was something we had not seen before, we watched for only 5-10 seconds and decided to go in and tell our grandmother to come and look. she came out immediately and we discovered that the objects had disappeared. they would have had to move very quickly to be out of sight in such a short time. we were certainly familiar with aircraft, but this sighting was so unique we were very perplexed. this is a prairie location with very little physical relief, so there was not much to obscure one's view unless an object descends close to the ground and goes behind the occasional poplar bluff.\r\n\r\nthis is something that is still very clear in my mind even though it occurred 56 years ago and i was only 4 years old. i can still identify the exact spot where we stood when this sighting took place. my sister was one year older. i'm sure that if i visit the location again i could take a digital photo and superimpose the objects as i recall them. in all the material i've read or tv shows that have been presented over the years, i have never heard of anyone witnessing anything like this. if mufon has had any similar report, i would like to hear of it.\r\n\r\nsincerely, rick","distance":"Over One

fountain, colorado doing yoga on a platform out in the wetlands...When i noticed swirling energy (not clouds) above me.  i was relaxing, doing meditation, while lying flat on my back looking up into the sky.  i usually meditate with my eyes closed...But for some reason i'd opened them and was observing the interesting energy swirls.  they are difficult to describe.  i'd never seen anything like it before...But there was an obvious energy disturbance taking place directly above me in the sky.  then a small white cloud appeared out of nowhere (now here).  it was just suddenly there.  it didn't form...One second it wasn't there and the next second there was this peculiar little white cloud that showed up and looked about the size of a softball.  an even smaller piece of this small white cloud separated from the main cloud.  the main cloud quickly disappeared...Evaporated or something...Leaving this peculiar little white triangular cloud in the middle of the blue sky.  the swirling energy was no longer noticeable by the time the main little cloud disappeared.  then this little bitty (gee, it's hard to gage size in a huge blue sky with only one little bitty cloud...But i'd say it looked about the size of a big marble...A shooter i think they call them.  then that little white cloud started spreading out...And behind it i saw, clear as day, a cylindrical shaped matte metal object.  it looked about the size of half a ball point pen...And was rounded on both ends.  it's cloud cover totally disappeared leaving a non-shiny silver grey object...It was only visible for approximately 15 seconds or so...But i saw it clearly.  i'd like to state that i was not under the influence of any mood or mind altering substances...Unless fresh air and exercise are considered to be mood or mind altering.  i admit i have been sleep deprived...But that hasn't affected my mental functioning to my knowledge.  i believe i'm operating on all cylinders.  i know what i saw and i give my word as a woman of honor that i\r\nsaw what i saw.  i am of extremely sound mind and body, have never\r\nhallucinated that i remember, and know what i saw was not made by human\r\nintelligence.  then it just disappeared.  it did not move or accelerate in\r\nany way.  it made no noise.  it must have shifted into another dimension or whatever they do...I don't know how they operate but would love to learn.  hopefully more solid metal objects will be appearing for others everywhere soon...Not just in my area.  one thing i'd like to add, is that i consciously had asked to see one yesterday.  i was playing the game\r\n\"wouldn't it be nice if....\" and i decided it would be nice if i finally had a really-oh truly-oh sighting...Not just lights flying around or orbs\r\nlike i've seen before...I wanted to see something solid with no mistaking it for anything else.  damned if whoever (or whatever) was tuning into the\r\nvibration of my thoughts didn't deliver.  i encourage those of

encounter, now i want to tell you mine, in case i forget and leave something out when i speak to you in person. i called the clinic today that did my steroid injections, main desk couldn't find the year, so i am expecting a call back from scheduling, to see if they have the year, but i can tell you if my wife says 97 or 99 its one of those, i also called my regular doctor to see if they might have the date, the nurse told me she looked pretty far back and couldn't find it, i'm thinking the date was removed because the specialist that did my spine injections made a mistake, here's my story. got up early still dark out went in for my spine injections, i will speed this up, was in getting the injections, when doctor missed the pocket the steroid was to go into, i yelled out in much pain, ex wife took me home, i was on strong pain meds, it didn't help, my ex wife wanted to go do some shopping, i told her i didn't want her to go as i was in more pain then i had ever had, even worse than the spine infusion years ago, i knew i shouldn't be left alone, she said she would hurry back, i fell asleep on the sofa, when i woke i got up very slowly to go to the rest room, i lost all, and i mean all hearing both ears, i thought for sure i was going to die, as a christian i prayed for gods help, i walked over and grabbed the phone, i laid back down and called 911, i told them that every time i got up i lost all hearing, and to please send rescue, when rescue got there they noticed my strong pain meds, and said i probably just took to many pain meds, i told them i hadn't, i said the doctor made a mistake with the steroid shot, and i was sure it went to my brain, they almost laughed at me, they just told me to call my doctor, and they left, soon my ex wife came back, i told her i need to go back to doctor, as my pain is very bad and when i stand up, all hearing goes, then it happened everything went silent, i pointed to my ears to let her know, i couldn't hear, i could see her worried look, she called the doctor, and then took me back in, i told the doctor at home i was loosing my hearing, he didn't believe me and told me, in a stern voice, this has never happened before with any patients i have had, in fact he said he had never heard of it before, i didn't believe him. my ex wife took me back home, i went into the bed room to lay down by now it was getting dark outside, i looked up and saw what was kind of shaped like a xmas tree with lights under it (triangle), point facing me, it didn't move, it made no sound, ex wife was gone again, i went into bathroom, as i stood over the toilet, all hearing left me again, but i didn't feel like i was passing out. i went back to bed, i looked up and i noticed this small craft was now slowly moving forward, i looked close and i noticed a alien looking back at me from a small opening underneath the craft (big head, big eyes, no nose, small lips) i got the feeling he was telling me to not be afraid he seemed nice, but as a christian i was a little pissed, as i had heard bad things about what they do to people, i don't trust aliens, as i don't feel they are from god, and i thought with all the pain and hell i'm in why are they enjoying watching me, leave me the hell alone, i prayed all night for god to help my pain, my wife and i fell asleep, then i was awake i noticed what looked like humans sitting on the floor in a circle, but there skin was very white and pail, the one that looked female spoke she said we are hear to help you, i noticed what looked like steam coming up from the floor, they asked me to come and sit down in the circle where the steam was coming from, i was now standing on the floor with them around me, i started jumping around mocking them, putting my hands to my lips acting like, oh i'm so scared, i thought i'm not falling for your evil tricks, i serve the lord you cant touch me and i'm not afraid of you, next thing i knew the people, steam and craft were all gone, and i was praying lord please take me home, i cant stand this pain anymore, to this day i do regret not sitting down in what ever that was coming from the floor, i knew what had happened was real when my wife said she also saw them, and that i was jumping around acting like a fag ( her very words), i told her it was because i was pissed at them, and i figured they would of taken or done something bad to me, like i had read about with other people. about a week latter, my ex wife went into the living room looked outside and saw little aliens, she said they were kind of walking in a jerky robotic way there were three of them, the leader looking one pointed up to the night sky, as the other two also looked up, she came back into the room to tell me i could see she was terrified, i said cool lol, don't worry there probably just coming back to check on me. one day after that i was in my back yard and was buzzed by a black helicopter, i was just sitting in a chair and i was being watched so close i went in and told my ex wife to come see this, she goes wow mark omg the black copter was close just a few feet above the tree line and it was side ways, just watching me, i'm ex military (6 years national guard) i thought this is strange a black out of place military copter watching me and no marking on it, must be the police looking for someone, for over a week this same black copter buzzed my house, sometimes i would play with them to see what they would do, so i would try to hide behind a bush etc. one time i jumped in my car and headed to the store up the street to see if they would follow me, i was freaked out to find not only did they follow me to the store, but they were waiting for me when i came out. i want to add that ever since my ufo encounter, i started having sleep problems, kicking and screaming in my sleep, it got so bad my ex wife and i could no longer sleep in the same bed, part of what destroyed our 20 year relationship, i was sent to the sleep lab, and was told i scream and act like i'm fighting something off , a nurse video tapped me in my sleep she said it was very dramatic to see, and that at one point my foot came up and i even kicked myself in the rear end. to this day, i'm told i have nightmares all the time but i never remember them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely,  mark

cloudy day with plenty of sunshine.  i was practicing a technique called cloudbusting when i noticed a high-flying dark object float into view.  if not for me looking directly at the cloud i wouldn't have noticed this object and several times i lost sight of it momentarily as it dipped and flew backwards down and then stopped.  it looked like a bird without flapping it's wings.  it stood motionless for a few minutes as the clouds behind it continued drifting, and then it would turn on it's side slightly and shoot backwards rather quickly and then just as soon as it began it stopped again and drifted virtually motionless.  at first my wife and daughter and myself thought it could be a very large high flying bird that was caught in a jet-stream and instead of traveling south in the direction it was pointing it just stayed stationary for a few minutes before dipping down and backwards as if the wind was too strong for it to make any progress.  soon we began to doubt whether or not it was a bird because of the height and size.  i know some birds have been known to fly several miles up but none of the north american species looked like this object.  the way it moved made me think i was possibly seeing some type of unmanned drone aircraft that wasn't powered by conventional engine, maybe it was designed to float high above a specific point.  from where i was standing the object looked to be approximately 7500-15000 feet or more in alttitude and about as big as a leerjet in size.  all black in color shaped like a bird crossed with a boomerang and a b-2 stealth bomber.  as time passed on the object continued drifting backwards towards the north as it was a southerly wind that day, until i lost track of it.  ps: i have read a few accounts from witnesses in the states around me who have reported similar sightings maybe they are the same thing. also of note i don't know if it was because the sky was so bright and the object so far away and small but when i looked at it there appeared to be a fuzzy dark moving aura surrounding it.  like i said it may have just been because the sky was so bright with the white illuminated clouds around it and because it was so dark maybe it was an optical illusion gving it the aura.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

admiring the almost full moon that was in the south east area of the sky.  i noticed, what seemed to be a star (as bright as sirius or vega would be, but in the night sky) floating still,  relitivly close to the moon...This did not make since, being that the sun was still up.  i continued to examine the \"star\" for the next 1-2 minutes. i was looking around for any neighbors who could confirm the that there was an object up there, because i could not believe what i was seeing myself, but no one was outside, and i did not want to distract myslef away from the situation any more than i already had. i stared at this \"star\" intensivly, trying to make since of it. \"could i actually be seeing a ufo?\" i asked my self a few times...I tried to rule out a plane (i live next to an airport) or even military aircraft, but there was no movement...It was just hanging there still, high in our atmosphere.  i had taken my eye off of the object, to briefly check on my dogs, and looked back up at the sky to find the object was gone. i was very stunned, and a little bit angry that i looked away from the object,because i knew better.  but it appeared again!!! in the exact same spot...I was determined to not look away again. about 15-20 seconds after i relocated the object, it faded from its diamond color into a light brownish/red color (like mars appears in the night sky), faded in and out 2 times, then was gone. if i was questioning what the object was before...Seeing it fade in and out and completly dissapear was making me question it more. i could not justify the object being a plane or any other earthly aircraft at this point. i tried desperatly to snap pictures with my cell phone camera, but with no luck.  my experience lasted about 2 minutes

decided to do this because of shag harbour and its relative time approximation to my sighting a month or more earlier. i was in a rock 'n roll band at the time which was based in edmonton. we had finished playing a job in a very rural town about 250 miles, roughly north of edmonton. let me state at the outset that we were neither drinkers nor in to drugs at that point in any of our histories as young men. we finished at 1 a.M. and packed up immediately (about a half hour to 45 mins., stopped for a burger at a truck stop (probably 30-45 mins.), and left to return to edmonton. the night was very starlit and beautiful. i was in the front seat on the passenger side with the band's keyboardist and lead singer driving, and our second vehicle, a 3/4 ton truck driven by our 'roadie' with our lead guitarist with him, perhaps 500 yards behind. we had radio between the two vehicles. laying in the back of our vehicle was the drummer and bassist, brothers, in our band. apparently the drummer had fallen asleep, but our bassist was still somewhat awake.\r\n\r\nsince very young, i've always had a thing for gazing into starry skies and was doing that as willie drove, about 3:30 or so in the a.M., driving on a well-paved 2-lane highway far away from towns, etc. i noticed a \"light\" down the highway. i didn't think anything of it as from afar, it could have been a typical single light illuminating a country intersection. then i noticed something about the light which caught my attention. it appeared to be moving. \r\n\r\nnow, you have to try to understand that what took place was very, very fast and the whole thing, from the time i noticed the light was moving until i clearly saw an underbody passing over our car, that it would have been about 5 seconds, perhaps 7 seconds. as i noticed the light was \"moving\" at great speed toward us, i asked our driver \"what the heck is that?\" by that point it was nearly on us and my head was at the dash, looking out and up. what i clearly saw was an underbody of a circular craft, unlit yet seemed lit because i saw a bluish green colour to it. i was immediately yelling and my heart was leaping. the driver never saw anything unusual and immediately accused me of making something up, but called back to the truck and we all got out of the vehicles and talked. i was beside myself, but the only other person who noticed anything was the bassist who claimed that upon my yelling, he looked out of the tail end of the station wagon and noticed a light shooting away from our location. the next day our band played in calgary, and i read the calgary herald, which contained a tiny \"filler\" article well-back in the paper dated from maclennan, alberta, close to where we were that night, which claimed farmers were saying they had seen strange lights or something of that ilk. i'll never forget the look of that flying over our car. for many reasons, i've kept this mostly to myself, and as sightings go, it wasn't much, but it was very unmistakable and had to have been exactly what i saw...Of course, because our car was, i believe, heading west at that point and the craft going the other way, after it passed over our car i saw nothing else. the bassist, as i said, claimed he saw a light shooting away from us...This is really all i can say about it as i was immediately discredited by our lead singer/keyboardist, well-known for his need for absolute control, so besides the bassist, there was no other corroboration, and they scarcely reacted to the small article i gleaned from the newspaper next day from the farmer-sightings near maclennan, alberta...That's it!

9:30. our eleven year old son pointed and asked \"what's that?\"  there were event search lights flashing on the clouds at the time. at first we thought he was asking about the lights. however, all four family members quickly spotted a dark triangular or boomerang shape moving slowly across the background of light, broken cloud cover.  the clouds were part of a storm front moving out toward the southeast.  the sky to the northwest was clear.  there was a half moon due south and occasionally visible through breaks in the receding clouds. the dark shape was clearly moving independently of the cloud movement.  the shape was never illuminated by the search lights and had no lights of its own. it also did not appear to reflect light. it was evident primarily due to the absence of light, like a shadow. it was distinct when the cloud backdrop was solid and very hard to see when it crossed a darker or broken patch in the clouds.  we first spotted the shape maybe 50 degress above the southeast horizon, in the direction of south high school from our vantage point. the shape moved slowly to the southeast, maybe 10 degrees and then reversed direction back toward the northwest without turning. it became faint and then disappeared in a larger area of dark sky. we watched it for a total of 3 to 4 minutes. it was very hard to tell its size or how far away it might be, other than it was below the clouds. \r\nat first we speculated that it might be a kite or a bird.  there was no discernable breeze to keep a kite aloft and it did not move like either a kite or bird. we kept our eyes on that area of sky for the rest of our walk to the south end of the park and back and did not see anything further. \r\nso, we are just curious if anyone else saw this or has an explanation.

outside. the aircraft-like noise boomed through the air like extremely fast, low flying aircraft. what i saw next made me drop my iced tea. two sets of lights - red, horizontally set - spinning around each other in perfect cylindrical form... then the heart-stopping separation; one set sharply northwest, the other slightly northeast. the nw set continued directly away in sight for some time. the sound passed quickly. the ne set seemed to stop altogether and dim. if one were to walk up and see at that moment, the ne set would have appeared no more than a faint star.\r\n as i continued to watch

yelled for my husband to come here quickly!\r\nhe also thought it was very peculiar so he went in to grab the camera, while i did not want to take my eyes off it. it looked like a fireball to me, but it moved so slowly and in a controlled fashion from east to west.  i suspect it was not a meteor. it definitely was not an airplane or helicopter. it was completely silent. i stayed to watch it as it faded from sight, still hight in the air several minutes later. i wonder if anyone else saw this thing? i saw it from the tacoma area, on the south end of tacoma. it appeared brighter with the naked eye than the picture i have included. by the time he got the camera, it was further away than when i first saw it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

think my case is a special one because i see the ufos regularly.I'm from tehran but have been a university student for four years in babolsar, a small, coastal town in the extreme north of iran. i have been interested in the ufo subject from high school. for the first time, two years ago, at around 5 am in december, i noticed a very bright fast moving light in the sky moving from north to south. from that moment i became very curious about the existence of ufos in north of iran also before that i also heard about a lot of ufo sightings in iran especially the northern cities. so, i used to watch the sky a lot. when one day i saw a ufo at 6:30 p.M. i watched at the same moment the next day and to my suprise i could see again and again. i couldn't see them everyday because the sky was cloudy most of the times. during the last year i just could see the starlike ufos which moved usually from south to north ( toward the caspian sea) mostly at 6:30 to 7:00 p.M..But by the start of the previous semester at november, again i used to watch the sky at 6:30 p.M.. now to my suprise i saw new kinds of ufos. these ufos were flying very low at an altitude of about 200-300 meters and were very small nearly at the size of a football. these unmanned ufos are covered with a halo of yellow-white and very dim light that they are unnoticeable and when i saw one of them for the first time i mistook it with a bird on which the light from ground was reflected, but when i saw the object several times i got it. these drones sometimes move singly or in pairs or in a triangular formation and i once saw 16 of them ( i counted) in an arrowhead formation at 6:35 p.M. and once i saw nearly 50 of them moving slowly at 1:40 a.M. towards the caspian sea. the late 2 months i feel more activity as i see lots of starlike and drone ufos at 8:30 to 9 p.M..I have bought a 5mw green laser. this device helped me a lot. when i shoot the low altitude small ufos the light reflects perfectly which shows the smoothness of the surface, and the ufo tries to dodge my shot and sometimes increases its speed. when i shoot the starlikes they immediately make their light very dim or invisible. only one of the ufos which i think is the same responds to the laser beam by glowing very sharply for 2 -3 seconds and later goes off.\r\ni have also seen other things for example once i saw a glowing stork which i'm sure was made of light ( like laser projection ) and surprisingly was flying like a bird ! there have been reports of some strange creatures in the caspian sea which you can find on the net.\r\ni believe the investigation of ussr which concluded that there are some ufo bases under the waters of caspian sea. i wish you could come to investigate in iran because ufo sighting is a very common and handy phenomenon in babolsar. you should just know the time of their flight then you will see them trafficking for about 30 minutes every night.
