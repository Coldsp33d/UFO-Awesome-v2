many times and just enjoying the warm evening and watching the stars. i lived in sheepshead bay so it was common to observe the incoming flights to jfk airport which i also would would follow as they made their approch pattern before landing. on this particular night this one light in the far distance was not following the normal approch course which caused me to follow it more intently. it was moving from south to north turning than north to south. thought it was stange but it appeared to have airline flashing lights so i kept watching waiting for it to form a normal landing pattern. as it got closer i than observed the flashing lights started to take the shape of what then looked like a blimp with scrolling letters but there was no letters? so i keep staring at it waiting to see what message it might be displaying. all along beliving at that point it was a blimp as it had no sounds and was common to see over manhattan & brighten beach but never in the evenings. i continued it slow back and forth flight pattern disappeared breifly (vision blocked by the homes)until it finally came several yards from my house just above what seemed like several 100 yards up and a span of several houses. at that point i could see the object clearly. still in disbelief of what i was looking at i walked down my steps and stared at it for i don't know how long with a 100 thoughts running thru my mind of what it could be until the realization that it wasn't a blimp, a film prop, etc. etc. and a cold chill of fear ran thru me. i ran back to my house and locked myself in and turned of the lights (lol i was a kid, who thinks)after awhile i got up enough nerve to go to the window and peek out, it was gone. i check both the front and back but could not see it. my parents were out that evening and i sat in the dark waiting for them to return and when they did i hystericaly blurting out what i saw. needless to say they ignored it. \r\n\r\nfrom the distance it appeared to look cylindrical with flashing strobbing lights but once it was close enough to see it was circular with the lights (retangular pane's) along the rim, there was no sound except for possibly the sounds of wind moving as it hovered motionless above me. the underside was flat but had an irrgular pattern. ok, here's the kicker, a few nights later i was at a party when i overhear a young man talking about ufo's so of course i began to listen to what he was say and interupted his conversation with i just saw one. he immediately responded with so did he and described exactly as i have. turned out he also lived several blocks from me although i had never meet him before but he was sitting on his back porch when he also noticed the irregular movements and started to watch it as well. those memories have lingered in my mind and every time i by chance turn on a show relating to ufo's i keep hoping someone has documented it or has an explanation for what we had observed that night.

pm est. after the show i went to check the doors to make sure they were locked and we were all going to bed. when i got to sliding door in back of the house i noticed that the planet venus was visible again so i went outside to look at in my back yard. i looked at it and the moon which was to upper left of the planet(i presume it was venus). it was a clear sky and i thought it would be neat for the boys to see this so i went back into the house and called the boys down to take a look at a planet. so we all went back outside and looked at it. as we were looking at it my oldest boy said what is that? and ofcourse i said what and he pointed to the north our right. when i looked i saw two points of light that were spaced apart and the second was flickering eratically and real fast which i thought was odd. they were both moving fast headed south towards indianapolis. the flickering pattern was inconsistent unlike a normal jetliner. the second light vanished and i said where did it go but the first light was still moving( i can't remmeber if the lead light was flickering). then the second light reappeared and again behind it but somewhat above and behaving eratically and again the flickering which i can only describe as like \"machine gun fast\" and it seemed like it was moving in zig zag but still behind the first light. i made the comment to my son it seemed like it was chasing it. we watched this for about 10 seconds as they both flew south and the trees and our house blocked our view so we ran around to the front and they were gone. we kept looking for 20 more minutes but nothing. ofcourse we were saying it must be a plane or something but as we kept looking we saw a normal plane with normal lights and very consistent which was clearly different then what we saw. one last thing there was no noise,only white points of light no other colors and these things were clearly flying and moving

dim steady light point was moving in an easterly direction.  i assumed it was a satellite and followed the light in hopes it was an iridium flare, a satellite that brightens quickly when it reflects sunlight.  i have seen dozens of these iridium flares over the past few years.  after traveling for a few seconds, the light gradually turned north and headed for the horizon.  this struck me as very strange, because the curve was too steep for typical plane and the fact that the light had no resemblance to a plane.  the light soon died out, much like satellites commonly do.  i then heard a jet sound emanating from the direction of the light, but saw no jet.  this could be a coincidence.\r\n\t\r\n\tnext i saw a bright reddish flash closer to the horizon, but where the light���s trajectory should have placed it.  this flash was like a sudden brightening, similar to a meteor, but slower and more controlled.  i then saw two simultaneous flashes and for the next few minutes i saw two flickering lights travel in many directions, usually fading away and then reappearing in a new location, always in the northern sky.  the flickers were at first somewhat rhythmic with a double flicker followed by a single, but soon became more irregular.  every so often the lights would simultaneously flash reddish.\r\n\r\n\tthe lights next appeared in the north-northeast and traveled westward, one slightly ahead of the other, flashing irregularly the entire time.  the front light faded, but as the second light continued westward, the other appeared at the original starting location.  this time it traveled eastward, and both were traveling on the same horizontal line.  finally, after a short time (appx. 1 min) of nothing, i saw the reddish double flash occur.  this time the flashes were very close together (less than a degree probably) and hooked from left to down to right in a tight arc.  after the flash was over, i never saw the lights reappear.\r\n\r\n\ti���ve been an amateur astronomer for years and have never seen anything like this.  i am college education with a background in science and engineering, and i try to logically analyze things.  several reports of near identical situations have been reported out of semi-nearby lafayette in the past few days.  perhaps this is something military related, but all i know is that i have no current explanation of what could possibly make this light display with the movements i observed.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

about two weeks\".  he then went on to explain that he has witnessed this same kind of event for the past two weeks from his backyard at night.  he stated that generally the two small specs of light come together turn orange and then race away. he said that generally it happens around every 15 minutes or so. as we spoke with him we could see the specs of light (5-6 of them) racing around the sky

quite a few and none of them looked like that.  i just was bewildered.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

viewed from my large window.  i saw a bright light come from the left margin of my window and speed accross to the n at below tree level, because i could see the trees/branches in front of the light.  the size is difficult to explain, but it seemed that from where i was lying, my view was like the size of a lightbult, (a star would be a small spot in comparison ?).  it passed by once and that i saw.  incidentally, the bright star-like lights i have been witnessing cirlcing nightly (in the ne sky) were flashing noticably more prominently.

is it taken seriously? will i be looked at as crazy? will anyone even read this? are there others who have reported this, or something like this? will i ever get an answer to these questions? please help to enlighten me on this subject.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":7062,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7846545,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05222007-0004","longitude":-73.9567295,"occurred":1057381200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1057381200000,"summary":"Me and my friend both saw a floating orange orb","tags":["floating"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"New York, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:466004"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Brookston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I observed four star like objects moving in the southeastern sky last night at 10:15pm.  the met and formed a boomerang, like shape, which brightened and flashed a few times before dimming, then resumed the light intensity of a star.  it continued moving about the southeastern sky.  approx: fifteen minutes later the four objects reformed into a boomerang shap, rebrightened and resumed a bright oragne intense light which flashed.  it was followed by a thunder like sound this time, the lights then quickly dimmed and the four star like objects dispursed in a northsouth direction.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":7061,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6043944,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05222007-0003","longitude":-86.8628039,"occurred":1179810900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,  Flash,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1179810900000,"summary":"I observed four star like objects moving in the sky which met and brightened","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Indianapolis","timeZoneName":"America/Indianapolis","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Brookston, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:466005"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2541}
