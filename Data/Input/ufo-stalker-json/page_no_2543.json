minutes watching the light, you had to admit that it was moving. sometimes it would move very quickly forward, then stay in one spot for a while, then move slowly backwards, then stay in one spot for a while again, then move forwards quickly again. occasionally, a light would flicker rapidly, maybe a blue or green light, not like an airplane light that goes on and off. it seemed incandescent.

in the back. rita spotted it again, and this time it was closer because it was brighter. then, suddenly, it zipped across the i-80 and stayed in one spot. when we approached it, i rolled the window down, so that there would be no reflection. desi and i stuck our heads out the window. it was about 30 yards off the highway, about the height of a water tower. it was saucer-shaped with windows around it, and what appeared to be lights on top, although they were not lit. after we passed it, desi and i were about to start looking through the rear window when it took off in a flash. with no

who often prefers to look for a rational explanation for many of these so-called \"phenomena\", however i could find no such reasoning for what had befallen me on this night, nearly a month ago now.\r\n\r\ni was sitting on my back porch, listening to neil diamond and billy idol, while sipping on my champagne and rocking in my rocking chair. it was a relatively quiet night, with only a few kookaburras in the background, and the faint cry of a dingo.\r\n\r\nmy wife, by this time, had since retired to bed, and i was not yet heading that way myself, as i still had much to complete from my days work. i was alerted by my dearest pet cat to a strange goings on in the night sky, and to my bemusement and wonder i happened to notice an unidentified flying object, known as a ufo.\r\n\r\nit was in the shape of a triangle, or so i assumed, as all i could see of it were a red, yellow and white flashing lights at each 'corner'. it was travelling at a steady pace across the night sky, in a westerly direction. i estimated that it was approximately 1400 metres in the air (this is merely an estimation, as i had no real point of reference at the time) and was decending at a uniform pace.\r\n\r\nit is my guess that about 10 kilometres down the road in the direction it was travelling, the craft would have collided with the earth, however i was unable to see this as it dissappeared behind the treeline. the whole incident lasted less than 5 minutes, and it left me confused and scared.\r\n\r\nhowever, i have not reported this to anyone as it was not reported in the news, and no mention was made of it by my friends. unfortunately, i had not the presence of mind to take a photo or recording of the object.\r\ni hope this was helpful,\r\n\r\nhermon

was nearing my destination after 90 minutes of driving, having long exited the highway (hwy 515).\r\n\r\ndriving on aska road about one mile before reaching newport road, i saw two cars parked on the opposite shoulder with their lights on and their drivers standing a few yards from them on the edge of a dirt lot. aska is a long, winding road in a very remote part of ga and it is unusual to see any traffic after 10pm. i thought one of the drivers may have been having car trouble, or collided with the other driver.\r\n\r\ni slowed to take a closer look at the scene and saw both drivers staring to the sky above a hilltop that was about half a mile away. above the hill, maybe 300 ft. in the air were a string of 12 or so bright amber lights arranged into a crescent with a very shallow curve. i first thought them to be airplanes flying in formation. i did not see the lights moving, however, and i also stopped my car and rolled down my window to get a clear view of the lights.\r\n\r\ni did not see stars behind the general patch of sky occupied by the lights and realized i was staring at a single solid object with lights spaced along its leading edge.\r\n\r\ni exited my car and joined the other drivers on the dirt lot and asked them what it was. neither knew, but the first driver to arrive said he had been looking at it for 5 minutes already before i arrived. the three of us traded theories about what we were looking at, finally deciding that it was most likely some kind of blimp. we all agreed it was strange that it wasn't moving at all.\r\n\r\n15 minutes after first noticing the object, it began descending straight down and quickly disappeared behind the hilltop. it covered this distance in no more than 3 seconds. the other two drivers were surprised by this but did not

that had about 10 lights in a v duck looking formation that change shape. there was also a set of 3 or 4 that went about 2 times faster then all the other ones..That was very scary then they stoped

rattled me and her and we are 100% confident it was nothing man made. it looked nothing like a plane, weather thingy,satelite or anything like that..This is scary cause they all went north from all

with juveniles who are in incarceration & treatment. the sun had just gone down when we noticed an object in the sky about 40 degrees up from the horizon by the star that was the planet. the object was on the north side of the planet/star and was large enough to be some type of object like a plane or helicopter. as the client and i looked at the object we noticed that it was not moving. the object was however unjulating and changing its shape. we thought it was a flock of birds however it was very high up in the air and it never moved, just kept changing its shape like a blob. the object was also totally black, no light however it had this edge like it was composed of something liquid. being in the western sky after sunset with the sky still bright, there should have been some type of light reflected off it however it was like the pure absense of any light. planes landing at the slc airport were coming in just under where we witnessed the object. it was about the same size as the planes coming in however it appeared to be far higher than the planes. we could not figure out what this object was. i also attempted to take a picture of this with my phone, the planet/star would show on the display of the phone however the object would not. this was weird since the object was large enough to show.\r\nthe client and i watched the object for a few minutes stay in the same place. the object then traveled to the other side of the planet/star and took another stationary place. the time that it took to move was about 2 minutes. i took the client inside our facility. i then went back outside and continued to watch the object. it started to get smaller however it stayed in the exact same place. i watched it for about 15 minutes total. it basically just shrunk out of sight while the sky started to get darker. the entire time that i watched the object, there was nothing in the sky except the plant/star and the occasional plane coming into land at the airport. the sky was cloud free and clear.\r\nwhen the client and i first went back in the building we ran into one of my coworkers taking out trash too. we told him that there was something in the sky and he asked what we were smoking outside. i saw him come back in from taking out his trash and he stated that he witnessed the object too. when i went outside i grabbed two other coworkers and told them to come look at this. they came outside with me and noticed it too as it was going out of sight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then

locals enjoying the free entrance, sights and beautiful beach.  my oldest child and i took pictures of the ruins up and down.  we ended in the afternoon swimming at the beach and otherwise enjoyed an interesting day.  next day at the hotel i overheard several of the local workers talk about sightings of ufo's up / down the coast line near tulum but never gave it a second thought.  upon returning to the states i uploaded the pictures from the digital camera to our pc.  started looking at the photos when i noticed a speck in the corner of one shot.  upon maximizing it i first thought it resembled  a helicopter but we all remembered how quiet and peaceful the days was and did not hear any aircraft.  upon further review the bottom of the craft seems to have some sort of glow and seems to be almost oscillating.   my oldest has been bugging me ever since to either submit this picture to a ufo site or have a professional photograhper look into it.\r\n\r\ni'm a bit of a skeptic but i

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"To whom it may concern:\r\n         i was a witness to an extraordinary event that may have involved hundreds of people in fort stockton, texas, in the year 1972.  i am looking for anyone who may remember any thing out of the ordinary during that year, the year before or the year after. what you are about to read is truly extraordinary and unbelievable.  but it really happened exactly as you are about to read it and as i am going to write it.   there may even be numerous witnesses alive today that can validate what you are about to read.          \r\n        during the late sixties and seventies, my dad delivered sodas for a dr. pepper company out of pecos.  for those of you that remember, my dad���s name was gerald d wilson.  mr. wilson ran a gas station for 2 years near the sands motel off 285 and i10.  then he worked for coors for the rest of his life. my name is carl wilson.  i will keep my brothers name out of this to protect their reputations.  i was a junior or a senior at that time, but i can���t recall the exact date. i do remember that it this extraordinary sighting occurred just before graduation.  this is what occurred.\r\n        as i mentioned before, while i was in high school, my dad worked for a dr. pepper company out of pecos texas.  some days he would have too much work to do by himself, so made my older brothers and i skip school to help him out.\r\n        one day my dad was making a delivery to a convenience store on the corner of n rio st. and the main drag.  the convenience store is still there today.  it faces 285 and i10.  \r\n        that day, my dad parked his delivery truck in front of the store at an angle facing rio st. so that it would be easier for him to leave after he made his deliveries.  after he parked his truck, he reached across my brother and popped me in the chest with the back of his hand.  then he said, ���you boys ever see a ufo?���  my brother and i replied in unison, ���no sir.���  then he said, ���there���s ya one sitten over there,��� as he pointed out his driver-side window.\r\n        when i looked out of the window, i saw a giant silver object hovering over the elementary school across the street.  this object was in the shape of a boomerang and it was so big that it covered the entire school.  from my angle it appeared to hover no more than 30 feet above the school.  it looked like it was so close to the roof that someone could reach up and touch it.  \r\n       it was thick near the front and it tapered near the back like a wing on and airplane.  i noticed that it was thicker than the height of the building so it had to be at least 15 to 30 feet thick in the front.  it was solid silver like shiny mylar or foil but i don���t recall seeing any windows on it. i did notice that it had ridges on it that were spaced about 10 feet apart that went from front to back.  the bottom was not flat, it curved like a wing.\r\n       now here is the weird part about the whole sighting.  as my dad was getting out of the truck, he said, ���now i don���t want you boys standing around watching that ufo.  we���ve got work to do.���  then he just stepped out of the truck and went into the store to find out what they needed.  while he was gone my brother and i waited for him to come back and give us the list of things that we needed unloaded.  so, i got out of the truck and walked over to the drivers side to get a better look at it.  \r\n      as i was observing it, a couple of cars pulled over to the side of the street and some people got out and started pointing at it.  so i knew that i wasn���t hallucinating because others were seeing it too.  we went ahead and made our delivery, which took about 15 to 20 minutes.  but, the whole time we worked, i was disappointed because i was going back and forth inside of the store because i was afraid that it would fly off before i could get a better look at it.  but the weirdest part was how every one else was reacting to it.\r\n     as my dad was stocking the cooler, i noticed that everyone in the store was going on about their business like nothing was going on.  all someone had to do was, look out of the store window and they could clearly see the thing across the street.  but, no one seem to notice.  there were at least fifteen people milling around in the store, gathering up chips and soda pops.  then they would walk up to the cash register and pay for their items, then walk out the door and drive off. \r\n       i was puzzled by everyone���s reaction, so i decided to ask the man behind the cash register if he could see it.  i pointed out the front door and i asked, ���can you see that thing across the street?���  then he leaned over the counter to get a better look at it, and he said, ���yep!  what is that thing.���  i replied, ���my dad says that it���s a ufo.���  then he replied, ���ufo huh?  strangest thing i ever saw.���  then he just rung up the next customer and went about his business like he didn���t even care.\r\n      now, needless to say, his reaction totally blew me away.  i was seeing something phenomenal and i felt like a kid in a candy store.  unlike everyone else, i was excited and i wished that i had a camera so that i could take pictures of it.  if i had a choice i would have even walked over to it to get a better look.  but everyone else was going about their business like it wasn���t even there. even my own dad was acting strange.  because, once we made our delivery, he just got in the tuck and drove off to the next stop.\r\n      i remember being so disappointed because the direction we were heading would take us away from it.  as we drove east down the main drag ( hwy 285 ) i noticed the traffic coming toward us.  i thought that the occupants of the other cars coming toward us would see it as they approached it.  i looked through the rear view mirror on the side of the cab to see if any cars were pulling over to the side of the road.  then to my surprise, i noticed that none did.  so, i was really blown away then.  that is why i never forgot this unusual event. because of the way people in fort stockton were reacting to something so extraordinary.  but it didn���t end there.\r\n     even though i was astonished at the way people were reacting and i was disappointed because i had lost site of the boomerang, my disappointment didn���t last very long.  as we were traveling east toward our next stop, i glanced out my window and i saw another one to the south of us.  from my position i reasoned that it was hovering over the junior high school.  then once again my excitement soared because i felt like i was experiencing a national geographic moment. but my dad just went on about his business, and the citizens of fort stockton went on about their business too.  \r\n     my own brother was even acting strange.  every time i tried to get him to look at it, he would just say,   ���daddy told us not to look at it.  so, i���m not looking at it.  if you want to get in trouble, that���s up to you.  but i���m not looking at it.  i don���t want to get in trouble.���  he knew that it was there, but he refused to acknowledge it.  yet it still didn���t end there.\r\n     as we traveled east to make our deliveries from stop to stop, i would search for gaps between businesses and buildings just to get a glimpse of it.  but, as we got further away, i finally lost sight of them.  yet once again, my disappoint didn���t last very long.  because i saw another one further south as we passed main street.  the only thing in that area was the main hospital and a trailer park off south 285.  \r\n      now, here is the wildest part of the whole story.  it usually took my dad a whole day to make his deliveries.  he started early in the morning just as the stores started to open then he we would finish around six o���clock in the evening. which meant, that these boomerangs were hovering over ft. stockton for at least half a day.  yet there is more.\r\n      my dad���s last stop was a gas plant about 30 to 40 miles outside of ft. stockton.  i can���t remember the name of the gas plant, but it was on the highway that heads east towards bakersfield.  anyway, as we traveled east i pondered everyone���s reaction to the boomerangs and i couldn���t understand why everyone was acting so weird.  \r\n       then as we drove down the highway, i glanced outside of my passenger side window and once more, i saw another one.  it could have been the same one that i saw over the south of town or another one altogether.  in any event, this one was pacing us.  but this one was farther away.  it flew less than a hundred feet off the ground and i judged it to be at least a mile away.  i looked over at my dad and i wanted to point it out to him, but i changed my mind and kept it to myself.  so, i nudged my brother in the ribs and pointed it out to him. but once he saw it, he shook his head no, as a warning to me, then he continued to look straight ahead.  i watched it for awhile until we started to out pace it.  then i eventually lost sight of it.  yet it still didn���t end there.\r\n       as we entered the gas plant, there was another one hanging over the plant.  this time, we were so close to it that there was no denying it or it���s size.  it was huge.  it was at the very least, the size of a football field and the thickness of a two-story building.  once again it hung over the plant no more than 30 feet high.  it was so low that it looked like someone standing on a catwalk could reach up and touch it.\r\n     but this gas plant was more than just a gas plant.  the people that worked there, lived there in their own community.  that is why my dad made deliveries that far out.  once again, my dad warned us not to stare at the ufo because, we had work to do.  so, we went about our business loading and unloading until we were finished.  \r\n    once we were done, we climbed back into the cab of the truck and i watched my dad prepare his bill.  then once he was finished, he said, ���i���m gonna go back inside and have a cup of coffee and settle up.  i want you boys to sit here till i get back.  and i don���t want you watchin that damn ufo either.���  so, he stepped down from the cab and walked into the office.\r\n      the truck was parked facing away from the boomerang, so the only way i could see it was by looking out of the rear view mirrors attached to the side of the cab.  i was fascinated by it and i wanted to get out and take a closer look at it, but i was afraid that my dad would return at any moment. so i stayed in the cab as he had ordered and observed it from the rear view mirrors.  my brother on the other hand, just reached under the seat and pulled out a magazine to read.  \r\n     i was shocked by the way he was acting and i needed to reassure my self that i wasn���t just seeing things.  so, i asked him, ���don���t you see that thing out there that daddy called a ufo.���  then he glanced out of the window and said, ���yeah, why?���  then i said, ���well, it���s a ufo, but everyone���s acting like it���s not even there.  don���t you even care about it.���  then he replied, ���yeah, i care about it.  but daddy told us not to be watchin it.  so, i ain���t watchin it.  if you want to watch it that���s your problem.  but i don���t want to get in trouble.���  then he just continued to read his magazine.\r\n      needless to say, there were a thousand thoughts running through my head.  all i could think about was how everyone was acting.  i knew that i wasn���t hallucinating, because my brother had seen it and my dad had seen it.  then there was the cashier at the convenience store and the people in the cars that pulled over to the side of road to get out and point at it.  then i thought ���oh god!  they���re taking them all.���  even though i had never even heard of anything remotely related to abductions in my life, i believed that they, who ever they were, were taking every one, including my dad. \r\n       then i remember thinking, ���if they are taking everyone else, then why aren���t they taking us?���  so, i thought a lot about what had transpired over the last few hours.  but eventually i too got bored because my dad was taking so long to come back to the truck.  so, i grabbed a magazine and started reading one myself.\r\n       then my dad finally walked out of the office and climbed into the cab, and first thing that i noticed was the look on his face.  as he sat down and started the engine, he looked absolutely terrified.  then as we backed out to leave, i noticed that the boomerang was gone.  now, this is the scary part.\r\n       my dad had been gone for at least two hours before he returned to the truck.  as we drove back toward ft. stockton  i could still see the fear on his face and he never said a word. so, out of concern for him, i asked, ���daddy, are you ok.���  then he replied, ���i���m fine.  i don���t want to talk about it.���  he said ���i don���t want to talk about it,��� as though he thought that i knew exactly what he had gone through.  \r\n       now, my dad was no wimp.  he stood six foot four and he was as strong as an ox.  one day, he knocked my brother completely off the top of one side of the truck, just by tossing a case of cans up to him.  he rode horses full out just like the cowboys did in the westerns.  he would lean forward in the saddle, while holding the bridle in his teeth, then whip the horse on the rump and gouge it with his spurs just make it run faster.  \r\n       in my whole life i had never seen my dad afraid of anyone or anything.  if anyone was afraid, it was me and my brothers.  when he said jump, we jumped or we got a beating with a belt or a board.  but that day, he was terrified and his fear bothered me.  i felt as though he had been taken against his will, and i couldn���t imagine what had happened to him.   \r\n       i have been carrying this phenomena with me for over thirty years and i never forgot it.  the only reason i am coming forward now is because of the debunkers and skeptics that spout off their opinions every time someone sees something extraordinary that they can���t explain.  people have been seeing ufo���s for years and they are still seeing them today.  but just because a skeptic hasn���t seen one or had an experience themselves, they come up with explanations that are even wilder than the sightings themselves. \r\n     what i saw cannot be so easily explained away, it wasn���t a blimp or a weather balloon, a cloud inversion or swamp gas.  our military didn���t have the technology to create crafts that defy gravity without making a sound and their wasn���t a mass hysteria by the population.  in fact, it was never even mentioned in the media.  i had intended to ask my class mates the following monday after i went back to school, but i completely forgot about it.  yet i searched the news paper every day for weeks for any kind of story remotely related to what i saw.\r\n      so, today i am looking for anyone that lived there at that time or had parents that might have been witnesses themselves.  the implications of what i saw could be frightening or exciting, depending on how you look at it.  if what i witnessed was real, that means that every one of those kids in the those schools are adults today, and each one of them may have stories of their own.  instead of debunking and denying this sighting, the government should jump on this story so fast that it would make your head spin.  i went public with this story at the first of may, 2007. then someone else came forward because they remembered the same thing happening to them while they lived in mineral wells texas of the same year.\r\n       i can be emailed at sticks109@iwon.Com or sticks109@gmail.Com   your story will remain confidential unless you allow me to use it.  i will not give out your name or any private information you share with me.  i am only looking for validation to what i saw and hoping that more people will come forward without fear of ridicule.   thank you for your cooperation\r\n
