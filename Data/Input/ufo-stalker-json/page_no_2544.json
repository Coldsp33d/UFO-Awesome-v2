morning. on saturday at about 7 pm, i was walking out to my car to get a sweater when i saw this thing in the sky. it was pretty close i think, but still above the trees. it was moving and spinning slowly, heading towards my right. i was startled and confused at first and wanted to take a picture, but our camera was still inside so i took two pictures with my camera phone before it passed behind the roof of the house. i ran around to the other side and was yelling to my husband to come out. we came around the other side and saw it just as it was going down behind some trees. he didn't get a good look at it, but he saw enough to convince him that it was something really strange. we decided to take a drive around the area to see if we could see it again, but we never did. we didn't see it the next day either. since we were renting the cabin for the weekend we didn't know any nearby residents but i would bet at least a few other people saw it. it was very visible and very strange looking. i was definitely a little freaked out but my husband didn't seem very bothered by it. he was more interested in it than scared. he wanted to drive around a lot longer trying to find it than i did! =) it didn't make any noise except for a very, very faint sound that is hard to describe but sounded like something vibrating. we both heard the sound although just barely. it moved in a very straight line when it went over the house but when we saw it on the other side of the house, when it was going down behind the trees, it made a very sharp turn. it didn't move like a helicopter or airplane, it was very \"exact\". we did see one person on our drive who was a few blocks away taking a walk and asked him if he saw it, and he said no. then we asked him if he heard any weird noise and tried to describe it as best we could, and he said he might have but he wasn't sure. by this time it was at least 20 minutes since we first saw the thing so who knows.\r\n\r\ni talked to some

the liqour store. when i'm in the car i always scream ufo to see what my mom thanks of it. she always tells me thats not a ufo you don't have high chances of seeing a ufo through out the whole world. just give it up. so tonight when we were at the store at spring glenn jacksonville,fl as we were coming back towards jax beach on beach blvd. i saw a strange figured-shape going in a rather strange direction very aquirdly.It had about 5 white lights at the bottom side. and 1 that flashed white at the bottom.I said mom what is that she said where i said right there by the trees she said i think thats a plane. i said mom look how can that be a plane when its traveling faster than us not that but getting further ahead of us she said i don't know. i had a feeling that this was no type of man-made or earth like aircraft. so i looked at it carefuuly one more time and saw that it went in a perfectly straight horizontal direction.Then it slowly tilted as if it were trying to fly sraight thrugh the ground with speed increasing trees were in the way of my sighting so it dissapeared. if this was a plane why didnt it have red or blue lights. if this was a blimp why did it travel so fast. if this was a helicopter where were the blades to it.If so a jet why so gigantic. i'm not sure hat it was and it couldn't have been a crash because nothing blew up. it wasn't a landing because there were no airports in the next 30 miles or so it was about half-a-mile away from us.What was it and why did it not come back up?     \r\n\r\n\r\n1.I was in jacksonville,fl on beach blvd.\r\nat the time i was looking in the sky\r\n\r\n2.What made me notice the object was the fact that the lights were so bright it caught my attention\r\n\r\n3.I had no idea of what the object was i thought of all possibilities but all were eliminated\r\n\r\n4.The object was sort of like a long vertical diamond\r\nit's motions were different from the usual aircrafts i see it went a straight line across then started to tilt in a diagonal angle as if it were trying to strike the ground\r\n\r\n5.My feelings were very odd i felt as if i was being watched by something beside humans\r\nmy reaction was stay calm and study the object harder while you can after the sighting i couldn't think of what it could have been\r\n\r\n6. i lost sight of the object unfortunately because of tall trees this is not a hoax,fake,or any type of joke sometimes people joke around but theres just things like these in life you just dont joke

heading back home which was about a mile from home, right in the clear blue sky on the right appeared this huge craft in the sky, dark brown in color with windows going all around it,there was one woman standing in front of one of the windows as it hovered about a good two hundred feet above the trees, as we were riding in our car i asked my wife do you see that and she said yes, it was so huge and magnificient, i never seen anything on this planet like it before as it hovered over the trees not making a sound and no wind was stirring at all from this huge craft, the tops of the trees didn't move at all, as i sped up to get a better view of the huge craft,i had some trees that blocked our view for maybe 5 seconds as we was clearing the trees with great anticipation to get a better view the huge craft had vanished without a trace. we are a christian family with strong christian values, and when i tell my story of what we saw people really don't believe but i know what i saw and my wife know what she saw,and she does'nt like to talk about it and seems like she's a little different since it happened but we know what we saw. i've been searching the web to try and see something that looks simular but to this date the closest thing i come across is the one this site here.Http://webpark.Sk/ufo.Htm. it looked to be that size with some of those features. i feel that more time had passed than what we could remember but i'm not sure, it didn't dawn on me to look at my watch for the time we were so in awe, but at times i feel more had taken place than whati can remember. after we had encountered it i just remembered being tired,and going to bed early that night. we told some family abuot it but not much was said or done since.In school i used to be a fairly good
