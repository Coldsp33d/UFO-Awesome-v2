took me about five minutes to get to the location where i observed the large, about 25'-30', round black circle hovering above the trees. it was about 1/4 mile from my observation point.\r\ni was leaving my subdivision and the street i was driving on makes several curves before it reaches the main n/s street, 72nd street. i spotted the object as i was about to drive around the last curve, the sighting was no more that 5-6 seconds. however, during that time period i could see that the object was not moving relative to the trees. since it was march the trees were just starting to bud and i could see through the tees and observed the roofs of several homes, so i knew that the object was east of 72nd street where the homes were located. the object was about 20'-30' above the trees, which were 5'-10' taller than the homes. the wind was about 10-15mph, however, i didn't see the object moving relative to the homes or trees. the object was not a weather balloon, airplain, helicopter, hot air balloon, and i didn't see anything that looked like a teather attached to the object. it should also be noted that about 100 yrds to the north there is a power sub-station the furnishes electricty to about 1/3 of the city of lavista, about 1000 homes.\r\n\r\nafter i rounded the curve the object was gone. i didn't make any attempt to try to locate it. i later contacted the lavista police department & the faa. the spokeperson for the police department said that there had been no calls about the object.  the faa spokesperson said that no such object had been sighted or seen on their radar.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

object(oval)hanging over my house about 150 feet in the air. it was about 20 feet high and 15 feet wide--camouflaged against the dark night sky. no lights at all. definitely trying to hide itself.\r\ni called a couple friends out to the porch and it was so hard to see--that they had to follow my finger as i pointed at the object. we observed it hanging there for about 5 minutes. suddenly the bottom of the craft lit up with a swirling kind of energy source. (if i recall it was red yellow and green) although the sides of the ufo were not lit--the reflection from the bottom lights enabled us to make out portholes that went around the craft.\r\nthe ufo hung there--lit up--for about 5 seconds then took off slowly. we could not hear any noise-total silence. it then accelerated at a terrific speed towards malibu,ca and about 30 seconds later--it looked like a star as it grew smaller and disappeared into the northwest sky. it did not disappear behind any mountain--but high in the sky--into the stars.\r\n\r\ni called the weather bureau and they had no other report of a ufo. i also  checked the next day papers and nothing was there. i never heard or saw any report about this incident. i never ran into any other person (besides the 3 of us) that witnessed this. this amazes me as it took place in west hollywood,ca--at an early night hour--just a quarter mile from the main section of sunset strip--one of the most populated streets and areas in the country.\r\n\r\nhave you ever got a similar report about this incident? i wish i could recall the exact date but i cannot.  summer of 1969 is the best i can do.\r\nthanks,\r\nwayne hagstrom

sky.  but let me say this,  these lights were very bright.  they were so bright surely someone else had seen them.  i am not sure of the altitude, but i would guess the object was about 100 feet in the air.  \r\n \r\nhow long i viewed it?  well, i stepped outside and the lights caught my attention, i noticed 2 lights close together. i don���t know how long they had been on but they were the 2 lights on the top.    i thought, my gosh those planes are too close they are going to crash.  but also thinking those are some bright lights.  i walked into the grassy area of the yard (about 10 feet) to get a better look and that is when the 3rd light below the 2 on top came on.  i at that second thought \"what the heck\"  and it was at that point the other 5 lights came on.  i quickly (maybe 5 huge steps) went inside the doorway and yelled for my husband to come quick.  i turned back and looked at the lights and they went out.  unfortunatly my husband did not see it at all.  i stood outside, walked around looking in the sky only to find nothing, not a plane, not a star, not a cloud.  nothing at all was in the sky.\r\n \r\nthese lights were so bright, i am surprised that no one else has mentioned it or that it was not on the news.  i watched the news that evening and in the morning and nothing was mentioned.  nothing in the paper.  has anyone else reported this sighting?  i

(he had heard my stories about the ufo's i have seen and many times came in and said i saw a ufo grandma! well this time was different!) he practically pulled me out of the house i knew it was a different reaction from him and knew i had to hurry or it would be gone. as i ran out the door i could see his sisters and three of the neighbor kids pointing into the south eastern sky and exclaiming there it is there it is! i looked and saw nothing then all the sudden i saw it, a gray disc with three round lights or maybe reflective metal at first it was more of a side view the disc would appear and then disappear it seemed as though it would ascend and move over to the left or the right about thirty feet away from where it last appeared and then it would appear and disappear.....It seemed to be playing peek a boo with the kids... i saw it from the underside it was circular and seemed to have five lights around it, or circular reflective metal spots that resembled lights, it had a design on the bottom of it that consisted of what i believed to be five loops, topside of the loop by a light, they seemed to be something moving on the underside the loops maybe. i ran into the house and got our binoculars to get a better look when i came out and put the binoculars to my eyes i amazingly pointed them straight at what looked like the same ufo or another one that was carrying or attached to a long white rectangle that was long ways hanging down, also it seemed to have no shadowy areas and sizewise i thought it to be as big as the quest building ( a high rise) attached to this ufo that looked exactly like the one we were watching , it seemed to me that while i viewed through the binnoculars i could hear the kids saying there it is!! there it is! like they were seeing the same thing they saw before i came out to look and interestingly enough none of them said what is it carrying now! which amaized me also. i don't think they saw that for some reason. the ufo that i saw through the binnoculars that was carrying the white rectangle seemed to be desending and then just disapeared. my impression was that the other ufo the first one the one the kids were watching attached to the bottom of the one i saw in the binnoculars the one with the white rectangle. if so i believed this to be a white spool of thread. i believe it lasted for about 15 minutes that we were out there viewing this sighting.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":6946,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7449736,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05012007-0009","longitude":-104.9770134,"occurred":1176847200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Square,  Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1176847200000,"summary":"There was a ufo disc shaped it was appearing and disapearing and would reapear about 30 feet from where it appeard and seemed to be assending and dessending i got my binoculars i saw what looked the same but with a huge white rectangle attached underneath","tags":["ufo","disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/6946_submitter_file1__threadspoolufo.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/6946_submitter_file2__threadspoolufopencildraw.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Denver, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:468201"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Niagara Falls","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This case is from new york state within 20 miles of the niagara hfalls military base. the witness was with three others (father, sister and a cousin)in 1979 as they sighted a glowing orb-like orange light streaking across the sky in a northeast direction.All felt the object sighting was not was not a military craft.It appears that two military jets were scrambled within a minute of the sighting and took off in the direction of the object. all four witnesses felt the jets were following the object. they followed the object with the father doing the best he could to keep up until the objects and the jets were out of sight. the sighting was of short duration. even 28 years later the sighting will come up as the family discusses other events like the phoenix sighting. the witness has not answered any e-mails nor made attempts to contact us to discuss this any further.

object. i was riding as a passenger, so i had the luxury to watch it travel at a quick, but not impossible speed, for a typical aircraft. its path was a very straight angle from the upper left area of my field of vision toward the lower right, with no obvious deviation. it was broad daylight in a blue sky with sparse, full clouds, so i could see the object quite clearly, with my vision obscured only by distance. since it was quite far and my visual impression of it wasn't perfectly clear, i dismissed it as nothing but a commercial plane, likely a 747 judging by apparent size. i remember noting mentally, though, that it was strange for a jet aircraft to not leave a vapor trail, but also dismissed that, since that's what i saw, and assumed the absence of vapor was due to whatever climate conditions existed locally relative to the object. convinced that it must be mundane, my attention momentarily wandered to focus casually on other scenery, but then i glanced back a few seconds before the object was about to pass in front of the only nearby cloud directly in its course. i was very surprised when the object instead passed behind the cloud, as judging by distance and speed i assumed it was much closer than the cloud, and wouldn't be flying at such a high altitude. my attention was now fixed, and i mentioned it to my friend who was driving. i explained everything in detail, and he watched with me, we were both paying attention, hoping to get another look when it should clear the cloud and emerge on the other side. even though we watched with fixed attention for several minutes, the object never appeared again, seeming to have vanished while behind the cloud. we watched long enough that the cloud (which was drifting gradually in an almost directly opposing course to the object) eventually moved beyond the approximate point in the sky where the object passed behind it, and the cloud had mostly dissipated by that point. both of those factors: the position of the cloud, and its dispersement, meant that we were satisfied that there was no possibility to reestablish visual contact with the object. my friend, the driver of the vehicle, never actually established visual contact with the object, but knows me well enough to know that i didn't fabricate or exaggerate any part of what i told him, so there's no doubt in his mind that i saw exactly what i described. even though there was nothing particularly strange about the object aside from its seemingly unusual shape and the fact that it never emerged from behind the cloud, it left me with a very intense sensation that i can only described as unsettled, and somewhat excited.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6938,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9983949,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05012007-0001","longitude":-84.4871637,"occurred":1176328800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1176328800000,"summary":"Light

was a disc shaped object hovering in front of us.We exited the vehicle and stood on top of the car,starring at this object in amazement .About 30 seconds later their was another car that pulled up behind us,the guy stepped out of his car and starred at the object. i was feeling confused,scared,and numb.No one said a word. i couldn't believe what was happening!The object made a very low sound like when you put your ear against an florescent light,and a very low humming noise.The object hovered in the same spot for roughly one minute,it started to move very slow off the street,and started heading towards the trees.All of a sudden the large ufo vanished!We ran into the car and drove to our parents house,we ran out the car to the front door and knocking hard to get in.When my mother opened the door we almost knocked her down. i was crying,confused,and thinking that something was going to happen to us and the world.We ran and closed all the blinds and windows and hide in a room.We were looking out the window to see if the object was going to return. i was thirteen years old when this occurred,and never really told anyone about this event until i hit my late 20's,and now i can't

much quicker than any type of an insect or even a bird.  there movements appeared to me to be thoughtful, and indicative of intelligent beings.\r\n\r\nthey were aware of me, or so i thought.\r\n\r\ni don't remember exactly how long they were there before they attempted to communicate.\r\n\r\ni was not afraid, but rather seemed calm and intrigued.  i don't think this would have been my natural reaction.  i think that somehow they were able to prevent me from getting to fearful or excited.\r\n\r\nat some point, i heard a telepathic communication (inside of my head) that they wanted to communicate.\r\n\r\nthey specifically used the word \"commune\" which i thought had religious connotations at the time.\r\n\r\nthey said, \"we want to commune... with you.\"\r\n\r\na few moments later one of the object came around on my left side and entered my left ear.  i could feel that the object was physical.\r\n\r\nfor the next few minutes (not sure how long) i heard what i perceived to be multiple high-pitched voices inside of my ear.  i was unable to discern anything specifically that was communicated.\r\n\r\ni am also not sure how long this took place.\r\n\r\ni think that i went into a trance of some sort, durring the majority of this \"communication\" and don't remember more than a few minutes of it.\r\n\r\ni estimate that i came out of the trance a couple of hours later.  the two light-emitting red objects were still in my vicinity.\r\n\r\ni went to bed, and went to sleep and did not see them the next day.\r\n\r\nhowever, that night, one of the objects appeared in my room again, momentarily, before exiting the room, {apparently} by entering a fluorescent light tube that was turned off at the time.\r\n\r\ni have not seen them since, and although at the time of the event i regarded this as an extra-terrestrial event.  because this experience differed from the common descriptions of close encounters that i was aware of, i was reluctant to report the event at the time that it occurred.\r\n\r\nrecently i was reading a book called the watchers by ray fowler, which indicated that a lot of reports are atypical of the \"common\" ufo report, especially contact reports.\r\n\r\ni perhaps would never have reported this event for i am not looking for publicity or anything like that but through the years i realise that i have no idea what or who these things were, what their intention was, or what (if anything) they did and for what reasons?\r\n\r\nin short, i have no clue-- and i would like to know.\r\n\r\ni felt that in reporting this event that perhaps you may be aware in your investigations of similar experiences that others have had, and i may be able to learn more about these many questions that i have about the event.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":6931,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6489716,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04302007-0010","longitude":-117.9089689,"occurred":767689200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":767689200000,"summary":"Two luminescent unidentified flying objects appear in my home and make contact","tags":["contact"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Costa Mesa, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:468216"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2545}
