our backyard in lawn chairs with our sony handycam. supernightshot was used. we notice a lot of air traffic as usual to the west of our house. living next to camp lejeune we are quite customed to seeing a lot of traffic. i was in the military for 7 yrs. i know my aircraft. it was about 1035pm a civilian jetliner was in the air about 25-30 thousand feet. then about 5-10 thousand ft below it was what we thought was another plane. then we noticed it was on the same flight path as the one above it. we then both remarked how it had no lights blinking. no red no blue no strobe. just solid white-ish glowing orbs. two of them not quite side by side. this double glow was beneath it like it was staying hidden. however it was not flying as fast as the jet. it was just sailing along. i zoomed in and tracked it for about 20-25 seconds till it was blocked by my roof. seeing this gave us a state of awe. we neither could explain to eachother or ourselves why some thing so bright let alone two of them so close together would be flying so low. we know camp lejeune is restricted airspace so that limits all of the little craft. i would say it was the same size as the airplane about 50-75 feet long flying at about 17000ft. we have been seeing a lot of different things in the last month here. lots of flashes in the sky lots of very fast craft. not military not civilian.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"10:35:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

down and directly parallel to the interstate coming straight at me and it flew overhead about 200 ft from the ground tree top level.  it was the shape of a basketball with what appeared to be in pearl metallic grey with no lights whatsoever, the only way i could have seen it was because my headlights may have reflected off its surface. it had to have flown down and past me at an amazing speed of 500+ miles, and caught a glimpse of the object for only a few seconds.  it looked like it was going to impact my windshield and i had began to duck as if it were.  i felt a great fear as because of the speed and precise maneuver it had made to descend from a parabolic angle to become parallel with the interstate as it traveled from west to east at speeds i cannot describe. there was no impact as i looked in my mirror for something to happen.  the object appeared to look like a round pearl grey ball with grainy contoured lines and perhaps orb like and did not light up or glow, with an intent on getting somewhere fast.   my first thought was this a probe?? i am a truck driver and had seen over 2 million miles, and this was the first time something like this has caught my eye.

point rd. and sebastopol rd. in the city of santa rosa ca. heading north on stony point rd. as i approached the intersection i noticed the object in the sky. at first i thought it might be a kite but it moved at a steady speed and course and appeared very rigid. i could not see any string or anything else attached to the object. it was totally silent. it was light but the sun was not up all the way. the object was opaque/clear. it was wedge shaped. a long tapered wedge. the outline of the entire object appeared as a very thin line. if it were a foot long the front of the wedge was about 2.5 inches tall and tapered to a point at the other end and maybe 5 inches wide. i���m just guessing that it was actually between 10 and 20 feet long. the front of the wedge was a very bright white light. it appeared as though the front of the wedge was cylinder shaped a glowing cylinder. i am just guessing but it appeared to be fairly close, within a hundred yards or so. i have no way of knowing its' actual size so it's hard to say how close it was. i would say it was 30 or 40 degrees above the horizon and that aspect changed as it got closer to crossing above the road in front of me (maybe a more southeasterly course). by the time it crossed the road i was at a stop light watching. i believe there were two other cars that i noticed one facing south opposite of me and i think one in front of me that made it through the light. the speed of the object seemed fairly slow, maybe 5 to 10 mph (just a guess because i don't know how far away it was). i watched it head to the southeast towards what would be the community of redland. this was totally 180 degrees from when i first saw it. the light turned green and i watched it over my shoulder as i continued home. that���s it. not very exciting

the mess hall. as i waited in line i was gazing at the skyline before me (the back of boystown faces the passiac river and newark) the area is much a higher elevation than newark, so the view was great. as i looked up i saw a full moon to my upper left and settled my gaze on that for a moment. the sky was clear for a december evening...No haze or clouds. \r\n         i saw a \"dot\" fly from the left side of the moon and that caught my attention! the \"dot\" got bigger and bigger by the second and it was clear to me and everyone else that this \"dot\" was a fireball!\r\n         within less than a minute it was flying in to my left and was as big as a house and flying an altitude of what a jet looks like when approaching to land. it vered a little and seemed to find a \"path\" to fly the rest of it's flight.\r\n         my thought at the time was \"this can't be a meteor because it's flying horizontally\" i always thought meteors came in on a diagonal and smashed into the earth. this fireball was flying at an amazingly slow speed and i thought \"how is that thing staying in the air\"?\r\n         as the event ended there was a lot of talking in line by the guys waiting to go to dinner, and we were told to settle down. needless to say it was the talk of the night and the next day.\r\n         the next day the radio said it was a meteor, and also joked that they received calls that people called it a ufo and even said they saw windows in it. that was 1965, here it is 2007 and i still remember it like it was yesterday. i hope one day the truth of my experience

out of nowhere i noticed a very bright, metalic looking object in the northern sky. i noticed it because the sky was so blue, and it looked at first like a plane coming into tucson at a definately wrong angle and it had its landing lights on.  i rose out of the pool, and viewed this object which semed to be hovering in the sky. if you were to stand, and raise your arm in a hitler type salute, this would be the angle. \r\n\r\nin my estimation it was the size of a green pea held at arms length. it seemed to be spinning in a very slow speed. the sighting seemed to change from a shiny chrome body with the sun bouncing off the left side of it, where the sun was in the sky to a more satin or brushed silver appearance. then it would go red in color, only to repeat the patern. i watched it for approximately 2 minutes before i called my family out. they too saw the object and first stated it might be a childrens ballon. but, after watching it for an additional 5 minutes, it never moved from its position in the sky. it would just slowly spin. i ran inside our home and grabbed a camera. i took 4 photographs and only captured the object on one picture. when viewing the object on the digital it had lost its shine and color, and only appeared dark metalic grey. but, it did still hold its shape. after we watched the object for approximately 3 more minutes it simply disapeared. it never moved from its location. there was no drift in the sky. i can say this because it was between two trees and we watched movement between branches. no movement, no sound.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"    on friday, august 4, 2006, at approximately 11:30 pm, i was driving west along ocean boulevard in long beach, ca.   ocean boulevard runs in an east-west direction along the shore of the pacific ocean, as the city is a south-facing beach, situated in a small notch in the southern ca coastline.\r\n     i stopped my car and parked on lindero avenue and crossed ocean boulevard to bluff park, a railed off cliff that overlooks the ocean.  i enjoy watching the ocean, the oil islands and this area, which is three blocks from my home.\r\n    off to my right (west), i noticed a white light approaching from the san pedro/los angeles ports.  at that distance, it looked like a helicopter shining its searchlight straight ahead.  while i had never seen a helicopter flying that high, it was the only thing that came to mind.  the light moved at the speed of a small plane, descending rapidly from very high up to almost ocean level as it approached an area maybe 1.5 miles offshore.  i feared it was indeed a small plane or helicopter crashing into the ocean.   instead, at a height i estimate as between 15 to 25 feet (difficult to tell at that distance and at night), the object stopped!  it just stopped on a dime!  i then realized this was something different.  the object then turned a blue color and hovered in place for what seemed like 20 to 30 seconds.  no spotlight as such came from it, though it did illuminate the area underneath it with its blue glow.  the area it hovered over was beyond the small oil refinery island and breakwater, which would put it about a mile and a half from shore.   i estimate it was about 12 feet high by 20 feet long, but i realize the distance and dark make that just a best guess.\r\n    while hovering, it also rotated and each side had a row of solid (not blinking) blue light.  it is more accurate to say that it appeared to me to be rotating, since the strip of light would blink off for a second and then reappear, creating the impression that it was rotating.  after about a half-minute, it rose very slightly [maybe five or six feet?], and tilted so that i could see its underside and shape better.  the light from it went from blue to white again, and the outline was definitely triangular, with (perhaps) a small concave area along the \"back.\"  after it tilted, its color went from white to orange-red, and it literally zipped off south, towards catalina island [and past it, i imagine], as it rose steadily and at a steep angle.   i am not great at estimating speed, but it seemed like it went from a mile and a half away to way out and far out in a split second.  i have never seen anything go that fast, except for perhaps a shooting star.  it was amazingly fast.  and that was it.  \r\n   other than it quick stop and quick take off speed, it never made any sharp angular turns that i saw or anything like that.   from the time i first saw it to the time it was gone, it had followed a very wide, open v-path:  from high in the west to the water surface and then back on high to the south.   with time, this incident has caused me a mixture of anxiety, depression and an odd elation.  i really want to know what this was, but i know i never will.  i have taken to going to the shore at night with binoculars and my digital camera--it has become an embarassing obsession.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

about two hours, it did not change the place but looked to move toward little bit, little bit far away from our place in two hours.\r\n\r\nwhen i was watching same red and blue and white in 2006, was

astronomer and have seen all kinds of (explainable) ���things��� recorded through scopes and camcorders, including objects thrown by someone into the scopes field-of-view, animations added later, etc. when analyzed, these can be detected. \r\nand i don���t have the time or desire to fake something that i think is as important as the possibility of advanced life visiting us.\r\n\r\nok, that said���  \r\ni was attempting to use different filters and attachments for these daylight conditions without much success as achieving good focus on the moon with the rapidly deteriorating conditions were getting impossible. that���s why the moon is out of focus but that put the object a little more in focus.\r\ni was recording 30 second clips of the moon passing through my fov in an 8��� schmidt-cassegrain when at 18 seconds, an object streaks by. (i wasn���t looking at the video screen at that time and started slewing the scope down after it passed) i saw the object when reviewing all the clips from that session.\r\ni have captured many (identifiable) objects through a scope and camcorder; planes, birds, satellites, balloons and even some guy���s radio controlled airplane that looked very much like a full size plane because of its distance. \r\n \r\nall of these objects have their own characteristics such as; planes leave a heat signature that lingers for several seconds in its wake. wings, tail and fuselage are detectable. and the contrail in the right conditions, not to mention lights. not only that, all air traffic at that time was well below my fov and could be seen without optical assistance. and the flight paths run diagonally to this objects direction.\r\n \r\nsatellites captured with this scope can clearly see solar panels. they pass by slightly slower too, making them easier to identify. and the shape and outline of satellites are even more defineable possibly because they are outside the atmosphere.\r\n \r\nbirds flapping wings. unless the bird is \"seagull size\" or larger, they look like dark, blurry, small \"sticks\" streaking by and much faster. they also have to be close to be detectable at all. if at a great distance, their characteristics are more defineable and they don't leave any detectable air turbulance.\r\n \r\nthis object is interesting to me because it doesn���t have any of the characteristics of the ones mentioned above.\r\ni estimate its altitude at 45 to 50,000 feet based on air traffic seen below it. \r\ni estimate its distance from me to be a minimum of 10 miles knowing my scopes capabilities. the moon was about 40 degrees above horizon.\r\nif these figures are close, then the object could be 10 to 30 meters in diameter depending on its actual distance.\r\n\r\nthe consistent sun reflection along its top edge suggests a metallic skin. \r\nthere is also an odd dark area near the center of the object.\r\nit almost looks like a hole. when zoomed-in, it looks like you can see the moon's features through the \"hole\". i don���t think it���s a shadow because the sun is behind the scope and to the left and slightly higher than the moon. a shadow should be forward (the direction it���s heading) and slightly left of that position. \r\n\r\nit also leaves quite a bit of air turbulence after passing by signifying it���s in the atmosphere, however there isn���t enough distortion for it to be a heat signature. jets, large and small leave a blast of hot exhaust for several seconds in its wake.\r\n \r\nat 30fps, the object was captured on 7 frames. the first frame, only shows the front edge and the next frame was duplicated. so only 5 frames show each new position.  \r\nanyone with video software can break down the video into frames.\r\ncropped from a 30second, 650mb avi file. available on cd free but i would need a mailing address.\r\nanyone wanting a

at the street corner and was about to cross howard moving towards to the south and i looked up into the sky and i immediately noticed a very bright, white light slowly moving accross the sky. i stopped at the street corner and did not cross the street when i first sighted the object. it was in the south, very high in the sky; i estimate at least at an eighty five degree angle from the south horizon. it was moving to the south west and after two seconds of observation the light appeared to slowly shut off but i noticed it became much dimmer; it turned into a faint but clearly visible star and continued to move accross the sky towards the south west; it moved mostly to the west and only slightly in the direction of the south. it passed just to the south of the moon and saturn by a few degrees in the sky which allowed to have a rough guess of it's brightness which was clearly much dimmer than saturn. i observed the object for about 15 seconds and then it became too faint for me to see it. it was walking down forth street towards my destination which was whole foods market on forth and harrison. when i first noticed the object i knew right away it was something unusual because of it's color. i have watched airplanes for many years and they mostly have yellow lights and always have a flashing light but never use their search lights when they are very high in the sky but only turn them on when they are in a few miles of landing and less than a mile above the ground. this object appeared to be very high in the sky above five miles above the land. my feelings about the object were one of surprize; i was suprized when the objects luminosity was drastically reduced; it was almost like the sun going out during a solar eclipse; the object slowly turned off it's very bright white light and there was a very big contrast and loss of light in the sky. i don't believe airplanes fly blind without bright lights at such a high altitude. the starlike object was very faint after that and i lost it in the sky as a result after 15 seconds. it was as if a high flying craft had a powerful spot light and then turn it off. the object clearly had a light of some kind and the faint light was definitly a electronic light of some kind as well and not the sun's reflection which would only be visible if the object was high in orbit like a satellite but it was not that high. it was still moving too fast to be a satellite. i believe i saw a similar object in late october 1999, but even though that object was as bright it was not still visible after the bright light went out. the sky was clear without clouds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6899,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.6942541,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04262007-0002","longitude":-122.4676579,"occurred":1177484400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1177484400000,"summary":"Very

see what it was.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be like a very bright fireball which passed over me from about 15 degrees south of due east travelling at a very high speed. it continued on in a straigt line passing out of site to about 15 degrees north of due west. the time it was in site was between one and two seconds.\r\nas it passed out of sight, it appeared to light up the horizon to the west with a bright orange reddish glow for an additional 1-2 seconds.\r\n\r\ni don't have an idea of its altitude, but it was low enough to seem as if it were following the curvature of the earth as opposed to be coming straight down. \r\n\r\ni do not remember hearing any noise associated with the object.\r\n\r\ni have always assumed that this was some kind of meteor which it may well have been,
