(note: it's a very large, choppy lake, so no ripples would be visibly cast and were not mentioned, nor did she mention any bobbing in the chop). it stayed there for a number of seconds, then ascended slowly, accelerated, and ���shot straight up��� and out of sight. \r\n\r\nshe spoke in a quiet tone and gave me the impression as if she was almost a little embarrassed to share the story, but again, casual about it. she ended the account by saying dismissively, ���i don���t know what it was.��� and dispensed a shrug. she did imply during this conversation that many of the employees have their own experiences. as she spoke, i got the impression that her attitude was that in this place with such a conspicuous, immersive, impossible-to-ignore sky that occasionally seeing something ���strange��� is just kinda bound to happen eventually if you work and live here.\r\n\r\ni know a 2nd-hand report is unusual and less than ideal, but this witness lives basically off the grid, and had no particular interest in the phenomenon, so i wanted to get it on record. in retrospect i wished i had pressed her for a little more detail, but didn���t think it was appropriate at the time. the previous night, while gazing at that crystal clear, star-blanketed dome that betrayed to us every single little chunk of trash parading above, i couldn���t help but think, ���well, if ufos are real and one got anywhere near this place, you sure as hell wouldn���t miss it.��� i think the unassuming, down to earth folks that work in this place are probably quite aware of that too.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

(16 yrs.) was telling a story about some guys using a flash light to communicate with ���ufo���s���, but i did not take it seriously because it seemed somewhat simple. despite my rejection of his idea, he got a flashlight anyway. so as we lay for about 2 minutes after his comment, there was a flash thousands of feet up. my younger brother noticed it, and then we all noticed it as it flashed again. it was directly and perfectly at our zenith as we lay stationary in our position where it was an indicator that it was meant for us. of course i questioned it before i made that conclusion. it was a white flash thousands of feet up in the air, but i told them that we have to be critical of what we see, and skeptical to every degree as the ���ufo��� subject is a taboo one and is always susceptible to misidentifying objects in our sky. in the preparation of our night to see what i saw last night, i told them to observe all the craft in the air for a better comparison of when the objects do show themselves again, or if they do.\r\n\tthe night before the lights indicated they will make themselves shown to me again and that is why i brought witnesses the next night. i did not bring my video camera because it is just a handy cam that only records blackness at night and doesn���t ever record the moon very well when it���s a full one. so as we looked at the flash that occurred every 11 seconds directly above us, i told them to wait and see if it moves into any direction that would indicate it was a plane with a flashing light. i thought it could have been the space station (maybe) or a satellite that happen to give off flashes every 11 seconds. as time went on, all indications showed that most likely it was neither of my guesses that i proposed. this object was defiantly signaling us, so i grab the flashlight that my brother had and signaled back. i signaled it out of sync with its signal, but after a while i decided to copy it at the exact time it signaled us. it was stationary and exactly every 11 seconds it would flash which lasted a total of 5 minutes. my brother t.J. said that he was going inside because it was making him uncomfortable and he would be a witness if we got abducted, but i reassured him that it was just a flashing light and he should not worry because it is only going to get better and i didn���t believe we were going to get abducted.\r\n\twhen the flashing stopped, 2 minutes past and 3 lights in perfect formation in equal distance from each other (one next to the other) came down out of the sky and were moving in a southeast to northwest direction. the size of the lights was as big as a star. when it came closer, the lights went out and the 3 objects where 500 ft. above us without any lights and the shape changed as it came down to something bigger (this is not unusual since when you get closer to something it gets bigger). a good comparison would be that of a car without any headlights that would pass by on a dark street which you would only see the car but you would have to look closely to see what kind of car it was. so when the 3 lights came down i pointed it out to my brothers with excitement, and we observed it as it went on its path. again the difference between objects that we are familiar with that fly in our air, is that they seem mechanical in movement rather than a natural way of moving. the three objects seemed as big as a basket ball which would make them as big as an suv if observing it close up, 500 ft above us, with no lights, and a white surface that seemed like a oval shape but not exactly (it was a very unique shape), also it made no sound at all which then moved behind our backyard tress, which they still were visible, the moved towards a cloud. the objects were visible for 30 seconds, and then it moved behind a cloud. the expectation of it following its direction was very high, because why would anyone expect anything else if it was an ���ordinary��� flying object.\r\n\tbut as the expectation of it exiting the cloud was high, it never exited the cloud. i stared at the cloud as it moved away; making sure that it was not going to exit it. the clouds were about 500 ft above us moving swiftly across the sky in this chilly somewhat breezy night. if it was a bird that was as big as an suv moving into a cloud, you would expect it to exit it, but it never did. my 16-year-old brother saw it but my youngest did not because of him needing new glasses. you would have to have your eyes adjusted to the night sky, and to have been on surveillance to see what we were seeing. from my first sighting to this second night sighting, everything happened in a synchronized fashion for it to be meaningful and it leaving out chance or a mistake of identity when pertaining to these objects. it was amazing. after my first sighting i started contacting news agencies in my local area and organizations that dealt with this stuff or not. i am 100% sure what i saw was ���out of this world��� and it happened twice to me; one night after the other. people that i have contacted have shunned me away, told me i did not see what i think i saw, and that they would call me back but never did. i don���t blame anyone not to look deep into it because how can anyone prove it happen, or didn���t. i went out the next night with my siblings and did not encounter the objects again, but i can feel this is not the end for my sightings.\r\nif they went through all that trouble to show themselves twice to me, which rarely happens to individuals that do see something like i have, then why not again another night? i don���t think of my self as special in anyway, but that these craft showed themselves to me where others have never seen one. some will swear to have seen one and it ended up not being one, but all you have to do is talk to the eyewitness to understand the state of mind that they are in. so what i am purporting is that i am a reliable eyewitness to an event with a unique nature such as this one. if you don���t believe me, then just meet me. this life is interesting, and interesting things happen. i am just glad and honored that i got to see what most people have never seen, and enjoyed it with my brothers. i just feel that the last 2 days was a way of letting the world know through my 2 sightings that we are getting closer to the day where the boundaries that we have set for our own kind will be broken, and we will truly embrace freedom.  this is just the beginning, and i am glad for it. my story, along with other stories of ufo���s is not a new one, but mine is a unique one that should definitely be looked into by people that have good intentions, and the resources to do it. but truly i don���t even think we have to go far anymore to get answers, because the answers to this mystery will be coming soon. \r\n\t

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"4/23/07\r\n\r\ndavid edelen\r\nmillbrook, al. \r\n\r\n\r\ndear sir,\r\ni am a correctional officer with the alabama department of corrections and work at one of the prisons in elmore county, alabama.  this morning several other officers and myself observed an odd phenomenon.  what we saw appeared to us to be some sort of cloud which upon closer examination appeared to be some sort of flying craft hidden or, to use a term from star trek,  ���cloaked���, so as to be unseen.\r\n\t\r\nbefore we are laughed off as nuts, let me explain the whole story as it happened:   it was around 8:00am and was the morning count time and i was a dorm officer.  my dorm partner and myself counted ���a��� side of the dorm. then as she went through the ���cube��� in the middle of the dorm to go through to the other side i went outside to go along the sidewalk to the other side to count. as i was walking along i felt a sudden blast of wind or breeze and felt sand stinging my face. i thought; what in the world? it is a nice day, where did that come from?  i looked in the direction of ���b��� dorm and saw a low wall of dust coming towards me as if propelled by some unseen force and when it hit me i had to shield my face and eyes.  it was not really a high wind, but just propelled along by some force other than high wind if that makes any sense and when it hit me it felt very cold or extremely cool. \r\n\t\r\ni looked up to check the sky wondering if some storm was blowing in out of nowhere. but to my amazement the sky was mostly clear, but something immediately caught my eye when i looked up.  a dark sort of a dirty grey cloud tinged in pink was going over at a good clip.   but what struck me as odd was not only the fact that it was close to the ground, maybe a couple of hundred yards, but that it was going along at a fast pace, much faster than a normal cloud, even in a storm, but also that it was shaped so funny.  i wondered about such a strange looking, lonely storm cloud to be skipping across the country side at such a good speed all by itself in an otherwise clear sky?!?  \r\n\t\r\nas i stood and stared at it for a moment as it flew along over the \"camp\" (slang name for a prison) it i noticed a group of officers, ���yard rovers���, standing in the prison yard a hundred yards away watching it intently also. i then turned and went on into the dorm to continue our count. but others watched it until it was out of site (see below).\r\n\t\r\nbut it was shaped so funny that it stuck in my mind for the next few hours and sort of worried me like something nagging at the back of your mind. it was as i said a dirty, very dark grey like a storm cloud and had a pinkish tint in places, especially along the underside. it was not shaped like any cloud that i have ever seen. it was almost like a big wedge the size of two or three houses end to end, the pointed or narrow end to the front, the aft end sort of flat or squared. and above this aft end was a section of it, of ���cloud��� ,  that was sort of like a diamond or triangular shape, almost reminding one of the tail section of a rocket or plane. all along it and especially the aft end of it were sort of like tendrils hanging along being tugged at by the air as it went along, as if the vapors were being sucked off by the passing air or wind and being constantly rejuvenated.  sort of like, if one can imagine it, a block of dry ice flying along with its vapors enfolding around it and flitting around and from it with the wind.  that stuck in the back of my mind about how it looked to me. then a bit later a single word came to me, ���artificial���!  that was what i was trying to think of , what was nagging at me!  it had almost an artificial look to it!!  maybe i have been a ���trekky��� too many years, studying space travel, reading up on and being a fan of things like ���star wars��� and ���star trek���.   but the terminology on star trek used for the technology for a space ship to able to hide from radar and from visionary detection, basically being able to become invisible at will, is called a ���cloaking device���!  something similar is what the united states was trying to perfect with the ���philadelphia experiment��� during wwii. that experiment failed as far as i know and cost the military some lives.\r\n\t\r\nbut not wanting to be laughed at i kept all these thoughts, uneasy feelings, and observations to my self for fear of being ridiculed. but as it turns out i was not the only one who had witnessed it!\r\n\t\r\nlater, as the day was winding down, and i having forgotten it,  three of the yard rovers stopped in our dorm on their rounds and sat down to take a slight pause, or break, to rest their feet and began going on about something..  it dawned on me that they were chattering about the same thing i had seen!  but they had more to tell;  one commented on the coldness that hit them, and how without any real high wind a wall of slight debris and sand came at them also, sort of along of and in front of this so called ���cloud���.  they agreed that it was sort of like the ���fore blast��� in front of a helicopter or hover craft of some sort, but not as violently thrown as a helicopter does.  someone else asked if anyone else noticed the orange plastic barrier to the construction area sort of just wrinkle up and roll up and over into a ditch, but with no real high wind to make it do so, just that sort of uncanny cold air and slight breeze that went along in front of the ���cloud���.   \r\n\t\r\none officer was asking did the rest of us notice how the so called cloud, or cloudlike substance around it,  kept folding in on itself, sort of like renewing itself or something.  another officer said that she thought from the beginning that it was some sort of secret, or even alien, craft in some sort of disguise and that when it went on over them she intently tried to look at the back of it to see if there was the ���back��� or aft end of some sort of craft visible.  she said that the cloud, or vapors, just boiled down and over the back of it hiding the rear end, with the same tendrils of vapor or cloud that i had seen trailing behind it.   \r\nand then they all agreed very excitedly that when it went over and across the open area of the prison that the ���fore blast��� of breezy dust and all preceded it and when it crossed over a tree line of tall trees the tops of those trees went crazy jiggling and swaying very fast back and forth, and as soon as it passed this movement ceased.  \t\r\n\r\nthat last bit of info sort of puts me in mind of the reports that at so called ufo landing sites it has been found that the molecular structure of plant material in the area had been changed or altered! \r\n\t\r\none of the rovers said that he had been going to the back-gate at the time to let in the ���farm squad��� inmates. he chimed in and said that he had seen the same thing and now that he thought of it he agreed with all that they said. and he said that when he let the farm squad inmates in the farm boss asked him did he see that odd looking cloud flying fast across the camp?  this farm boss more or less saw and felt the same things too.  of course by then i had chimed in with what i saw, my observations, and my feelings.  \r\n\t\r\none of the officers, who is very interested in science, space travel, etc, as i am asked, ���officer edelen, did you get the definite feeling that it was a craft of some kind, somehow ���cloaked��� or in some kind of disguise?���  i readily agreed and we all more or less agreed that whether it was an alien ufo of some sort of a top secret craft of the united states, it gave us all the impression that it was a craft of some sort in some sort of disguise.  i of course even commented that i had read reports of alien craft that were not of solid material atoll but were known as some sort of plasma craft, possibly craft capable of traveling inter-dimensionally.\r\n\t\r\nit does indeed appear to have been just that; some sort of artificial anomaly, or some sort of craft:\r\none;  it was flying too fast,  two;  it kept a set course until out of site,  and three; it retained it shape until it was out of site.  and four; one officer commented that she had studied its shadow for a moment.  she said the shape she had seen was not the obscured shape of an edgeless or uneven edged cloud but the definite shape of a hard craft of some sort. \r\n\t\r\nand then they all agreed that they had seen  three air force jets, one behind the other, flying way up above the ���cloud��� but along the exact same course as if they were following it, hunting it, or possibly monitoring it.  at that time we called channel 12 news and asked if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the skies over elmore, autauga counties. the guy i spoke to said that at that time they had received no such reports.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nnow these officers that saw this: i have right at14 years in with the alabama department of corrections, and the others on up to near 20 yrs and over.  they all three are mature men and women and very serious, professional correctional officers, not given to flights of fancy and delusion and are trained both by not only apost certified correctional training but also by the training and intuition that years of service gives you to spot anything unusual and out of the ordinary and keep a level head while doing so, and to be able to mentally keep notes while doing so. \r\n\t\r\nand to top it all off this evening a 2nd shift supervisor called me at my home asking about the ���sighting���, that some of our 1st shift officers that were working overtime on his shift had commented on seeing what we saw along with several inmates. i told him what we saw and he concurred saying that is what others there had told him. \r\n\t\r\nso i am tendering this report in the hopes that perhaps someone might find it interesting, might even already know about it, or to see if others have reported any thing similar..\r\nsincerely yours,\r\ndavid middleton edelen ii\r\nmillbrook, al.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

out into my backyard and absorb the night sky and relax. i haven't gone out in almost a year to absorb the beauty of the night sky, but today was the day that i will never forget and will never regret for doing so. as i stepped out into my backyard my eyes were trying to adjust from the computer that i was staring at for sometime. i lay on the concrete floor and relaxed to enjoy the night sky. i live in a city where lights do obscure most of the sky when one stares out to the distance from ones zenith. i am a college student at my local community college and have taken astronomy and other sciences to give me the ability, to some degree, to determine what has validity and what doesn't. i routinely have helicopters and airplanes fly over my house, but what i saw this night was not such. \r\nas i lay for about 5 minutes, the stars in the night sky became much clearer. i was telling myself how i must get away from technology, such as the internet and t.V., for starters. i told myself that i need to go out on a regular basis and take in my surroundings, and as i finished that thought a light came from \"out of the sky\" and into my view. it moved swiftly and at a very steady pace. i was waiting to see some flashing lights and to hear some sounds to determine if it was a plane, jet, or anything that i can relate it to, but it never hear or saw it. i have 20/20 vision and in all my life i have been great at detailing anything and everything. as i boggled to determine what it was, i noticed that it seemed as if the lights where joined. as i finished that thought, it split up into three different lights. the light (then lights) were moving in a southwest to northeast direction. when the lights broke off from each other, the middle one did not stay in formation and pulled closer to the one left of it. this showed me that it was in control and showing off to me. it was so beautiful that it now feels like a dream.  \r\n\tthe perimeter of my backyard has trees and when it reached that area, i was still capable of seeing it very well. then a fourth light came out of \"nowhere\" and started following it as well. the middle one kept on moving back and forth from the center of the formation towards the light left to it. this was obvious to me that it was letting me know that it is what it truly is, and that is beings that have technology i have never seen. the lights kept its speed and that's when i told myself that i still have time to get my fourteen-year-old brother to enjoy this fascinating and boggling experience. i say boggling because when describing it to someone else, that is all that they would be capable of comprehending. truly i was not boggled but sure that there are other people like us out their, with fascinating advancements in their civilizations. it���s like describing the sunset to someone, but they would have to see it to truly know what it feels and looks like; a picture would not even due the sunset any justice and neither would seeing a photo or video of the ���craft��� i had seen. as my brother hurried towards the backyard, his eyes were not adjusted to see what i was seeing. i felt alone in enjoying this, but none the less it was beautiful. as my brother was out in the backyard with me, only three were remaining heading towards the northeast sky, and eventually the city lights obscured it from total sight as they moved apart from each other, where the middle one stopped moving the way it did towards the left light craft. \r\n\tthe lights were like that of a medium star that you would see in the night sky, but it did not pulsate or give off rays, (as if a kid were to draw the sun where rays are being placed around the sun) such as the stars exhibit at night. the light was oval shaped but not totally, it seemed like a solid light but not emitting light out wards (it's as if the energy of the light was contained in its structure), and it was definitely thousands of feet up in the sky.  i know that we have bad depth perception when estimating the distance in the sky at night, but i have looked at objects fly over my house at night, so i have some confidence in my statement. also the estimation has to be drawn by how big the object was, so if i were to guess the size, just one of the lights that split up had to be bigger than a conventional airplane. there were no other planes or conventional objects in the area. it did not move in a straight line in the southwest to northeast direction, but swiftly and naturally. the main word is ���naturally���, which was the way they moved. my brother went on playing his video games, but i am changed forever. i have studied and researched \"ufo's\" all my life, with the disclosure project research and other sources under my belt. \r\n\tif i were to tell someone my background in what i know about\r\n\"ufo's\", i think it would add less creditability to me, but since i know so much about it, subjectively i have a better chance at determining what i saw. i ask myself, \"why am i so special to have these lights tell me to come out and see them move so naturally and beautifully\"? they wanted me to see them, they wanted me to do what i have been meaning to do, and that is to go back outside, and meditate, and get away from technology like i have before. this was my goal that night and the sighting was a confirmation. this sighting was meant to be personal and even though it was a confirmation of what i should do personally, they came with an obvious message that was given to me, just as the message to go out that night and look up at the night sky. the message that they wanted me to give is that, \"they are definitely here and they are almost ready\". i don't mean to be so dramatic but this is my truth, my reality, my life, my experience and overall this is fact.\r\n\ti immediately started writing about it to get everything that i saw and felt in detail so it will not slip into memory. i just really hope i was not the only special one this night so that this can be collaborated on by many other eyewitnesses. thanks for your consideration to take my account seriously. allan.  (i am attaching pictures but it is not of the objects i witnessed. it is just to spark your imagination of my surroundings and where i saw it and where it went)","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":6880,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.7588218,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04242007-0001","longitude":-81.2941794,"occurred":1177269000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,  Square,  Rectagular,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1177269000000,"summary":"Light splits into three and another comes from nowhere","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/6880_submitter_file1__Watching.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/6880_submitter_file2__Zenith.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/6880_submitter_file3__NE.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Sanford, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:469309"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Vevay","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I encountered one of these triangular shaped ships while i was stationed at soto cano airforce base in honduras in 1998. i was part of a marine unit that was down there providing hurricane relief after hurricane mitch hit the country. it was amazing and i never would have seen it if i had not been lying down on a picnic table looking up at the stars while i was on base. it flew low about 200 feet off the ground and made absolutely no noise and it went right over me at a speed of about 40 mph. i knew immediately that it was a ufo. i didn't bother telling anyone because i didn't feel anyone would believe me. it's interesting to know that there have been similar sightings around the world. the only lights that this ufo had were 5 white lights. one light at each corner, and two lights in the middle at the edge of each side, i did not see any red light in the center. it was hard to judge the size of this ship. the one you have in your photo for this story looks a little different from what i witnessed. this was a complete isoceles triangle and there were no curves in the sides. the 5 lights were much smaller, about 1/4 the size of the ones in your photo and not as bright. there was a very bright moon that night which made it very easy to observe it's shape. i watched it as long as i could until it went out of my sight. that memory has always stuck with me and i'm glad that i was able to witness one of these crafts.

potato field, with a forest on the other side. \r\nit was a beautiful spring evening,  and so, i decided to sit outside on my porch, without any outdoor light, listening to the nearby river, and gaze at the sky. the moon (although not full) was so bright, and it seemed as though every star in the universe were right before my eyes (they illuminated everything. i could see  everything around, very clearly). \r\nbut there was one in particular that didn't look at all like a star. i was on the telephone with a friend, who lives in the city. i was decribing to him what it looked like up here, when all of a sudden, the object caught my eye (in the same place as before - i'll explain later), moved very swiftly from one point to the next stopped, and then, would go back to the same distance(about 2 to 3 miles west of me). i was telling my friend (who knows a great deal about these things - as a matter of fact, he was the one that referred me to your site). we we're on the phone for (at least) 40 minutes, and it remained there the entire time - going back and forth, and pulsating (actually more like a quiver). \r\nthis is not my first time seeing this since i'd moved up here from manhattan,  to the country 3 months ago. i saw one for the first time on, monday, february 11th, 2007, at 12:21am, when (while turning down my bed),i heard this strange humming sound, that i'd heard on several other occasions, after lying down in bed (i would discribe it as more of a \"pulsating hum\"). i shut off the lights, and drew back the drapes, and i immediadtely saw it (or one) in the very same spot(s), swooping from side to side (at 3 to 30 second intervals). i immediately phoned my friend (the same friend that i was speaking with during the second sighting). i phoned him on his cell (so, as not to wake his wife), and i got his answering machine. i left a message as i stood there transfixed.  i stared at this opject for 5 minutes, before running into my foyer, to grap my binoculars, and ran back, raised the glasses to my eyes, and got a glimbs of it before just to off, so fast it was hard to tell which direction it actually went in. i went, and stood in my front door (kept the porch light off)looking out into the darkness of my yard, and drive down to the road, (mind you; there are no street lamps anywhere, and the only light cast is that of the moon, and stars, when they're out), when all of a sudden the entire yard lit up with a very soft light. it was as though a helicopter passed over with a flood light. but; this was absolutely, positively, certainly not a helicopter\", because there was no sound of prop's, or engine, not flying dust, or gust of wind, just that pulsating hum,  (most importantly) the light was not harsh (like that of a helicopter flood light), but very soft (like the light from a soft pink light bulb)making the snow on my lawn look like pink sand. it just passed over. my friend got my message and rang me back about ten minutes after it all occurred. and he said to me, \"i was wondering how long it would be, before you saw something. i had heard on the news about sightings in you area, two-weeks before you moved into that house!\"

aspects, and can easily identify most of them on sight. i also have a degree in physics.\r\n\r\nthat said, i was putting my son down for a nap when i saw what appeared to be a very long, bright white fuselage of an aircraft heading due south at subsonic speed, approx. 20 miles away (which would put it close to the coastline). i was looking out my son's west-facing window. the object was at approx. 10,000 feet, moseying along. upon closer examination, i noticed that the bogie had no tail or wings, and was about 6-7 times longer than a 747. the white cylinder presented great contrast (and was subsequently easy to track) against a sky that was perfectly clear and blue. there was no contrail or sound. i eventually lost the object behind a 50-foot redwood.\r\n\r\nthe object had caught my eye as i'd seen another object travel the same \"air lane\" two weeks previous, moving very fast at high altitude; i thought twice about the speed and altitude, but eventually dismissed it as a jet. i

like i was being watched.Just a odd feeling that some thing was not right.When i got my footing on the ground i looked straight up and saw a huge white ball.It almost looked flourecent.Thats the only thing i can come close to describing the color or light.A very clean pure white light.I really could not get a grip on what i was seeing.I new it was not a planet or a star.All the sudden it shot straight up.With a speed that my mind could not even comprehend.Then all the sudden it stoped.Then darted to the right back to the left and then shot straight up again till it was out of sight..I have had 3 other sightings in my life.Yes i admitt i was very shaken up. my heart was pounding. i came back in and sat down.I think most of all i was jarded by the speed and the size.Like i said it took awhile for my mind to even comprehend what i had just saw..So on this one, i finally said ok this is it.We aren't alone and we never have been.I have no doubt now.The experience has litterally altered my view on so many levels.Sorry this took so long to post.I did not know of the website.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was working at kawartha downs in the kitchen when at around 730 i went out for a break. it was a very clear sky. lately when outside i've been watching jets spraying chem-trails over peterborough so i have become accostomed to looking up alot. i noticed a jet first and then a flash of sunlight in the air caught my eye above it 30000 feet aprox. in total. the jet underneath was at half that. when i looked up i saw a huge silver round disc directly above the huge parking lot we have. it was slowly moving east slightly tipped forward. there were so many people around but no-one would look even though i was gaping mouthed and pointing and shouting ufo. i found it so f'ing strange that nobody would look at first.\r\nfinally a security guard came over and i showed him at this point it had drifted east at about 1 third the speed of the jet noiseless but i could hear the jet. if held at arms length it was the size of a small coffee saucer and real high up so i thought it was huge!!! aircraft carrier size.\r\nwe watched with like 5 others until it disapeared in the eastern horizon. 7 minutes elapsed total..........I was already looking up its like it appeared all of a sudden and flashed in the sun silvery metal. the way it moved at first was strange it was as if it gave 3 little bursts of speed at the beginning. i told everyone at work and people generally believed me. i am a 29 year old cook and have never seen anything like this................It was massive. the appearance was silver round tipped at a -15 degree angle and soundless. i was excited as hell running around trying to get people to look. after i ran around telling everyone  i had just seen a ufo for real!!!!!!!!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6867,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3088031,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-04222007-0001","longitude":-78.3196559,"occurred":1177209600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1177209600000,"summary":"Saw

a no smoking policy when the kids are in.I noticed this object as soon as i stepped out of his front door as it was so bright and asked him to have a look,this object was the most unusual colour orange and it was pulsing as it moved across the sky slow then quickly,at this point we were joined by pauls daughter chloe who is 9 years old,she also witnessed this event which scared her.I am an amateur astronomer and i know what meteorites satellites and planets look like,, it was about the same size as a jumbo jet but round and the nearest thing i can liken it to is a firework rocket just as it explodes but caught in freeze frame and pulsating without exploding,, i must stress that this was no firework at all.It went from south to north and across newcastle airports flight path then instantly vanished.I have been in touch with the british astronomical society and am waiting for a reply back,i nor my friend have ever seen anything like this it was weird,really weird.An orange transluscent pulsing object is what the three of us seen,it was no aircraft and whatever it was there was no noise,totally silent.I would estimate it flew at between 3000 to 5000 feet.If it was higher then this object must have been huge.I am in utter shock at seeing this as is paul because we just cannot think of what this is or could possibly have been. yours graham
