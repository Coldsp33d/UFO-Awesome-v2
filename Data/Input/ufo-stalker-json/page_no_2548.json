in the evening i saw a flash out of the corner of my eye. when i looked i saw a bright silver circular shaped object flying north and not at a very high altitude ,but  way up there all the same. i watched it for about 20 seconds and it just vanished. my husband was outside but he didn't see it. when i first noticed it , it was shining very bright like the sun was reflecting off it there was a plane flying at a very very high altitude to the left of it.The plane was flying southbound. the plane was putting out contrails in a dotted line pattern,for lack of a better way to describe it. i've been seeing this thing for years. most times when i have a daylight hour sighting of it , it will dart out from behind a cloud and then back behind the cloud really fast , it is almost as if it knows it's been spotted. but today the only cloud cover we had was the contrail clouds , some in lines beside each other and some x like patterns. we have those all the time here in tuscaloosa also. anyway i watched it for about 20 seconds and it just vanished right before my eyes. if anyone knows what these things are feel free to e-mail me. i have tried to get local authorities and the local airport to check into and they have written me off as a nutcase. i am 37 years old i have no desire to be noticed over this and i am not looking for money or fame . the fact is it scares the hell out of me thinking that something is flying around up there and no one seems to care. i won't be flying anymore , it's not safe because these things sometimes seem to follow the air traffic that fly's over here leaving or headed to  the birmingham airport. when i see them it gives me a really really bad feeling. i started watching the skies in 1993 when i saw a reddish orange and silent object fly right over the tree tops beside my house. this silver thing is also silent.And at night it sometimes not always though shines a very intense white light in a sweeping pattern towards the ground. i really scares me and to me it is a ufo because i do not know what it is . it looks nothing like anything i've ever seen in person or on tv.

smoke. my girlfriend and i were looking up to the north and i was showing her how to find the north star by running a line off the lip of the big dipper's ladle. \r\n\r\ni suddenly saw a moving light in the right(east) corner of my field of vision. i assumed it was a satellite and looked over at it to get a better look as i usually do when i spot a satellite. once i had focused on it, i realized it wasn't a satellite because it was low to the ground and there was three dim reddish lights in the shape of a triangle. the object was moving at a high rate of speed comparable to a snowbird or blue eagle jetplane passing overhead. i know this because when the snowbirds are in town they have to fly over my house to get from the airport to the lake where they perform their act. \r\n\r\nat this point i was confused as to what i was seeing and excited by the possibility of what it might be. i immediately spoke up in an attempt to get everyone's attention and get them to look at it. since my girlfriend was already looking up at the big dipper and the object was moving in a straight line through her field of vision, she quickly saw it and was as excited as i was at seeing something so strange. \r\n\r\nas the object passed directly over us, i noticed how it made absolutely no noise. i found this strange considering it was so low and moving at such a high speed. normally aircraft, planes and helicopters alike, produce noise, and at that level it would have been very loud if it was a jet. also, the object was small, as it would have been hidden behind my fist held in front of my face at arms length. when the object was moving past directly overhead, i noticed that as it passed in front of a star, that i could still see the star in the center of but it was a blurred image, as if the object was semi-transparent.\r\n\r\nwe attempted to point the craft out to our other two friends but it was quickly heading off in an eastern direction and they were not able to locate it. when the object was about a quarter mile away, the three lights began to spin in a clockwise direction, then the began to zigzag in and out from the central point. suddenly the three lights all merged in the center and then vanished. no sight of it was seen after that. my girlfriend and i were both very excited about what we had just witnessed and began describing it to our friends in as much detail as we could. we both had the exact same desciption of what had happened.\r\n\r\nunfortunately this all occured in the span of roughly 20 seconds or so, and there was not enough time for any of us to run in the house and find my slr or my video camera. it's a shame because my video camera does high res video and i would have got a great video of it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6858,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.4978,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-04202007-0011","longitude":-81.0018,"occurred":1176959100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1176959100000,"summary":"Low

noise came from the object, and the sky was clear enough for me to watch it as it went all the over the trees behind my house. it stopped, glowed bright white, and then it was just gone. it vanished.

was a formation of lights. there were 5 of them in a line at about a 45 degree angle, as if an airliner was banking in front of us with an array of lights on it's wings. the center light was the brightest. we followed the same direction and watched as the craft banked north to our left and it's bottom faced us. what we both saw was a triangle of yellow lights with a white flashing light at it's rear. as it headed north, light after light went out until there were two blue lights at it's tips and then it disappeared past the trees faster than we could keep up with it. i spend a lot of

venus setting over the horizon from my deck.  i was planning on experimenting with photo overlays as i just purchased the new adobe cs3 and am new to photoshop and was going to use this series of

and venus setting over the tree line. \r\n\r\non the 6th photo, as i opened the shutter, something flew into the frame from the right.  moving right to left.  i immediately thought this was an airplane and it was going to ruin the shot.  i decided i would wait until the object moved across the frame and immediately take another one.  unexpectedly, the object just disappeared.  there was no evidence of it anywhere, the object only made it as far as what is seen in the photo and then nothing, i scanned the sky and no planes were visible anywhere in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nby all rights this should be an airplane as this would be close to the flightpath of planes going from seattle to portland (horizon \r\nair flys these).  the only thing that made this strange was its sudden disappearance shortly after the shutter closed.  also, in reviewing the photo, the flight path doesn't match up to the normal path of the seattle to portland flights  (in hind-sight, i'm wishing i had set a quicker shutter speed setting).\r\n\r\nthe photos attached are unaltered.  the .Cr2 format is in raw directly from my canon camera, while the .Jpg is converted directly from photoshop.  the time

on my horses, on our 3 1/2 acres in collins, mo., because one is close to foaling.\r\nwhat made me notice this was a bright red light that caught my attention at tree level, just north east of our property. there are frequent helicopters flying over our house because we are in line for the life flight from one small hospital to the bigger ones in springfield, mo, but this was not a helicopter. \r\ni tried to dismiss it as an airplane, but there was no noise and it was as bright as the cell tower lights south of our property. then, a few seconds later, 4 or 5 bright orange lights started lighting up from left to right (about 1 second each) and going out about the time the third light in a row lit. that was a little north of the red light (as though it was moving very slowly to the north). then the orange lights lit up again, a little farther north but not very much, (if i had to guess how far they were from the first red light i'd say they moved about 10 feet? over a period of 5 seconds? with each lighting. \r\nthis time there were 5 or 6 bright orange lights. these went left to right too, only the last couple, sort of went around the object, as though it was a circular object. \r\nthese orange lights were, i thought, sort of computer looking more rectangular than the ones on the 16th. i did see them from a different angle than the ones my husband and i saw on the night of the 16th. if they moved north, as they seemed to with each string they moved very slowly. \r\nthese lights did the same thing that the first set of orange ones did, they went out about the time that the third light was coming on. i ran to the house to get my cell phone, hoping to take a picture of it, looking back as i ran to see if it was still there, and it was not. i check my horses every 30 min to 1 hr, and kept looking but it did not come back. i was alone that night, because my husband is a truck driver. i was excited to see it,but a little frightened because i was alone.\r\non april 16th though, he was home and he saw the lights with me. we got our video camera out just in time to catch the last couple of times it lit up, but couldn't get a very good shot at it. my husband was filming in night vision on the first light that he caught,(which was the last two strings that we saw) and didn't get the focus very well. the light showed up as white, on the night vision setting.  the next shot he got was on regular vision and he focused in on the last two of a string of four of the orange lights just before they went out. \r\n\r\n     the sighting of april 16th was virtually the same thing as i had seen the week before, red light started and went out, then the orange lights began lighting up left to right, then one time they lit up right to left. also the lights looked more like orange fireball shaped flares but they didn't go up or down or anywhere but out. \r\nagain they lit up left to right, about one second apart at first ,but, on one string of them  they lit up a little faster and went in the direction like it was going around an object, and the last few lights in that string were closer together (my husband said it was like the lights were forming a sort of arrow). \r\nthis night, april 16th, the sighting was longer, more light strings (that's what they seemed to be doing, stringing left to right, with a little curve at the end), and some differences in the color of the lights.  \r\nthe first ones were in the north east again, they didn't seem to be moving north like the ones on the night of the 9th, there were different amount of lights in each string, one having three orange lights, and one having one, and one having 9 or 10 (the one that my husband thought looked like an arrow, it pointed ese)almost like a code. \r\nthen we saw a little later, more yellowish orange lights with with more white forming a string of three lights straight east of us (these ones are the ones that showed up white in the night vision shot). then 4 more orange lights more in the north east again (these are the ones that he got a shot of the last two lighting up,(as though there were two ufo's signalling to each other really close to each other or one very big one with lights going in the south end and the north end at different times) nothing made any noise!\r\nwe could not see the source of these lights at all, but, it blocked out the lights that usually sillouette the tree line east of our house. that would be about 1/2 to 1/4 of a mile span. we could not see any stars in that area, and usually we can see a few dim ones. the source of these lights would have had to be black, big and flat, if the lights were coming from a craft of some sort.\r\nthen my husband saw a red light in the timber behind our neighbor's house which is east of us (closer to the ground) i saw a white light at the time he saw the red one closer to the ground in the timber. then the last thing i saw, which no one else saw, was an orange fireball shoot right over the roof of our neighbor's house (east of us)from ssw to ene.\r\nwe had put the video camera on the charger by that time and my father and mother-in-law had come to watch the light show. they got there too late to see anything except what we had taped. this sighting lasted about an hour. then it just stopped, no noise, no lights nothing.\r\ni did hear though the next day, that someone who lives east and south of us several miles also saw weird lights in the sky about the same time that we saw these.\r\nneither one of us has ever seen anything quite like this before.\r\ni have seen the big black triangle thing with the round lights on each of the three corners while driving a truck at night, and i have seen a very long silver \"rod\" shaped cylinder over my father and mother-in-law's house during the day several years ago, among other things. but not that anyone else ever saw at the same time that i did, so i never reported them. this time, there was another witness, and we got it on video.\r\ni don't know how to attach video clips or sketches to this report, but i did call the st. clair county sheriff's dept. and reported the sighting of april 16th and what i thought was the previous sighting of the \"thursday\" night ones that i saw alone. i keep a dated and timed hour by hour diary of my horses progress through the last stages of her pregnancy,i had writen what i saw in that diary. after giving copies of my notes of those lights sighted on april 9th (still thinking it was the previous thursday) i realized that the date that i jotted it down in the horse diary was april 9th. one week to the day before the april 16th sighting. \r\nthe deputy mr. couch, didn't take the tape because he said that there wasn't enough on the tape to show anything. i told him that this wasn't a joke, after he said he didn't know what he was going to do with a report like this, and declining to take the video tape. i'll never report things like this to the sheriff's office again in st. clair county. i told him that i wasn't a kook, that i was an rn. and that i knew the sheriff, and the officer in the next small town north of us, and that they knew me personally, but that didn't seem to matter to him!\r\ni wish i hadn't called it in now!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

located at the present lighthouse museum and parking lot north side of the newport state park, newport, or. the sightings began about 2300 pm, i was not the person who seen the objects at first, we are mainly concerned during owr watch time  for things at seaward (west) and at the inlet of yaquina bay (west) in case of any emergency that may occur that the coast guard may be needed in the event of rescue efforts. there were people parked at the parking lot below the watchtower who started seeing the objects in the eastern horizon, they banged on the tower legs and got my attention, they were asking me if i was seeing them, i said no but i would scan the eastern horizon to try and see what they were refering to. it took a few moments before i spotted the objects and then i called the xo/co at the base facilities what i was observing. the co came to the tower and observed what was going on, left the tower that i was to stay on watch until notified to do something else. my watch was to be relieved at 2400 hrs but i elected to remain with the new watchman to watch the objects that were in the eastern horizon. apparently the co called the airforce to investigate, jets went to the area and they dissappeared when they were in the area but returned as soon as they left. some were of yellow color others were an orange color. some were larger than others and they move back and forth in the sky, staying in the eastern portion of the newport, or area from the park area i was at. when the jets went in the general area they went out one at a time, returning nearly in the same area after the jets went away. by early morning, around 0200 am there were quite a few people in the area, parking lot and other viewpoints to see these objects, there were as many as twelve and as little as three at a time in the eastern horizon, changing directions at various time for whatever reason.\r\n   the news media in portland, or broadcasted the event that late evening which several people drove to the coast to observe the incident(and the increase of people i seen after 0200 am in the general area) which lasted until nearly 0500am, which one by one they dissappeared from view. it was amazing to me how long they stayed in the area. i added everything i observed, as did the other watch personnel in our log books. several days later airforce personnel asked us to write down all that was viewed on prepared forms. a few years ago i went back to the uscglbs at yaquina to see the entrys, since i am a retired uscg and asked permission to see the old logbooks, which was granted, they were missing from the records they still had at the station, in fact a period of several months before and after all log books were gone and no explanation where they were. i was able to get news articles and a few people remembered the event...It was a night that has never left my memory and still cannot say exactly what it was. since i observe many things during my career until retiring it was only one of two events that i cannot explain away as normal objects i encountered during my lifetime, they were not normal in any sence of the concept of things, but an event that will never leave my being.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path

cousin \"do you see that out there?\" he said \"yea!\" i said \"i wonder what that is.\" everyone seen it too. i knew than it couldn't be no airplane or anything like that. i went closer to the road to look. and you can see a redlight flashing on it. my cousin got some binoculars, being that hes taller than me. he went stood on the road to get a better look. and he said it had a cone. so we knew it wus triangular. and he also said he can see that redlight flashing clearly. i could too. because when we'd just stare at it. that little part would really light up into red. this thing was orange, or it almost look like a carlight with a redlight blinking under it. when i first seen it i was amazed, wasn't scared or anything. i kept a real close eye on it. i remember as we walked to the road, that's when it start fading away. i was thinking whatever it was, knew were watching it out there. somebody said this might be a local satellite from a military base. but who knows. i don't know what this object was, but it sure was interesting. i watched this thing slowly fade away til it was a little dot in the sky, & i couldn't see it nomore, so i jus came inside for the rest of the night. that

was standing on the deck at my home on the east side of indianapolis. the back of my home faces south, i was facing north towards the back of my house and as i was talking to my fiance' on the phone i noticed an inbound commercial aircraft coming towards me from the northeast, on approach to indianapolis international airport, at approximately 2000-3000 feet(we see a lot of commercial air traffic both inbound and outbound since we are inside the 465 beltway). as i glanced up at the aircraft passing overhead i noticed what appeared to be an opaque boomerang shaped object passing just underneath the commercial jet, from south to north in a straight line, very quickly and quietly. the object was unlit and had no distinguishing markings.  the shape of the object was one large eliptical in the front but the wings were semi elipticals on each side meeting in the middle.  compared to the size of the jet passing over, it was approximately 1/3 the size at that altitude although i cannot determine the actual distance the object was from the aircraft. the color of the sky was a light bluish haze because of the amount of light pollution from the ground but the skies were clear and starry so the object was clearly visible. as the object quickly passed overhead just north of my home it made a very sharp right turn at almost 90 degrees and sped off towards the east in the general direction of greenfield, indiana. i lost contact of the object due to extreme light pollution on the horizon in that direction.  the entire event occurred in just a matter of seconds.  i was in shock and couldn't believe what i had just witnessed and as i spoke to my fiance' i conveyed to her those exact details. i'm a navy vet of 21 years and have seen a lot of aircraft from all the branches of the military and i worked for the department of homeland security, transportation security administration at indianapolis international airport and have obseverd numerous civilian aircraft as well and this was like nothing i've ever seen. i don't know if anyone else in the area has seen anything like this or if any reports have been made since i feel fortunate to have seen it based on the objects nearly transparent appearance.
