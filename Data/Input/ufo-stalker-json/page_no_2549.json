got our lawn chairs out and were commenting to some other people near us what gorgeous weather it was for a fire works show. as i was looking up at the cloudless sky, i noticed a moving \"star\" that appeared to be the space lab. i commented that \"the space lab must be moving directly over iowa at the time\". then while trying to fix my wife's attention on the object, it stopped! i'm just smart enough to know that \"stars\" and space objects do not stop their forward motion and pointed it out to several other people within ear shot. i continued to watch it to see if it would continue to move but \"stars\" don't just start and stop and neither do orbiting space vehicles. i must admit that it was completely dark by this time and my gaze did wander to the remaining fire works show for no more than 5 minutes. with completion of the show my line of sight was directed back to the \"star\" that quit moving and within no more than 2 to 3 minutes, it suddenly moved ....But at a 90 degree angle to what it had been traveling when i first noticed it. originally, it had moved in an easterly direction prior to stopping but the second move was directly northbound. my wife and i spoke about

something tonight because there was little league baseball at the park which made me feel like no one would of even seen the stars due to the field lights!.  well about 10, 15 minutes go by and i tell myself to go inside but to the other way around my house that way on the way in i could see that star before i go inside. alright well a soon as i turn around i start walking around the other side of my house and with the corner of my right eye i see some red pulsing lights, threw my neighbors trees. and i tell myself what the heck , and across the street my other neighbor is pulling in her drive way , and i say i don't care im gonna look at this thing. well to get a better view i have to walk to my curb, i was looking the whole way and it was so slow , no sound , just 2 red pulsing lights at the same time , it was like floating north then it make like a quick jump and shifted  directly east and the lights weren't as clear anymore i thought my eyes were straining , then as it floated away east , threw each pulse the 2 lights were getting closer together  i took 3 pulse's  for the 2 lights to become 1 light. after i saw that happen it seemed like the object was far away but it didn't look like it, it was the lights fading  slower and slower to nothing! i ran inside to tell my brother and step dad because i know i had just seem something in the sky that is rare i saw it transform who knows. my eyes were teary i was so shocked and sure and straight serious. i went back out with my step dad's video cam. and stayed outside to try to get it on tape but it never came around. this

sky (as i always do) looking for ufos'. when i saw a red baloon high up in the (as high as the low clouds maybe 1000ft) at first i thought i saw a ribbon dangling down from the balloon and said to myself \"well that one is a balloon for sure i can even see the string on it\" it was gently floating across the sky just like you would expect a balloon to do. then i took my eyes off it to see how my car was doing and when i looked back it was gone. i couldn't find it for a minute and then i saw it way far away from where it had been. and i began to get more interested in it because i didn't the wind could have blown it that far, and as i watched i notice it was no longer moveing it seemed to be stationary but slowly getting smaller. at that point i called my wife and told her i was watching a possible ufo. then it dissappeared behind a cloud. i had been standing away from most of the other people waiting for thier cars. i now moved closer to the crowd and leaned on a rail still scanning the sky which was partialy cloudy and i caught sight of it again directly over the car wash now and there was two of them. there was a woman in front of me reading a book and i said to her \"excuse i would like someone else to witness that there is something strange up in the sky\" and pointed out the two red balloons that were above the carwash (i still wasn't sure what they were so i was to embarrased to say \"oh look ufos\") and she looked up at them and went right back to book. then i remembered my cell phone camera and set it up to take pictures and when it was ready to go, they were gone, but my car was ready so i went back home. i got my camera and took my wifes car down to be washed (it took me about 40 minutes home and back) i didn't think it would still be there but it was and i got these photos and a short video.\r\nif you zoom in on these pictures you can see an aura around the balloon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(texas), in the parking lot, with my boyfriend. we were waiting for the tow truck guy to show up to tow our car back to our house. the sky was a bright, flat blue. not one single cloud in the sky. and i see this.... thing. this silver thing hanging in the sky. i laughed and poked my boyfriend in the arm, then pointed at it, saying \"think it's a ufo?\" we both laughed a little, but... the more we watched it, the more we couldn't dismiss the idea. we stopped laughing and watched it.\r\n\r\nfirst of all, it was very high up in the sky. higher than you normally see birds for sure. and even if a bird was up that high, it wouldn't be anywhere near as large as the thing. definitely bigger than a balloon. i'd wager to say it was bigger than a car.\r\n\r\nsecond, it was silver. it was obviously silver, and highly reflective. it kept kind of \"twisting\" in the air. as we watched this thing, we began describing it outloud, planning what i would report seeing. i said that the way it was flashing--brilliantly flashing--was like a coin flipping in the air. my boyfriend shouted \"yes!\" it kind of pulsed with reflected light, and my he remarked that it looked like it was doing it rhythmically, in a pattern. not erratic.\r\n\r\nit was most certainly round in shape, no visible fins or wings... in fact, we were certain it wasn't an airplane, because shortly after we spotted it, a large white passenger plane flew near it. to me, from where i was standing beneath it, it appeared that the object was closer to the ground than the plane. and if so, and if it was a plane, shouldn't it have been clearly definable as such? the plane made a loud noise, but the object made no noise at all.\r\n\r\nwe watched this thing, transfixed, as it moved in a straight line against the wind, appearing to go west. then it paused. then continued to move west. i watched it until i could no longer see it anymore. at its furthest distance, when i could no longer see the object properly, i could still see the bright flashing.\r\n\r\ni'm interested in seeing if anyone else in austin reports seeing what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

have had repeated close encounters with entities over the years. these normally took the form of obe's and did not include the typical grey alien beings. rather the beings took many forms, and always had an enormously powerful effect on my personal spiritual development. at no time did i ever equate these experiences with the ufo phenomena. \r\n\r\nhowever, during a 6 month period in 1992 my family and i were visited on numerous occasions in what appeared to be a fairly common fashion according to research i conducted following the events. at the time i was relentlessly forced into convinction that a foreign intelligence was determined to reach me and members of my family in what could only be described as a deeply spiritual message.\r\n\r\nof the many incidents the one that sticks out the most began late one evening. my wife and two young children were asleep in their own rooms (daughter 4 and son 1). the night was eerily quite. i was experiencing feelings of being watched, chills, unwarranted fear, ringing in my ears and rapid heart beat. my two large dogs were also experiencing fear and distress. for no reason that i can explain i went around our home and turned on all the lights - going downstairs was particularly frightening. \r\n\r\ni then turned on the tv. in a matter of minutes the atmosphere became truly strange. first, every channel i turned to was featuring shows on ufo's! in an instant i was experiencing feelings of death, and judgement. suddenly i sensed/envisioned a being entering my son's room. at that very instant he began crying and calling out. the timing betwen those two events was chilling. as i went down the hallway and opened his bedroom door he was fast asleep and lying on his back. what caught my attention was for a split second i thought i saw a bright blue glowing ball of light on the centre of his forehead. at that very instant ths 1 1/2 year old sat up and waved out his bedroom window and then laid back down and was deep asleep. i picked him up and he was so deeply asleep that i could not wake him.\r\n\r\nalthough the event was very strange, i felt that i was either imagining things, or, that there was nothing i could do other than remain awake and stand in vigil over my family. i went back to the living room. in seconds i saw/felt something go into my daughter's room. at once she began to scream. i ran down the hall and as i opened her bedroom door i felt something walk right through me. my head felt like it was standing straight up and i was shuddering - i'm experiencing mild chills as i write. as i stood in the doorway my daughter looked at me and screamed. somehow i 'knew' that whatever was in her dream and passed through me in the doorway and that she had mistaken me for whatever it was. by the time i got to her side she was also deeply asleep! i remember thinking that hollywood couldn't have produced a scarier film as this was becoming extremely strange and frightening. \r\n\r\noddly, i felt very familiar with all of those sensations, although i couldn't place when exactly i had ever encountered anything like what was happening. on another level, something was begining to breakdown within me. in the past i had kept some very strange experiences at what could be described as an intellectual arm's length when it came to my sense of reality or world view. suddenly, these very same feelings were clearly happening outside of my imagination or so it seemed, as other people appeared to be experiencing being acted upon! \r\n\r\nin an effort to combat this encounter, i chose act as if nothing was happening and to go to bed myself. ordinarily it takes me quite a while to fall asleep, but on this night it seemed as if i had just laid my head down and i 'sank' deep into the pillow and was asleep in an instant. the next thing i knew i was standing in my hallway in my dream. as i have had many obe experiences i 'knew' i was dreaming and cold actually govern my actions much as if i were awake. i looked down the hall into the bathroom and was shocked to see and alien looking directly at me. i 'knew' the he had been who was in the house earlier and had somehow 'arranged' to get me to see him. he was approximately 5 feet tall, had grey skin and only one large black eye, his left. this was shaped similarly to the common version of the grey alien beings.\r\n\r\ndeeply afraid and shocked i woke up immediately. again, i sensed the being moving into my son's room, and again my son called out in his sleep. i was both shocked, afraid and somehow accepting of the situation. i got up and checked on my son again and he was asleep as before. i returned to bed, but rather than try to sleep, i turned on a light and began to read. there was no way i was going back to sleep! at that moment, i sensed the being coming into our bedroom and my wife jumped right out of a deep sleep and screamed! without wasting a second i asked her, \"what were you dreaming about\"? she replied that she was on an operating table and a number of aliens were there. one of them told her not to be afraid, he had 'only one eye, his left one'!         \r\n\r\nshe fell back asleep in what seemed like seconds. for the next few hours the being kept wandering through the house. i could sense where he was, and sure enough my family would talk or call out when he 'seemed' to be in their rooms. at dawn, i finally fell asleep myself. in the morning my daughter came out of her room and told me that she had seen a spaceship floating over our boat that was stored in the backyard. this 4 year old child went on to describe the ship (as above) and that there were2 being on our back deck and three in her room. they had inserted a long needle into her belly button that hurt terribly. she was concerned that she was going to bleed on her bed. i interupted the procedure and then they left.\r\nshe later indentfied the beings as the grey type with shiny black eyes and black one piece suits.\r\n\r\ni can recount many more such experiences. what i feel i must do however is to undergo regressive hypnosis and remember what was been said to me as i am convinced that something very important was shown to me.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading.\r\n\r\nmichael

going on, but as we walked closer, i was thinking it was too large to be so low, going so slow, making no noise, i realized it was quite possibly a ufo. it was unlike anything we had ever seen or had knowledge of and my son (now a pilot), was into aircraft, yet didn't know of any us aircraft that looked like that. he thought it might be a military experiment since kaneohe marine corps base was nearby, sited on kaneohe bay (i have now learned it is a possibility because we have learned new technology from visiting ets since 1947).  either way, it was a ufo, either visiting ets or us government testing of flying saucers.\r\n\r\ni felt very special, privileged to have been able to see such a sight in my lifetime, although i did not report it for, back then, to make such claims,

slowly from the north and we still had sunshine above us. the clouds were dark, so the ufo was easy to see. it seemed like it was less than half a mile away. the object did a number of movements. it darted left to right while it ascended/descended and vice versa. the most impressive maneuver was a series of figure eights. during that time charlie and i went inside to grab our cameras. charlie took 11 pictures of the object with his digital camera and i got a little over a minute of footage with my camcorder.  the ufo went nw out of our view. we only saw that one ball of light during that time, but when we reviewed the film, there was more than one object. the film somehow picked up more activity, very close to us, at least 50 yards away from the camcorder. the first object is a streak of something moving so fast it is hard to catch it on the pause button. it looks very similar to a rod. the second object is a ball of light that descends from the top of the screen all the way to the ground, and it seems to go into the ground. it was very close to me. i'm so surprised that my friends and i never knew that it was there. the 3rd and 4th objects seem to fly in formation off in the

two sightings of the same craft during this week the adress was 601 mcleod apt. 3. it was late wednesday/early thursday. my tv was broken so i was sitting in the dark when i noticed a light through my curtain. i opened up my curtains to see a light. the light alternated colors. i'll secribe this to the best of my ability. at fiest it may have been blue then turned red and then green. when it changes colors it would let off short bolts of electricity of that paricular color. when it completed a cycle of colors it would go into a rapid pattern that resembled a child scribbling on a paper. that light would be pink. when it was done scribbling it would turn a dull light pink and fill the night sky with this color. it would literally blind me, and i would have to blink over and over until my sight returned.\r\n during the whole time it was drifting from left to right. it was moving slow. it seemed to be running some kind of test. it appeared to be over lake superior. i don't know what was over there for it be testing. \r\n\r\ni remember watching it with my cat. i stuck my cat in the window and the cat seemed not to like it....It just gave a fearful meow. \r\n\r\ni tried to take pictures but the camera batteries were dead. i watched it over and over for the next few hours.\r\n\r\n\r\na few nights later it came back. this time i saw it come in. it was about 2:30 in the morning. i was laying on the couch looking out the window as my tv was still out. around that time i saw a white light coming in. i thought that was a weird way for a plane to come in. then it just stopped. all i could think was they're back and they started doing the same thing. this time i felt fear as i was wondering what the hell do they want.\r\n this time i wanted to phone the airforce, but didn't want to end up in a room with someone telling me that i didn't see anything. i didn't have a phone and the payphone was down the street, but i figured if i tried that they would abduct me. i also thought i shoulds never tell anyone of this as they would believe that i was crazzy.\r\n i watched this time for maybe 3 hours before jets showed up, and started flying around the craft. i lost sight both times of the craft because of jets showing up. \r\n\r\nafter seeing the craft i became obsessed with this. i told people and they thought i was crazy, but i knew what i saw. i studied every ufo book photo i could find. i looked at ufo images on the net to see if i could find photos that resembled what i saw that night. so far no luck.\r\n\r\ni can offer you no proof to what i saw. my only motivation is that maybe someone else has repoeted something simular at the same time. i don't remember the exact dates only taht it was near the mid to near the end of september 1999 in the city of thunder bay, ontario.\r\n\r\ni am not a credible witness as i have two mental disorders. one being clinical depression and the other is attention deficeit disorder. i don't hallucinate visually or

midlands, uk.  there are radio masts close to the town, some of which are used by the m.O.D., and you could see them at night from my bedroom window, due to the red warning lights they had on them.  a number of these have been removed within the last few years, but there are still some left in that location.\r\n\r\nwhen i couldn't sleep, i used to look out of the window at the mast lights, and one night, while doing just that, i noticed a white light moving across the sky.  i couldn't tell how far away it was from me or the masts, but it moved across, from right to left, at approximately the speed i would have expected of a light aircraft.  naturally, that is what i first assumed it to be, but the light suddenly shot upwards at an angle of about 60 - 70 degrees, and was moving so quickly out of sight that i would have missed it if i had blinked.\r\n\r\ni am 100% positive that this was not a light- or passenger aircraft, as it's last movements would be impossible for an aircraft to accomplish.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, my sister, who shared the bedroom with me, remained asleep during the event, so i have no witness to validate my sighting.  i am now 43 years old, and this memory has remained very clear in my mind since that evening, as it was a very exciting event for me.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6801,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.3688876,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-04122007-0004","longitude":-99.9962463,"occurred":155030400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

little high for house lights on the horizon so i just began watching them. rolled down my window to assure they weren't reflections. they rose higher and higher. they never got any bigger, just remained about the size and color of house lights on the horizon. there were 5 or 6, flashing a little and in a straight line. definitely not horizon lights. they eventially went directly over me. i did not pull over and didn't have a moonroof or anything so couldn't see them over head. i stuck my head out the window once, just to see. they were there and getting dimmer. i really thought i was going to be abducted or come up with missing time or something. i did not pull over. was too frightened. was sure that i would hear something about the lights on the news or something but never did.
