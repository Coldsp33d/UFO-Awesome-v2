traveling north on rt.9a leaving ossining and entering croton. i was in my car a 1991 eagle talon with 2 other friends in the vehicle, we were on our way home from a night out and i was the designated driver so i had not had anything alcoholic to drink. both friends were asleep at the time because it took us close to an hour to get home so no one else witnessed the event. as i was driving over a small bridge parallel to the croton train station a large flash lit up the entire sky and it appeared to be comming from somewhere north or slightly northwest of our location. right after the flash i felt as if my entire body was engulfed by goosebumps, and at this moment i am feeling the same sensation. at the time i didnt think much of the event and blamed my imagination or maybe i was just seeing something especially because there were no witnesses so i ignored it. about a month later on a snowy night i was driving to the croton point park which is within a mile of the location i described above to fool around in the snow with my car. i was alone this time, i was on the road that leads to the croton point parking lot when once again there was a massive flash whitch lit up the sky but unlike last time it was snowing quite heavily and the sky was covered by clouds yet the flash seemed to be eminating from below the clouds because i vaguely remember seeing the clouds being iluminated. once again my body was engulfed with goosebumps and this time i was quite frightened especially because my location was secluded with no one near by. once again the flash seemed to be emanating from the north or northwest. finally about a year ago i was traveling south on rt.9 leaving montrose going towards croton when once again i saw the flash again and the sensation i experienced the same feeling as before. this time i was several miles north of the location i had witnessed the flash the last 2 times and this time the flash seemed to come from the west. strangely this may have nothing to do with these incidences but there is an active nuclear reactor in peekskill called indian point which is also extremely close to these locations i mentioned above. i have heard rumors that this reactor sits on an inactive fault line but dont quote me on that. i have never had any eye sirgury nor do i wear glasses or contacts and consider my eyes to be in perfect condition and the last time i had a full eye exam was about 2 years before the first sighting. i have believed in ufos and extra terrestreals for many years after i was introduced to a show called \"unsolved mysteries.\" since then i enjoy watching any kind of show relating to this subject mainly the shows on the scifi channel which is where i heard of your organization and led me to come forward with this information. i know i saw those flashes but what caused them i can not explain, and after researching ufo sightings in westchester county i found that there have been quite a few so anything is possible. i hope this may help but if this turns out to be nothing i am deeply sorry.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\nvitor","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i saw 4 white lights decending from the sky that i perceived to be a large aircraft with the landing lights on. being familiar with that area, i could not think of an airport around there that could handle a plane of that size and was very curious as to where it was going to land. keeping in mind that this was not too far nautically (50 mi.+-) from washington d.C. i thought maybe it was military, and there was a base/airfield nearby that i was'nt aware of. i lost sight of it due to the road being cut through the mountain,and the trees that grow along that stretch. about 2 min. passed and i was coming to the jct. of i-68 and i-70 in hancock,md. when those lights came back into view, only now i could clearly see that it was a large disk shaped object hovering over a hill just north of i-70. it was no more than 50 ft. above the trees and standing still. absolutely huge. brownish/grey in color. the white lights that i had seen were on the edge of it, contured to the edge much like those of an aircraft. i could make out what i can only describe as portals here and there on it, no real pattern to them, and no light emitting from them. i could also see the overlapping \"seams\" where the metal that it was made from joined each other, along with a very short(from my vantage point) \"l\" shaped pipe coming from it. i had just a few sec. earlier told myself to observe everything that i could about it, because \"you ain't never going to see anything like this again.\" as i was now directly in front of it, and at the closest point with out it being hidden by tree tops, i could see that in the center of it was a cicular part that looked to be of a translucent material that was turning orange,redish,and yellow/orange. with out stopping,i watched it until i had passed it completely. may i mention that i am a long distance truck driver and i was in my truck at the time. traffic was very light, and what ever traffic there was going west bound would probably not have seen it given the incline of the hill and their closeness to the hill. a few miles later, as i was coming up on i-81 jct.,i heard on the c.B., another truck driver, obviously going east, ask for a west bounder.(for a\"bear\" report). i picked up my mic and asked for that truck going east and where he was. as i thought, he was a few miles behind me, so i asked him had he seen that thing above the hill at the 68/70 jct. he said \"did that look like a ufo to you, driver?\" i said it sure did. he said \"no i did'nt see it, but my wife did, i was busy looking at that cop on the side of the road standing outside of his car\". so somewhere out there, there is a truck driver and his wife, and an officer of the law that can vouch for my story. may i stress that i do not take drugs of any sort, i don't drink, and i was'nt tired. and also, it was a pleasure relating this to someone other than my wife and family. thank you.","distance":"101-500

said i don't think so but it would be cool to have one!!. \r\n\r\nme and my friend tried to locate somebody with a camera to no avail. we follow the object, and then in the middle of the lake started to spin slowly on its axis!!, every 3 seconds more less , following and absolutely silent and straight path despite the mild wind moving the trees. i had the chance to compare against the 2 passenger planes in the horizon,this after the object heading for manhattan crossing the boulevard east,and the hudson river, it was completely flat from below no protruding shapes, and absolutely majestic and spooky in its fly solid in the air. i have found that a lady saw it too in rockland county,and reported it to jeff rense.Com, while hiking she described mayan like designs and a hull on top this is

one series of two pictures that appear to show an object travelling a likely trajectory from one point ['image1of2'] a distance away from my the porch of my parent's house (one mile away??) to point (b)['image2of2'], roughly parallel above my house. \r\n\r\ngoogle maps 'calder ave, north vancouver, bc, canada' and the northernmost location of the capilano park/ southernmost point of capilano lake/ (our water reserve) is where the object appeared to be in the first picture, to the second picture where the object appears to be close to the area around calder ave (it nearly visually disappears over the rooftop of our house ) travelling towards the middle part of lynn canyon park. (the time frame between the two images is around 10-15 seconds) \r\n\r\nthe same day (the properities indicate july 8, 2004 it seems), i took a picture of grouse mountain (directly to the right of our house) showing an mysterious object that appears to be uniformly saucer-shaped... you decide. after many, many fruitless days of snapping pictures of clear skies, i took another picture [image 'abovevancouver'] showing two of the same strange objects apparently directly overhead vancouver city. \r\n\r\nwhat astounded me is that i did not see these objects in all four pictures. interestingly enough, the reason why i took these random pictures was because the fact that, beforehand, i read on the internet that many people who captured pictures of ufos did not see them at all, but their cameras! so outside with the digital camera on full res and a mind addled by weed... bam! \r\n\r\ni just hope these aren't snaps of bugs zipping by my camera... it couldn't be! my doubts kept me from publishing these pictures for 3-5 years (blame the wide timeframe on the pot), but... you decide, and share if you think its legit.\r\n\r\nthe objects are there in the pictures. look carefully, they're either faded or tucked in the corners. i'm sending you the whole image file(s)\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the truth...Good luck.\r\n\r\nglen parrish\r\n","distance":"Over One

ice break-up last april 2006, we the people of waterhen lake first nation (a cree tribe reservation), started noticing frequent predictable ufo activity.  it came to a point that each night at about 10:30pm until about 11:00pm, people would be waiting for the expected light show.  i tried to convince a friend from a neighboring town to bring his digital camera and to come and witness the activity, but he said he had other things to do that evening and that he would check it out some other night.  in a serious way i guaranteed him about a 75 percent chance he would record something that night (before the sightings, i would never even give anyone a 1 percent chance of a ufo sighting).  that night was the best light show we had ever seen.  at first it formed a semi-circle of lights with each light flickering on in sequence, then would flicker off in sequence but in reverse order.  the lights then repeated the sequence, but this time in a row which stretched out about a half mile to three quarters of a mile. the approximate distance from our viewing area to the lights was about two miles away across the lake.  just before i got to the sighting area, an rcmp constable had just pulled someone over and had his lights flashing.  when i pulled up beside him i told him to look to the northwest.  the rcmp constable just said \"oh, there back\".  from this statement, i knew he had seen them before.  \r\n\r\none other thing is that we are situated near the cold lake air weapons range.  we see many types of military aircraft from many countries flying in our airspace.  you just get use to the noise. whatever we seen that night didn't make a noise and there was no wind that night. these lights resembled what were referred to as the phoenix lights.\r\n\r\ni am not guaranteeing that we will see a repeat from last year, but it would be worth checking it out, wouldn't you say.  i am however guaranteeing a location to view from with no interference from anyone. i tried to report this to other agencies but i got no response.  i just recently found out about mufon.  to be honest, i don't know what i seen that night, after all ufo does mean 'unidentified' flying object.\r\n\r\nthere was a video released to the canadian broadcasting corportation (cbc)and they did show it.  it was a spectacle and they picked the wrong individual (nightwatchman) to represent us

afternoon (exact time unknown)\r\ndate sighting reported: april 9, 2007\r\nduration of sighting: 11 seconds\r\nlocation of sighting: camano island, washington (see map)\r\nlatitude: 48.19 degrees north \r\nlongitude: 122.5 degrees west \r\nnumber of witnesses: one\r\nweather: cloud ceiling 5,000 to 7,000 feet. light rain in area. visibility 8 to 10 miles. \r\n\r\ndescription (in witness's own words): i took this footage on the afternoon of saturday, april 7th, 2007. you should be able to see clearly an orb/balloon? the orb/balloon was stationary and then rose up. i didn't see this object at the time so i didnt zoom in on it. i was just filming the family farm and happened to notice this while i was viewing my footage. i have a higher quality video also, but i'm not sure if you could view it. it is a 35mb .Mod file (from a jvc harddisk camcorder). \r\n\r\nsecond report by the witness (in response to my questions): ok the orb is first visible at 3 seconds into the video clip in the middle right hand side of the screen, you will see like a white ball overlapping a power line with water in the background. it is stationary. at 7 seconds you see the object start to rise. watch very closely upper right hand corner at 13-14 seconds and you can clearly see a spherical object against the blue sky.\r\n\r\nthird report by witness: glad you saw what i saw. it is indeed very interesting. the film is taken facing south/southeast. the closest business is right next to where this was, the camano island fire department, right next to that is a small park and a group of businesses (camano island coffee roasters is one) it is known as terry's corner. the actual farm where i believe the orb is hovering over has an antique shop and the guy raises grass fed beef. the thing that gets me is that i can only really think of one real possiblity for what this could be and that is a weather balloon. but that really doesn't make sense being that it was perfectly spherical (not what i know weather balloons to look like) and it was above my neighbor's farm, and it was hovering for a few seconds, did not rise like a helium balloon would. also the fact that it was a fairly low altitude (50-100 feet?) makes it seem even less likely that it could be a balloon. the only other thing that i can think of, that i don't take seriously is \"swamp gas\"? (because there is a pond right next to that area as you can see from the sattelite view.) this isn't one of those \"lights in the sky\" kinda things, its so clear and at a low altitude, it should be easy to explain away if there is a good explanation. i'm going to go visit the farmer guy and ask if he saw anything (or were launching any weather balloons?) and i'll also call the fire department and ask them since they are right smack dab next to where this happened.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

flying in tandem at about the height that airplanes fly around here. the sky was clear and i could see stars too. i could only see a row of lights blinking for each craft. it looked like each object had at least 4 lights, maybe 5, and they all appeared to blink. the light in the center of the row of lights was red and the other lights were white or yellow. i heard a low rumbling noise. when i noticed them i did not think they were airplanes because of the way they flew together and maintained the space between them and the lights looked strange. my first thought was that they were ufos, then i thought, no, they are probably airplanes. but i didn't really think they were airplanes. it was exciting and i tried to get a good look and count the lights, but they were pretty far away and i can't be sure about it. they had too many lights to be airplanes i think, and they made a low rumbling noise that wasn't like airplanes. they flew in a straight path, about the speed of airplanes. they were heading west and crossed the sky in about 5 minutes. it occurred to me that they could be military planes, the really big ones, flying together. i went inside and got my mother to come out

from the angle it came in on. shutter speed was more than likely set at 1000 , because of bright sunshine that day,. so object was going basically the speed of light. \r\n\r\ni even did a negative on it and it shows up even better. i have more pictures , if your interested in seeing them, but i will attach the original first, and the other 2 will be my negative and zoom pictures. and you can do

phone call from my dad. i live in a group of units in south frankston, and the guy who lives in the unit next door is a mate of my dads. he often does odd jobs like painting for my dad. dad was having trouble contacting alby(the guy next door)as, alby has no phone connected. so he called me on my mobile, and asked to to go next door to see if alby was home.\r\n\r\nso over i went knocked on the door, found alby, gave him the phone and told him my dad wanted to speak to him. while alby was speaking to my dad, i stood on the porch of his unit and leaned against the security door too keep it open, and started gazing up at the stars as it was another very clear night filled with stars. as i listened to alby speaking on my phone while he was standing on the inside of his door way, i continued to scan the skies for several minutes wondering when the convesation between the 2 would end, so i could go back inside and watch t.V.\r\n\r\nthen after almost 10 minutes,with alby still talking on the phone, a group of lights came into view from behind a tall tree across the back of our units. at first i thought it was a helicopter or a light plane flying at low altitude. but almost emmediatley it was obvious that something was strange about this craft. it travelled at a very slow pace, and being fairly close to us in the sky made no noise what so ever. the lights which i initially thought were from plane/helicopter, did'nt look too unusual, but the array in which they were set was not like any plane i have seen before.\r\n\r\nthe lights were set in a diamond shape. red lights were set at the front or \"nose\" of the oject, and at the back or \"tail\" of the ufo, and they did'nt flicker. 2 white lights which also did'nt flicker were set on either wing, or side of the craft, these 4 lights giving it a diamond- like apearance. there was also a red flashing light set in the center of this craft.\r\n\r\nthe object was flying fairly low to the ground, i would guess under 1000 meters.(around here police helicopters cruising over the neighbourhoods happens fairly often at both day and night, and you get to see them come down pretty low and close to your roof)the fact that i could not hear any noise from this thing is the most puzzling thing for me. if it were a chopper i would of heard it long before i clapped eyes on it and by the time i could see it the noise would have been very loud.\r\n\r\nas i watched this thing from the steps of alby's unit i wondered if he'd seen it. just as i decided to interupt his conversation and ask him about it alby exclaimed, \"whats that?\" to me. i answered \"i dunno?\". the object slowly drifted over the units and out over an oval that is across the road from our block of units. i headed down to the bottom albys porch and moved into the yard to get a better look at the thing. then alby came down and gave me my phone. \r\n\r\n\"heres your phone back\" alby said has he handed it to me. then he said \"what the hell is that thing?\" i said \"i really dont know, its not a plane or a chopper, its to quite!\" then he said, \"i am going out the front to the street to get a better view!\" i then lifted the phone to my ear and started walking out to the front of the units. my dad was talking to me but i was still looking at this thing in the sky. eventualy dad asked what was wrong as i was more interested at watching this craft than talking on the phone, so i just said, \"ah dad there is just something weird up in the sky that alby and i are looking at.\" \r\n\r\nmy dad laughed and said \"what have you guys been drinking.\" i said \"nothing, i just dont know what it is. i'm glad alby seen it too cause you'd think i am seeing things or going mad\" dad who is a fair skeptic, said \"well ok.\" i told him that id catch him later, hung up and ran to where alby was still looking at this craft which had floated off into the distance over port phillip bay. you could not make out the shape now, and if this view was all you saw of it you would probably think it is some type of conventional aircraft.\r\n\r\nwe stayed out the front for about 10 more minutes then to our amazment it came back into view from a different angle and again glided fairly close to our group of units, not as close as the first pass but close enough to see it was the same thing. after we lost sight of it again over the distance, i decided to go and get my camera. so i headed in grabbed my digital camera and headed back out to where alby still stood.\r\n\r\nthere was nothing for about 15 minutes then again it came back from a different direction cruised in fairly close to our street and then headed in the general direction of the mornington peninsula. i attempted to take photos of it this last time, but the 6 or so shots i managed to take show nothing but the clear night sky and some trees and street lamps. alby and i just don't know what this was. the only thing that moves silently like, was some type of blimb, but ive seen them before. i have seen blimbs at night pass over my house several times (allan bond used to have an advertising blimb years ago), and if it was for advertising i saw no sign. it was to small to be one of those things. i will be checking out in papers and on the net to see if any blimps, etc were flying over frankston last night. i wonder if any other people saw it.

it shines about 100 times brighter than any brightest star in the night sky - it is about 10 times larger that any stars in that quadrant, and it seems to flicker or sometimes pulse it's lights (which have a bluish hue and reddish tinge to it at times). the light seems to be more like a hallogen type light or brightness, and it seems to get closer and farther away from the earth (moving) as the night progresses. \r\n\r\nrecently, we've noticed that there is another similar object to the south of the other one. they both are bright, and obviously huge, whatever they are. there are times, when we take out our doggie in the back yard, when we notice the object gone, all of a sudden, or perhaps, the lights have been turned off. then, later, it appears a long distance from its original location (higher or lower in the sky and farther to the north or south), once more. it usually sits to the west of our residence, at about a 25'-30' angle from the western horizon. \r\n\r\nwe have thought of taking photos of it with our digital camera, but figured nothing would really register, except a bright spot in the sky, so why bother. if you instruct us to take photographs, and tell us how and with what type of equipment, we will certianly attempt it, if they will still be here. \r\n\r\nwe always feel \"strangely\" after these sightings, often feeling a bit frightened, just by the obvious sheer size of it. it often feels like \"someone is watching us.\" nothing that we can put our fingers on, but it is unnerving nevertheless. fyi: i always want to run in the house and lock all the doors for some inexplicable reason. by the way, the object is typically still there, and its lights are flickering, like the sunrays off a huge diamond. \r\n\r\nit would be helpful if someone from your organization would check this phenomenon out, as it is rather disturbing to note it just sitting there, as \"if observing us,\" and know that no one from earth (that we know of) is atempting to find out what's going on with it. we realize that if that is some kind of a \"space ship of alien origins,\" then given their size and obvious technological superiority, we, on earth, are probably helpless and unlikely to investigate it with any certainty or confidence. \r\n\r\nthank you for your assistance on this. it is my hope and expectations that i will not have unwanted \"visits from the men in black,\" or have any of my personal information distributed outside of your scientific circle of inquiry. \r\n\r\nrespectfully,~ eva starmach, ph.D. ~","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6773,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5322515,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04082007-0004","longitude":-122.6706471,"occurred":1172649600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1172649600000,"summary":"Large, bright, object in the western sky in portland, oregon","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Portland, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:472467"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Juana Díaz","country":"Puerto Rico","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was the election day in p.R. in the town of juana diaz in the year 1967 or 68. me and three of my friends after voting went to the plaza to celebrate with everybody else the results of this election.When we where standing in the middle of the crowd, we all saw this egg shape form thing in the sky;

me and my friend were on his balcony and right in front of appeared four glowing lights moving across the sky that seemed to be perfectly spaced and glowing in and out like a beacon of sorts. we had a camcorder there at the time and quickly grabbed it and started to film the event that i like to call \"the mesa lights\". these lights were moving southwest in direction and were at a low altitude. the lights that i observed were only four that we saw and definitely moving across the sky fairly quickly, however observing this happen seemed much longer. my friend said that he had read about an airshow that was going on around this same time in the paper but now looking back at this footage again i don't believe that to be the case as there was no sound coming from these so called \"jets\". it was ominous, and where i currently live whenever military \"jets\" fly by at a much higher altitude the whole house practically shakes. the footage i have of these lights seemed much lower to me than any military \"jet\" i have ever seen. also, is it common to practice for an airshow in the evening? that question still to this day looms in my head. all four of us there were very intigued by this event as we all watched in amazement these lights that none of us had ever seen before. it was a bit strange to have witnessed this, almost like maybe we saw something that we shouldn't have. afterwards some of us wanted to go follow them to see if we could document anything else but not everyone there was as interested in doing so. the lights ended up moving to far out of view from the balcony that we were on and we lost sight of them. my friend did call up the police and they had said that they had received a lot of calls on the lights but still confirmed it was planes practicing for an airshow. i never believed this theory. there we're no other lights on these objects neither like airplanes have that blink in the night sky when flying. all i know is that to this day i've shown numerous people (friends,family) the footage and we've all tried to come up with a logical explanation of what these objects could be and still no one can! here in arizona we had a mass sighting ~ 10 years ago called the phoenix lights and it still happens from time to time again. being that the 10th anniversay of this mass sighting just happened in march, it really sparked my interest to get my footage out there and share my story. i'm not sure what these lights in the sky were, but i do not feel they are military in any way.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6770,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4223343,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04082007-0001","longitude":-111.8263124,"occurred":688442400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,
