cylinder and disk shape was hovering over this parking lot we were next to. it was hovering no more than one hundred feet about the ground and was nearly the circumference of the entire parking lot. it made no noise what so ever but had a bank of lights that encircled the bottom and side of the craft. the lights didn't spin but appeared to be more like flashing green, red, blue and yellow. i asked my friend what we should do. he was in shock and still starring. it was at that point a humming noise came form within and it flew over the hudson river which was a few blocks away. it became a dot in the distance as it totally disappeared in a matter of maybe 2 seconds, no more. i was excited and intrigued but my frined was never the same after. he starred at the chalkboard in school that monday (the next day) without a sound and was dismissed from school. he remained out for the remainder of the week. he would never speak of it again and would not respond to my questions of what we saw.\r\ni never saw him after i moved several years later. i did run into him nearly 15 years after the event. even then he would not talk of it. i approached him and we said our usual hello's, how

do that a minute after the fireworks would go off. so i went down my street knocking on doors and trying to get people to come out and see them but i dont speak much spanish and i think most of them think im nuts now. anyway so i went up to my apartment on the top floor where we put our laundry and i watched the green one go off into the distance and after about 10 to 15 minutes some other green balls appeared in the sky and they all disappeared together. so i went back to my girlfriends house (shes mexican) and waited for her and some neighbours came by (one of my students) and i told him about it and a local boy was walking by and he said he saw the same thing but from farther away... anyway i was really freaked out and i couldnt sleep most of the night..... do you know someone here around mexico city that i can talk to? im in toluca, metepec and.... i would really like someone to talk to about this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nmy email is mikemitter@yahoo.Com","distance":"101-500

we left my home at about 8:30 in order to get to beachouse in plenty of time. the beach house was located in a resort town of southampton new york  in the hamlet of watermill. the community is a summer beach resort for the rich and famous, for whom i worked managing a beachouse. i usually lived at the beachouse by myself. however, i had just bought my own little house a few minutes away and was there with my uncle who was visiting me for the first time. i didn't want a tv at my house, so to watch seinfeld, we had to drive back to the beachouse where there were many tv's. \r\nnow. i should tell you that most of these resorts die after labor day and this was thursday night so  the beach road where the house was was deserted. i was the only one who lived on the beach for about a mile in one direction and over a mile in the other.\r\nthe unusual situations are numerous for this particular sighting as i'll explain as we go along.\r\nas we were about a mile or more from the house i noticed an amber chandelier, which i thought must be in this newly built empty house on the right side of the road slightly higher than the road, as the land sloped upward about 10-20 feet with trees along the road and then a potato field behind them well out of my sight. maybe the owners were moving in or something. ( the logic of this doesn't fit in retrospect, however i remember thinking the house was empty and no window coverings would allow the chandelier to appear so bright.) this is because i was seeing an amber glow in this particular direction on my right and there had been a house built there a couple of months earlier and it had not been moved into yet. \r\n now the street was dark, no street lights as i recall, so lights would stand out. as we proceeded down this road there was an upward slope to the land all along the road. an embankment rising some 10 to 20 feet which had potato fields on the high side out of my vision and well behind the trees.\r\nafter i passed that house, i noticed the night sky behind the trees on my right and up over the slope i just described, seemed to be aglow with this amber light. as if there was an event going on in the potato fields. my initial reaction was a movie company filming in the potato fields or maybe a grass fire. although as i drove it seemed that the light stayed behind the trees all along the road. sort of like the moon follows you as you drive along. although all i could see was this night sky lit up but the source was out of my sight beyond the trees. i started to think there might be a fire or something else, it felt out of sorts. now about a half mile from the house, which is on the ocean with a bay behind it so the house sits on a narrow strip of land that encloses this bay/saltwater pond, the road heaqds straight toward this small bay/pond and we are paralleling the ocean beach at this point about a third of a mile back from the beach. when you almost drive into the bay the road turns ninety degrees right and goes along the side of the bay down to a public beach where just before you get to the parking lot the road turns left and goes about another half mile between the ocean and bay and then ends at the turn around by the river entrance to the bay. \r\nnow i must back up to where the road almost goes into the bay before turning sharp right. because as i turned my little pickup truck right around this corner right beside the bay and turned toward the ocean beach straight ahead with the beachouse just a ways to the left of the beach sitting on top of a large dune and i'm still about a third of a mile away from the house and beach parking lot is where my uncle and i were surprised.\r\nover the beachouse and stretching for several houses in one direction and a couple of houses in the other above the dune with the moon lit night sky visible all around it's silouette and reaching a few hundre feet high into the sky was the biggest thing i ever saw floating in the air absolutely silently from where i was, as i rolled down my window. it was unlike anything i ever could have imagined and bigger than anything i can think of except maybe an aircraft carrier or cruise ship. and that's not the most amazing thing. it was a black dark silouette with six giant charcoal red glowing lights or portals. positioned like the points of two pyramids sitting side by side. what i mean is at where the pyramid corners would be were these giant glowing lights four across the botom and two above. (i'll come back to the enormous size of these lights)\r\ni drove as fast as i safely could, fearing for a dear or fox might run in front of me as they were prevalent in this particular area, down to the beach and when i got to the parking lot entrance, rather than turning toward the house, i drove straight ahead up into the parking lot and right up to the edge of the sand leading to the beach. at this point there is an area where the dune has a break in it so you can walk out onto the beach. from the time i hit the parking lot i lost sight of the object as i believed it was slowly moving away from us out over the beach and ocean, so i jumped out of the truck and ran out onto the beach.\r\nit was gone. i was amazed, where could something so big go to so fast. as i looked up and down the beach and out onto the ocean way in the distance to my right and all the way out on the horizon as far out and to the right as i could see i saw something above the water by the horizon yet above the water shining these giant searchlights down on to the water in a scanning movement. now, this is especially interesting to me. i grew up on cape cod in massachusetts and we as children nearly lived at the beach day and night and we had a big air base on the cape and my dad was in the airforce, so i am use to seeing planes and helicopters flying over head and out on the horizon and have a pretty good idea of scale and relative distance and size of things. the thing is that the search lights shining down on the ocean should have been like a speck at that distance and maybe a beam the size of the thicknessof a piece of hair. the lights shining down onto the water were huge even at that distance. it's hard to explain how huge because it doesn't make sense.\r\nmy uncle was in his 70's at the time and as i walked back from the beach to the truck he was just standing by the truck looking all around and wondering if i had seen anything. i was thinking we're going to see aparade of cars racing down to the beach to see what the heck this was. one jeep wagoneer with three teenagers showed up and asked me what that was. i asked them what they thought it was.They didn't say except they thought they had seen a chandelier drop down out of the sky.\r\ni would have thought they would have been much more curious or inquisitive except they weren't and i was rather put out with their lack of excitement. i said i thought it was a ufo. i got back in my truck and drove over to the beachouse and went inside it was about 9pm time for seinfeld which i always watched, except for this night i didn't. when we got in the house my uncle said he thought he should have a drink and he watched tv. i don't drink and wasn't interested in watching tv. i went out on the beach dune decks and watched eagerly waiting for our visitor to return. they didn't that night. i went o bed about midnight.\r\nthe next morning i awoke early and thought wouldn't it be exciting if i went up on the dune decks and looked out and saw something in the ocean even if only debris. i saw nothing in the water or on the beach. no sign of anything, i looked for quite a while. as i got finished looking i heard a faint noise. it happens to be my favorite sound and i'm sensitive to it. the flutter of rotor blades of a helicopter far far away. i couldn't see it, but i could hear it and it was approaching and it was big.\r\nnow i lived in this house for almost 4 years on the ocean, seeing planes and helicopters fly along the beach. even had a police helicopter land right in front of the house on the beach, while searching for some windsurfers who had strayed out to far and couldn't get back. we called for them.\r\nas a single engine pilot i know some of the requirements of altitudes around houses for aircraft. well this day i saw something i had never seen in my life. way down the beach as far as i could see was a big helicopter flying over the beach sand about 50 to 75 feet high at the most. as this big dark helicopter approached, looking about the size of a coast guard rescue chopper, a sikorsky i think, except it was military grey with no markings. except it was so low and obviously searching for something, as i thought they were going to fly right by me standing on top of the dune, i raised my hand to wave to them, i could see their two faces and even the dark shields raised on their helmets, as they reached me in front of the beachouse they abruptly banked left out over the water, i thought they had seen something i had missed out in the water. they turned ninety degrees left and headed out over the water. they proceeded straight out over the horizon and i never saw them again after that.\r\nexcept about a year later i had a revisit of the lights after i had moved out of the beachouse. \r\nenough for now.\r\nsorry for the length\r\ndavid adao\r\ni have sinced moved and live in upstate sw of albany in a small town of ghent.\r\nas jack horkheimer use to say\r\nkeep

one of their boyfriends. i was just star gazing and watching passing planes go by. we live a couple of blocks from a hospital and we see helicopters fly in and out all the time. i noticed a bright light in the sky and thought it was just another  passing airplane. this object was about the same brightness, and size of a passing airplane. i watched for a few moments and waited to see if i could see its blinking light or lights, but i couldn't. which in itself is no big deal. so i compared it to a stationary object to see if i could find its path or see any movement. i couldn't. so i continued to watch it for about another ten to fifteen minutes. still no movement. then suddenly it faded until it was almost out of sight. it reappeared, but got brighter for a few seconds and changed its color from whitish blue to an almost red. it stayed this color for only a few seconds and then changed back to the whitish blue color. at this time i told my sisters and their boyfriend what i had saw. at this time they started watching as well. it continued to fade in and out of sight like before, and every once in a while you could the red color reappear. then  i noticed it started to move up. like it was going further away or it was changing to a higher elevation. still it wasn't moving very fast. it reminded me of a helicopter in some ways. for example it seemed to just hover in the sky. but you could tell it was far away, and it would be to big at that distance to be a helicopter. the light that this object giving out was a very strange light. it was like a star that was kind of twinkling. the center of the light was brighter than the rest of it. it reminded me of a very small cross. but when you looked at the object as a whole, with all the light around the edges of the cross gleaming, it looked like a circle. you didn't really see the cross center unless you really focused on it. i never really lost sight of the object, i came inside to get something and when i returned to the porch the object was no longer visible. i just want to know if there has been any other reporting of the object, or if maybe i was seeing a planet . the object was in the east to n.East sky from my house. i don't know if any of this will help you guys but i hope it will. and another i want to mention is that i always watch the sky especially at night and i have never  seen

nieces (miranda age 8 and serena age 4) when miranda pointed upwards and said \"uncle chris, i can see a balloon!\". naturally i just thought it was an 8 y.O. getting excited from some kid losing a helium balloon and didn't pay it much notice at first. i was kneeling down talking to serena. miranda kept getting excited and repeating herself over and over about the balloon (about 3 or 4 times in about a 10 second period getting more and more excited) so i thought i would humor her and look for the balloon. serena also started to look up for the balloon. since i was looking for a runaway balloon (or so i thought) i started to look over the rooftops and over the treetops for a balloon, fully expecting to see some helium balloon on a string caught up in the wind and rising steadily. i didn't see anything and i told her there was no balloon and was ready to dismiss her as a hyper 8 year old and go inside. she kept insisting she could see it. that's when she pointed w-a-y up, higher than i would have thought to look for a balloon, and then it came into view. the first words out of my mouth (remember i was humoring an 8 y.O. girl) \"miranda, that's not a balloon, that's a plane\". i immediately followed that up with something along the lines of \"that's no plane like i've ever seen!\" and i started to walk blindly away from them to get a better view. there were no wings and it was like a silver/metallic orb. it was silent and fast. much faster than i would have expected a plane to be going. there were no contrails either - which was startling (more on that in a minute) to me. it traveled in a straight line in a north/northeasterly direction and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. i would estimate from the time she said she saw a balloon until the time it was gone was probably 30 - 35 seconds maximum. i watched it myself for maybe 20 seconds at the most. serena also saw it. i can't say how high because i just suck at judging vertical distances and would not even hazard a guess. it was at an altitude where no wings were visible but you could clearly see that something was moving through the sky even though it was pretty high up. it happened between 5:15pm and 5:20pm. i know because i noted the time on the clock when we went inside as soon as it was out of sight. my nieces were jumping all over telling my mother and my sister how we saw a ufo. naturally, they looked at me and were ready to say \"yeah sure\" when i told them that whatever it was we saw it sure wasn't a plane, helicopter, blimp or balloon. once i thought about it the video footage that is always shown of silver orbs over mexico city was what immediately came to mind.\r\n\r\nhere is some more info on me and the location:\r\ni have been a professional photographer and videographer for 19 years. i am trained to notice things and remember. my sister wanted to know why i didn't take out my cellphone and take a photo or video of it. i know damn well that a 1.3 megapixel cellphone camera won't do a thing at the distance i was dealing with. i would have needed to have a high end camera with a good optical zoom (not a digital zoom) to get anything worthwhile. i had one in the car but by the time i would have gotten it out the moment would have passed so i was counting on myself to remember details as much as possible. i have also been in a number of planes and helicopters for aerial photos in the past. it was not any type of helicopter. it was dead silent and too fast. it didn't do any kind of amazing acrobatics as people often report. it just traveled in a straight line.\r\n\r\nwhere i live in chicopee ma i am in proximity to 4 airports so i see planes all the time. i am 10 minutes from westover air reserve base in chicopee so i see c5 transports and other miltary aircraft all the time (not to mention the airshows they have every year). i am 20 minutes from barnes municipal airport in westfield. i often see warthogs flying manuevers. i am 20 minutes from northampton airport (a small private airport) so i see light aircraft like cessnas. i am 40 minutes from bradley international airport in ct. so i see commercial flights all the time as well. also, every plane i see these days has contrails of some sort. within 90 minutes of the sighting i counted 6 other aircraft flying overhead. i could see the wings on each one as well as contrails from each one. i did see one plane that was in a steep climb to go way up and couldn't hardly see it at all....But i saw the contrail. whatever we saw had no contrail which was a fact that i really picked up on. i know that whatever we saw was not a commercial airliner, military transport, helicopter, blimp, weather balloon, cessna or ultralight. it was round, fast and quiet. if i hadn't seen it myself i would have dismissed the observations of two preteen girls easily. \r\n\r\nat the risk of embarrassment i am filing this report because i know what i saw. i have tried to dismiss the sighting but cannot think of what it could have been. as much as i do personally believe in ufos i also take every single report i read with a healthy dose of skepticism without hard evidence to back up the claim. i also now understand why so many people don't have photo or video footage when they see things. i was so totally mesmerized and trying to take in what it was that i was seeing that getting proof was the last thing on my mind. i was more concerned with details so i could report with some semblance of credibility. i would be happy to follow up the report with a phone conversation if necessary but don't know what else i can add aside from the fact that i am not crazy. i realize that an 8 y.O. and a 4 y.O. aren't exactly credible corraborating witnesses but that's all i can tell you. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

 as strange as it sounds, i could sooner believe it was a space ship with little green men before i could believe there would be a helicopter out there. i know we had helicopters that were being used in korea at the time, but i had never seen one in person, and that explanation never crossed my mind at the time ... but again, what would one be doing out there in rural america?\r\n\r\ni'm sorry if this is a waste of your time, but maybe someone else saw something back then and you already know about it.  i don't think i want to know if it was just a helicopter - i've always been pleased that i saw something and i've pretended all these years that it was, in fact, a real honest to goodness ufo.\r\n\r\nand i am a believer.  i've just not yet been lucky enough to really see anything important - well, actually i did see a model of russia's sputnik in their pavillion at the brussel's world fair in 1958. i was an exchange student at the time.  i'm 66 years old now, but maybe someday.........In the meantime, i faithfully watch all the ufo programs on the history channel and long to know what it's all about, and wish i lived near a \"hot spot\". i'm glad there is an organization that takes this stuff seriously and people who are willing to come forward with their stories.  \r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":6696,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.0122554,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03302007-0002","longitude":-84.1852142,"occurred":-586467000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-586467000000,"summary":"In the early 50s a  yellow/greenish light dropped slowly from high in the east  to the west at a 45 degree angle","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Detroit","timeZoneName":"America/Detroit","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Onsted, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:473526"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2552}
