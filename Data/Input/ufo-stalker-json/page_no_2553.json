of work for the winter of 1976 to 1977 and took a job as a security guard at wild acres lakes in dingman's ferry, pa.  this was and still is a lake community.  in january of 1977 there were a lot of completed homes in the area, many occupied year-round and many only on weekends by people from the ny metro area, just 60 miles or so to the east.  this area was also being actively developed at the time, with a real-estate/construction sales office at the entrance to the community, and with new lots being created from the swamps and woods, and new homes being built.  part of my job as security guard was to make sure nobody was stealing the building materials from the job-sites at night, in addition to making sure nobody was breaking in to the weekend homes during the week.\r\n\r\nthe night of the sighting was in january of 1977, but i can't recall exactly what date.  there had been a long spell of very cold weather, and everything was frozen solid.  the sighting was around 1 or 2 a.M., the temperature was probaby around zero, the air very crisp and clear, the ground had probably a foot or more of snow cover, snow was crunchy.  i don't recall a moon that night, but it was clear and very starry.  this area is very rural and dark at night, no streetlights or house lights where i was, but the sky to the east is lighter than the sky in the other directions because of the ny metro area 50 miles away causing light pollution.\r\n\r\non the night of the sighting i was in the volkswagen rabbit patrol car as usual, driving around the roads of the development.  at the time, during the day they were clearing a swamp with heavy equipment in one section of the development.  they would bulldoze the stumps into a big heap in the middle of the cleared swamp and burn them, so at night these piles of stumps would be glowing and sending up sparks, especially if the wind kicked up.  i would drive by several times during the night to make sure that sparks from the fires had not set off any brush fires in the surrounding woods.\r\n\r\non this night i was driving south on wild acres drive toward it's intersection with windwood drive.  at the time, there were no houses on the west or east side of wild acres drive on this section.  there was a swamp on the left (east) side of the road, between wild acres drive and the construction road.  this swamp was frozen solid and covered with snow.  i was on wild acres drive, about 500 to 1000 ft or so from it's intersection with windwood drive, when i saw out of my driver's window towards the east what i thought was a fire burning on the ground on the other side of the swamp.  the swamp here is about 1000 feet across, and then the ground rises up a small ridge maybe 20 feet in elevation, as i recall.  the fire was on the ground towards the top of the elevation.  it was clear, and i could clearly see the trees outlined against the snow and against the sky, which in the east was lighter than the rest of the sky, as explained above.  i thought at the time that they might possibly be clearing a new area for development, but i hadn't been told about it, and it was in an area where there had been no clearing going on the day before.  i was about 1/4 mile away, so i took out my binoculars, a good set as i recall, but i don't recall the exact specs.  i rolled down the drivers window and looked at the fire through the binoculars.  i was puzzled at what i saw, because now it looked like 2 fires instead of one, but it didn't burn like a fire.  the color was orange/yellow like a fire, but it seemed to be two balls of fire one right next to the other with no space between, side by side on the ground.  they burned steadily and brightly, not like a wood fire that flickers and has subtle color changes.  the colors were yellow/orange like a fire, but steady and bright.  i would guess that the total width was 10 to 15 feet, and height maybe 5 or 6 feet.  at a distance of a quarter mile, i could probably have blocked out the light from my naked eye with my fist on extended arm.  i didn't hear any sound at all, except for the engine running in the vw.  i looked at the fire through the binoculars for a minute or so, trying to figure out if it was a controlled burn or a brush fire, when suddenly i saw the dual balls of fire, still through binoculars, slowly rise straight up off the ground and through the trees until it was about 10 feet or so above the tops of the trees, and it hovered there for maybe 15 seconds or so.  at this time, i was just dumbfounded, is the only way i can describe it....What the h is that?  then after it hovered for about 15 seconds or so, it shot up into the sky at about an 80 degree angle from the horizon so fast that it just left a streak of yellow/orange light in the sky, like when you wave a flashlight wand at night and you see the trail of light as you wave it.  it just streaked up into the sky and disappeared.  i was certain at that point that it wasn't a fire.  i don't know what it was, but it certainly left an impression on me.\r\n\r\ni did not drive over to the location to examine the ground.  i wish now that i had, and i can't explain why i didn't, but i didn't.  i just went about my job for the rest of the night and then went home, although i did remember thinking, wow, that was different!  i didn't mention it to anybody else for a long time, but i can remember it like it was yesterday.  i never saw anything like it before or since.  i have mentioned it to my family and a few friends, but the reaction is generally skeptical.  can't say as i blame them.\r\n\r\ni have often wondered if there might have been a physical trace left on the ground...Radioactive, maybe, since any ground impression would have long been gone by now.  i have not been back to the area since 1977, although it's only a few miles from where i live now.  if i had a geiger counter i'd be tempted to go sweep the area, if they didn't kick me out.\r\n\r\nthe area surrounding wild acres lakes was then and is still very rural.  to the east is the delaware river and thousands of acres of undeveloped woodland of the delaware river national recreation area, as well as stokes state forest in n.J.  there are no airfields or military installations for miles in any direction.  what i saw was not the landing lights or running lights of an airliner flying west from newark, n.J....I see them all the time and i know what they look like coming, going and turning.\r\n\r\ni'm 54 years old now in march of 2007.  i have worked as an insurance underwriter for nationally known companies for the past 29 years.  i am married, 2 children, own my own home.  i served in the u.S. army for 2 years from 1972 to 1974, and was honorably discharged at the end of my service.  my mos was military police, i served in the headquarters of 15th mp brigade in kaiserslautern, germany as a clerk in the plans and operations section.  i had a top secret security clearance, which required a successful background investigation to obtain.\r\n\r\nhere's a link to a google map of wild acres development in dingmans ferry, pa.  the area where the object was on the ground is just to the east of the construction road.  i was looking from the car on the other side of the blank area of the map to the west of construction road, which is a swamp, sitting on wild acres drive facing south and looking east.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Google.Com/maps?Q=dingmans+ferry,+pa,+usa&ie=utf8&z=16&ll=41.217662,-74.940963&spn=0.00962,0.026028&om=1\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

of work for the winter of 1976 to 1977 and took a job as a security guard at wild acres lakes in dingman's ferry, pa.  this was and still is a lake community.  in january of 1977 there were a lot of completed homes in the area, many occupied year-round and many only on weekends by people from the ny metro area, just 60 miles or so to the east.  this area was also being actively developed at the time, with a real-estate/construction sales office at the entrance to the community, and with new lots being created from the swamps and woods, and new homes being built.  part of my job as security guard was to make sure nobody was stealing the building materials from the job-sites at night, in addition to making sure nobody was breaking in to the weekend homes during the week.\r\n\r\nthe night of the sighting was in january of 1977, but i can't recall exactly what date.  there had been a long spell of very cold weather, and everything was frozen solid.  the sighting was around 1 or 2 a.M., the temperature was probaby around zero, the air very crisp and clear, the ground had probably a foot or more of snow cover, snow was crunchy.  i don't recall a moon that night, but it was clear and very starry.  this area is very rural and dark at night, no streetlights or house lights where i was, but the sky to the east is lighter than the sky in the other directions because of the ny metro area 50 miles away causing light pollution.\r\n\r\non the night of the sighting i was in the volkswagen rabbit patrol car as usual, driving around the roads of the development.  at the time, during the day they were clearing a swamp with heavy equipment in one section of the development.  they would bulldoze the stumps into a big heap in the middle of the cleared swamp and burn them, so at night these piles of stumps would be glowing and sending up sparks, especially if the wind kicked up.  i would drive by several times during the night to make sure that sparks from the fires had not set off any brush fires in the surrounding woods.\r\n\r\non this night i was driving south on wild acres drive toward it's intersection with windwood drive.  at the time, there were no houses on the west or east side of wild acres drive on this section.  there was a swamp on the left (east) side of the road, between wild acres drive and the construction road.  this swamp was frozen solid and covered with snow.  i was on wild acres drive, about 500 to 1000 ft or so from it's intersection with windwood drive, when i saw out of my driver's window towards the east what i thought was a fire burning on the ground on the other side of the swamp.  the swamp here is about 1000 feet across, and then the ground rises up a small ridge maybe 20 feet in elevation, as i recall.  the fire was on the ground towards the top of the elevation.  it was clear, and i could clearly see the trees outlined against the snow and against the sky, which in the east was lighter than the rest of the sky, as explained above.  i thought at the time that they might possibly be clearing a new area for development, but i hadn't been told about it, and it was in an area where there had been no clearing going on the day before.  i was about 1/4 mile away, so i took out my binoculars, a good set as i recall, but i don't recall the exact specs.  i rolled down the drivers window and looked at the fire through the binoculars.  i was puzzled at what i saw, because now it looked like 2 fires instead of one, but it didn't burn like a fire.  the color was orange/yellow like a fire, but it seemed to be two balls of fire one right next to the other with no space between, side by side on the ground.  they burned steadily and brightly, not like a wood fire that flickers and has subtle color changes.  the colors were yellow/orange like a fire, but steady and bright.  i would guess that the total width was 10 to 15 feet, and height maybe 5 or 6 feet.  at a distance of a quarter mile, i could probably have blocked out the light from my naked eye with my fist on extended arm.  i didn't hear any sound at all, except for the engine running in the vw.  i looked at the fire through the binoculars for a minute or so, trying to figure out if it was a controlled burn or a brush fire, when suddenly i saw the dual balls of fire, still through binoculars, slowly rise straight up off the ground and through the trees until it was about 10 feet or so above the tops of the trees, and it hovered there for maybe 15 seconds or so.  at this time, i was just dumbfounded, is the only way i can describe it....What the h is that?  then after it hovered for about 15 seconds or so, it shot up into the sky at about an 80 degree angle from the horizon so fast that it just left a streak of yellow/orange light in the sky, like when you wave a flashlight wand at night and you see the trail of light as you wave it.  it just streaked up into the sky and disappeared.  i was certain at that point that it wasn't a fire.  i don't know what it was, but it certainly left an impression on me.\r\n\r\ni did not drive over to the location to examine the ground.  i wish now that i had, and i can't explain why i didn't, but i didn't.  i just went about my job for the rest of the night and then went home, although i did remember thinking, wow, that was different!  i didn't mention it to anybody else for a long time, but i can remember it like it was yesterday.  i never saw anything like it before or since.  i have mentioned it to my family and a few friends, but the reaction is generally skeptical.  can't say as i blame them.\r\n\r\ni have often wondered if there might have been a physical trace left on the ground...Radioactive, maybe, since any ground impression would have long been gone by now.  i have not been back to the area since 1977, although it's only a few miles from where i live now.  if i had a geiger counter i'd be tempted to go sweep the area, if they didn't kick me out.\r\n\r\nthe area surrounding wild acres lakes was then and is still very rural.  to the east is the delaware river and thousands of acres of undeveloped woodland of the delaware river national recreation area, as well as stokes state forest in n.J.  there are no airfields or military installations for miles in any direction.  what i saw was not the landing lights or running lights of an airliner flying west from newark, n.J....I see them all the time and i know what they look like coming, going and turning.\r\n\r\ni'm 54 years old now in march of 2007.  i have worked as an insurance underwriter for nationally known companies for the past 29 years.  i am married, 2 children, own my own home.  i served in the u.S. army for 2 years from 1972 to 1974, and was honorably discharged at the end of my service.  my mos was military police, i served in the headquarters of 15th mp brigade in kaiserslautern, germany as a clerk in the plans and operations section.  i had a top secret security clearance, which required a successful background investigation to obtain.\r\n\r\nhere's a link to a google map of wild acres development in dingmans ferry, pa.  the area where the object was on the ground is just to the east of the construction road.  i was looking from the car on the other side of the blank area of the map to the west of construction road, which is a swamp, sitting on wild acres drive facing south and looking east.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Google.Com/maps?Q=dingmans+ferry,+pa,+usa&ie=utf8&z=16&ll=41.217662,-74.940963&spn=0.00962,0.026028&om=1\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6684,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.22,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03292007-0001","longitude":-74.871667,"occurred":220867200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,

it appears to be similar to an object we saw in august, 2006.  it is different from an object that we have also observed over western new york since october, 2005. \r\n\r\ni walked outside to bring in my dog from the yard and i saw a very bright light in the western sky at approximately 70 degrees above the horizon.  the light was very bright, with light rays eminating from it.  the light was not as bluish as halogen lights on cars, but as bright.  i called to my boyfriend to come out and look at the light,and he confirmed that it resembled the light that we had seen in august, 2006, and it moved slightly south while we were watching it.  it had also blinked when i had first gone outside, and moved slightly south, and closer.  i took 3 or 4 photographs of the object with a 35mm camera on 70mm zoom.  i had attempted to film the object in august, but it was too dark, and the object did not appear in the film.  this film was taken at just past dusk, so i am hopeful that the object appears in the photos.  it is triangular in shape from top to bottom (appearing taller than wide), and it hovers for hours.  the object is still in the sky, in the same place.\r\n\r\ni am contacting you because i can't believe that we are the only people who have observed this object, and the silence of mainstream media in regard to these indidents is insane.  in august, we observed helicopters in the sky, that appeared to be approaching the object, and there was no mention of the incident on the news, or in the local newspapers.

as it may or may not be significant to some readers.  \r\n  when i was 18 (may of 1978) i began experiencing a series of phenomena that resulted in extreme psychological trauma.  it would take many pages to relate all that occurred, but basically, myself and a couple of friends came to the conclusion that the world was about to end.  we came to this conclusion simultaneously, albeit independently, without ever having had discussed anything like this hitherto.  ever.  we were happy-go-lucky pothead musicians. period.  \r\n        one thing that helped solidify in our minds that we were indeed being warned by \"something\" about the imminent end of the world was when a friend of ours offered to read tarot cards for us.  i didn't have a clue as to what that was all about (i was a devout atheist and darwinist at the time)but i figured, uh, go for it.  interestingly, this girl drew the tarot cards twice and they came up exactly the same each time (except for one card the nature of which was significant in and of itself).  the cards' message (at least according to her interpretation) basically confirmed our newfound apocalyptic fears.  mind you, she wasn't even sure if she believed all of this herself.  \r\n       at this time i was befriended by a 30 something women who offered to make stage clothes for me, as i was playing in a band.  i told her about my experiences and she believed me!!!!!!  she told me something apocalyptic was in fact imminent and that she had seen lights in the sky (i.E., ufo's).  being a von daniken buff, i had already concluded that whatever was warning my friends and i about doomsday must be extraterrestrial beings from a technologically advanced civilization. \r\n    one evening in june of 78 (shortly after my 19th birthday) this women called me up and told me to come over to her apartment, as the lights in the sky were going to show up that night.  she didn't call them ufo's - she called them \"the powers that be.\"  i went over to her apartment and hung out with her and her 3 kids.  i did not indulge in any substances that evening.  clich���-like, at 12am, half hanging out of her 4rth story window looking out into the night sky, i saw a bright white orb appear out of thin air and begin to slowly move across the sky.  i yelled to my friend that the ufo's were here.  she was not surprised in the least.  myself, this lady and her 14 year old son went to the roof of the building and watched these lights appear out of nowhere, travel slowly and silently or hover.  we saw planes go by - they didn't appear to be planes.  at one point, 2 of them merged and sank below the manhattan skyline.  \r\n     after about a half an hour, her son decided to go back to the apartment as it was a chilly evening and he was apparently used to seeing these things.  i thought he was nuts - this was the most monumental moment of my life and he was complaining about the cold!!!!!  after about an hour, they all disappeared and none reappeared.  i sat there with her on the roof for a few minutes after this spectacle ended in utter disbelief when all of a sudden a bright white light engulfed us for a few seconds.  i asked my friend if she had seen this and she calmly said yes.  she had tried taking photographs of the lights but nothing appeared in the developed photos.  i didn't think to call the police or check the newspaper the following day, but i didn't hear about any sightings.\r\n     i was in shock after the sighting but my friend said that it was no big deal - she saw them all the time in the daytime and nighttime.  i should add, if it makes any difference, that she was a devoted follower of alistair crowley's teachings. she and her kids often experienced strange occultic phenomena (e.G., apparitions in her apartment, her camera, only after falling off of a table by itself would subsequently take pictures of auras). \r\n     i began to read the old testament, as, being raised jewish, was the only book i had ever heard of that talked about supernatural events and i had to find an answer to all of this.  during the summer and fall of 78, many bizarre poltergeist types of experiences became commonplace for me.  i was in a state of constant fear and confusion and could find no answers as to what was happening.  \r\n     during midsummer, i told my drummer's wife about these events and she gave me a copy of the new testament.  me, a nice jewish boy from queens started reading the christian bible.  at the time, it seemed to fulfill a need that i had for objective morality, although i couldn't quite figure out what the heck the main message was.\r\n      eventually, i began to question the goodness of the \"powers\" that were essentially driving me nuts!!!  one biblical passage in the book of ephesians states that our enemies are not flesh and blood, but the spiritual powers that reside in the heavens.  i connected this with the lights that i had, by this time, been seeing on a regular basis (other people i knew had seen them as well).  very long story short: in the fall of 78 i had an epiphany of sorts and was convinced that demons were plaguing me and that jesus had died for my sins.  i heard a voice in my belly (!!) tell me this during a particularly scary poltergeist-type moment.  immediately after this happened, i experienced a peace that i had never felt from pot and booze.  i felt completely elated for a couple of days.  i was friggin' floating!!!!\r\n       although i couldn't deny what i had experienced, after a few years i fell away from the christian church.  i did so for a number of reasons: 1) i couldn't come to grips with the many discrepancies found in the bible.  2) it seemed that there was no agreement amongst the various christian denominations.  how can truth be truth if no one agrees what the hell it is? 3)  i was a very horny young man.  i prayed unceasingly to god to take my lust away from me to no effect.  4) the concept of hell, the advocacy of misogyny, slavery and genocide found in the bible was abhorrent to me.\r\n      as the years have passed since that time, i have become increasingly jaded re: faith in god.  until last year, i was a child welfare worker for 11 years.  for 11 years i dealt with neglected and abused kids and their dead beat parents.  the evils and injustice of life continually ate away at me, making me more hateful towards god than i had ever been as an atheistic teenager.  on an intellectual if not emotional level, i simply could not believe in a benevolent god. \r\n     what torments me now is, despite the fact that i cannot believe in the god of the bible or a benevolent god in general, i still to this day cannot deny the things i experienced in my late teens and early 20's.  were the lights in the sky and subsequent spooky experiences (e.G., knocks on the wall, lights flickering when i seemingly had a key thought, an out of body experience, etc.) simply hallucinations or caused by something out there?  at age 47 i still can't figure it out.\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

bright light and figured it was a star, i just looked out the window and its gone. i didn't lose sight, i was just spooked.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"11:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6674,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0142314,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03282007-0002","longitude":-121.801179,"occurred":1174978800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1174978800000,"summary":"Triangular

that night... then i noticed that a few stars i was looking at were just getting like blocked out? so i sat up and wiped my eyes and got out of the steam coming off the water and was trying to see really good, and i could make out a dark object  (the best way to discribe it is if a cruise liner was going through the ocean with not one light on, you know you can make out the shape, and tell its moving but it was totally dark) also no sound at all. this thing did not want to be seen, it came down and then whent into a clouded part of the sky, so i could see only the back part of it. it was alot..Alot bigger than i thoght ufos would be! i think the thing was triangle shaped but would'nt swear on it, the back was rectangle, but very thick, i'm telling you this thing was big. i was really in shock for a few minutes! i always heard of lights asociated with ufos. this was hard to see  but once i did...I realized there might be alot more ufos flying around than you think? this great big thing was the same color as the night sky and no lights no sound...It's a little scary. i would not have been able to track it if i wasnt looking right at those few stars but once i seen it and followed it and it came down to about 40,000 feet and then the contrast of the clouds was the only time i could really make it out.(it was very stelthy)  the whole sighting lasted less than ten seconds. anyway thats it, i never seen a ufo before or since and i'm 44 years old. by the way i don't drink or smoke anything! and i came in the house and said to my wife \"holly shit i just seen a ufo\" she said thats nice don't tell anyone else that. what i seen was real... very real.   thanks! larry  \r\n

they had seen weird living creature in the river.  people in our neighborhood are uneducated therefore they do not know what they had encounter, but story told that there was a lot of childs being abducted by this weird living creature.  my grandmother house is about 50 yard from the river and the river is where i like to hang out the most since my mother was always away for business.\r\n  i like to sit on the coconut tree leaning against the river currents, looking at the stars at night. there are several time, i had seen bright star object flying very quickly at night and scope down into the river currents.  i don't know what it was except thinking that it was a falling stars.  some night, i even seen the bright star object move out of the water very quickly and into the sky.  i was confuse about falling stars since it can move down into the river and up into the sky.\r\n  one night, i remembered it was a full moon and i can even see the full moon shinning into the river and my shadow as i walked toward the river with my grandmother.  i had asked my grandmother to come along with me that night because i was scare and i needed to go to the restroom near the river.  we do not have a restroom in the house at that time because we was poor.  as i get closer to the river, my grandmother and i saw two weird living creature sitting on the coconut tree leaning against the river currents that i had always like to sit and watch the stars.  they were talking to each other and their hands are pointing at the stars.  we were standing about 10 feet behind them therefore they don't even notice that we were there.  my grandmother was really scare that she tried to scream but her mouth cannot make any sound.  she grabbed my hand really hard because she was shaking and scare.  at that time, i wasn't scare because i can see their shadow which told me that they are not a ghost and i was amazed of that one minutes encounter with aliens.  i remembered it so clearly like it was yesterday, a feeling that i will never forget until i grow old and die.  the two alien wasn't wearing any clothes as they sit on the coconut tree with there legs hanging down.  they look so friendly and relaxing on that very warm night.  i can see their skin was very white and slippery like fish skin.  there head is so big but no hair.  it seem like they don't have any hair except white slippery skin.  their eyes are so big and dark, but shinny.  their mouth and nose are small.  i can see there fingers are long and also there tose.  they don't seem short to me even thought i was a child, but i know they are taller then my grandmother.  \r\n  i was lost in my curiousity with the aliens body feature.  suddenly, my grandmother scream so loud that the aliens turn their body around and look at us in the eyes for a few second.  they stand up on the coconut tree and dived exactly like the professional olympic swimmer diving contest.  i don't see a lot of water splash in the air and i don't see they ever come up for breathing.  my aunty and uncle rush outside the house and asked, \"what had happen.\"  i was so amazed as to what i had encounter that very night and a little regret that it end so quickly.  in my eyes during that time, they almost look like human being.  at that time, i don't really know what i had encounter but when i got into junior high in the us, then i've finally knew what i had encounter.\r\n  now that i am 35 year of age, i can finally tell a story of my one minute encounter with aliens.  i don't like to tell this story to my friends because i don't want them to look at me differently.  it is weird for people that haven't encounter with aliens, but it is amazing for me to have the opportunity to see aliens once in a lifetime.  i believe there are many undiscover thing in this world that we have not encounter and maybe we are just aliens ourselves.\r\n\r\nthank you for taking the time to read my story.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\ndai nguyen\r\n\r\n\r\n

sky.I was talking to a friend on the phone when i noticed a bright light in the western sky.I got my binoculars out,,because i have learned from years of watching for ufo's that they are a different kind of light.I watched as it began to swing back and forth like a pendulum then after a few minutes it would go in small circles in a clockwise direction ,,like a corkscrew ,,then back to the pendulum motion.After about 15 minutes it split apart and became 2 different ones.After about 1 minute it went back together and changed colors from blue to green then back to just a bright light.As i watched it would move very quickly from one position to another so fast that i would lose sight through my binoculars and would have to look to find it ,,then it would come back to the same position.After 1 hour and about 10 minutes i noticed 2 more lights come from it and went in a southern direction very quiclky and was out of sight in a blink.After another 10 minutes or so i noticed some red lights below the main one that were a lot closer to me.They appeared to be within a mile or closer and was going back and forth over the tree tops in a pattern ,,like a search pattern.This continued for at least 20 minutes then disappeared to the south and did not return until the next night at about the same time and in the same place doing the same pattern. the main light which appeared first stayed in sight until it went behind some trees out of my sight.The next 2 nights more lights appeared in the same area at about the same time,,,around 7 p.M. eastern time. they would do a seach type pattern in the sky close enough  that i could tell that they made no sound at all. i have seen several in my life ,,,the best and clearest went right over my head and was rotating with different colored lights .It was only about 1000 feet above me at the closest point and made no sound,,then made a 90 degree turn and was gone in a flash.
