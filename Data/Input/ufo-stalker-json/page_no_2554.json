(as i said it appeared to resemble mars or a star, i suppose at (star distance) ). when i went for the telascope i later learned that it had dropped down in front of nelson island and disapeared into a valley/draw on the south/ south eastern face of the island/mountain, which in turn (knowing the area quite well) told me the light was only about one quarter to one half mile away at an elavation of maybe 1 to 2 thousand feet. the approaching jet came up from behind the island as though it had been traveling at about 1 to 2 hundres feet in elavation. i flew in from the north west, my impression was that it was using the island to as cover as it snuck up from behind the light. as the jet came up and over the island the light was gone and the aircraft banked left and then right very quickly as if the pilot was trying to look directly below himself.   it flew off in the same south east direction in which it initially had been traveling. about 5 min. later either it or another jet flew in from the west directly over the area in which the light had initially been, it then accelerated noticably and flew off towards vancouver island, acctually towards comox airforce base.We continued watching the skies and had no further sighting, after about an hour we decided to go in as it was late and cold.**my distint impression was that it was watching us, watching it**   the next night we were out again watching the skies as we had done the previous night, we did not see anything in the sky that was out of the ordinary when my friend said what's that! the other fellow and myself looked in the direction in which he was looking and i saw a light on the other side of the street in which his house was located, at the enterance of his driveway he has a couple of giant boulders one on either side of the enerance. the light appeared just behind one of them as though it was peeking around from behind it. the light appeared to be about the size of a soccerball from where we were. as soon as we realized it was there (a time frame of about 2-3 seconds) my friends dog began to growl. it had been sitting with us, it did not move (the dog) i picked up my flashlight and began walking fairly quickly towards it, i turned on my flashlght and shone it towards light, i moved to the end of the driveway next to my truck and stopped and observed it. i began to evaluate the light, 2-3 seconds later my flashlight dimmed out from full light to no light in about 4 seconds. i began resonable deducting as to what it might be...The first thing came into my mind was that it was a porch light of someones house being barely visible through the trees. i realized remembered that there were no houses in that direction. then i thought maybeit was the underside of an alder leaf , when you shine a lght off the bottom of the alder leafs they are very light green/white and sometimes appear to be a light. then the thought of a light from someones house came back to mind,,....** not my own thoughts resurfacing,,,,for say but more like the thought was being put in my head. i really had the impression/feeling that the thoughts were incoming as apposed to being generated in my own head**. i remembered that i had concluded that it could not be a house light. then the alder leaf theory came back into my head so i decided to test the theory,....   i picked up a baseball sized rock from off the ground and tossed it directly where the alder tree would have been had the light actually been a leaf. my friend has several alder trees about 10 to 15 feet tall next to the boulders at the head of his driveway,...When the rock landed on the edge of the pavement on our side of the road/pavement not only did i realize that it was not a leaf but that the light was in fact on the other side of the road, a distance of (from myself to it about 45-50 feet) about 1 second after  i got a feeling of conclusion and urgency, about 1 second after that the light blinked out. more than a blinking out it was as though it had sped off directly away from me, like when on star trek the enterprise jumps to warp speed and gets smaller and smaller in the fraction of a second. there were many trees that would have been in it's way and it would have had to navigate it's way through them creating an irregular zigzag path. it did not it just blinked out, got smaller and smaller almost all at once. the light was a smoky white color not just a big dot it was like a very dense swirling ball of smoke, not a lot of distinctive lines or details just emough to be ditinguished. we began talking about it and my friend whom had initially seen it desribed it as the same swirling ball of smoky stuff but, he had seen, what could best be described as golen(ish) eye. thats it just an eye. we never saw anything else that evening.  the one fellow whom had been with us freaked out and we had to calm him down for he thought we were seeing spirits and i am pretty darn sure that it was not  for we had seen the light in the sky as well as a jet(which i am positive was a fighter jet from the comox airforce base).

past me, and leaned out of the window to see this object almost directly above me (i estimate it was 1200 feet above me).  the object was not moving and was completely silent.  as i looked up i saw a dark grey triangular object (see drawing) with two red lights and at the bottom two criss-cross long panels with white lights on them.  the strangest part of what i saw (besides the hovering with no sound) was the cobalt colored \"blue mist\" surrounding the object.  from the moment i looked at this object until it started to move was probably 5 seconds ( i had this feeling that \"it\" or \"something\" knew i was observing it, and that's why it moved so quickly from its stationary position.  when it started to move it made a low whooshing sound (almost like a \"quiet\" fighter jet and at a lower frequency).  as it moved, the \"blue mist\" surrounding it stayed with the object.  it moved slow, but seemed to get out of my sight quickly, which seemed odd.  so i probably observed this object for about 40 to 50 seconds total, with about  12 seconds looking up close (5 seconds not moving, and 6-7 seconds moving away).  i thought of trying to follow it, but didn't.  i actually felt very lucky to see something like this. it kind of hit me as i was driving away that they could have come from another part of our universe, another time of this earth (past or future), or from another

road and asked her if she knew what the flashing lights were?She said she saw them when she came down the road and saw them too.She said'lets drive down there and take a look.I said i think they are too far away as they looked like they were over lake erie.Whe got in the car and were watching the lights as we approached they were already up to where we were.We pulled over to the side of the road.As we were approaching one of them had shot away side ways and the second one seem to follow.The 3d one was starting to move away slowly as we were under or actaully it was hovering over near us.There was no sound and i guess thats what was the scarriest.They were very large.The lights kept flashing.We both got out .  i went around to the passenger side to be near my friend.I got a littl queezy and scared and kept saying what in the he-- is that.I told her we should get back in the car and we did.This object stayed over there for it seemed like 5 minutes but i guess it was only a couple of minutes.The 3rd on streak sieways to catch up with the other 2 as it seemed as though they were waiting for it.When it got nearer to the other two they just streaked and dissapeared in a distance.We got back in the car and she dropped me off without eiher one of us saying too much to each other.When i got back home i called a radio station to see if anyone called in.There was no report.I called the niagara falls  air base  there wasn't  any .Report.They gave me a number to call.\r\n\r\n  that was a governmment # for reporting suspicious things??It was friday night late and there as no answer.I waited until monday and called the nuber.I reported it what i saw and they said, someone would get back to me.No one ever did that!I have never written about it before today i was on the aol people chats and i read about other people saw things.I put my story on and last night i saw another special about ufo on tv and i decided that i needed tell someone who would believe me.As you feel like a nut and no one would beive you anyway unless they saw the same thing.I don't like to think about it and usually i don't.That is my story &iswear it is true.I asked my friend why she

went out boating on sanford lake at 5:00 p.M., march 26, 2007. we launched the boat at the sanford lake park public access and headed north up the lake. we boated for about 3 hours and headed back south toward the public access. the weather was unusually warm that day (76 degrees which broke a record from 1925!) and the sky was mostly clear. it was around 8:30 p.M. and the sun had almost set. we could see venus and several star constellations. we saw a few planes way up in the sky with their usual aviation lights. however, as we were boating south on the water, my friend noticed a big bright yellow ball of light hovering just above the tree line. from where we were, it seemed like it was the size of a jet plane and shaped like a lemon. we also saw a light beam coming out of the bottom at about a 45 degree angle. the light only emitted a short distance from the object. it was moving south very slowly and seemed to be keeping pace with our boat (we were going very slow). all of us saw the light and we watched it for 7-8 minutes and it stayed at tree line level the whole time. we then boated under the us-10 over pass. when we came out from under the over pass and could see the object again, bu then it began to rise very slowly, straight up into the sky. we watched it rise for 2-3 minutes and it ended up about 45 to 50 degrees up from the tree line where it stopped and hovered motionless. as we watched it, it looked like something wrapped around the light and it went out and disappeared. the way it went out was strange. it looked like a blanket wrapped around it, almost like a cloak wrapped around it in a counter clock-wise direction. and it just disappeared into thin air. needless to say, we were all pretty wide-eyed about the experience and confirmed to each other what we had seen. we all agreed that it was definitely not a helicopter as the shape and lights were not that of a copter and the way it just disappeared like a light being turned out was very unusual. two of the witnesses have flown many times in helicopters and are familiar with them. this is the second time i've encountered an unexplainable object in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

low rumble noise of a ship or a triangled shaped vessel that appeared out out the south east. was what seemed like it came out of a wormhole cause it's appearance was so sudden, hard a big swooshing sound at first one moment there was nothing then there it was in the evening sky clear as day. this ship slowly moved forward northwest towards the arkansas river, oklahoma border in the evening sky. the vessel was very visible at a approximate altitude of no more than 400 yards up this ship was huge about 2 city blocks wide or more.  it was like it came out of a wormhole cause right before it was there i heard a big swoosh sound or something as i stood on the porch and looked up over my right shoulder.  wow there it was i called out to my mom in the next room and at age 70 she was as much in shock as i was eek!..I freaked at first.  oh my god i said to her there it is mom, as i told my family several times i had i had seen strange vessels cruising the skies.  i hurriedly walked out to the street corner for a clearer view as it went over my head towards the northwest.  as it went out of my view the evening sky suddenly went from light evening to almost dusk, and it felt very eerie as the night went to a lighter shade dusk lighter than the left top photo sample. i have tried not to tell too many people about this even family, but i feel i must speak out via the web to try to bring light to this event. this has really traumatized me in many ways as i hardly sleep nowadays, and yes i watch the skies most nights as i listen to coast. let me just tell you my life has completely changed after viewing this event, i also have had two other encounters with alien visitations, and it had taken me years just to recall those events. what i always knew existed in my heart has become so very real to me not only in the visual sighting of this ship or vessel.\r\n\r\nlet me just say i was got very excited i left my elderly mother standing there as i ran from the porch to the corner of n 8th and q street, then i stood there in awe under the street light as it went over my head, and yes i was very afraid at first but for some reason i had to get a closer look at the event.  something else very unusual occurred to me several days later this sighting, i began to itch profusely on my skin, and did not know why i began to itch, and just did not pay much attention to it at first but as several weeks went by it got worse.  maybe, possibly i was exposed to some kind of radiation or something i'm not sure what an i hope not, however; i'm still feeling the effect of this exposure from this event. i not one to embellish any report at all, and i did send a report about this to art bell at coasttocoastam featuring mr. george noory.  i've received no response from coast to date feb.07, but note a few days later another strange thing happen to my computer hard drive when i tried to boot up to windows, i simply could not boot it up. i later found out my hard drive had been completely erased by something or someone, and all e-mail's has been deleted as well from the mail on my  mail server at at&t online services not long after i reported the sighting.  a web

tame, and it is old, but i would  like to have it on record.  i am an engineer having worked for companies involved in the design of aircraft, missiles, outer space vehicles and the like, as well as a math professor, having taught at long island university, brooklyn campus, some 25 years ago.  \r\nthis is my encounter;\r\nmy then girl friend (wife now) lived at 414 rosemont ave, la jolla, california, which is right off the beach.  on sunday night, october 17, 1965, at 7:15pm, we were walking along the edge of the beach only 1 block from our apartment. we were very startled and amazed, when suddenly there came into view 4 flying saucers, going southbound, about ��� mile inland and less than ��� mile in height.  they were flying fast in a diagonal line formation, were definitely piloted, each gently and separately undulating up and down as though slightly buffeted by the wind.  they emitted no lights and made not a single perceptible sound.  we had been easily hearing birds chirping in the distance but no engine sound or even a sound of airflow was perceptible, and the day was bright and clear and otherwise quiet. we were just out of earshot of the sound of waves hitting the beach.  these vehicles were not birds, not balloons, not airplanes, not swamp gas, not temperature inversions, not kites, not anything but saucer shaped vehicles. there could be no way we could be mistaken as everything was in day-clear close view. my eyes happened to concentrate on the under rim of the saucers. i saw a dark brown colored rim on the underside of the saucers of perhaps 2 feet in width.  the vehicles otherwise were approximately the color of aluminum. i saw 3 hemispheric undercarriages spaced circularly at 120 degrees apart.  i saw portholes.  my girl friend���s vision happened to concentrate on the top most portion and she saw yellow light in the portholes. they flew past us at perhaps 350 miles per hour and we had them in view maybe 6 seconds in all. they were less than ��� mile from us at the closest point. based on the angle subtended by the vehicles and my estimate of the distance to them, i would make an educated guess that their sizes were about 150 feet in diameter each and perhaps 20 feet in height not counting the height of their undercarriages. they flew in the direction of the san diego airport and seemed to be totally unconcerned at being seen or if it was a danger to them. they appeared to be their own masters. i phoned the san diego airport, the miramar naval station and informed them as well as the local police.  the police told me they had not received any calls thus far.  miramar naval station recorded my phone conversation but would not answer as to whether there were any other witnesses. after this encounter, my friend and i found a book in the library called ���flying saucers and outer space���, written maybe in 1955.  on one page there was a drawing of a flying saucer.  as soon as we saw it, we both said to each other ���that is just what we saw���.\r\nmind you, prior to this, i and my friend had thought that those who said they saw flying saucers were seeing things by mass hallucinations, and gave these reports no credence at all. and neither of us had read a book on this subject.  my girl friend became very frightened at this incident, and i, foolishly wished they would have just stopped and taken me aboard for a ride. but, having worked as a mechanical engineer in the space industry for 20 years, and being well up on every flying vehicle known to man, for one thing i know of no vehicle now or even contemplated, that can fly without a very noisy engine to power it. if there was a noiseless engine it would have been put to very good use a long time ago, for example on the very expensive concord aircraft, which is only allowed to fly over uninhabited areas because of the incredibly loud noise it makes.  from this fact and my general feelings about this i must conclude (the u.S. government and any naysayers not withstanding) that these vehicles are of a very very advanced stage of technology and that they are not of this earth.  \r\neli

air corps observed the object. the day was warm and totally clear.  the object was at 11 o'clock high. it never wavered, just sat there. remember,in 1944 ufo was a term unknown to us. it was not used until later. we theorized that it might be a jap balloon. but it never moved. it was shining brightly, but the sun surely was farther away. how could that be? later i became aware that some people seemed to see them glow. that bothered me for over 50 years!  i took the pains to liken it to one of several, new-from-the-factory, bright b-29 bombers that had just come to the field. we had 60 planes more or less. it appeared to be about the size of a dime on a 14 ft high ceiling. remember, we were young trained observers, in perfect physical condition. we were qualified to fly.\r\n\r\nover the years i have wsatched ufo stories on tv and elsewhere never having an answer,always just more questions. i don.T know any more now than i did on that bright morning in 1944. i spent over forty years as a professional engineer - performing structural design for all types of structures. i am a highly experienced engineer and look hard, and long at something before expressing an opinion. where do we go from here?  i'm used to scoping something out and, at least, coming up with an opinion. \r\n\r\nwhat is your scope of work?  somewhere we have to form an opinion and get over with the exercise. i am 85 and 1/2 years young, with all the smarts i ever had, i believe.  we can not keep going on and on!  as you can see, i don't have that luxury.  \r\n one thing i can say to you is that we, for the first time in our history, in 1943-'46 had about 6 b-29 fields in a 400 mile radius with 60 very active aircraft on each one.  just think about it; this was at clovis army aiffield only about 200 miles from roswell. how does that grab you?  we went to the officers club for lunch and it was gone when we returned to the flight

chicago toward o'hare. \r\n\r\nsuddenly, i noticed some lights moving very rapidly away from us -- apparently more or less horizontally -- in a formation resembling a set of bowling pins.  i don't remember the exact number, but there were either 6 or 10.  i said to my brother-in-law \"what the heck is that\" and pointed.  he looked and saw it.  about that time, the formation of lights abruptly moved vertically and accelerated.  their size dwindled very quickly until they were just gone.  \r\n\r\nat the time, i had vision that was superior to every other fighter pilot i'd ever heard of.  in fact, a flight surgeon once reported me to the commanding office of my group, claiming that i cheated on the comprehensive eye exam they give pilots because nobody could have scored so well and so quickly without cheating.  that said, within a matter of just a second or so, i could see nothing more.\r\n\r\nby the time my wife and sister could lean forward to look out the windshield -- and they
