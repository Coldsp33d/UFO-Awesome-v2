(my wife and i live in an area that is on the flight path to the halifax international airport from the western approach and see many commercial flights throughout the day and night pass overhead).I was halfway down our driveway when i just happened to look up and over towards the western sky. much to my amazement i was looking up at a large black triangle about the size of a 747. i didn't get excited but acted as though it was an everyday occurance, nothing out of the ordinary. but it was out of the ordinary since it was a large, black, equilateral triangle flying over my street at low level altitude. the triangle shape was clearly defined. at the underside of each of the three angles  was one bright white light and at the center of the underside of the craft was a red dome. it must have been a few hundred feet in the air but the craft was well defined as i said above. i thought to myself way cool man...So what the hell is that. at about the same time, coming in from the southwest was a 757; the pilots had to have seen the triangle. well anyway i went about my business and went back to the house to get a few more items that i was putting out to the side of the road for pickup in the morning; the triangular craft was still around when i got out to the street but was moving slowly in a north easterly direction as if following the street lights on micmac drive, the street where we live. the craft was not silent, but did not make the same sound that other aircraft make as they pass overhead. it was sort of like the sound our furnace makes as it exhausts up the chimney.\r\nhere is the real kicker that gets to me; we have a digital camera and because i was not used to using the thing it didn't cross my mind until later that night that i could have taken some great pics of that thing. i could have followed it down the street in lots of time to get some great shots, it was moving so slow, but i didn't.","distance":"101-500

37 triangular or boomerang shapes moving from the southwest to the northeast in a direction towards kingman, arizona. at first we both thought they were large birds, but there was absolutely no wing movements nor directional or altitude variances typical of soaring birds. and because they had wingspans that we had estimated to be \"at least\" anywhere from ten to fiften feet in length, we ruled out any known birds of that size that could soar motionless in a straight line at an angle accross the prevailing winds. there was no pattern to their flight,like a v-shape for example, but rather random 'bunching' and a couple stragglers. because we witnessed them for a period of a few minutes in which they traveled about five miles in distance, we both had time to grab binocculars and a rifle with a scope to observe them closer. neither of us could distinguish typical bird-like heads or tails or feet. the entire time we saw them there was no movement of the wings, no sound and they all kept uniform distances from each other and altitude did not change. altitude was very hard to estimate, but we thought perhaps 1500 to 2000 feet, and about a quarter mile distant from us at the closest point. it looked like to me while observing through binocculars that the tips of the wings were greyish in color whiile the main body was black. the l9cation of the sighting was one mile west of hiway 93 between mile markers 100 and 102...I know this from knowing the location of my land parcel in relation to the hiway and the direction of the flight of the unknowns. we lost sight of them as they got to small to see above the horizon, they were still moving in a straight line in the general direction of kingman. the weather conditions were very clear under high, scattered clouds. there was 8-10 mph winds from the southwest.\r\n\r\nat the time of the event we had just completed some target shooting and relaxing around the cabin area. we noticed the event because i had happened to look up and see them approaching us from the direction of the aquarius mountains accross from hiway 93, and immediately i alerted my son to them. we both later and immediately discussed the sighting and had similar feelings that it was almost surreal in that \"if\" they were very large birds (and hard to determine exact altitude or size) they moved in a continuous straight line and did not change altitude, which convinced us they were more mechanical than biological in nature.

day as it was a solar eclipse and the kids were asked to stay indoors in our dormitories. that evening after the eclipse, at around 6.30 pm or 7.00pm all the school kids assembled outside the dining hall as usual waiting for dinner. it was when we noticed, i think the whole school saw it, two glowing stationary spheres about 1/3 the size of a full moon, both were of the same size and same colour, ie. the same as a glowing bulb. there was no audiable noise. the moon was also visible seperately, we did check that, but dont remember in which direction, but it was clearly visible.The sky was clear and no clouds, however, to the left of the two spheres was something that looked very odd...A very bright orange coloured cloud or object, again stationary shaped exactly like a comma, didnt figure out if it was a cloud reflecting sunlight or an object that was glowing on its own...We watched these objects for over an hour, till we went in for dinner.The whole time we watched all three objects, the two spheres and the comma shaped cloud/object, didnt move or change size or shape. when we returned after dinner, the sky was dark and none of the objects were visible. no photographs of the objects were taken, however i d remember two or three school teachers also watched the spectacle. i dont remember anyone discussing the matter again.\r\n\r\na year later, in 1980 or 81, i was in my

and told my fiance \"look at that big plane\". then i slowly realized it was not a plane,it was moving too slow to be a plane that large and it was totally silent. one of the 1st things that i recognized was not like a plane was the lights. i see planes all the time and they have a red light on one end and a green on the other that flash in turns one at a time. this craft was nothing like that. there were 4 or 5 solid orange lights from the nose straight down the belly of the craft,one more solid orange light near the center and a bright red/orange light at the middle rear on the bottom. i could see white light flashing at the rear on both corners. these lights flashed at the same time. as the craft flew over me and was going away from me, the white lights were much brighter from the rear and the orange/red light at the center of the rear was only visible inbetween the flashes of the brighter white lights. we headed home and i was sitting in the back of the car so i continued watching out the window. we were headed north-east towards scottsboro.The craft was still visible to my right. much farther away now but still hanging around in the same general area. again...Much too slow to be an aircraft. it was in sight off and on as the landscape allowed on the way home.After we got into heavy trees and hills,i could no longer see the sky line and i lost sight of the object. i watched another craft around one month ago over highway 79 in scottsboro.This was the same road we were traveling last night as i watched the craft.The one a month ago was bright orange/red strobing.It hovered and moved left to right and stopped.It slowly moved east over lake guntersville and got brighter and dimmer.I saw 3 planes come towards the object from three different directions.Once they all got about the same distance from the object,the object vanished.I saw the triangle again tonight upon walking into my house.It was heading west but the white lights that i saw last night on the rear were not there.I could see the orange lights on the bottom and the red/orange light on the bottom rear was flashing.It was only in sight for maybe 90 seconds.I ran inside and got my mom out to see the craft for about 10 seconds before it went out of sight.I stayed outside for 5 min's afterwards, but never saw it again.My feelings were not new ones. i had experienced a ufo sightning when i was 13 or 14 years old living on sand mountain(al.) there were a lot of sightings on the news at the time in fyffe alabama.Me and my family watched that object make awesome high speed bursts and then come to a dead stop.It was never close enough to see the shape but the strobing lights and flight path were something that had me looking up at the sky every since.Until a month ago i have never again seen anything that i could say for certain was not a plane.But the object i saw over highway 79 one month ago was very close to what i saw as a teenager. what i saw last night and tonight was the 1st time i have ever seen one close enough to see the shape and detail of the lights.I was not sure if i wanted to report a month ago.I was almost ready to report last night.After i saw it again tonight i thought it was very important that i report this sighting. i am hoping there might be some other reports that will go along with mine for this area in the past month or days.I have waited almost 20 years since my 1st sighting to see another.And now that i have,i find myself reluctant to tell others because of the taunting that i had to endure as a teenager when i was so excited about watching a ufo.But i know what i have seen and i know eye witness accounts are very important to mufon.I so hope you will email me in response to this report.I would like to know if there were other sightings in my area and if the triangle i saw sounds like something others have seen.If possible i am willing to send a drawing of what i saw.Thank you....Jeremy

links for the cropped images, and the sendspace zip link for the full sized pictures. i hope it's not too much of a hassle.) also, the time stated in the form is of my main (orange ball) sighting. the other pictures are taken from various times that day. they are also in chronological order in the zip.\r\n\r\n\r\ni don't know how to go about this matter but i will try.\r\n\r\nso anyhow, i was at my fathers house for the weekend. there was an abnormal amount of contrails in the area and i felt compelled to use my camera for the first time in several months so i decided to take pictures of the trails and the scenery at my house. i will get back to that later. \r\n\r\nmy main sighting took place at around 5 or so in the afternoon. my father had asked me to go and get firewood from the barn and i reluctantly agreed. i was lagging behind a bit and by the time i left the house he was already inside the barn gathering wood. \r\n\r\nwhen i was almost off of my deck i heard the ever so familiar sound of a helicopter flying by and since i'm an avid fan of aviation i stopped and looked for the source of the sound. there was something quite odd about this sound, almost as if it were hollow, like a recording. i didn't pay much attention to this fact until i saw what the sound was coming from.\r\n\r\nthe sound was coming from a amber/orange ball type ufo that was moving at roughly the same speed as a slow moving helicopter (but it definitely wasn't a helicopter).\r\n\r\ni immediately dropped the wood carrier that i had in my hands and bolted inside the house to get my 4 megapixel digital camera. after scrambling around for it and putting new batteries inside i managed to get 3 pictures of the craft before it went behind the trees/hills. i would've gotten more, but unfortunately it was impossible to see it in the viewfinder since it was displayed as white instead of orange.\r\n\r\nthe weekend had passed and i was quite proud of what i managed to take a picture of. little did i know is that several of the other photographs had ufos in them also. the strange thing about these other photos is that i never saw, nor heard anything. and im 100% sure none of them are birds as it was a fairly barren day bird wise. this may not be related, but there was also a fairly odd x shaped contrail barely above the horizon (which would probably result in a jet slamming into the ground if it tried to make it).\r\n\r\nanyhow, enough of that. here are some fullsized, unaltered photos. note, i had to put them in a zip file and upload them to a website because all the image websites would resize the images. rest assured that there's nothing malicious in this file.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Sendspace.Com/file/grv9b0\r\n\r\nanyhow, as i said before the image websites resize my images so here are some cropped versions of the ufos. you should be able to find them easily using the pictures in the zip.\r\n\r\nthe following pictures are displayed in the same order as the zip (and order of photos taken) for easy finding. also, i never saw any of these while taking the photos except for the one i described in the beginning of course. although i did inexplicably have ufos on the brain that day.\r\n\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing1.Png\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing2.Png\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing3.Png\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing4.Png\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing5.Png\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing6.Png\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing7.Png\r\n\r\nx-contrail:\r\nhttp://i26.Photobucket.Com/albums/c141/thisisforoddwebsiteok/thing8xtrail.Png\r\n\r\nmain

pictures are not birds, aircraft, or lens dirt. i have photographed many birds and airplanes and none of them look like this.\r\n\r\nwhat i'm curious about though, is why the amber orb sounded like a helicopter (albiet hollow)? do they have the technology to disguise their craft as one of our own? maybe there was some sort of error during the process which is why i was lucky enough to see their craft.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time. also, if for some reason you need to contact me, use my email as i'm not to comfortable with putting my phone number up.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

it was either the shape of a triangle or boomerang, i could not make out a tail.  what caught my attention was its speed and altitude. i estimate that it was no more than 800ft above the ground and traveling 50 to 60mph in a straight line.  it passed overhead and over my house, i moved to the front yard to observe it's flight.  i heard no noise until it passed.  i distinctly heard the sound of a jet engine, but the volumne of the its engine was incredibly faint. the time of night this occured flights of jets over my area are rare and can be heard easily even when they fly at commercial jet liner altitudes -25 - 30k feet.  jet planes at 800 feet make a lot of noise and is easily recognizable, this craft made the sound of a jet plane, but the volumne is what you would expect to hear if it was several miles away.  after it passed overhead the engine noise quickly dissapeard.\r\n\r\nthe lighting on the craft was not like commercial aircraft.  it had what could only be described as cop car rollers on the underside of the craft.  red and white rotating lights as well as fixed position green and blue lights could also be seen.  the action of the lights were exactly like police car lights - up close you could see the beam coming off the the rotating lights.  as the craft continued on its course the lights appeard to strobe like what you see with police car lights.  these sets of lights were arranged in parallel and as the craft moved away, toward buchanan field (east of my location), it looked exactly like a airborne cop car.  \r\n\r\nthe craft never changed its course or altitude and was visible flying over martinez, pacheco, and parts of concord ca. i could see it clearly for up to fifteen minutes - its flight path looked like it would intersect mount diablo if it continued on the path i observed.  \r\n\r\ninterestingly, i noticed the craft was exceptionaly stable.  as a former pilot i can easily recognize the change in flight path of a plane that  engages its rudder, alierons or elevator to maintain level flight. this craft seemed to be flying without using areodynamics. thrust + speed + wings = lift.  this craft was not flying like a normal airplane.  \r\n\r\nmy guess is that this was not extrateresstrial, but rather a new toy for the usaf. the sound of a engine, the look of the lights, the look of it looked terrestrial, the flight behavior of it was anything but.  if i'm right, i'd like to know what how much this thing cost and what our governement intends to use it for.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
