was luminious like a star. when i look up at the sky i look to see if any thing is moving, and that is what first made me notice it. when i saw the object i was like \" not again?\" i just noticed

about 80ft off the ground, about the size of a small plane, and 4 \"huge\" lights on the front. it came about 100 feet away from us and atomaticly turned. before it turned it was going slow and the

4-wheeler up & down the street we live on.It was just before sunset & something caught my eye in the sky when they were riding up the street up hill,first it looked like a cigar shape but it was bright like a star at nite than it went up on it's side & the sun reflected off it & i seen it was a dull stainless steel color disk . i was so shocked i couldn't believe what i'd seen than it changed back to a cigar shape & flew faster than any thing i'd ever seen in my life,it flew over the lot beside our house & there came another one from the opposite direction came to a stop changed into a round tennis ball shape circled each other than took off so fast & disappeared in a flash this happened in late july or early aug. of 2005.I told my family & they said,sure you did, when i seen they really didn't believe me i didn't tell anyone else because i figured they would think i was nuts.I don't care who believes me i know what i seen & i know we are not the only ones around.I seen a totally different type of spaceship last year during the tenn. walking house celebration in shelbyville,tn.2006 there were 4 of us in the car going to the horse show coming in from m'boro,about 1/4 mile from the main street in shelbyville & i was driving,i noticed something lit up to my left in the sky not very high up,i first thought it was a goodyear blimp,until we got closer to it i seen it was'nt & it was lit up inside, i got excited & pulled the car over to the side of the road so i could see better, this thing was about 2 stories tall & hugh & just still in mid air not moving & i thought maybe it was something related to the tn.Walking house event ,than all of a sutton it started moving slow & i could see under it and it was in the shape of a triangle with bluish lights only 3, one at each corner under it,than it took off like lighting , this really surprised me something this hugh traveling at that speed,first not moving than slowly moving but not for very long than zoom gone out of sight.I've never seen anything like this before nor since.I've been watching the sky since my first sighting in 2005.I stay up all nite some nites if there's activity.I have taken pictures of some-things i have no idea what they are, maybe you guys can tell me what they are,from the ground view some just look like stars others change color & shape,but when i download them & zoom them up on the computer as you can see i see something totally different than when i take a picture of it & there is military helicopters started coming here for about the past 6 months a light like a large flashlight comes over the hill behind my home no sound goes a little ways down the fence row than lift straight up & gone,alittle while later comes 2 helicopters with sound lands than 1 takes off.When the helicopters start coming in \"they\" go up like stars in the sky,when the helicopters leave strange things start happening all over again.I've noticed it doesnt matter about the weather conditions. i need some help!!! would you please look at some of the pictures & let me know what you think these are.\r\n                                              thanks d.L.\r\n

friends ever. i still get freaked out thinking about it or talking with my friends about it. this took place a few years ago, so the exact dates and times are not so fresh in my mind but what i am absolutley damn sure about is what we saw that night.  myself and two of my best friend were hanging out, they started to tell me about something they saw in the sky the previous night,they start telling me the story, they saw red and green lights in the sky, heard loud noises echoing through the surrounding woods and echoing across the lake that surrounded the property. i was like ya know what guys it could have just been a plane,but i would find out shortley that it was no plane for sure. it was about that time to leave and go home for the night, i walked outside with my friends, was about to say goodbye to them, but i had to take a quick piss. we started to hear wierd and i mean wierd noises coming from the woods, almost like somethign had landed, or i dont know, maybe something was walking around, but the noises scared us pretty bad. i looked up into the sky for no reason at all and omg i saw what my friends said they saw the previous night, red and green like lights floating in the sky. now at first they seemed small and i thought to myself wait, they still could be planes, but no!  these things started to zig zag and i swear followed us from one side of the property to the other.  they were pretty high up in the sky though, maybe 10,000 feet.  but they were there and i am pretty sure somehow they new we were there to. so these two red and green cirlular shaped lights keep zigzagging through  the corner of the sky, we are excited and yet panicked , but what happened next and what would follow would make anyone cry...(i did)\r\none of my best friends (there was three of us) stood at the top of his drive way overlooking the ice on his lake as my other buddy and i were still looking in the sky, we kept telling my other friend, look , look...Look in the sky yo, but he was like frozen still like he saw a ghost. he pointed at the ice and said\"shhhhh\" and right then and there i shit myself i swear and i think my other friend did as well. we saw a tall object, persone, or whatever it was walking across the ice (very tall and lenghty)with long arms swaying. it was like watching a movie..This is no bullshit. we started to hear noises from the other side of the shore of the lake again and heard what i can only describe as cosmic sounds coming from the sky and woods. we lost sight of whatever it was walking on the ice (this was in february) so we looked back into the sky and it seemed as though the red and green lights that were were watching just a few minutes ago were moving away and out of our sight. we new we had to follow them, this was to good, and thrilling to miss even though i was mad freaked out. my dumb friend did not want to bring a camera because he would have to wake his father up, so we had no camera witch i regret so  so much now. we get in his jeep and try to follow the lights in the direction they went.  they went towards harmony (a small town in rhode island just a little ways away from johnston rhode island where the sighting started at my friends house. we eventually lost track ofthese light and someone in the car (one of us three said turn on the radio) we turn on the radio and the fm stations are not coming in clear at all!!  they are mostly static.  we heard that am stations come in better at night than during the day (dont know if thats true or not) so we tell my friend that was driving to put an am station on. as soon as he did my eyes started to tear, i felt so stupid but if you heard what we heard at the age that we were you would prob start tearing too.  we heard  all these different noises, bops, pings, water dripping quick kind of noises with loud commanding noises in the back ground of it( that i sthe best way i can describe it, sorry) it was so freaky. we were like, ok, we need to get to a huge clear area without light and trees to intrupt our view of the sky we have to find these things. we all looked at each other and said, the golf course (i will not name the golf course) but it is in the harmony area. we drove to the course and started to drive up the winding dirt road wich lead to th eparking lot, this was a nice wide open area.  as soon as we took the bend we saw something our eyes had never seen before. there were at least 6 very large very bright star/cross shaped lights in the sky overhead just floating around like ducks in a pond. i started to panic, i was probly the most paniced, i was so frightened that i cryed, the other guys say they didnt but i am sure they did, i dont even think it was that i was scared but more excited and overwhelmed than anything. i called my mother  and told her what i was witnessing she coulsnt believe it she to once had an experience (we both did prior to this one) she said get out of their before something happens. i had to call her and let her know because we did not have a camera.   the driver of the jeep (my friend) flashed his head lights at these 6 or so bright bright lights in the sky an dthey flashed back just as many times as he flashed his lights, i i could not f*^king believe this. i actually got out of trhe car and starte dto shake a flash light around to see if they would communicate again to us. then the flash light got dim (the batterys were not good ) and i got back into the car.  the formed a square, then a circle and then they were gone, they drifted away out of our sight. (they were about 2,000 feet in the air but looked like the size of a pretty big hous (starshaped/ cross shaped) they no longer were green/red cirlces as we had previously seen.  they were about 2,000 yards away but seemed so big and so bright.\r\nwhen they left the radio started working again.\r\ni had to have my mother meet me at my front door when i returned home.  i was so scared.  i think this is why we have kept this quiet for so long. only the three of us know what we saw that night, until now and how crazy all the events were.  we have seen some pretty creepy things in the sky since then.  if anyone saw this, please let me know. are there any hot spots  in rhode island wher e i might be able to see more of what i saw.\r\n\r\nsorry for the long story, but its true.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6577,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8878768,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03192007-0002","longitude":-71.5967307,"occurred":1077010200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Rhode

ufo's where your organization was featured i decided to write this email. the video showed an object that first appeares to fade then when i focused in, the object appeared to get brighter. i thought it was quite interesting. when i had a good shot of the object, a number of different colors appeared, from white, dark blue, burgandy, grey, and black. the object then faded and in the camera shot it reapears in the sky. the sky night was clear, also, i thought that my hand was shaking, but when i stabilized it on the balcony window( i live on the 7th floor) and got a clear focused shot of the object it appeared to be moving away and then closer and finally it was moving around as on the camera footage. later the object was not in the sky any longer. a person said it was a star but i and

the sky and then turning verticle and then disappeared. \r\n\r\nthe total time we saw it would have been about seven seconds if counting \"one thousand one...Etc.\" my daughter saw it first as we were

object from the time she said to look was a second or two. \r\n\r\nthe object was very shiny and fluid like mercury appears when it runs on a table after one of the old thermometers breaks. this shape was in the sky so very high (i do not know exactly how high it was but it was about the size of a small green pea)as we looked at it the shape was changing from that of a silver sphere that she saw to what i saw which was a silver soft curved triangle into a sharp triangle that faced us. this shape then seemed to lay down in the sky and became like a horizontal black line in the sky, no longer having its three dimensional quality.  this took a couple of moments and then this line turned verticle;then it appeared to layforward, remained for a moment and then was gone.  i did not understand how it could have such a shiny surface that appeared to reflect light when the sun was behind it as it was about 4:15pm mountain time. i do not know what it is that we saw, but i have never seen anything like it before. my daughter stated that she has seen similar things before when outside at her school.  the school is located on top of hwy. 16. \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object i wondered

know.\r\nwas this really a balloon or was it something else, i did not know.  i was not upset, but i was positively excited, as was my daughter. we watched the object as we were standing still until it disappeared. \r\ni know how to describe how it finally left. it was like on an old television that when you turn it off it makes a verticle line and then the line goes to a point and then is gone.

then the photos would have been amazing. what was weird besides the fact that a brown cylinder was just sitting in the sky, was the way that this craft flew.\r\ngravity was not an option, there was no noise from it, it was just sitting there, then it turned on edge and acended about 3 lenths of the craft, leveled off and went along about the same distance then decended the same way, then leveled off again and i thought to myself 'that's weird'. this was back in the 60's sci-fi as we know it had not come about, but even now we have nothing on this planet that can fly like it in that sort of formation and everything still has to conform to gravity. as i said as far as this craft was concerned gravity was not an option. i did not stay to watch more because assembly was at 9am and if you

pleasant night in march. after i crested the hill i was on and took a left, i saw a remarkably lit triangular shaped craft right in front of me. it was on either one of its sides where its distinct triangle shape could not be mistaken. my initial impression was that this had to be some kind of plane, but the more i looked at it, the less it looked like any conventional airplane. my next thought was that maybe it was one of those stealth bombers because of its triangle shape. but this craft had a large red, circular light in the middle of it. one white light on its nose, three white lights on its rear. i think there was one white light on the other two sides, but i can't remember that detail because i was transfixed by it. shortly after getting a good look at it, i started looking all over for a blinking light somewhere, the kind that all planes have. there was no blinking lights, the lights on it all stayed constant. the craft was on its side when i first saw it, then it flattened out as it flew off into the distance, heading west. my car has a digital compass in the top center console, so i know the direction is correct. also, i always have my driver's side window cracked to thump out ashes and to be able to hear any possible sirens. i mention this because i didn't hear any engine noise, which should have been significant because it was pretty close at first.\r\n\r\nthe details i kept coming back to were its triangle shape, large red light in the middle of it and no blinking lights anywhere. i thought as it flew off and it straightened out that i might see a blinking light somewhere on it since it was at a different angle then. no blinking lights. i've tried to figure the distance it was from my car and estimate its size, but i really can't. i wished i had taken a picture with my camera phone because it was close enough to make a good picture, but its hard to think straight when you're looking at what i think was a ufo. it was mesmerizing to look at, i couldn't believe what i was seeing. the large red light in the middle of it had me perplexed and stunned. \r\n\r\nafter turning off chalkville road, i came to a stop to look at it and had to glance behind me a couple of times just to make sure another car didn't hit me. as it flew off i drove again to try to keep eye contact with it. i did for a short while. two other cars traveling on the same road passed by going in the other direction. i shortly thereafter saw a plane fly overhead once i got to parkway east, a half mile away. i mention the plane because it was easily recognizable, as was its blinking light. i'm not sure what it was, but it was amazing looking. i wished i had taken a picture of it with my cell phone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

for the last 3 weeks i (as well as my 2 roommates) have witnessed white and red orbs flying around my home. the orbs have been seen in all directions from the house, as well as directly above the house. this last weekend the orbs were flying extremely close to the house. saturday and sunday i was able to capture about 20 pictures of these orbs. pictures were taken while the camera was on a tripod. \r\n \r\n\r\ni have a strong feeling that these orbs will be back. i am planning on capturing more images and video over the next few days. i get the impression they like me taking pictures of them. that even sounds strange to me but that���s my belief.\r\n\r\n \r\ni am willing to share my photos with anyone who would like to see them.\r\n\r\n1 - in the backyard with my dogs.\r\n2 - the objects were close to a southwest airplane.\r\n3 - a bunch of ballons.\r\n4 - it looks like a little white orb. the orbs seperate and also huddle together. when they are together, it looks like they are battling for the center position. when this happens, it looks like a bunch of ballons tumbling through the sky.\r\n5 - i was thrilled sat. afternoon to get pictues of these items. i was a little shook up when the orbs were directly over my house sunday morning. it almost seemed they were waiting for us to come outside again.\r\n6 - i think they will be back.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

morn. i was using the finder scope that came with my telescope , it has a 6 x 30 magnification and is great for viewing large areas of the night sky with a good amount of magnification. i had been out looking into the heavens for aprox. 2 hours  when a pulsating very bright ligh came into my view from the right side. the light was not blinking , but pulsating, and that in itself struck me as odd looking, the pulsation of the light enabled me to track the fligh path, had it been blinking i would not have been able to. \r\n\r\ni thought at first that maybe i was looking at sevral lights independant of each other. i thought this only for a split second when i pulled the scope away from my eye, only to not see anything. i quickly re-positioned the finder scope and to my utter amazement, the pulsating light moving extremely quickly across the sky  performed a triangular flight pattern before i lost it behind the trees or it took off so fast that i could not tell if it had disspeard behind the trees or just took off. \r\ni think the object was very far away,while not visible to the naked eye , i could clearly see it through the high magnification of the finder scope.\r\n\r\ni now go out every night between 2-4 am and just use my binoculars to scan the heavens and to behold the beauty of the constellation that are not clearly visible with the naked eye, and for whatever else i might be privy to behold amidst the starry skies.\r\ni actually cried after seeing this performance- i never thought i would be privy to such an incredible display of aeronautics. i have read about various ufo sightings , and had i not read previous info , i might not have recognized the mportance of what i saw, the pulsating -electro magnetic self illuminated light in the sky- perhaps in space, and then to witness the incredible manuevers i witnessed - wow - what a joy- i too can now say - i have seen something , i know not what for sure, but there is a good possibility that it was a ufo of the type most commonly seen by those who have truly seen these crafts and know their behavior.\r\ni count it all joy- what an earth we inhabit.","distance":"Over One
