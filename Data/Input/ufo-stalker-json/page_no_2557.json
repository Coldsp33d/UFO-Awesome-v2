and no tail.  it was very shiny silver and was approximately 3 football fields in length it seemed anyway.It was  very straight, no curves.  it was quite far away but i could see it clearly.  it was a long cylinder with  3 things on the top of it that looked like fish gills sticking up. in comparison to the cylinder, they were very small, one in the front, one in the middle and one at the end, but they were on top of it, not to the sides and not underneath. it was traveling slowly from the south to the north and then dissappeared. it was moving in a steady motion, not wiggily like the saucer ufos many times do. i wasn't surprised to see it because i have seen ufos quite a few times. i just wish i had gotten my camera and taken a video or snapshot. it was really beautiful. it was so shiny and silvery.  i was not afraid. actually once about 40 years ago i saw a similiar object in shafter, california. but it was red, like blood.  it also passed overhead at a slow steady pace.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

about the size of a stealth fighter. the size of it with no noise totally scared me. the only way i saw it was because i was looking in the right place at the right time or you would have never seen it. it was traveling east to west in a straight line. approx. dupage airport toward dekalb. just north of rt. 38. i called the local police dept., but no one had reported anything. i did notice the

my thumb nail at arms length.  object/light hovered in one spot for about 2 minutes, then disappeared when camera auto-focus beam went off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis sighting just happened last night.  i was at the computer...My wife was doing the dishes...We both kept hearing an unusually loud, low pitched, rumbling sound, going overhead...We could not tell, from inside if the sounds were jet engines, or the wind.  i had gotten up and looked outside on three earlier occasions to see what it was, or if i could see something flying overhead.  there was, in fact, a constant howling wind all evening.  but, there also was a steady stream of jets, aircraft, or something overhead.  i couldn't see them because of the cloud cover, but i could hear them, that is, apart from the wind.  and, i could hear the doppler pitch change in the engine sound as they passed by.\r\n\r\nexcept for the chemtrail planes (i have 100���s of photos) there are no regular flight paths over my place at this time of day, and very few at any time of day. there also are no major airports nearby.  we have two community airports, potsdam & massena, each about 12 miles from my location; one due west, one due north.  fort drum is approx 80 miles southwest of my location.  there were no stars or moon visible, there was a low cloud cover, and it was quite windy...I could not tell from inside if the sound i was hearing was the wind or a jet engine...Which is why i kept going outside and checking.\r\n\r\njust before i went outside for a fourth time (and this is where it gets a little weird), i said to my wife: \"i keep getting a sensation like i am being watched, or stared at;\" like when someone is standing behind you and is staring at you, and you can almost \"feel\" it.  the thing is, she was off to my left, in my field of vision, doing the dishes; and we live alone?\r\n\r\ni went outside and this time there was a single very bright white light, shining like a star over my neighbors barn, who happens to be a detective with the nys troopers, and who was outside with his family observing and commenting in an excited way about the light/object...It wasn't reflecting like the moon...It was shining, sparkling, or emitting light, and so bright, i could only see light, i could not see an object, just a source of light.  i was looking slightly north of west, up at an angle of approx 35��� from the earth...The object was slightly smaller than my thumbnail extended at arms length...There were no other lights in the sky...I live in the country, there are no streets lights or other forms of light pollution.  the object must have been quite low in the sky, because there was a low, visible cloud covering/ceiling last night.\r\n\r\ni asked my wife to get my camera, a canon power shot s2-is (it gets a little weirder here).  as i pulled the camera up to my eye, i was thinking i was going to have trouble finding the object in the viewfinder, shooting in total darkness and all.  i was surprised to see the object, right there in the view finder, no problem at all finding it...I zoomed in some on the object and was i thinking; ���i'll take this picture, and then i'll take another with the flash up/on and see if the object responds to it.���  i had the auto-focus on, and when i squeezed the shutter to focus, of course it shot out that green laser beam.  then, just as, perhaps slightly before, the shutter went off (i have the camera set to make a sound like an old 35mm) and there was a slight delay in the shot because the camera had set the exposure to 1/8 of a second���. right at that instant, just after i zoomed in, and just before the camera locked on and froze the image, a split second before the shutter went off, i saw in the view-finder the object change from a bright shining white light, to a blue sphere with white light shining through the blue with a blotchy sort look...It kind of looked like one of those pictures of the surface of sun, except it was blue...That's when the shutter went off...And that is what the picture shows. i can���t say if the object actually changed in appearance, or if it was the ���zooming��� that caused me to see it differently?  my wife didn���t see what i saw, the change in the objects appearance from bright a bright white light, to blue sphere���she had just turned to shut the front door, it was chilly out, and when she turned back, she asked; ���where did it go?��� \r\n\r\ni could not see the object in the viewfinder anymore...It seemed to just disappear���.I didn���t even think i got anything on the exposure.  i pulled the camera away from my eye to see if i could re-find the object without the camera.  there was a glowing in the cloud cover where the object had been.  i could hear my neighbor and his family saying to each other; ���did you see that?������everyone sounded quite excited, so were my wife and i.  it looked as if the object was now above the clouds and illuminating them from above.  although, i could not see anything of the object anymore, or make out any shape...Just the clouds slightly illuminated from above where the object/light had been.  the illumination was growing fainter quite fast...So, i pulled the camera back up and tried to get a second picture...It doesn't show much...Just looks like there���s some slightly illuminated fog.\r\n\r\ni haven���t talked to my neighbor yet.  i hope to see him tonight, or perhaps this weekend.  also, after i took the pictures���i remembered that i hadn���t yet changed my clock on the camera, which is why the time stamp is an hour off from my reported times.\r\n\r\ngreg\r\n\r\nps:\r\n\r\nwhen i first dowmloaded the pics from my camera, i could not see the object in the piture onmy monitor, just black. however, i could see it in the view-screen on the camera.  i discovered my monitor settings(brightness & contrast) were off a little.  after i adjusted the settings, i could see on the monitor what i can see on the camera.\r\n\r\nps-2:\r\n\r\ni have cropped, enlarged, and auto-enhanced a photo.  i can't see where to upload/attach the photo on this extened form.  i will try to send a follow up.  i hope it all ends up at the same place?\r\n\r\ngreg

had to climb down to use the bathroom. the bathroom was halfway down the hall between the bedrooms and the living room. the living room was dark, but the bathroom light was on so i had no problem getting up to go. i went back into my room to go back to sleep. as i was climbing up to get back into bed, i saw a glowing orb outside my window move diagonally up and to the right slowly. it disappeared from view. i was in shock and scared, but i still ran to the window to see it. in the short time that it had moved out of my view and me running to the window it had disappered. it was by far the most frightening part of my life. i told my friends and i told my sister, but to this day i have not told my parents do to the fear of them not believing me. one scarier part of this is the fact that you would think this was a once in a lifetime event. something you would see by chance just once. it happened again two nights later. same events. i woke up to use the bathroom, but this time i checked my parents clock as i walked by their bedroom. the time was 3:35 am. i saw the orb and when i ran to the window it wasn't there. the second time i saw it i turned the lights and the television on and slept on the floor at the foot of his bed. i never told my brother or my parents about the experience. so far i don't think anyone believes me, but it doesn't matter because i know what i saw. it was to close to be a plane. it made no sound at all. it happened twice. it didn't move fast from what i had seen and it disappeared instantly. i was twelve when this happened. the only

coffee and watch the stars, partially to be romantic and we like to watch satelites, meteors,etc etc. we probably went down by the sea wall/beach area about 11:00 pm. we seen maybee 5 or 6 shooting stars or debris burn up as they came through the atmosphere. anyways, about 3 in the morning as i lay looking up, scanning the sky for anything, i arched my head back and looked over my right shoulder as my feet were pointed west, looking to the north, i looked over and i seen somthing behind me,which was east. i seen seven crafts flying very fast. as they came directly over me, i counted them,thats why i said seven, not several.Anyways the wierd thing is, that as i watched them fly, the ones in the front on the formation would take turns going to the back and middle of the formation as they all kept flying forward. real fast changes in the formation. i would guess they were flying at about 20 thousand feet. they didnt make any sounds at all and they all radiated fuzzy green glows.From the horizon behind me, where they first caught my eye, till they were out in front of me was about 3 or 4 seconds. a jet at 30 thousand feet is traveling well over 500 mph and as you know,they still seem to be almost standing still. what i seen was moving way to fast for our planets technology. they must of covered atleast 30-40 miles in 4 seconds or so. like mach 20 30 40 or somthing crazy like that. then they stopped all at the same time and just hovered together for 5 seconds and all at the same time, went up, fast, real fast. from the time they hovered together until they shot straight up and out of our atmosphere was probably 2 seconds and they were gone. thats basically it. call if you want more detail. thanks, brian","distance":"Over One

to determine because of their flashing lights and engine noise.  the white light then began to move while pulsating between colors in a zig-zag motion northeast to southeast.  it almost appeared to be a fiber-optics strand with only the end visible being swung through the air.  i wondered why would intelligent beings do stupid things like that. the light then dimmed to a low brilliance white and

walking, aliens have been visiting our planet, to pack up something important to them, in more recent time, one alien civilization has have been using mostly women. another group is more concerned with our nuclear capability, our attempts to put nuclear capabilities into the universe and the fact humans can���t stop killing each other, by the millions. i have been showing (1969 to present) thousands this portal and 99% of them can see what is taking place today. in september 2005, the portal was shut down/closed by an alien security force. there have been three extremely powerful alien security ships controlling who leaves and who arrives. many watched in august 2006, has an alien ship attempted to enter the portal to leave, one of the reddish glowing alien security ships intercepted it then blew it too bits. has the ship, what was left of it, reentered our atmosphere, it looked like a space object was falling with hundreds of bright white materials flying into the north pacific ocean, northwest of seattle. many persons called into the nw news reporters and stated what they thought they saw, but i received emails and phone calls: ���ted, did you see what just happened? you were right, you have informed all of us, that the planetary ships stuck here on earth have to leave, they can���t stay here forever, you were right.���\r\n\r\ni worked for a telecommunications corporation, responsible for our us government and military communications, thanks to this job and because the corporation system had serious problems, i was sent to location i would never have been able to visit, let alone work on top secret sites/locations/systems. seven times, i was sent to nellis afb too resolve issues that no other department/personnel could, several times this included area 51 and the 2nd valley (underground nuclear engineering/scientists /physicists) what i saw where alien grays that look just like 6��� 2��� strong humans with several exceptions: ���they are grey/no hair and only wear special grey clothing, of course it���s a possibility they do wear something else but completely grey jumpers. humans can not work in the 2nd valley where nuclear underground testing takes place.  i would love to tell all what i have seen���..Maybe in person and after several alaskan amber beers. enjoy, hundreds of thousands are watching including the dod/norad/nasa.\r\n\r\nsomething is happening ��� extremely important ��� do our governments know about this? yes  \r\n\r\ni���ve been watching a special location in the heavens for 30 years, (ufo universe freeway entrance/portal) and have seen several hundred mother ships and planetary vehicles come and go. since august, something has changed.\r\n\r\nthree (3) small red alien ships are controlling the entrance. i've not seen one alien mother ship come or go since this started. they move fast, they chase one another, they hold in place; this has been going for several weeks now. you don't require anything more than your own eyes. but you have to be in a dark location, you will not be able to see them if your in a city. if you can see the big dipper, look to the south around arcturus and watch between 9 pm and midnight. they are too dark and move to fast to record with any normal camera.\r\n\r\ni think they���re here for a reason. are they protecting our planet for some reason? \r\nif so - what? - why?\r\n\r\nthey have to be security ships - very powerful and are controlling what alien civilizations visit our galaxy - what other reason could there be?\r\n\r\ni hope you can see the big dipper from your home. good luck, enjoy, this is exciting, but scary at the same time! \r\n     \r\n \r\nthe 3 ships spend time parked lined up with muphrid, then they travel

a parking lot waiting for my friend. i looked up at the sky as there were many chem-trails which i love to try and figure what aircraft made them, at one point as i was looking up, i saw a black triangle shaped craft doing maneuvers like an old bi-plane except it was up so high it could not have been a bi-plane. the maneuvers the craft was doing was just unbelievable.  all of a sudden, a second craft (same shape) went next to the other object and started doing the same types of maneuvers, again the maneuvers were awesome and so unbelievable, there is no way conventional aircraft were involved. the first object that i had witnessed took off to the south east at an incredible rate of speed. then the second object followed the other one again at a very high rate of speed. i do not know what i saw, but i can say, that there is no way these were conventional aircraft, if they were from the military, they must be very highly classified aircraft. i leave it up to you to decide what these objects are, i truly can���t say what they were. any questions, just send me a message.\r\n\r\nthank you for taking time to read my experience.\r\n\r\n\r\ni have no pictures or video, this is

noise.  we watched thru the window as it moved northwest at rapid pace.  there was at least 3 white lights in what seemed to be in a triangluar pattern. it went to the area of the kansas city downtown airport, seemed to hover, the white lights went off, but red lights came on in the same pattern, then it seemed to disappear for maybe 5 seconds.  it reappeared over the area of the airport, still hovering, went north slightly, went south slightly, hovered over the same area, the white lights came back on, and then it quickly moved south.  we watched until it went behind the downtown skyline, and we lost it.  there was no noise, no sound.  i called 911 and the operator asked my location, i described what i saw, and i asked if there were any helicopers flying in the area.  she said no, and that my call wasn't the first one she had gotten about the incident.  after the call, 5 minutes later, i went outside on the fire escape\\balcony and noticed 2 helicopters going towards the airport with spotlighs on.  we called the local fox newsline and told them what happened.  it moved too fast for a helicopter and too quiet for a plane and it moved fast.  please contact us, we are excited

the stars were at their peak, as if you could reach right up and touch each and every one of them! we were talking about the sky and different star clusters when all at once something strange was appearing to come right at us. as this thing got closer to us, i asked my parents,\"what the hell is that?!\" my mother just looked at the thing as if she couldnot believe her eyes. my father said,\"i be damned if i know! we just watched as it hoovered over the house behind us, which is appro. 75-80 ft away from us. the lights on it were flashing in sequences like christmas tree lights. we just stared. i told my moma and dad, i had to go in and get my husband so he could see this and that he would never believe it if i didn't but at that moment it was as if i couldn't take my eyes off the lights! it was like something out of tv or a dream! finally, i ran in the back door, and yelled for him to come out now! i turned around and ran back out. just as i got out it shot right straight up and disappeared! i said \"where did it go?\" and my mom said up somewhere?! she said, \"i'm 69 years old and i have never, never seen anything like this in my life and probably never will again. i think if there is such things as ufos, we just saw one!\" my dad said, \"well, i think we just saw exactly that, a ufo!\" i personly was still shaking from seeing this thing. when my husband came out and we told him what happened, he just looked at us as if we were crazy and so does people that i tell about it. but it happened and i'm glad i got to witness this with my parents because my mom died in april of 1998 and my father died in june of 1999. until they died, we spoke often of what we witnessed that beautiful night and wonder what and where it came from. even a week before my father passed away, he and i were telling a friend of his about it. he was in the hospital at that time and later this man asked me if it were true. i told him, \"i promise you on my son's life it is true!

noticed several jets creating contrail in the sky. it was at this point that i noticed a spherical object hovering and bobbing in the n/e sky. the object was shining brightly in the blue sky, but i noticed its wobbling i would often see a dark undercarriage. additionally, the sphere was moving very slowly and then looked to be stationary.  \r\n\r\n\tat this point, i pulled my vehicle into the first baptist church parking lot and observed the sphere. the parking lot is on the corner of ridge and walnut, i was going east on ridge. additionally, the object was positioned in the n/e sky. i though the sphere might have been a balloon let go, but it seemed somewhat larger and brighter than what one might expect and something did not seem right about how it wobbled. i exited my vehicle and observed the object for approximately another 3-4 minutes. the sphere appeared to be hovering while i looked n/e.  i continued to walk towards the sphere hoping to get a better look.  \r\n\r\n\tunfortunately, i was not able to find anyone who could also observer this sphere in my general area. at approximately 13:14 pm (eastern standard time), i noted something shoot off of the sphere. this object seemed to by cylindrical in shape and was wobbling itself, but moved slightly quicker than the original sphere. within a few seconds, i lost sight of this object (faded out of sight?). at approximately 13:16 pm (eastern standard time), i lost sight of the sphere. i scanned the sky for a few more minutes, but the object was no longer visible. at this point, i returned to my vehicle.\r\n\r\n\tat this point, i am unsure of what i witnessed. it was probably terrestrial, but it certainly caught my attention. in fact, it reminded me of the videos of the mexican ufo���s and the grainy footage of military test objects viewed in florida. if you have any questions feel free to contact me via phone or mailing, but i would prefer to remain anonymous at this juncture.I was surprised to see the object, but was more curious than frightened. i am sure there is some logical explanation for this event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\ns.
