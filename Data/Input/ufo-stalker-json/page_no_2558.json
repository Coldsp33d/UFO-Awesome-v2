an extension on the second floor, which is outdoor. we had clear sky with clouds passing over. then one of the witnesses (woman) noticed a punctual object moving high in sky to the south-west and disappearing. during the event the witness called the attention of the other 6 (six) gathered in the same place of the house and we all could see the object moving away. then right after that the same first witness noticed another object stationary high in sky, more than 1.000 meters above the passing clouds almost at zenith. the object remained stationery until a cloud passed over it. when the cloud was gone the object also was gone. the first object that moved in south-west direction had the speed evaluated to be at least 300 km/h or higher when it disappeared. after the second object disappeared after the cloud passing, the second object returned in a slower speed and stopped high in sky at an altitude evaluated to be of more than 1000 meters to the south at an angle to be estimated, but i believe it to be around 70 degrees in ascension. the object remained stationery until another cloud passing over hid the object. after the cloud moved away the object was gone. 13 photos ware taken with an slrd camera, in 80mm and 300mm telephoto lenses, of the second object, the one that moved before and after. but as the camera is digital, aps sized ccd sensor, there are considerations to be taken for the true focal length, because the lenses were designed for a 35mm non-digital film.\r\nwe thought the objects could be balloon probes from the brazilian air force at jk airport in brasilia. we had contacted them by telephone and e-mail  and they said that at that given interval of time on saturday 03/03/2007 there were no meteorological balloons over brasilia. they launch balloons at 9 o'clock in the morning and at 21 o'clock in the evening. everyone was very excited about the sightings. also the meteorological service in brasilia (inmet) was contacted by telephone but they do not launch balloon probes.\r\n\r\ni also would like to mention a previous sightings about 20 days before this one, with no photographic evidence, of three objects, two moving in parallel trajectory and blinking, and one stationery in the sky while the other went past. this time the two objects were extremely rapid, ant the stationery one disappeared after the passage of the other two.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks. pedro luz cunha (revista ufo consultant, cbpdv associate with a.J. gevaerd).\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

out.  just about parallel with the position of the moon.  i was still able to see the first object when the second object reached the first object's position, but parallel and it also faded out. after about another 30 seconds i was unable to see any of the objects.  i realized that the objects were not moving in a northeastern direction, i would have seen them floating over ahead like satellites would in orbit.  have witnessed satellites in orbit before.  my conclusions was that the objects were moving straight up into the sky.  waited for several minutes to see them reappear or something,

weekend in rocky point, mexico. we had left the town of why, az and i had been driving for a while. my husband was asleep. there was no radio reception in the area and i figured it was because we were going through the reservation lands. traffic was very sparse. i was contemplating a roadside pit stop and was looking out for a likely place to turn off.  i spotted several dirt roads running perpendicular to ajo hwy but they each had a parked car, perhaps 50'from the intersection, with its headlights turned on and pointed at ajo road. it was as if they were watching something. i thought it was strange. plus, it prevented me from stopping.\r\ni kept on driving when i noticed in my rearview mirror that everything behind me was pitch black. looking forward through my windshield was a beautiful bright starry sky. i thought it was awfully quick for a rain cloud to appear, so i turned to look behind me several more times. then i leaned forward over the steering wheel and i looked straight up.  i saw silently gliding above me a huge solid black morphing metallic ufo. it was so huge and so close (15'-25')that all i could see was a rounded nose cone with two, of what were surely many, gigantic round lights. i thought it was trying to remain unnoticed, because when i would lean forward to get a better look  i would inadvertently ease my foot off the accelerator, it would end up gliding over the automobile hood and then quickly try to pull back to my speed. i did this a few times to be sure. i just felt my adrenaline rushing. in my head i kept saying \"this can't be happening\" over and over and over. i stayed calm but inwardly i was extremely panicked. after two good looks,and concluding that it was real, i leaned over and awakened my husband, calmly but urgently and asked him to look too. yep, he saw it too. i remember trying to get the exact time and knowing that i would forget it, i noticed that it was dusk.  that i can remember.  for a brief moment i just gave into the helplessness of it all.  irrationally, i thought that if i would stop the car that it would be the end of us.  to continue driving would keep us safe. made no sense.\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes the space ship just shot off at \"warp speed\" and i got a good look at it. it stayed low and headed to and along a large mountain range.  then it disappeared.  it was about a third of the width of the mountain range-that could be a mile or more. i lighty predicted that it was headed for prescott.\r\n\r\nonce we recovered our sense of control, i tried to find a radio station but nothing came up until we were almost to kitt peak. (i think about 45 minutes) i was so sure that this was \"the day the world stood still\". when we got to the outskirts of tucson, the radio stations skeptically reported that there were lots of ufo sightings in pima county.  we got home at 9:55 pm and i didn't help unload the car until after the tv news was over. it's amazing that the whole incident was so successfully margionalized.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":6516,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.268672,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072007-0005","longitude":-112.7387586,"occurred":858310200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,  Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":858310200000,"summary":"We were driving on a 2-lane highway when we were shadowed by a ufo.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Why, Arizona","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:477913"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Gainesville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ufo sighting  22:34 2/20/07 north central florida, north of gainesville by about 20 miles. \r\n\r\nshape ��� changed   duration ��� 45 minutes\r\n\r\ni think i got to bed around 10:20.  after i was in bed, i had to get up and write something on the computer.  the first thing i grabbed to put on was a t- shirt given to me by  a couple who used to run the mufon of tampa/st.Pete with a green alien on it in a santa suit.  i was pleased that i had grabbed that shirt in the dark (it had not been worn since december), jumping to the conclusion that since i was getting something to put on to get up and write, the shirt (that former chapter leaders of mufon had given me), was probably electronically chipped.  (ok, so a lifelong knowledge of ufos has made me a little paranoid.  i had a daytime sighting in 1961, when i was 11 with 2 hours of missing time.)\r\n\r\ni sat down and typed a few words.  my dogs started barking, i let them outside, noting that the clock above the door said 10:33, and i sit back down at the computer, but the barking persists and seems to beckon me outside.  it was chilly in n florida, 54 degrees, so i put on a sweater and ran outside to see what they were barking so incessantly at.  \r\n\r\ni went outside and stood on the porch and looked up. there was a white light blinking intermittently and after about 10 seconds changing to a triangle with a light on each corner, red, green, white.  the single white light flashing light at the beginning of the sighting was about the size of 4 stars together and the triangle it turned into, the sides were as long as two aspirins at arms length   it was intermittent red, green, white,   flash...Flash������. .Flash flash flash flash.. flash  (estimation, not exact sequence) and not regular, the time between the flashes was not the same each time.  the lights were beautiful.  it danced around the sky and i said to it ���hey, wanna take me for a ride?  come get me, only this time i want to remember!���  i watched it dance around.  for a minute or two it blinked here and then there, like the cheshire cat in the right hand quadrant of my area of view.  then it went to the left and stopped and zig-zagged. it blinked out and then reappeared a few times.  it flew to the left a few inches in the sky.  at one point the triangle looked like the edges were lit up, pale yellow lines were visible on two sides, and it seemed to have an ultraviolet glow.\r\n\r\n then, it flew out of sight to the left, traveling about a foot at arms length, across the sky. as it disappeared behind the trees i sang ���hey, mr. spaceman���, (mcguinn).  i continued to stare at the sky hoping it would re-appear.  just to the left of the tree line, flash���flash.  large white blobs of cohesive light about aspirin size at an arm���s length and about an inch apart at an arms length.   the flashes were a couple of seconds apart bright white, except there were no rays of light coming from them.  that���s why i call them cohesive light.  and, the strangest thing, they were blobs, not round.  they were unevenly shaped and the two were not identical.  \r\n\r\nafter the white flashes, which lasted maybe 5 seconds, they winked out at the same moment, a plane flew in the same direction.  i could hear the plane. the ufo was silent.\r\n\r\ni went back inside to write about it and looked at the clock on the computer- 11:20.  i didn���t realize until i had written for about an hour and it and it was 12:30 that i had probably had some missing time; not that that matters.  (lea hayley had an experience once where they brought her back a few minutes before she last looked at the clock.)  i figured that the sighting lasted maybe 10 minutes but not the 45 minutes that passed.\r\n\r\ni know i should have run back inside my house to grab my camera and my watch but i was too excited to think of that.  i should have counted seconds and numbers of flashes and paid attention when the triangle was heading in one direction as to which color light was the leading one, but i didn't think about it until the sighting was over.  i have not yet drawn any pictures.  i did not have my glasses on.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":6515,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6598744,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072007-0004","longitude":-82.3149362,"occurred":1172039580000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,  Triangle,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1172039580000,"summary":"Flashing white light then triangle shaped craft with 3 lights- red, green and white","tags":["lights","triangle","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Gainesville, Florida","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:477914"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Kansas city (biggest)","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on the phone with an attorney and looking out the bedroom window of my second story apartment. i noticed an object that i first thought was a very large bird moving south to north approx. 1/4 mile away and approx. 1500 feet in the air, as it got closer i realized that it was not a bird nor a plane. the object moved in a straight line across the sky, it started out slow moving and then fast and back to slow. the object did not spin, rotate or change altitude while it moved. i lost visibilty when it flew into a cloud formation approx. 2 miles away. i was in shock at what i was seeing and couldn't believe it was so visible in the daytime sky, i made several explictives to the attorney i was on the phone with and ran to get my wife up from bed in hopes of seeing it again with an witness; the object never returned. the object was moving in the direction of the international airport in kansas city missouri, it was low enough to have enough visibilty to see that it was not any kind of commerical or military aircraft.

paying much attention to the sky as i headed to an elevated train station a few blocks away from my home. but i had just missed my train as i was climbing the stairs to the platform, at around 5:52 p.M., i knew i was definitely going to be late, because i had to be at work at 6, so i decided to relax since i was going to be late anyway. i walked to the middle of the platform, which is my favorite spot because there���s an open lot behind the station and a clear view of the sky. i listened to my mp3 player for a few minutes and for some reason i decided to turn east and face that open parking lot, this was probably at 5:56 p.M. \r\n\r\nwhen i did i noticed a round brightly lit ball just sitting in the sky. the lights didn���t blink. so at first i thought it was a plane, because i wasn���t expecting to see something different than that. i soon realized that it definitely wasn���t a plane because it was dark outside, and at night planes aren���t brightly lit, nor are they extremely visible, and this object was. planes also always move while they���re mid-air, and they���ll appear larger or smaller eventually depending on which direction it���s heading. this object didn���t move, and it appeared the same size the whole time i looked at it. then as i looked further past it, eastward, i saw two other objects that were identical to the first one. they all were in a perfectly straight line with one another, the line made a diagonal from where i was standing. all the objects in the line didn���t move either. i know they had to be miles apart realistically, but from where i was standing they only seemed about 50 ft. apart from one another. \r\n\r\nsuddenly i saw the first object head westbound straight across the sky, it covered the distance pretty quickly, i���d say a little more quickly then the average plane would, but not astronomically so. i didn���t hear any noise as this happened. the other objects stayed in position and didn���t move. about 30 seconds after seeing this, my train arrived at my platform; this was at 6:02 p.M. i kept my eyes eastward and on the sky for the length of my trip. as soon as we���d covered about 4 or 5 blocks, i noticed that there hadn���t been two other objects behind the first one that had flown off. there had actually been 3. i saw that even though this was one was the furthest away from me, it was a brightly lit object, looking identical to those others, and it was next in the diagonal line, and it too just sat there in the sky as well.\r\n\r\nmy train headed north to the downtown section of chicago, and even as i covered at least 30 blocks worth of distance, from the original point at which i saw the objects, they were still very visible, and very bright, until some of the high rise buildings started to block my view. i know that they weren���t moving still. my trip to downtown took about 15 minutes, because i arrived at work at 6:17 p.M. as i said, a few minutes before, my view of the objects had been blocked, but my eyes were still on the sky in case there was a clearing. i didn���t see the objects again, but i did see another aircraft flying a few miles higher than me, but parallel to the train i was on. i only glimpsed it for a few seconds because the buildings blocked my view. it could have been just a plane, but it was so low, and i think there���s some sort of a no fly zone, in downtown chicago, so i don���t know why a plane would fly so close in that area. this is the only object whose shape i can���t describe really describe, it was possibly rectangular, but i didn���t get to really look at it. i just remember it flying in between one of the high rises, and it was brightly lit, but the craft itself was dark probably brown. i felt that it looked odd because it didn���t look like a plane, yet it was flying, it almost seemed to be rectangular. but it was definitely bulky and heavy, looking, and it was headed northbound, it quickly disappeared from my view, which was probably because of the buildings, not because of the object itself. i don't know what this object was, but i'm pretty sure that it wasn't a plane at all.\r\n \r\ni eventually went to work for four hours but i really hoped, that the objects i���d seen by my house would still be there when i got off, so that i could show someone in my family what i���d seen. i headed home on the train and arrived at my stop at around 10:30. i didn���t remember to look at the sky when i was on the platform because i was in a rush to get home, but when i was on the ground, about a block east of the train station, i walked southeast where there���s an open area of sky because of a parking lot. as i was crossing the street and heading south, i saw one of the objects or perhaps another one that was in the same vicinity of the ones i���d seen earlier. it was way closer to the ground than the ones had been earlier. i made my way onto the sidewalk and realized that the big concrete roof of the parking lot was blocking my view. so the object had to be very close to the ground because the roof of the parking lot is only about 15-20 ft high. i decided to back up a few feet in order to walk in the street so that i could get a good look at the object. \r\n\r\ni did, and basically i saw an object that resembled a saucer, but it wasn���t a flat thin disc, it had layers. the top layer was full of deep burgundy lights and so was the bottom one, i think they were on but they were very dull and nearly blended into the dark sky, that���s probably why i didn���t see them earlier. but the center layer was bright, bright white. the whole object was saucer shaped, and all of the lights looked like they were framed by rectangles. so they just looked like panels of lights. whatever was holding all of these layers together wasn't very noticeable because it wasn't illuminated, but it was thin and either black, or dark gray like metal. \r\n\r\ni do not know if i���d imagined it from the influence of tv and movies, but i do remember thinking that it hovered and rocked a little, instead of being completely still, but that could have been my mind adding that part because i was moving and i was so excited. as i kept walking south, my view was blocked again by the roof of the parking lot, so maybe the object had moved. about 20 seconds later, i���d moved past the parking lot���s roof, and parallel to the entrance of the parking lot. the entrance of the lot isn���t enclosed by a roof, so there���s a very clear view of the sky but i still didn���t see the object. it was gone. i continued my way south and walked past the apartment building attached to the parking lot, which unfortunately blocked my view, because it too, is a high rise. \r\n\r\nabout another 20-30 seconds later i had crossed the street from this high rise, where there are just small houses and apt. buildings, which leave a better view of the sky and i saw no objects, i headed east to get back to my building, and there still was no object in sight.  but i kept my eyes up for most of my walk and i did start to notice the stars, which i usually don���t they were visible, but since it���s chicago and we have lots of lights and air pollution they aren���t blindingly white. so when i saw another object later on, i was totally sure it wasn���t a star.\r\n\r\ni arrived inside my apt. at around 10:35 pm. about ten minutes later i turned off the light, in my bedroom and looked out of the window. i noticed a blinking object, west of my back window, which is further south in chicago. it was much higher than the last one i���d just seen, and i would have taken it as a star if i hadn���t looked at the stars a few minutes ago when i was outside. this object was much brighter than the stars, although the light was still white; it also blinked on and off. i made out a reddish light that came from it as well. it was probably the one that i���d seen 20 minutes before, when i was outside. but i���m not sure, i couldn���t tell its shape from so far away. as i was gazing at the sky, i then saw a really large object traveling someone close to the ground, maybe 30 miles above that had a bright light attached to its bottom part. it was big and it was loud. i ran to the front of my apartment to get a better look, because it was fast and i believe this was a plane, but i do not believe it was a commercial plane, because it was so bulky, and because of the light coming from it, and because it was a dark color, i think it was a brown or bronze type of shade. it quickly covered the sky and was out of my sight within a minute or two, so i went back to the other window to see the blinking object, it was still there but it looked even further away then before it was still very bright though. so i just decided to watch some tv because i couldn���t do anything about it and then i went to bed. \r\n","distance":"Over One

week. we returned from dinner to our hotel on wed. night feb.28,2007 at approximately 8:15 pm. we got a pot of coffee and sat outside on the veranda in front of our room which overlooks zihuat.Bay.\r\nthe night was perfectly clear, temp.Approx.75f .Our position was facing south toward the ocean.\r\nat approximately 8:40 - 8:45 my wife (looking to our right west) said what is that. i immediately looked to the west to see (what was my first impression) appeared to be balloon or large canopy shaped piece of\r\nplastic with fire burning below it rising into the air from the beach below. i thought someone had sent a balloon or plastic bag with something on fire attached below it into the air as a prank,advertisement,or just something fun to do.\r\nas we and 2 other people in the pool next to us watched the object, i really thought it had something on fire(flameing)below it. \r\nthe object then was coming toward us. it was heading west to east(from our right to our left).\r\nas it came closer, i then realized this was not what i originally thought.\r\n firstly, there was a light breeze that night. the object was moving at a fairly slow steady unwavering pace. no movement up or down,right or left.\r\nthe entire time we watched,it kept the same steady speed never wavering.\r\n secondly, when the object got close enough, i could distinctly see the shape. the object was dark, but had a perfect triangular outline. it still looked like flames burning under the center in a circular dome like shape. it could possibly have been a strobing light, but looked flame- like.\r\n thirdly, the object made no sound. it was perfectly quiet.\r\nwe watched it for approximately 5 minutes until it dissapeared to the east. the entire time it never deviated it's speed or made any wavering movements. it was like it was on a rope. straight,steady,and perfect speed and tragectory.\r\non reconsideration,i believe we actually saw the object coming over the hillside from the direction of ixtapa when we first sighted it. i think at first glance it gave the illusion of rising up, but was actually moving over the hill and coming toward us.\r\nmy initial feeling was curiousity. once i could see the shape of the object and that it was not making a sound i then became more intent and somewhat in awe watching it. the fact of the matter is that i was so intent on watching this event from start to finish that i neglected to go into our room and get our camera. for this i am now kicking myself.\r\ni have been very interested in ufo's for many years, but even though i wanted to experience an event myself, i never had. i honestly thought i probably never would. this was very surprising and exiciting.\r\n\r\nie: i approximated the size to be somewhat equivilant to a commercial jet aircraft, although i could not exactly judge the altitude in the night sky. the object also appeared to be following the coastline from my reference. we finally lost sight of it when one of the buildings on top of the eastern hill to our left blocked our line of sight. our angle of sight was approx. 60-70 degrees. the object was not directly overhead but fairly close so that we were able to get a good visual of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

sighting of a huge, classic disc (saucer)shaped ufo. four of my neighbors also saw it. i reported it to the police, but nothing came of that. after all these years, i decided i want to let the sighting be known for whatever good it might do in the search for the truth. i was living at 55 normandy dr. piscataway, n.J. at the time. it was at 8 pm and at that time of the year the sun is low in the western sky, but the sky is still bright and clear. i usually went out back at this time to watch the sunset. my yard ended at railroad tracks and power lines that went east and west. across a field on the opposite side of the tracks, i had a clear view of the distant watchung mountains in the northwest direction from my yard. it was a cloudless clear sky, i was facing due west. the sun had just gone behind the mountains so it did not obstruct my vision. after a while i noticed a small object in the sky coming from west to east, not far from and paralleling the power lines. it was coming directly towards me. i thought nothing of it at first. as it got closer i noticed it had an odd shape. at first i thought it was a hot air balloon. but, as it came closer and grew larger, i could see that it was in the classic shape of a flying saucer and was metalic silver in color.  it came almost directly overhead and it had to be at least 100 ft. in diameter or larger. when it was nearly overhead, about 350 yards at its closest point to me, it made a 90 degree turn and went north gaining in altitude as it went. i ran to get my neighbors. four of them came out and saw the saucer, but only after it had gained some altitude and distance so they did not see it nearly as close up as i did. they were none the less amazed at what they saw because even when they saw it, it was plain to see that it was no known conventional aircraft. there was a small local airport not too far away and my house was under major flyways for the new york and newark city area airports. usually at any given time you can go out and look up and see various normal aircraft of jet trails in the sky. on this occasion, however, the sky was oddly empty except for one small private plane (about a two to four seater) coming from the direction (west) of the local small airport. the small plane came to a distance of about half way between me and the departing ufo. even at these distances the ufo could be seen to be well over twice the length of the plane. the plane suddenly made a 180 degree curved turn about and flew back in the direction of the airport. i thought that was a strange maneuver. they may have spotted the ufo or may have been contacted by radio and told to clear the area. we watched the ufo until it faded from sight into the distance. at no time did we hear any noticable sounds at all coming from the ufo. if it made any noise at all it owuld have had to have been a low hum. later on, i told other neighbors about the sighting. naturally, they thought i was crazy. my neighbors who saw the flying saucer with me would not talk to anyone but me about it. to this day i regret that i didn't get any photos of the ufo. if i had photos to show as back up, it would have made it a lot easier for me to report this sighting. i hope that someone else in the general area may have seen it and taken photos and that these photos may turn up some day. if they already have, i would like to know about it and see those photos. i affirm that everything i have reported here is absolutely true. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

flying in echelon formation with the lead element to the right of his 'wingman'.  they were in what appeared to be a northernly course, slightly east of me. they traveled from the constellation of leo's throat to the handle of the big dipper in about 10 seconds. this is 53 degrees in the sky. this is about the speed i have seen low f-16's from the iowa national guard do. there was absolutely no sound, though. \r\n\r\nthey were a dim, fuzzy orange. at first it seemed fake to me, because of the lack of brightness. it was almost as if the object was illuminated, not giving off it's own light. and if it was, it was a dim source of light when compared to the moon.  the orange in the middle was surrounded by a fuzzy white light emitting radially.  there was no tail in anyway.\r\n\r\nthey did not follow an exactly straight path. the leader was very slightly weaving back and forth. his wingman was also weaving, more noticeably, about 90 degrees out of phase from the leader. i estimate the weaving oscillation to be about 2 hz.\r\n \r\nthey got dimmer and smaller as they went into the distance and i lost them over the house.  the sky was clear, i could see venus setting in the west, the waning moon rising in the east, and clearly make out the constellations over head.\r\n\r\ni am an ameteur astronomer used to looking at the sky at various things and i am also a fan of military aircraft.  this sighting still has me baffled, i have not even an idea of what it could be.\r\n\r\ni would also like to add a past sighting to this report as it was very similar.  in april 2005, i saw 2 circular orange glowing objects pass directly over my house heading north.  they were in the same echelon formation as this 2007 sighting was.  the difference was these appeared much lower and larger.  i estimated the size to be between 1/4 and 1/2 the diameter of the moon.  each object had a pattern in the light.  it was a diffraction pattern, lines of brighter orange and dimmer orange, about 4 or 5 of each.  the lines of the pattern were about 45 degrees off the direction of travel.  i only saw these for a few seconds as they flew over my house and i grabbed my binoculars running to the front yard, but i could not reacquire them.  i did not previously report this because i only had a small window of observation, less than 3 seconds.  with the similarity to this recent sighting, i found if relevant to include this report as well.\r\n\r\ni have attached a photo of each sighting as they appeared to me.  thanks.\r\n\r\ntroy","distance":"Over One

attending the university next fall.  i was planning on spending the day with some friends who were already attending the school, and hopefully hang out with them a lot while they weren't giving me the full-campus tour.  that lasted until about one or two, when we all decided to grab some lunch in the city.  after a nice drive over to newport news, we found a subway.  it wasn't so much the food choice as the scouting out of the city-life that i was interested in.  on the way over we noticed a nice looking park, and decided, that after spending the rest of the day there we would go over at night and play some flashlight tag.  \r\nnight did come, and after exploring much of the city, we all managed to purchase 5 flashlights for each of us.  about an hour into playing the game, i looked up into the sky, because i noticed that the moon seemed noticably brighter.  after analysing the sky for a few moments i realized that the brightness was actually comming from a shape in the sky, maybe 100 yards up.\r\nthe first reaction i had to the incident was to tell my friends, and make sure i wasn't seeing things, but sure enough, they were looking at it too.  the object, shaped like a cigar, was glowing all over, with only the base showing a circular area of glowing red and white lights.\r\nas i looked at the lights, i felt strangely tranquil, and couldn't move from the position

book, so i'll just tell it like i saw it. my husband j (then boyfriend) and i were driving from colorado to santa fe to visit some friends. it was maybe 2 o'clock in the morning. that stretch of highway (between raton and las vegas, nm) was pretty empty at that hour, two lanes of highway in each direction, divided by a wide grassy median. that's why i immediately noticed two lights pop up behind me out of, what seemed like, nowhere. i thought it must be a cop that had pulled out from a hiding spot. this area is empty prairie. no trees, no nothing, and you can see for miles. but the lights were rather far apart, so i began to think it was two motorcycles or a really old classic car. they were not entirely round, more like horizontally elliptical, if that makes sense. they looked a bit different than traditional modern headlights. i'm not a good judge of distance. the lights weren't threateningly close, but close enough that i wondered if they'd ever pass me. there were no other cars around at all, so i was paying close attention. i mentioned the lights to j and he started watching them in the sideview. they really just looked like headlights, moving in unison, just farther apart than normal headlights and there was no sound. i honestly don't remember if they were yellow or white. i wish i could. anyway, they followed me for maybe 5 minutes and then they seemed to turn upward and disappeared in a blink. i said \"did you see that?\" and j said \"yeah\" so i slowed down and tried to decide what to do. being followed by headlights isn't weird, but this experience felt very weird so i actually pulled over, then drove across the median and headed the other way. there was nothing. and i would have noticed something, anything out there because it's just empty, rolling hills. no sign of any car. no car heading the other way. no car on the side of the road. so i got back on the highway going the right direction and drove on. i hadn't taken any drugs, hadn't been drinking, wasn't very sleepy. in fact, that's about as wide awake as i've ever felt in my life, when those lights disappeared. j and i drove on in complete silence for a long time, maybe 20 minutes, then both kinda said \"what the hell was that!?\" and \"i have no idea\" at the same time and rolled down the windows to look up frantically at the sky. we both had a \"hey, come back\" attitude at that point, even though neither of us ever said the word ufo or alien. we only referred to the \"incident\" a few times because all of our friends and family are skeptical, educated people.\r\n\r\neven just remembering this event, i have nervous chills. obviously, anyone would ignore it as an incident easily explained. two lights on a highway. big deal. but i looked. i looked everywhere. the lights came out of nowhere and disappeared. i'm a secularist, not prone to belief in anything unprovable or \"supernatural,\" but headlights don't turn upward and disappear. they just don't. and i was watching closely. and even though i tried to brush it off, i felt profoundly changed by the experience. i was even sad about getting rid of my old car because i thought \"well, that's the only way they could identify me. that license plate was my address, of sorts.\" i know. it sounds crazy.
