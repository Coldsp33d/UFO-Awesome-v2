object based lights.  los vegas was approximately 20 miles or so away.  the light was on the left of the highway and you could see the road leading up to a small tower type affair.  the light was approximately 1000 to 500 feet above the ground.  i spotted it about 10 miles out before i came to the source.  the light was above the mountains.  the odd thing here was that it was the day before thanksgiving late in the evening.  the light was near a tower and very bright like a star. the oddest thing was that there were about  2 dozen or so new suvs parked on the road at the base of the

the corner of my left eye something caught my attention, probably because it was hanging in the air above a large building (say, something like a wal-mart size wise). i was driving against a median so i glanced up quickly and saw this huge craft (i guess it was several hundred feet long and was suspended mid-air at about five hundred feet).  i was blown away.  the object didn't make me feel anything but awe.  it was beautiful. it was, what i would call, the perfect machine.  the funny thing is, is i only had seconds to look at it (since i was trying to avoid getting in an accident, and i couldn't pull over), but i had two clear unimpeded views of it.  it was made of some kind of black metal(?), it was missile like yet the back of the craft had almost an octagon shape with four (i don't know what to call them) arms that pointed to the very front tip of the craft--the tip of the craft and these four arms had, what looked like, pure gold orbs.  even though i saw this craft for only seconds, i knew that the gold orbs had something to do with its power source--don't ask me why, i just knew, most likely because all of these were in perfect alignment. on my second look at the craft, i noticed it had kind of an organic quality about it--that it was somehow alive.  well, it was.  i had to look back to the road and my driving, and when i looked back the craft was gone.  i believe what i interpreted as \"organic\" was actually it's cloaking device which, i believe, had failed and that's why i saw it.  this craft had about fifty, what i believe were, portholes or windows as well.  when i looked back and it was gone my first thought was to pull over and try to throw something at it--silly, but true.  i knew that it was still there.  child-like thoughts can overwhelm a person at a time like this.  anyway, that's what i saw, in my right mind, and in broad daylight.  years earlier, i had a physical experience at this sight, well near it anyway.  i believe that this sight holds a huge energy source of some kind.

we live in evansville, indiana and i had to travel to montoe city, indiana (appx. 60 miles north of evansville and 15 miles west of vincennes, indiana and 3 miles west of lucky point)i had to show come cleaning equipment to a new church at 6:00 p.M. that lasted appx 45 minutes and after getting loaded up and back on the road was probably 7:05...I headed out of town and took 241 south...At appx. 7:15 i noticed a bright light to the west of me as i traveled south. i wasn't thinking to much about it because this type of light so many times before just turned out to be a plane...But in no time i could tell this was different. so, i kept focused. what made this different was it appeared to disappear as if it went into a cloud and then would reappear a distance later. did this several times and then i realized this was one of those nights that didnn't have a cloud in sight...Then it appeared to be gone (appx 20 seconds) and then it reappeared this time directly in front of me...The light was quite large now and especially for the distance it was away (unlike the lights on the larger planes or jets). what happened next was the part that was spectacular...First of all it appeared abruptly in the sky in front of me as quick as it appeared it then bolted out another light like a shooting star and then in like manner did this again... it was \"bright light\"-flash-\"bright light\"-flash-bright light...Then the three lights stayed lit for appx.5 seconds and then the lights went out(the lights flashed toward the 8:00 hour not straight out...This wss also the unusual thing about this experience. very bright and very large...And at no time did i see any of the typical green and red flaching lights associated with conventional aircraft...I took a few minutes to think about it and had to talk to someone, so i called my wife...Couldn't get it out of my mind so  3 days later i went to google and typed in \"ufo sightings indiana\" only to find out that i wasn't alone and that indiana was a hot spot and that the hottest spot was only 2 to 4 miles west of my sighting and in reality that was the direction it was heading...By the way the lights were white but the lightning type bolts or flashing like a shooting star as the other lights protruded were fire like in appearance...I wanted to report this for the same reasons i needed to tell someone...And for the same reason i researched google...I was blown away...And only wish family members or a friend or for that matter anyone could have been with me to have seen and shared this experience...In short no one else was, so this is all i can do...Is report it...And just this weak in yahoo news the ex prime minister of canada came to the fore-front asking the nations of the world to release ufo technology to help save the planet...Maybe it will be sooner then later i and others will get our answers...Thanks for letting me tell my lenghty story and bend your ears...Thomas rennels","distance":"Over One

it was around that approximate time that i was drawn outside by a very deep, loud, hum. as best as i can descride the noise it was as loud as a train but less rumbling, like continuous rolling thunder only no crackling. the sound was consistent for a few minutes and so strange to me that i walked outside. i looked in the direction of the sound but had zero expectations as i could not imagine what could be making such a noise. as i looked up at about a 50 degree angle from the horizon i noticed a cluster of lights, possibly multicolored in the form of a top hat. the shape was about the size of a quarter at about 125 yards away. the light configuration was that of possibly 3 lights on top a few lights in the center and possibly 5 lights along the \"bottom.\" the lights were sparkling much like a cluster of several bright stars. the sky was lightly cloudy possibly a few wisps of cloud, but none to separate my position and the object. the object descended very slowly about 1 degree every few seconds. my girlfriend was behind me also witnessing the event as i began to yell for my father to come outside. she ran inside to call him and he was outside at exactly 11:15 as he made note of the clock. the object had by that time descended to about 30 degrees or so and was floating about 30 feet above the trees that span approximately 30-50 yards. i apologize for my lack of precise measurement. \r\n\r\nas we stood out there for several minutes watching the object the lights merged and the sound ceased. the several lights solidified into one light about the size of a small marble at the same distance. i was compelled to call my younger bother and told him that i was staring at a ufo. he told me to hang up and record it with a camera phone. i was able to get one picture but i was unfamiliar with the camera and could not successfully film the event. as i was fumbling with the camera i could see through the screen that the light was bouncing and thought that that was due to my shaking hand. however, i was not shaking. my father and girlfriend then began to say that the light was \"bouncing\" and had possibly turned to our direction because the light intensified. the picture quality was very poor as the camera could not pick up the light at that distance and i was hoping for a video instead of a picture. [the time on the picture is 11:22 pm. i can send the picture to anyone who feels they can decipher anything out of it.] as i put the camera down i noticed a very different behavior from the object that was now a smaller brigher ball of yellowish light. the ball of light moved off into northeaterly direction at an increased speed, but maintained a relatively slow speed. \r\n\r\nmy father reported the sighting to the local del rio police non-emergency number. the sound was intermittent throughout the evening at a lower decibel level but i did not see anything else. in the afternoon of march 2 i contacted the local airport to ask if there was any outgoing traffic at between the times of 11 and 11:30 they were curious to ask why i was asking but told me that there may have been, but not that they were aware of. since the lady was of little help. i spoke with the assistant traffic director joel martinez who discussed the event with me and said at his best guess was that of a black hawk helicopter but none were in activity at that time to his knowledge. i discussed with him my unprofessional familiarity with black hawks and we did come to an agreement that this did not match the light configuration. it was at that point that i felt that reassured in the previous idea that what we had witnessed was definitely an unidentified flying object.","distance":"501 Feet -

night, partial moonlight and stars, i noticed a glowing object moving slowly across the sky in a s, se direction. i first noticed it when it was about 4-5 miles away. it was not at a high elevation, i would estimate between 4-6000 feet. i think i expected to see some kind of aircraft lighting appear, but none appeared.\r\n\r\ni observe aircraft from this location, notably, mid-size commercial airliners on their approach into john wayne airport, some 16-18 miles north, and a local sheriff's patrol helicopter. i am aware of what flies in my area. \r\n\r\nthis was not an aircraft. it had no navigation lights or other lights. it was too low to be picking up sunlight but too high for me to get a clear, detailed view. it was mostly sperical and had a dark orange color that appeared to emanate from some thing inside it. the logic of this caught my attention. how come i could see something that is not reflecting sunlight in a very dark night sky and is not an aircraft as we know them? and what gives it this dull dark orange color?\r\n\r\ni ran back into the house and grabbed some binoculars and was able to find the object again and focus on it. it appeared the same as with the naked eye, however, i was able to notice the tumbling a bit more and also the appearance of it slowing expanding, contracting or metamorphing into different, yet still sperical shapes as it traveled. it was gainig altitude at the same rate that it traveled across the sky.\r\n\r\ni was very surprised to see something so unusual. i have seen the, shuttle, the iss and many other satelites cross the night sky, but this was not in an apparent orbit and it was nit the typical silver or white in appearance. this happened two days ago and i'm still flabbergasted as to what it was.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of it as it got higher and higner and moved into the moonlight at which point the light affected my eye too much to find it or even see it again.\r\n\r\nwhat was it?\r\n\r\nthanks-\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

tonight, right around 6:05pm pst (civilian time).  i know because a tv show that we tivo'ed began just as we were walking out the front door.  we were in the next door neighbor's house for probably about ten minutes. \r\n\r\nwhen the three of us left the next door neighbor's house, we walked outside, and around to the west side of the nextdoor neighbor's house.  as we did, i looked into the night sky because it was a pretty night.  it was mostly clear (i could see one or two early stars (i.E. bright ones - perhaps venus or saturn?)), there were one or two light clouds (it was snowing very sparsely), and it was not a dark or darkening sky, yet.  the sun was just starting to set.  in other words, the sky was still 80%, or so, day lit.  immediately i noticed a very bright gold consitent light (it didn't blink or alternate with another color).  it appeared to be very high in the sky.  it moved in a straight line, towards the southeast from the west (past the moon), quickly.  i describe \"quickly\", here as moving faster than i've ever seen a jet fly (including the high altitude flights one can see sometimes by the jet fuel trail); but the speed was not a streak or comet-like.  the speed was speedy and consistent.  there was no sound whatsoever.  there was no blinking tail or wing lights.  there was no blinking, there was no other light, the light shone at the same hue and brilliance the entire time i saw the object.  when i realized that i heard nothing and that it was one singular continuous light i thought 'what is that?  it can't be an airplane as there are not safety lights and it's silent'.  it was an extremely bright light for the altitude that it must have been at.  in other words, this was not a satellite - it was too early to be able to see one, this light was much brighter and larger than satilites, and it moved quicker than satellites (which do move quickly when seen in the dark night sky, and they're smaller lights than this one was).  in about 30 or 40 seconds, or so, it had crossed most of the entire sky (the whole expanse of the sky that we could see).  there was nothing else moving/flying in the sky.\r\n\r\ni watched it cross the sky.  by the time that we were walking into our front door (just next door, mind you) it was out of the field of vision of our view, of the whole sky.  in other words, it was gone.\r\n\r\ni asked my husband to look at it a few seconds after i noticed it.  he saw it.  later, when he and i were alone back in our house, i asked him what he thought.  he agrees with me that it was not a satelite as it was too bright a light to be a satellite and it was too early in the evening (given the daylight) to be able to see satellites.  he said that he didn't know what it was.  he thinks it could've been a high altitude flight.  when i remind him that there wasn't any noise he admits he can't explain why a high altitude flight would not be heard (even they have a very audible bass sound).  i reminded him that \"ufo\" is \"unidentified flying object\".  he admitted he doesn't know what it was, but he has a difficult time saying it was definitely a ufo.\r\n\r\nsadly, i did not get a a photo or recording (there was no sound to record) of it.  if i were to sketch what i saw, it would appear to be a larger star moving silently and quickly in a straight line across an 80% still daylit

stopping. \r\n\r\ni exclaimed to my brothers and i pointed to the star. it moved again and was followed by a green coloured star, which just seemed to appear to its left. after a few seconds, the

into the scene, it was yellow and acted like the other two stars, criss-crossing each other in trio for around fifteen minutes. we couldnt tell anything about the lights, any shape other than what

end.\r\n\r\n###########################################################################\r\n\r\nhello,\r\n[~17:19]\r\ni was at my window of my house and looked out of my window.\r\nit rained, but it was a realy special rain-day, because the clouds and the lighting conditions are very nice / butefull. so i want to make a picture out of my window with my mobile phone.\r\n\r\n[~17:00] \r\nbefor,\r\ni was in my house and making some pictures in the house. but my handy doesnt save the pictures dont know why. but i think that not realy have to do with a ufo or something.\r\n\r\n[~17:18]\r\nafter, i see a round little point (little because the mobile phone screen isnt big) wich looks like a silver or gray, from older times, like from the 1960s or older or somthing (if you know the story about german world war 2 ufos, like this color http://www.Nrg.Co.Il/images/archive/408x322/577/086.Jpg). the object not realy shone (not \"bling bling\"). \r\n\r\ni see the object only with my handy camera. i cant see it with my eye (i readet about the phenomen).\r\ni was shot a picture but my handy doesnt save it, dont know why but i think that not realy have to do with a ufo or something.\r\n\r\n[~17:20]\r\nrestartet my mobile phone. with some startup problems because the start button sucks or something.\r\n\r\n[17:23]\r\nshot the first picture.\r\ndsc00371.Jpg\r\n\r\n[17:23]\r\nshot the second picture.\r\ndsc00372.Jpg\r\nthe \"ufo\" were littler, think it \"fly\" away (think the sky were a lil bit darker <- my sun reflaction therory)\r\n\r\n[17:23]\r\nshot the last picture.\r\ndsc00373.Jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall in one, the \"ufo\" dont moved higher / lower. i dont heard what from the \"ufo\". it was a \"fix\" point in the sky.\r\n\r\ni dont think that that is a ufo, i think thats a sun-reflection to my handy camera. so, whats strange if you look at the first picture you see a \"star\" or sun-\"star\"-reflection. mayby a alien moves arround or something :) or  engine \"smoke\" or \"rader scanner\" or something.\r\n\r\ni say again, i dont think that that a ufo is, i want send you the pictures because i think thats just a sun-reflaction and i want help u to filter out fakes or those sight phenomens.\r\ni have the orginal fotos on my mobile-phone (no worry about fakes or something :)).\r\n\r\n#################\r\nif you have questions about the \"signt\" or some geographic things, just ask me, i like storys about ufos, aliens, stuff like this. i hope i helped you all, and sorry for my bad english.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplease contact me want to know what you think about,\r\npascal g.\r\nwarrick@gmx.Ch (secondary email)\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
