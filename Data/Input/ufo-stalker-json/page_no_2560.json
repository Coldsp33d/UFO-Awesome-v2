university of colorado at boulder. i have waited until today (february 25, 2005) simply because i have only recently become aware of this opportunity to report this sighting. there was a total of two witnesses to this brief but interesting sighting: myself and my friend.\r\n\r\ni was a freshman at the university of colorado at boulder, and my friend was a sophomore. we were leaving the on-campus coffee house known as whizzers cafe, located near the center of campus in one of the dormitory buildings.\r\n\r\nit was a nice night out with a clear sky, so my friend and i looked up to see the stars. while we were facing northeast, we saw a large boomerang- or v-shaped aircraft flying directly overhead in the same direction. the aircraft was probably only about 200 feet above the ground, and it flew completely silently over the dormitory and classroom buildings of the campus.\r\n\r\ni could not see the actual body of the aircraft, perhaps because it was too dark out or because the body was too dark, or both. however, what i did see was a series of circular lights moving in such perfect unison that i concluded they had to be on the underside of a single machine.\r\n\r\nthe arrangement of the lights reminded me of a v-formation of migrating canada geese. there was a total of 5 lights: one at the apex of the v, followed by two in each flank of the v. the flanks made an angle of about 30 degrees from the horizontal to create a shallow v, or a boomerang shape.\r\n\r\nas i said, i could not actually see the body or fuselage of an aircraft. however, the lights kept their formation perfectly. thus, either their flight formation was very tightly cohesive, or they were simply all part of the underside of the same vehicle. i had to conclude the latter.\r\n\r\nestimating size and speed is difficult. however, each light was probably about 10 to 12 inches in diameter, and emitted a whitish or at least a very light-yellowish color. given that the vehicle was probably only about 200 feet above us, i estimate its width from one tip of the boomerang to the other at about 50 feet. it's speed was surprisingly fast given where it was flying, probably about 150 mph. again, this aircraft was completely silent. had my friend and i not looked up when we did, we might not have ever known it had been there.\r\n\r\ni hope that this report is helpful in furthering research on the ufo phenomenon.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

was great sand dunes national monument in southern colorado. the date was approximately saturday, may 18, 1996. the sighting began after 9:00 pm and lasted for over two hours. i have waited until now (february 25, 2007) to file this report simply because i have only recently become aware of this opportunity to publicize what i saw.\r\n\r\nmy friend and i were seniors in college, and we were camping in great sand dunes national monument early in our summer vacation. our campsite was located near the base of the great sand dune itself, in a wooded area near the river, and well within the monument. we had been hiking during the day, and when it got dark after about 8:00 pm we got ready for bed in our tent. the weather was mild, but there was some cloud cover. at about 9:00 pm my friend and i noticed some well-lit aircraft in the eastern sky. these aircraft were above an open, prairie-like area, away from the trees to the west (where we were) and the mountains to the north. the aircraft were probably less than 5 miles away, and at an elevation of probably less than 1000 feet above the ground. we did not observe them closely yet, as we assumed they were simply the usual type of aircraft.\r\n\r\nhowever, after sitting up and talking for about an hour, we noticed that the aircraft were still in the same vicinity of the sky. so, at about 10:00 pm we began to observe them. it quickly became apparent to us that the vehicles we were watching were very unusual.\r\n\r\nfor one thing, they were completely silent. we heard no sounds from motors or engines. we did not hear the rattle of propellers or the roar of jets. in addition, the lights on these vehicles seemed unusual. it appeared as though large portions of these aircraft were illuminated, instead of just particular points where bulbs might be expected.\r\n\r\nperhaps most importantly, though, we soon discerned the shape and flight pattern of these aircraft, both of which were certainly unlike any we had seen before. the vehicles were not flying in any particular direction. rather, they were hovering in a particular area of the sky. what's more, they were able to change direction instantly. they would remain still for a few seconds to minutes, and then suddenly move straight up, down, or sideways to a nearby position.\r\n\r\nthere appeared to be two types of aircraft, one larger than the other. neither type of vehicle left trails in the sky as it flew. the aircraft were just below the clouds, so they were not visible the entire time because they were occasionally obscured by the clouds.\r\n\r\nthere were about 5 or 6 of the larger aircraft. these larger vehicles resembled big, upside-down cereal bowls. they were capable of hovering and of making sudden directional changes, as mentioned above. however, they also appeared to be spinning in place as well. their spinning was not necessarily horizontal, however. rather, they were kind of tilted, so when they rotated, their profile would rock back and forth. their movement was like that of a flipped coin as it strikes the ground. just as only the edge of a coin makes contact with the floor, so too the edge of these \"upside-down bowls\" appeared to be rolling along an imaginary, horizontal plane in the air. it was difficult to judge the size of these larger aircraft. however, they seemed to be similar in size to a cabin or a trailer, so their diameter may have been approximately 30 feet.\r\n\r\nthe bottom of these bowl-like vehicles was brightly lit up, but the rest of them apparently was not. there was a constant glow emanating from their flat, lower surface. in addition, mobile searchlights projected downward at various angles, as though the vehicles were scanning the ground. these lights were reminiscent of the searchlights helicopters use, or of the spotlights that theaters shine upward toward the sky during important events (although, again, the lights in question here aimed toward the ground, not the sky). these lights appeared to be scanning a relatively wide area in all directions. they were so powerful and so maneuverable, that they actually illuminated our tent for a few seconds as they scanned the area. i repeat: the search lights were shined in our direction, and for a moment they lit up our tent.\r\n\r\nin addition to these larger vehicles, there were also smaller ones. these small aircraft were well illuminated as well, and again, it appeared as though light emanated from a large percentage (if not most or all) of their surface area, rather than from just a few points. it was difficult to tell their size and shape. however, they appeared to be rather spherical instead of bowl-like. they were much smaller than the larger vehicles, probably only about 6 feet in diameter. \r\n\r\nin fact, these smaller spheres appeared to be coming out of the larger aircraft and then going back into them again. they would emerge from the bottom, perform various maneuvers, and then re-enter through the top. whereas there were only about 5 or 6 of the bowl-like aircraft, these smaller spheres were more numerous. they may have numbered about 15 in total. they also seemed more agile than the larger vehicles. they would emerge relatively quickly, and then would fly in a haphazard way, reminiscent of an insect buzzing around through the air (although not quite so agilely). their flight pattern was usually curved and variable; i don't recall seeing them fly in a straight line at all. with so many of them, it was impossible to identify individual vehicles or gauge how much time they spent inside or outside the larger vehicles. however, this pattern of emerging and re-entering happened fairly frequently, perhaps every 5 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nmy friend and i noticed this activity at about 9:00 pm. we began watching it in earnest from about 10:00 pm to about 11:00 pm. we became tired and had to go to sleep while the activity was still going on, so we do not know for how much longer it continued. however, we estimate that the activity lasted for more than 2 hours.\r\n\r\nthe experience of seeing these aircraft was both fascinating and frightening. i was amazed, but i was also afraid that my friend and i might come to harm if we were discovered. fortunately, nothing bad happened to us. we slept soundly through the night and awoke the next day feeling fine and wondering what we had seen the night before. we did not see anything unusual the rest of the day, and we returned home around midday.\r\n\r\nmy experience that night left a great impression on me. because i am unaware of any military or commercial aircraft anywhere in the world that match the description of what i saw, i can only describe those aircraft as ufos. i am forced to wonder if what i saw is of extraterrestrial origin. i hope that this report is helpful in solving at least some of the mysteries surrounding this issue.\r\n\r\nnote: including myself, two people were witness to this sighting. because i am writing this report, i have listed myself as witness a and my friend as witness b below. i will refrain from providing information about my friend at this time. however, i will confer with him, and if he is interested, we can provide information about him in the future.\r\n","distance":"Over One

experience differs slightly from any report i have ever read about.I respect your quest for knowledge on this particular subject.I hope you can appreciate my tale.It does have the added advantage of being true.\r\n my/our story,there were three friends with me,is different because before we saw the object we all shared a beep in our ears and i do mean in our ears,no apparent direction.A very generic sounding beep,not loud,soft,not horn like but like i don't know,like the beep your microwave makes when you press a button.When i heard the beep i stopped talking,as we were all having conversation.Everybody else stopped talking also at the same time and after a long pause of nobody talking i asked did you guys hear that beep?Everybody in unison said yes some loudly.You see it was weird.We didn't have a whole lot of stuff that beeped back in 1972,especially inside a 1961 oldsmobile!Well thats the short of the long why this story is different,the inside the ear type beep.\r\n i was driving with my buddys just south of the missesinewa reservoir at night and yes in the country.We often went there around the reservoir to swim,hunt,and other things teenage boys do with girls,beer,etc. t. when they don't have there own place yet.                              \r\n we heard the beep!One of my buddies yells what the f**k is that?All in the car started yelling for me to pull over.I did.I looked and half a mile plus away from us hovering,soundless and motionless at above and below tree top level a huge glowing reddish orange,cigar shaped or disc shaped ufo!150 possibly 300 feet long.I hate to be vague on the shape but the object never moved and we were a long way away its possible that we were looking at a disc that was almost perfectly horozontal to the ground and at our eye level.The object was definately a glowing 3d thing not a light or a gas.The object had a row of lights on or very near the bottom of it.They very well have been windows with the inside light was shining out.The row of lights were white and not brighter than the reddish orange glow of the rest of the hovering object.There was a brighter light on one end of the row of lights that shone down a few times spot light like not a narrow beam.This light only this white light shone white on the trees and the ground.The overall reddish orange glow of the object was deep not as bright and illuminated only the surrounding trees not the ground.The row of lights flickered a few at a time and at the time it looked to me more like movement of something behind a window in a well lit room rather than a light flickering.We were far away but this thing was a big boy possibly with big windows.I stared at this hovering light show and bam i realised it was a classic 50's style ufo only difference was there wasn,t a dome on the top of it.We stood there in real shock and awe.One of my buddies yells lets get close.In my mind this is were my story may ring true to y'all.Though curious this was all to real to me a profound moment in my life.It was scary.I wasn't going any closer to the ufo.John wayne would not have gone closer.So many accounts of ufo sightings has the witness trudging right off to get as close or even touch these objects.In other words the hero of their story.After what i experienced,i say yeah right.My buddy who said lets get close knew we weren't going to drive up on that object.He was playing macho man.It was too real.We watched the object never venturing more than a yard from the car.It.By the way the car showed no effect from the ufo.After 5 minutes the object simply dissapeared.We all saw the samething as well as heard the beep the only sound this ufo made.Oh!I know that many feel there is a possible connection between ufo's and military nuke bases.Grissom air force base is 15 miles due east of where we saw the object.\r\n                                     \r\n\r\n

and i immediately noticed the glowing orange object and i said to myself \"that's a weird and unusually bright  star to be so low in the sky. i estimated it to be approximately 10 degrees above the horizon. from  my vantage point in the parking lot it seemed to be across the ohio river over southern ohio and in the procterville  or scottown (if it was further north) area. i walked to the furthest end of the parking lot (away from the bright street lights and light washout) to get a better look. it seemed to be at least 3 miles away or maybe 5 miles away over procterville. i kept studying it, as it was an unusual orangey fire color and seem to undulate. all the time i remained reserved in my opinion as it seemed to grow and shrink or maybe even pulsate. from the east, a small plane was coming in and going toward the west (possibly towards the chesapeake airport [a very small landing strip] in southern ohio).  i could easily see the red blinking faa light on the left wing

object and the object shrank to a small point of light.  after the plane had passed under the object, it enlarged and brightened again and appeared as an undulating, flaming top. this is when i began to lose my reservations that it was just a low or rising star.  i continued to watch it and noted that the sky was clear with visible stars and the crescent half moon but the exception of some moderately quick moving clouds coming from the west. it was a very breezy also. i watched until the object dimmed down its intensity and blinked out in two or three seconds. it seemed to collapse into itself as it disappeared. i walked some more, scanning the sky to try to relocate it but i never saw it again. in comparison the red blinking faa  seemed like a speck in the sky. i searched for it

during the ~30 minute event there were no flights at all.  i am not even certain how long it was before a passenger airliner even passed overhead again.  i do not recall any flights that evening passing through thier normal route to the east.\r\n\r\nin short, the craft slowly gained in altitude and dissappeared to the east in approx 30 minutes.  an airliner normally dissappeared in ~1/10th of that time.  the helicopters also left the area though i do not recall in what direction they departed as i was observing the craft and not too interested in the helicopters.  though, i do recall that the helicopters when entering the area did so from a westerly direction; that is to say that the helicopters were attempting to follow the craft (though they were about 0.5 - 1 mile south of the craft).  \r\n\r\nconsidering that the helicopters were searching such a small region of airspace and ground, and were due south of my position, i can conclude that through whatever means they were 'tracking' the craft, that the craft reached its lowest altitude at the point at which i oberserved it fly directly overhead.\r\n\r\nat the time the area was somewhat rural and given it was in the evening, and unless an observer were to just and happen to look up and see it (though it was dark in color) there were likely not more than a handfull of other observers to the incident.  though i am very certain that the air traffic controllers both at detroit metro and at willow run airports had the next best possible oberservations of the craft other than my own.\r\n\r\ni can only logically conclude that the us government believed that the craft had 'come down' in the area (perhaps thinking it had crashed) and were attempting to locate and recover the craft.  \r\n\r\nadditionally, i would estimate the craft to be larger than a boeing 747.  it was indeed a solid craft and not a flight of ultralite airplanes: it blocked the stars from sight as it passed overhead.\r\n\r\ni can only wonder about the records of flight activity at detroit metro that evening.  perhaps there is a way to cooberate this sighting with the airports records of that night.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6439,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.0964314,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02222007-0004","longitude":-83.2918744,"occurred":386409600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":386409600000,"summary":"Witness to an attempted ufo recovery by the us government","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Flat Rock, Michigan","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:479043"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Memphis","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While crossing the parking lot where i work, i was looking at an airplane leaving a heavy contrail when i noticed a flash of light.\r\n\r\nthe flash was tiny, like a star, very high up. it faded and moved slowly over the course of several seconds.\r\n\r\nmy first impression was that this was a satellite reflecting the sun.\r\n\r\nbut upon further consideration, i don't think this is true. here's why.\r\n\r\nit was moving from east to west. and it must have been very high up to be able to reflect the sun, as it was between the sun and me, so to speak. that is to say, it was between a point directly overhead and the sun in the east, in the eastern half of the sky, in the morning. \r\n\r\ni am certain that this was some sort of object because it was moving, as i stated earlier. over the course of about five seconds, it disappeared entirely.

dec. 2006.  i hate to bother you, but can't get this out of my mind.  it was a few days after they quit looking for those mountain climbers in oregon, around 5:30 p.M. outside of niles, michigan. i had just finished chores and was going to ride my atv up to the mail box.  as i looked to the west i saw a bright light, i thought oh, venus... then i noticed i didn't see anything else , as there was cloud cover.  i rode up to the mail box, about 1/2 mile away. on the way back i thought the light was closer, so i watched it and after putting the atv away, i stood and watched some more.  time had elapsed around 5 or so minutes. as it drew closer, i saw it had an extremely rounded body. i thought, wow if there were a pilot and a co pilot, they would have to sit one behind the other.  it was cigar shaped, super long with two tiny wings they went straight out  they were about 1/4 the length of the plane, looked very unstable to me. i think the plane was over 100 feet long, but couldn't tell for sure.  anyway behind these two  tiny wings were some square shaped wings, that looked like the corners had been cut off.  then a regular tail. the ones with the upright tail part in the middle, none of the wings or tail were swept back. i saw no cockpit, nor windows.   i heard a little noise, but couldn't tell if it was a prop or jet.  the one thing that made me keep looking at it was the extremely bright nose light.  i had thought it to be a planet at first it was so bright.  as the object went right over my head i saw it had a little light on each wing, but no red or green blinking lights anywhere to be seen.  the color looked like an army green/gray color.  was this a plane that had high tech equipment in it looking for the mountain climbers?  it was traveling west to east, like it was coming from chicago and going to detroit. i have looked at over 700 photos of aircraft on the internet but as close as i can find is the u2 spy plane, but it didn't have the extra set of wings. they also don't have the bright light in the nose either.  thanks for any help you can get.  i did draw a picture of it, so i wouldn't forget what it looked like, by looking at all the photos on the internet. carolyn

a.M.Thursday morning of february 22? i certainly saw something, raced up to tell my brother, and he saw it as well. i was peeking my head out our window to see if sirius had set yet and to see saturn, when i noticed what looked like two stars of equal magnitude that i didn't recognize (not that i'm knowledgeable enough to notice something out of place...It just looked odd). they were moving though (from southwest to northeast), so i thought plane...Which would be nothing out of the ordinary, they are always overhead, blinking away. these really weren't blinking...And the lights were way too far apart to be from the same plane. it passed overhead slowly, couldn't have been extremely high in the sky, on account of the wingspan covering a wide field of the sky. there was a noise similar to the kind of noise you get as a large plane many thousands of feet in the sky passes overhead (you know, you see it and the sound is slower, so it appears that the sound of it is trailing behind)(it was very low in pitch, could be easily heard from indoors, and spooked a few of the local animals, including a cow...Which i didn't know lived so close to us:). i could not make out a shape of the object, just its lights...Three of them two on the outside being a very light orange with the third being grayish but not centered in between the two on the outside. they weren't crisply flickering, i'm not even sure you could say they flickered at all.\r\n\r\ni wasn't sure who to contact, i looked in the phone book under evansville regional airport, but the numbers were for parking employees, security office...None of them seemed like the right contact for this type of question. anyways, i just wondered if anyone else had seen it and reported of it, or if there was some kind of way you might forward this to anybody who would be interested or aware of what was flying overhead during that time. i am an amateur stargazer, have seen planes, planets, meteors all the like; but this was quite unusual and worth my trouble to email you, and hopefully i wasn't to much trouble for you to hear out. thanks, phil schmitt\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i had an intense ufo experience. while laying on the couch i received some kind of message to get up, grab the binoculars and lay under my skylight and look for movement. i remember seeing a couple flashes of light in the star field and being frustrated. i said to myself \"come on now lets not play hide and seek\" just then i spotted what looked like two saucer shaped craft at about thirty thousand feet. they were huge i could make out lights emanating out from the edges, while coming to grip with the fact that i am looking at real ufos suddenly through my field of view at about five hundred feet flew a totally silent black triangle. i only saw it for a moment because i was looking through the binoculars and it was so close. at this point i put down the binoculars and went down to my mothers apartment to tell her whats over the roof i think she was concerned that i was going crazy. sitting in amazement over what i had just seen i started to feel frightened, cotton mouth, heart racing, the works it felt like i was being probed while sitting in that chair. my mother calmed me down and i gained my composure back, i said to myself no more star gazing tonight!. the following night i called my sister to talk about the event, she is a spiritual healer (healingthehologram.Com) i told her that i felt like the aliens probed me. she told me to ask what the alien called itself the name ether came to my mind weird!. we talked for hours till 9pm and i felt much better. as i hung up the phone i looked up and out the skylight and this time gliding at about 200 feet and 20mph rotating slowly was another huge silent triangle with orange plasma round lights on each corner, there is no doubt that they knew i was looking at them, it flew directly over head then turned 90 degrees and flew off wow up close and personal!\r\n\r\n                                                                                     newport ri 11/16/2004","distance":"101-500

here in rural northern minnesota. i was out with my dogs when i heard a military jet. because of my rural upbringing, i still look up every time i hear a plane and since i'm 46 yrs old, i've seen a lot of different planes. i know by sound what type of plane is flying over before i see it. i live in the flight path between duluth int'l airport and the minot north dakota air base so there is a fair amount of air traffic over my town, though most of it is pretty high in the sky. i could tell by the sound and the flight path that it was a military jet of some type and since it was about the time that there was talk of deploying more troops to iraq, i'd been seeing and hearing military jets fly over more frequently (for what ever reason). i looked up in time to see the jet and at the same time, a small red light came from another direction, almost perpendicular to the path of the jet. the red light was the same size as the satellites that i see, so i couldn't see a definite shape. i have watched the sky all my life and know the difference between stars, satellites, and meteors, and this was like none of those. i've even seen some meteors that were quite spectacular, including a double one that was bright green, which i knew it wasn't a ufo sighting. the red light turned and followed the same flight path of the jet. i shoved the dogs inside and yelled for my husband, who had to bolt up a flight of stairs to get outside where i was, and he agreed it was nothing like he'd ever seen before, either. we watched it until it was out of sight on the horizon. the jet wasn't low in the sky, but a lot lower than passenger planes that fly over this area, and even at night it was unmistakable. the red light kept pace with the jet the entire time. i just kept on wondering what the heck it could be and tried to think of a rational explanation. i guess it was unidentified, it was flying, and all i can say is that i know what it \"wasn't\". even if i'd had a camera on me at the time, it wouldn't have photographed well, unfortunately.

as a switch technician.  i���ve been married for 8 years and have one kid with my current wife and two children living in the us.  this event happened on sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:19am.  i'm pretty sure of the time because i called a friend of mine seconds after the event but the call went unanswered, then i called mufon.  he is a coworker and friend and his mobile shows that i made the call at 12:13.  my mother was visiting my brother and came over to the house in order to give my son his birthday gifts.  after she came over we planned on connecting over live for a video chat with my kids in the us.  my mother wanted to say hi to them but the kids were walking out the door to go to church and we had to postponed the chat till later that day.  we moved over to the back patio to hang out and chat for a bit.  we were talking about something when my mother asked me if those things in the sky were kites.  the sky was cloudy that day and i had a hard time locating the objects but after a bit of looking i managed to find them.  there were two objects in the sky.  they were a deep red and round.  from my position i could see that one object was behind and at a higher altitude than the other.  i could venture a guess as to the altitude of the objects but to be honest i have no idea.  much higher than the normal air traffic we get to see everyday.  we get a lot of overhead air traffic so we are used to seeing planes on a daily basis and  these did not looked like the ordinary traffic that moves above us.  the objects moved very close to each other at a very slow pace.  the object that was lower and to the front moved from the right to the left of the other object then they both started ascending on a 120 degree angle of ascension until they moved into clouds and we lost sight of them.  the object below flashed a light like a strobe light but i recall the flash only once.  the object seemed to be keeping the exact distance with each other.  the one thing that i find odd is how clearly i saw the redness of the object.  i keep wanting to say that there was a white spot on the red or something but i���m not sure.  my mother saw them much longer but by the time she pointed them out to me, i only managed to see them for two maybe three minutes at most, maybe less.  \r\n\r\nit was incredibly exciting to think that it was a ufo and i pointed it out to my mother.  i thought afterwards that it could have been a weather balloon because i���ve never read about a red ufo and because of the flashing light.  \r\n\r\nsincerely yours\r\ne.
