(sorry about not being sure, it���s been a long time, about 55 years ago.)  \r\n\r\nit was a beautiful spring day, not a cloud in the sky, lunchtime at school and us kids getting ready to play on the playground equipment.  as we were getting ready to play (we had just finished eating our lunch), i happen to notice a small, beautiful, silver, disk-shaped saucer, hovering in the blue sky.  as i continued looking at it, i was amazed that the object wasn���t moving and was able to continue hovering in one spot.  it was far enough away from us that, to me, it didn���t seem as any kind of threat or intimidating but i did have the distinct feeling that it was just observing us children at school.  i pointed this object out to the other kids who also were amazed at it, wondering what it could be.  we had never heard of the term ���ufo��� or had never thought of things like that.  we always had a teacher who, taking turns, kept an eye on us kids during our lunch period and i approached the teacher and pointed in the area of the sky where the object was.  we kids, after watching it for several minutes, got bored watching it and continued to the playground equipment.  while we were playing on the swings, i noticed that the teacher i had informed, concerning the ufo was now talking and pointing to the silver disk to another teacher, both now, seeming to be acting quite concerned and nervous, which confused me as i didn���t understand why they would get upset.  i had just assumed that the flying object was something our country had developed, as it never occurred to me that it could be from another world.  when the dinner bell rang and we had to return to the classroom, i looked back to that section of the sky to see if it was still there and it was gone.  we kids discussed the mysterious object for the next several days, never figuring out what it was.\r\n\r\nthe recounting of this experience is the truth to the best of my memory.  stan hamilton\r\n","distance":"Over

f150. we were en route to a blueberry field in franklin,maine. the field is parted by the george's pond road. we arrived around 23:35. we were going to the field to hunt coyotes. we were traveling northwest on the george's pond road when we noticed a \"no trespassing\" sign. road was icy so it took a little longer than normal to stop, and by the time i had stopped i passed the sign.So i backed up and positioned my truck to shine the headlights north to illuminate the sign so we could read the whole thing. immediately after reading the sign we noticed a steadily blinking light to the north. we first thought it was a hunter already afield signaling to us to let us know that spot was occupied. so we watched for a few minutes. then it seemed like there were multiple lights that were moving, all the while blinking in a steady pattern, the light would flash on for about 1/3 second, then off for 1 second. then we shut off all the lights in the vehicle, figuring that if they were hunters they would stop signaling. the lights continued to pulse. it seemed like there were at least two separate lights. one appeared to have a yellow tint and the other had a faint orange tint. the lights would blink on in one location and while the light was off, it would instantly move to another location then flash back on. kyle and i, both being  ufo believers considered the possibility that it was an extraterrestrial craft. we rolled the windows down and shut the vehicle down. we could hear no thing other than the wind. then i became very fearful and insisted we leave. as i was backing the vehicle down the road, kyle watched the lights. as he was watching he said he saw about seven lights flash on at once in a horizontal row. then we left the field. on our way to my home in hancock,me, kyle convinced me to go back. so on our way back to the field, we tried to call our friend tim sobel, who lives in franklin, to see if he wanted to come with us. kyle's phone was getting very bad reception in an area which he normally got perfect reception. he tried calling but couldn't get so much as a ring. so we continued back to the field without tim. when we went back to the field the lights were still blinking and watched them for a few more minutes. at 23:56 we left the field and went home, all the while kyle watched his phone to see if his reception would improve. when we got to a hill that always has good reception he still had bad reception. so he shut his phone off. it would not turn on again. so he removed the battery and reinstalled it and his phone would turn on again. in the same location that showed only one bar of reception only a minute ago now showed a perfect four bars of reception. in the morning we will contact the the local news outlets, airports, and police stations for reports of strange phenomena.  i have included an aerial photo of the area and a weather report of the area an hour after we saw the lights. the weather conditions in the report are the same as during the occurrence.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6427,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5874877,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212007-0001","longitude":-68.2316054,"occurred":1171958400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

down, yet the sky was not black yet. the objects were black and did not have lights. there were two clusters in a v formation. the objests were staggered somewhat, not like a perfect v, almost like birds, but they were not birds. they were too big and flying too fast to be birds. it was clearly a group of aircraft. nellis air force base is close and i see f15's often. i would have assumed thats what i was seeing, but there were way too many and they were too close to each other. the first group had probably twenty and the second had about six. they were triangular in shape and flew in the direction of the pointed side like a jet or something. they were right above sheep mountain at about 10,ooo feet to the north of the las vegas valley. i was traveling north on jones and saw them ahead of me. it was very earie and scared me to see the number of objects. i almost wanted to stop the car a get out and point. i looked around to see if anyone else was seeing it and it didn't seem so. i picked up my cell phone to call a non emergency number because i was so shaken and my phone rang. on the phone was a friend who lives nerby. the objects were gone by this time because the whole thing was less than 30 seconds. roughly 10 minutes later when i was home and still on the phone i heard a military jet and mentioned it to my friend and she said \"yeah, i can hear it too.\" i then asked her if she heard anything when she called me and i told her what i saw and she said \"no.\" the jets you can hear and see for miles. the objects i saw had no sound and disappeared out of nowhere. i was not able to watch them for a distance like the military jets. the staggered v formation flew from west to east and disappeared out of nowhere. the smaller formationed followed and did the same. there were no lights, there was no sound. i tried to figure out if it could be anything else at all. clearly they weren't birds. they flew too high, too fast, and were too big. that many military jets would have been extremly loud, not to mention they were too close to each other. the jets usually fly in a straight line and i have never seen more than a hand full. this was a cluster of flying objects. i am not crazy, i was not under the influence of anything, and i am curious if anyone else saw this event.

1am.  we had just finished loading our boat up for the summer, it was one of our first big weekends there since school let out.  our kids were in their staterooms sleeping, and although i was physically tired, i was too wound up to sleep just yet.  i wanted to relax so i was lying out on the nose of the boat looking up at the stars, it was very dark this night, not too many lights were on in the area around the marina or the surrounding area streets, the weather was clear, sky visibility was crystal clear, you could see for miles..., very slight breeze, about 70 degrees or so, and like everywhere else, you can always see the sky better when you are in an area with no lights like the ocean or mountains etc.,. so the boat is in the water, i am on the nose staring up at the sky and i see what i thought was a star at first, at first it appeared so far away, it was amoungst the other stars, i always look for the big dipper because that is the only constellation i know, and this object was as high up as the big dipper but from my possition to the right of it,(if you look at your pinky finger horizontally up in the sky with one eye to use it as a measuring devise, this object was two pinky fingers away or so from the big dipper)anyway, i have seen what \"falling stars or shooting stars\" look like, i have seen them in plano tx, and montauk li, and this was not like that at all.  then i noticed it was moving, but i thougt it must be me or the boat, so i jumped off the boat onto the cememt docks and kept looking, it was still moving and i know it was because its possition relative to the other stars changed, then i wondered if it could be a satalite or something else because at this point it was still moving in the direction everything else seemed to be going sort of, but then all of a sudden, it stopped on a dime, changed direction and shot straight across the sky in another direction 10x faster than it was originally moving!(again, with the pinky thing, about 2 1/2 pinky lengths) i swear i thought i was nuts so i called another boater over who happened to still be up as well, and he looked up with me, he found the object i was talking about, (or so he said)and we watched it for about 15 seconds, that is a long time, then it stopped again, changed direction again, (now, the total shape it had moved, if you were to draw it on a map, looked like a triangle...)and seemed to shoot straight across the sky at such a speed that if you were to have blinked your eyes, this pin head of light would have moved almost two full horizontal pinky finger lengths by the time you open and shut your eyes!! it was amazing. i know this next part sounds entirely crazy but the entire time i saw it, from begining to end, i felt drawn to watch, and or, compelled to watch this light- and not take my eyes off of it, but at the same time, i felt like it somehow knew i was watching it, even though i was millions of miles away, i felt instinctively like it knew that i personally was watching it, like it knew who i was, where it could find me, and that it could turn around at any moment and \"get me in some way\" if it wanted to, but it was in just too much of a hurry to come back right now...  you will never, ever make me believe that it was- spacejunk, spacedust, spacecrap, halucionations, or whatever, because objects just don't move like that, in an apparent pattern unless something/someone is moving it, and i do not drink alcohol nor was i on any medication that night, (or previous night!). i have had a fear of ufo's all my life, ever since i was a little kid, before i even knew what ufo's were, i don't know why, and i don't want to know why either. my husband and friends are always laughing and taking cheap shots at my belief in ufo's but, i swear i saw something that night that was unidentified and unexplainable too.

just a matter of seconds and then in the amout of time it took it to get to that destination it had arrived back where it started it continued to do this several more times.  at a certain point it was doing circles in the sky.  i continued watching it my entire way home to lake zurich, il.  it seemed like it was following the same route as me just traveling a distance ahead of me.  when i reached my neighborhood it was circling the houses and coming closer and closer to the houses. then i ran inside to tell my mom, she came out to look and it was far ahead in the distance and barely in vissability. during all of this i was very intrigued, at first i was confused trying to figure out what it was for a while i thought it was a plane in distress, but as it got closer to the ground i could tell it was not a plane at all.  that is when i became startled, i was convinced something was not right and that could very well be a ufo.  i have seen this object a handful of times since then driving down the same road. but i usually lose sight of it before i reach the lake zurich area.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

my brother mike victory, and our two friends jimmy and david bryant who are brothers, drove up to menifee arkansas one night to our deer camp to clean up the cabin before deer season opened. after dark we were sitting in the cabin in front of the fireplace talking when my brother mike went outside to check on the dogs in the back. he was gone a long time. david went outside to see what happened to mike and he did not come back. we were waiting on them to come back so we could go home, then jimmy went outside to see were they went. just a few minutes later jimmy opened the patio door and said ���hey danny, come look at this outside!��� i walked outside and saw everyone looking off to the north across from us on the next ridge was this huge round object. it was just above the tree tops and glowing and pulsating. it looked like it had heat coming off of it. after watching this object for along time, a jet plane flew over us from the south and flew north over the object. the plane just went on like it never saw the object. as the plane flew over the object, the object moved up in the air a little and stopped. it sat for a second or two then it started moving very very slowly towards us. as it got closer we could see the shape was triangle shaped. this object ended up coming right in front of us above our heads and paused for awhile never making a sound. it was right above the tree tops, so close i could have hit it with a rock. it was huge, about the size of a football field. we sat and watched it for what seemed like along time. we could see all underneath the object, it had big clear lights spaced out all underneath it. we could see all the metal work and designs underneath the object. while we were watching the object, to the east of us was a group of c130's crossing over the river. after the last plane past out of sight, the object went from a pause to shooting off at a high rate of speed to the south east towards conway arkansas in a matter of 2 to 3 seconds. and we could still see it as far as we could see way off and stopped and started blinking. when the object took off it did not make any noise what so ever. on the way home we did not say much about it. we were all stunned i guess. over the years since i have told a few people about it, some believe it and some don���t believe it. but i will swear on my death bed, i am a christian and know what the bible says about all liars going to hell, so before god knowing this....This is my statement.\r\n","distance":"21-100

2007. the object had no discernable shape or size, but must have been somewhat large due to its apparent distance from our location, two miles west of colmesneil, tx. on highway 1745. \r\n\r\nthe object was very bright white, but alternated color to blue-white, incandescent orange, and red-white in color; which constantly changed in no particular order or sequence, and continuously varied in intensity.\r\n\r\nthe light intensity of this object was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any current aircraft landing or taxi lighting system i am familiar with (an order of magnitude higher than systems reported to be 500,000 cp or more). the object was observed traveling away from our location, and the lights on this object were much more intense than landing and/or taxi lights on an approaching aircraft. in addition, the familiar blinking of aircraft position lights was not present at all. \r\n\r\nwe watched the object from an initial distance of approximately 4 miles and approximately 15000 feet agl, which seemed to vary somewhat due to its erratic motion. considering the distances involved, the object���s displacements must have been significant. the object traveled away from us slowly, due east to due west, for about 35 minutes. the height agl of the object was somewhat constant (discounting the erratic motion); therefore, after 35 minutes, the object was about 16 miles away, considering an estimate of 10 degrees above the horizon. this data would also suggest an approximate ground speed of slightly over 20 mph.   \r\n\r\nthe most disturbing aspect of this object (and the character that caught and held my attention) was its ���amorphous��� nature. we viewed this object for over a half an hour, mostly through 16x field glasses and a high powered camera lens, and were struck by the constant change of its shape, size, color and position. \r\n\r\nconsidering its behavior and appearance, we could not come up with an adequate explanation for the identity of this object. the experience was disturbing for us, since we could not explain its behavior. however, if the flight path is extrapolated on a map, it does come close to ft. hood, tx. so, perhaps the object is a new military aircraft undergoing some phase of flight qualification testing?","distance":"Over One

lasted about 5 minutes.  we heard no noise at all though-out this entire episode.  i could not see where the rays or what-ever hit because we in a cove and could not see around the small mountain to

the glen kernen golf and country club which is a non-public gated community in an area directly to the west of my house.  (my house is at approx. glen kernan pkwy and hodges blvd.)\r\n\r\ni was sitting in my room with my window open when i heard sounds of engines revving.  at first it reminded me of the starting sound of police sirens but instead of ending the pitch cycle the pitch went higher and higher as the sound continued like an engine being revved.  it was a sort of \"silky\" whirring sound.  it was a sound i had never heard before from any engine.  when i heard the sound it sounded like an aircraft taking off right from inside our neighborhood because of the volume of the noise.  that of course is weird since my area is heavily developed and housed.  my actual impression is that it took off.  the total time from total silence to maximum pitch/volume was between 5-10 seconds.\r\n\r\ni immediately thought it was ufo and i ran outside after a few seconds of listening.  i saw four white lights in a square formation and a red light on one side hovering in the western sky above the tree line which begins five houses down from ours.  either the craft was smaller and indeed hovering above the tree line itself, or much much bigger and hence farther away.  it was dusk so it was difficult to make out the contours of the craft.  \r\n\r\nthe craft itself seemed to be just black, faintly visible against the dark sky.  the lights seemed to be from the underside edges of the craft.  the top may have had a dome.  the craft was just hovering above the trees.  almost just slightly gliding.  moving slowly.  and most definitely hovering.  the sound of the engines became quieter and seemed to fade in intensity while the actual pitch of the sound remained the same.  the number of lights may have been more because of the angle which i saw it at, i couldn't be sure.  but i know there were at least four white lights in a square formation and at least one red light.  there were no chopper sounds.  they were entirely engine based sounds.  the sounds also started from complete silence, unlike the sounds of planes overhead which you can hear from miles away before they fly over.  \r\n\r\nit appeared to be large and close.  if i were to hold up a coin, it might have been two inches or more diameter.  i lost sight of the craft as it slowly hovered out of visibility behind the tree tops.  (the trees here a very very tall.)  \r\n\r\none thing to note:  three entire days before this incident, our skies had been non-stop chemtrailed with jet after passing jet literally clouding the entire sky, perhaps a cloud cover?  then the day immediately after and every day after the ufo's appearance there have been no such clouding of the skies by passing aircraft.\r\n\r\nother thing to note:  the same day as the sighting much earlier in the day there was violent thunder and lightning storms in the area with torrential downpour- very uncharacteristic of the weather in my opinion.  several times lightning touched down very close to my own proximity and the rain was very very heavy.  when the actual sighting occurred the skies where dry as though nothing had happened.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

several disc shaped objects in a v formation flying from west to east at a very high rate of speed. we didn't know what they were, but we knew they were moving too fast to be aircraft. their altitude was very high. they looked like lights as if stars in a formation. seconds later the objects appeared again flying at a high rate of speed flying from the east to the west. just a few seconds later they appeared flying from the south, when they got directly overhead they came to a complete stop. one lone object coming from the south joined up with the formation and the entire formation continued northward at a very high rate of speed, and disappeared from sight. my friend and i were very excited, but not really scared. we knew we'd seen true ufo's.  this was north of vance air force base in enid, oklahoma. to my knowledge, nothing ever appeared in local newspapers. just a few years ago, i spoke with a lady who had lived in enid, ok about the same time whose kids had seen something similar. \r\nmy friend and i were just teenagers at the time and because of our ages weren't taken seriously. \r\ni've been wanting to tell this story for some time. thanks!","distance":"Over One

california, i seen this object that was very brillant white, that was flying in one direction than without hesitation start traveling in a 180 degree opposite direction. when i first seen the object i thought it was a falling star, due to the brillant white color; however i have never seen falling stars change their course of flight. i pulled to the side of the road and continued watching this object fly all around the sky, when it reached an altitude of, i am guessing, 2500 feet it put off this extremely bright white light that made me see spots for about 5 minutes. after i stopped seeing spots i never saw the object again. after this bright light made me see spots, i asked myself to try and justify in my mind what i had just witnessed, through all my rational thought processes i couldn't come up with a logical explanation. most would say that it was a star that had just burned out and i witnessed it; however the flight pattern prior to the bright light would destroy all theories of physics as we now. i have not had a chance to talk about this event in many years, but i can say with confidence now that indeed it was something not of this plant. saying i saw a ufo sounds cliche, but i really think that that was indeed what it was.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with
