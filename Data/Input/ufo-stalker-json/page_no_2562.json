little green men. i simply did not listen to or get envolved in such *rediculous* matters. these toppics were in my openion very ludacris figmants of over active imaginations. however, due to an event that occured that i hold as phenomenal and simply beyond any *reasonable* explanation i find myself so mystafied that i am contacting you about my own ufo event in my search for answers and i can't believe i'm doing it but here it goes.\r\n\r\ni was staying out at my brothers farm in nashville, il. for a couple of weeks helping him with some remodeling on his home and for the most part, everything was pretty normal around there. i always slept in the living room on the sofa when we were through working and eating, resting for another busy day.\r\n\r\nit was in the late summer or early fall of the year 2000. my brothers wife, debbie worked the night shift at a local bar and grill,as a cook, in addieville, illinois called the eagles nest. she was at work when we went to bed at approximately 10:30 in the evening. we had to start working early the next morning so naturally, we were not drinking.\r\n\r\ni was in a very deep sleep when debbie came home from work in an excited state. she turned the light on and hollered in at me to get up because there was something outside that she wanted me to see. from there she went into my brother, ricks room and told him the same thing except she mentioned to him that there was something in the sky and she didn't know what it was. she told him she thought it was a ufo.\r\n\r\non hearing this i rolled back over to go to sleep but still awake, i heard them walk out the kitchen door and could hear them talking about the color, shape, and size of what they were seeing. when they noticed that i hadn't come outside, my brother rick came in just as excited as debbie with debbie at his side telling me that i had to get up and see this ufo. in response i said, \"i do not believe in that ufo crap so leave me alone we have to work in the morning and i'm not working tired\", but debbie looked at me and simply said \"have i ever lyed to you before and why would i lye about this\". i said \"no\" as they walked outside to view it again and that got my attention. she wouldn't lye about this and neither would my brother.\r\n\r\nso that they would leave me alone and i could sleep again, i figured that i would take a look at what they were talking about. as i walked from the front room through the kitchen and walked toward the door which was open, i saw something that woke me up immediately. i was officially curious and sleep was the furthest thing from my mind.\r\n\r\ni walked out the door to where they were with my eyes trained on the object and said nothing as they continued to talk. i felt like i was in shock and i could not believe what i was seeing because i didn't believe in such events. a few minutes went by and still in shock, i hadn't said anything. about that time debbie asked me what i thought it was and instantly my mezmerising shock was broken. i turned and looked to my brother and said, \"ok, rick, tell me about it and somebody wake me up\".\r\n\r\nhe told me, \"believe it or not, i think we are seeing something extrordinairy. i can not explain it except that we must be viewing a ufo\".\r\n\r\nin response i said to him \"is it possible for the government or the militairy to be able to have something so enormous like that?\".\r\n\r\nin answer,as it stood hovering in silence, he said, \"look at the size of that thing and the shape and color and how far away it is and how huge it is. it would be impossible for anyone to be able to construct something so big and brilliant.\"\r\n\r\ndescription:\r\nit was a enormous pyramid shaped object that looked like it was hovering above the tree lines but i knew it was a greater distance away. it was a brilliant, bright orange with no glare or halo. this object did not appear to be moving. as i looked at it, i was looking for imperfections in the objects shape but it appeared perfect. there was no distortion or fuzzyness. i knew that it wasn't the moon with some sort of gasses because the moon was to the right and the sky was extrordinairily clear that morning. i seen nothing that appeared to be rivits or any sort of writing or print. there were no sort of man made features visable. it was not of any oregion that i have ever seen or known in my life time.\r\n\r\nas my trade, i do professional, custom, autobody work, work with many materials and i know about the surface of objects, yet, this was like nothing that i had ever come in contact with and i have no idea what it was made of. it was not an aircraft or giant, orange, glowing, pyramid shaped weather baloon.\r\n\r\ntime seemed like it flew by as we observed it. we could tell that the object though appearing to stand still, was actually moving slowly away from us because it began to get smaller as we watched.\r\n\r\ndebbie said, \"why don't we get our video camera and film it.\", so we all went back inside to get the camera and while we were inside, rick started calling people telling them to look and see if they could see it from where they were and told them to call him back. it wasn't long before the phone started ringing off the hook by a lot of people who others had called to confirm the object. several people came over and some even in their pj's. a few broutht their own video cameras. it was a short time after that before it was almost invisable even from camera view.\r\n\r\nit was about 30 to 35 minutes from the time i first saw it to the time it was gone from site. debbie and sally made coffee for everyone who saw it because we all knew after such an event we would not be sleeping any time soon.\r\n\r\nthe next day:\r\nsome people came by the next day who did not show up durring the event and said they did in fact view it as it happened but because of relative positions in the community they did not want to be mentioned. they were afraid that claiming to have seen such an event would stain their name and hurt their position in the community although they too witnessed it and were dumbfounded by it.\r\n\r\ndebbie was called into work at approximately 11am in the morning. although she was tired she decided to go. someone had called in sick. my brother and i were awake and working in the house and had been awake a short time. rick was in the bathroom working on the shower and i was in the front room working on some trim. i had the tv on scanning the news to see if the news knew anything about the event. to my amazement, it was all over the news because people everywhere were calling in including police officers, medical staff and people from every background even people in 5 other nations. scott afb was tracking the object and confirmed that it wasn't *ours* and no other nation claimed it. the news said that the ufo society would be contacted about the issue (it might have been you guys) and after that i never heard any more about it but would like to know what it was that we saw if possible. my brother and i speak about it periodicaly with friends. \r\n\r\nafter this, i don't know what to believe. since the event my e-mail is planetmeister@yahoo.Com, sort of as an inside joke to those of us who saw it.\r\n\r\nthank you for letting me tell my story. if you have any questions please contact me. i would be glad to help.\r\n\r\n                       p.S. who's out there???\r\n\r\n\r\nrespectfully,\r\n\r\nplanetmeister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My vantage point was from outside my office in woodland hills, ca. i noticed a large (747) fedex jet flying over my office and i thought it was strange for such a large jet to be headed towards burbank airport, as this airfield is generally for smaller commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\nas i watched to see if the plane would turn into the landing pattern for burbank airport, i noticed a bright point of light in the cloud directly behind the fedex jet. at first i only saw one object then i noticed there were at least 2 others.\r\n\r\nthe lights i saw were an amber color. almost as if the object was reflecting the setting sun to the west. i believe i saw 3 distinct objects. but they were only visible as a group for a short period of time. each point of light would vary in intensity. from very bright (they seemed to expand as the light got brighter), to barely visible. the lights had to be quite bright because the objects were clearly visible while being either in the cloud or behind it. and the cloud itself was rather dark.\r\n\r\nnow, these lights were moving in some rather strange patterns. i would describe the flight patterns as parabolic. they would move in one direction and perform what i would describe as a 'u-turn' and move back in the other direction. these 'u-turns' were executed at a high rate of speed. at one point i saw multiple lights performing these manuevers. it resembled two squirreles chasing each other around and up a tree.\r\n\r\nat one point one of the lights was performing the parabaolic maneuver (on an off axis) and it stopped in its tracks. it hovered in that position for roughly 10 seconds. then without a noticeable acceleration period, continued the maneuver at the same high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nall of the movement i witnessed was at a relatively high rate of speed. i would estimate the altitude to be about 10-15,000 feet and the distance from myself to the objects at about 20 miles. i have never seen an object in the air travel this fast or manuever like these objects did. \r\n\r\nat no time were these objects visible outside the the cloud that was moving past. \r\n\r\nthe whole episode lasted 8-10 minutes. at which point the cloud had changed its shape and had moved off into the distance and the objects were no longer appearing.\r\n\r\ni have always been on the fence about the ufo phenomenon. i always believed that people were seeing something, but what they are seeing as of today has not been explained. what i saw today seems to be textbook from what i have heard others have seen - objects moving in a manner that cannot be explained by conventional physics\r\n\r\nsummary - bright points of light in the sky executing manuevers that conventional aircraft (at least any aircraft i am aware of) could not. executing these manuevers at a high rate of speed and stopping/starting on a dime. \r\n\r\ni am quick to point out that i am not claiming i saw et. the truth is, i have no friggin clue what these objects were. all i know is what i saw. i do not drink or use drugs, so i am pretty sure i was not hallucinating. and the fact that i witnessed this over a considerable period of time as apposed to a split second out of the corner of my eye, makes me think i wasn't seeing things that were not there.\r\n\r\ni am curious if any others in the san fernanado valley area saw what i saw. i do know that unless the viewer happened to be looking in that exact area of the sky, they would not have noticed it.\r\n\r\ni was walking to my car form work so i did not have a camera or video camera on my person. all i have is my eyewitness account.\r\n\r\nplease respond if any other reports of this sighting are filed.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

a ufo from los angeles, all the way to seattle, washington. i give you that sighting because i can't remember what time of year, or day it was. i hope you can fix a day and year to this for both of us. i work swing shift security for dshs juvenile rehab at maple lane shool about 20 miles south of olympia. i entered the office and shift change was going on with the passing of information on the days events, over to us. it's a small office, maybe 10by20. i sat in a chair next to the windows facing west, watching the clouds cover the sunset at due west. the clouds were large cumulis, some dark with moisture, and some light. my gaze was interuped with this object moving from right to left, or from noth to south, estimating about 10 miles away. i remember looking very intently as it began to emerge from a cloud into the open in front of another cloud that was dark as a whole. at this time i got up and went outside for a more clearer look. what caught my eye, was this very dark object moving, and as i kept looking, i could see that it was part of a larger object that looked cigar shaped, and if you hold your thumb up at arms length sideways, that is about the size of this object. the leading edge or front with the cocpit, resembled a boeing 747 but with no hump like a 747. the body did not appear to have windows of any type, and it had no wings, tails, or any stablizers. the end of the craft seemed to have the appearence of being flat, vertically, as if cut off. it was moving so slow estimating the speed at about 15 mph. i watched it for about 5 minutes as it just seemed to glide. then i noticed that it was turning away from me headed due west into this dark cloud that was the background for this event. it turned as slow as it was traveling and appeared to seemingly pivot from left to right. it seemed to keep it's speed and disapear into that cloud as if you slowly were to put your finger into a glass of water---slowly! iam familiar with diferent kinds of aircraft, as my brother and me have flown together for 30 years or so. he is a private pilot with all the ratings. there was no sign of propulsion of any kind, and no sound that was detectable by me. this is not my first sighting here in washington, and california. i hope i have been of some help, and could you let me know when this may have happened. i have another sighting from last year which i

working as a night surpervisor for a machine shop in clarksville indiana. it was kind of stuffy inside the building with all the machines running,so i stepped out side to cool off. the area i was in has alot of air traffic in the area, mostly big u.P.S planes,and passenger jets going in and coming out of louisville international. the flight path for approach was right over the building,it was a normal night and they were stacked in formation 5 deep at times. i was smoking a cigarette and watching them go over the building when they broke pattern and left. it was a hazy night,but clear so you could see a good distance. one minute there were 10 planes in the sky,some orbiting, some in single file. the next they had all faded in the distance.  when i noticed this strange colored light in the sky to the northwest,over downtown clarksville. it got my attention because it was a deep ruby red color,and instead of blinking on/off like airplane lights,it pulsed from very bright to dim. it was as bright as white,aircraft landing lights only it was deep red. it moved with a non ballistic motion,it moved forward when it was bright,and completely stopped when dim. i was watching it move to the east for a few minutes,i was so amazed with the motion,that i ran back into the building to get my my younger brother{he worked for me at the time},to come out and see this.   he said the same thing i thought when i first saw it...Holy sh$#.  we stood there watching it asking each other if the other was seeing the strange movement. no noise whatsoever. it must have been more than 5 minutes by now,it was starting to move southeast towards us,and i actually ran back in the building again,and called my father!  i was actually screaming in the phone for him to go outside and see this.  i ran back outside and sure enough it was still there,and now almost directly over the building.  im estimating it was 10000 feet at least 20 feet across. it was still just a sphere,no other lights on it,no structure visible.  by now its moved over the building to the east,and we were both watching this intently,when a basketball sized sphere dropped out of the bottom. the smaller one was unlit,we only saw it because the larger sphere was so bright,it reflected off the smaller one.  as it dropped the smaller sphere,it blinked out.   we were looking for it to reappear,for maybe 15 to 30 seconds,when a fighter jet{f-4} came from the east right to the exact spot it had just been. the f-4 was very loud,and it slowed down approximately where the light had just been and it dipped it's wings back and forth,like he was scanning for this thing.  he turned north ,then turned back to the east. and left the same way he came from.  here we both are with our mouths wide open,looking at each other like\"what the hell just happened\".  nothing ever hit the ground. there was no story about it in the news.  louisville international airport had to see this thing.  for the last 10 years i wondered what the hell that thing was,what it dropped.  i still have no idea,but i do know that it was'nt anything of ours.","distance":"101-500

website (maybe this one) the next day after it happened, said i'd be happy (anxious, in fact) to talk to an investigator and got no response.  now i'm really anxious that someone notices this report, because today i read on this site of a sighting this same night (oct. 1, 2006)at approximately 15 min. earlier, in huerfano county (which is se of where i saw the ufo; it would have been traveling nw when i saw it!) so...I was commuting to denver from montrose as i do almost every weekend, between my home there and my work in denver.  i was very late this time,but i had napped first, so i didn't feel drowsy.  i was about 10 mi. west of vail, closer to edwards (where there is a small airfield).  i was fairly close to the eagle river.  it was in a valley where lifestock grazes; otherwise, no light pollution, no buildings, little traffic on the road at this time.  i happened to look up at the southern horizon and noticed several streaks of light which looked like shooting stars. i expected them to fizzle out, but, instead, they stopped abruptly  above the highway and i was looking at a globular formation of glowing (shimmering) lights, perfectly spaced--i would say five or six of them in a cluster. each light was large and round (i can't really say how high up they might have been, but i judged them at height a helicoptor might fly).  they hovered to south of the road, then disappeared for a second or two and reappeared to north of the road.  it seemed they had shifted their position at the same altitude and held the same formation.  they hovered there for a few seconds, then ascended at about a 45 degree angle and disappeared on the northern horizon (just the reverse of the way they had entered my field of vision).  i would say that the whole episode must have lasted from five to 10 minutes.  i was able to pull my car to the shoulder and watch with the motor running while this was going on. it was dark and cold out, so i didn't get out of the care, but watched through the windshield.  i heard nothing (radio off--though i hadn't been getting any reception--strange near vail).  i thought it was odd that a few big trucks passed me on the highway, apparently not taking notice of this!!  when it was all over, i was in wonder.  this was absolutely not like anything i'd ever seen in the sky!  it moved much too fast to be any type of aircraft i've ever even heard of, and it disappeared and reappeared!!  i'm still amazed that i saw this at all.  but the other report from further south in the state (maybe 150-200 mi. s) confirms in my mind that i must have seen the same thing--just that the other sighting was of balls flying in a line-up type of formation, instead.  i am very excited to think that that sighting might well confirm what i saw!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
