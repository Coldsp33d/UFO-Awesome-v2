(this event occurred anytime from the 1st to the 10th of nov.  i know this because we were on our way to hear billy graham. i checked with their organization. he had a crusade there nov.1-10, 1974. the 1st was a friday, and i think that was the night we went.) we parked, went into their apt. a few minutes, then stepped outside onto the sand to leave. i happened to glance up and said, \"what's that?\". hovering silently over the beach, where the water meets the sand, at about tree-top level was a flying object. it was round, like two saucers put rim to rim.  around the rim were white lights going around. there was a single red light on top. it was large enough to hold several people. all four of us saw it. we weren't frightened, just startled and perplexed. i was a little awestruck. we stood and watched it for quite awhile, then it started to move east down the beach very slowly. it did not change altitude. there was no sound.  we hopped into the car and drove east on ocean view ave., which runs parallel to the beach. by looking out the window to our left, we could just see it between the buildings.  we followed it until we lost sight of it,(we had stop lights) then went on to see billy graham.  i'd say the whole event lasted 15 min. or so. we didn't report it, as norfolk is a navy town, and we thought it might have been some experimental craft. i did check the newspapers the next day to see if anyone else saw anything, but couldn't find any information. even though it was many years ago, i remember it vividly and i'm sure my ex-husband does too.  unfortunately, i cannot remember the name of the other couple. my husband's name at that time was mark lewis. he was in the navy and was stationed in norforlk in 1973-1974, where we lived on ocean view ave. if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

fairview heights, illinois. fairview heights is only about a half hour drive from st. louis, missouri but on the illinois side of the mississippi river. we took a short cut down some country, back roads that would help us avoid the holiday traffic. though st. clair county is a highly populated area, it still has a little bit of farm land left. \r\n   we stopped on one of the back roads to watch a fireworks display that was visable in the distance. it was being heald at a store about a mile away. we sat there for about 5 minutes watching when my mother asked me if a car was coming. i looked behind me but saw no car. this was odd because our whole car was engulfed in light. it was as if we were sitting under a street light but we were in the middle of nowhere (sort of) my mother asked me if there was a car as more of a confirmation than a question. when i confirmed that i didn't see a car either, we both looked into the corn field on the side of the road to see if someone was shining a flashlight into our car. when we saw that no one was in the field we got a little worried. (not that some maniac in a corn field with a flash light on the 4th of july would have been a welcome sight.)\r\n   no car, no maniac, we were starting to worry. then, out of the corner of my eye i saw something both amazing and terrifying at the same time. a large blue ...Something... was in the sky above us and a little to the left of us. the object was shaped sort of like a saucer with a tail. we only saw it for a brief monent. we didn't stick around long enough to see the *inside* of it, if you know what i mean. \r\n   i don't know what i saw was and no matter how hard i try, i can not logically explain away the event. not using the logic that holds with the rest of the worlds views as *logical*. though i can't tell you what i did see, i can tell you what i did not see. i didn't see a plain or jet. i didn't see a helecolptor. i didn't see a commit or metior. i didn't see a satelite. i didn't see a missile. i didn't see a rocket ship, and i sure as hell didn't see a weather baloon!\r\n   i must note that the next morning my mother brought home the latest edition of the st. louis, post dispatch (newspaper). on the front page was a picture of the thing that we say the night before. it was seen over the st. louis v.P. fair at about the same time we saw it. hundreds of people reported seeing it including the reporter who wrote the article. he contacted scott air force base that night. (a militairy instilation a few miles from where i saw the object). scott afb reported that they picked up nothing out of the ordinairy and that there were no strange atmosphereic phanomina that night that they were aware of. they also stated that they were not flying any aircrafts at that time (or weather baloons).\r\n   i know what i saw and i know what i didn't see. you might think i am out of my mind or incapable of distinguishing between a sky scraper and a helecopter but i know what i saw. it was no weather baloon either.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":6358,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.5922715,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02112007-0001","longitude":-89.9112124,"occurred":868078800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":868078800000,"summary":"Blue, teardropish (blob), shaped ufo spotted in o'fallon illinois on the 4th of july, 1997","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"O'Fallon, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:482218"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Phoenix","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife,two daughters, dog and i were walking west on east 26 st toward our home at around senven twenty pm. it ws a clear night. as i walked west with my dog,i suddenly noticed an object that appeared to be a meteor. i called to my wife and kids and we observed the firebal. as the fireball made a descent, it split into two. after the split the two objects stopped in mid air and split into four to six object. one by one each object dissapeared in an orderly fashion, and reaappeared in a orderly fashion. it was spectacular. a few moments later the objects merged into one object and continued in a south western direction.

the horizon.) venus was very bright (white) in the sky.  this was approximately 6:30pm (central.)\r\n\r\nmy friend and i witness two orange balls (one larger than the other) at 7:05pm (central.)  these objects were moving. these objects appeared to be very near the monroe city area, we were in washington driving west. i quickly found venus which was evident and about to set, these orange balls were not venus. each orange ball quickly dissappeared (not at the same time.)  we were travelling west on a country road and saw them reappear in a different location.  one orange ball was larger and quickly disappeared.  when it did disappear i noticed a twinkling at the location it disappeared.  my friend and i noticed about 4 - 6 other twinkling objects (which were moving.)  from then on we observed frequent (5 - 7 minutes) of orange balls appearing and disappearing at approximately 15 - 20 degrees up from the horizon.  during this time you could see the same twinkling after (some) of the sightings.  a drawing of the most common observation (two balls) is attached.\r\n\r\nover the next 3 - 5 minutes we observed a series of appear/disappear events with up to 3 orange balls, some very close to the ground (a 3 ball drawing is attached).  i then notice an orange ball, low to the horizon, move straight up, sort of bob up and down then disappear.  2 or 3 minutes passed and we saw the large ball appear followed by 4 more in an semi-circle line and another ball appearing(6 at the same time.) drawing of this incident is attached.\r\n\r\nat this time we called jerry sievers (vincennes) of indiana mufon (approximatly 7:20pm central.) at approximately 7:25pm central we observed one more orange ball appear/disappear much further south (south of monroe city 3 miles) which was very low in the horizon.  \r\n\r\nour last observation was one of the twinkling objects which passed directly over our heads (approximately 1000 feet) at 7:28pm central.  we could not discern a sound and the object had one red light and a swirling strobe (swirling around in a circle).  the strobe was very odd and we both commented how (un-airplane like) the strobe was. we could not clearly make out the shape of the object.  the object was traveling north.  we waited several minutes longer and did not see any more activity (7:45pm central.)\r\n\r\nwe must have observed orange balls at least 18 - 20 times over the 25 minutes.  sometimes the balls were stationary, some times they were moving.  the largest gap in time between sightings was 4 - 5 minutes. one time a smaller orange ball seemed to be rotating around a larger orange ball before both disappeared.  our conclusion was that we were witnessing a ufo incident.  each time we observed a new orange ball we shouted \"there it is, there's another one.\"  \r\n\r\nwe tried to reason away these objects as flares, meteors and airplanes.  the orange balls varied in \"orange\" intensity.  each observation was different from the previous observation in movement and location.  we did not believe they were flares due to the multiple locations (across the horizon) which we viewed these objects and the twinkling after some of the post-disappearance observations.  there were no trailing tails as seen with meteors.  the low altitude made us certain these were not airplanes especially when the 6 orange ball event (at the same time) happened.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

way home from a friends house when i spotted what i thought at first was a planet, maybe venus.\r\n\r\nthis object was to my left in the eastern sky, and looked to be a few miles away from me--(after some research i found out that this object was most probably 2-3 miles away from my location when i first spotted it.) \r\n\r\nthis object was very bright, and a light orange color. even though i thought it looked awful large for a planet, i still assumed it must be since it was not twinkling like stars do.\r\n\r\ni pointed the light out to my son, and proceeded to bore him with trivia like how to tell if a star is a star or if its a planet. the object was in my view the entire time i was driving-(except short periods when trees obscured it.) a little over 2 miles up the road i had to make a left turn to head due east. i had started thinking there was something weird looking about the light so once i turned, and saw no other cars were coming, i stopped in the road to have a safer look.\r\n\r\nthis was when i noticed the light was moving, and also that it was not a single light, but three lights! i thought to myself that it was weird for an airplane to have three large lights underneath it like that because for it to have been an airplane the two front lights would have had to have been on the end of each wing, and the third rear one on the tail, but all would have had to have been directly underneath the object.\r\n\r\nthese lights all looked to be the same distance apart and were very big looking lights, all large, all the same color, no pulsing, or color changing, and they were set in a triangle pattern--(note i stated the shape of the craft was triangular, but i am unsure of the actual shape of the craft itself--only what formation the three lights were in.) \r\n\r\none thing that struck me as very odd as well was that the triangle formation was backwards---the two side by side lights were leading, with the 'tip' bringin up the rear.\r\n\r\nthey didn't appear to be landing lights, and after later checking a map i realized the 'plane' was not coming from, or going towards the direction of the closest airport anyway, so i'm sure it wasn't landing or taking off.\r\n\r\nthe object was closer to me by the time i stopped to look and was heading towards me in a diagonal path. i made no unusual note of speed, or movement--(it appeared to move slowly, but i wouldn't say notably slow, nor did i see any unusual movements that defy conventional aircraft performance.) i heard no sounds as if an airplane, or helicopter, was passing overhead, but i never actually cut my van off, so i suppose it's possible there were some sounds.\r\n\r\nthis object appeared to be flying pretty low, yet was too high for me to make out any of the aircraft itself--i could only see the three lights. it's possible this may have been a normal, everyday aircraft, but i have to say that i've been driving for many years, and have been out lots of times at night, and i have seen many, many, airplanes, helicopters, and such in the night sky at varying distances. i've seen all kinds of colored lights on planes at night time,at different altitudes, sometimes steady, sometimes blinking and blipping around.\r\n\r\nmore than a few of them have given me pause, but i always realize very quickly that it is in fact just an airplane, or some other form of 'normal' aircraft. i can't say as i've ever seen three big orange colored lights in that formation on the very bottom of an airplane like that before. ever.\r\n\r\nto give you an idea of the distance away from me, as well as the size of these lights, it would have probably taken a nickle held out at arms length in order to have covered just one of the 3 lights. \r\n\r\nso, just when the object was about to pass overtop of me, a car ended up turning on the road behind me that i was stopped on, so i drove up to the next side road and turned on it to find a place to turn around and try to watch this thing some more.\r\n\r\ni did this in about a one minute time period, losing sight of the object as i did so. i made a left onto this side road, went a very short distance, then turned left again into a dirt path that was in front of a clearing. this put me facing straight at where i had just came from. i stopped and searched out the object, finding it easily as it made its way in the same diagonal trek, but in front and away from me this time.\r\n\r\ni sat there maybe 30 more seconds as it grew smaller in the distance, then drove home, calling the person whos house i had just left from to tell him that i thought i may have just seen a ufo--(this is the reason i am positive about the time and duration of the sighting due to my cell call log.)\r\n\r\ndon't know if this is helpful or not, but my physical coordinates around the time i first laid eyes on the object were at roughly\r\n lat: -76.9872522354126 - lon: 36.74926092648688  \r\nand after studying a map of the area, and judging by the horizontal direction this object was flying in while it was coming towards me on black creek rd--(when i realized first this thing was three lights)--i estimate that the craft was coming from the vicinity of the following coordinates; lat: -76.96995735168457 - lon: 36.75394593241057\r\n\r\ni wanted to add that i filed my sighting with the nuforc the night after i saw this. i've recieved no response from them, but my report is now posted on their site.\r\n\r\nthe night after i submitted to the nuforc site, i was googling around, in search of any other possible information, or witnesses, that may have came forward about the same sighting and came across the hbcc ufo research site owned by a very nice man by the name of brian vike.\r\n\r\ni filed a report with his site as well, which led to a subsequent radio interview i did for him for his weekly radio show called the vike report, that aired this past sunday.\r\n\r\nsince i filed my report with those two sites, i have been trying to locate any other possible reports that may pertain to what i saw. i've called my local paper here in franklin, 'the tidewater news', as well as contacted a lady from a bigger paper, 'the virginian pilot', to see if either of the papers had any reports. both were negative.\r\n\r\ni also contacted via email one of our local news channels,wavy tv-10, which also turned out to be a dead end. i have kept an eye and an ear out for anything pertaining to any unusual sightings made that day, or that week, but so far have found nothing. i am confused because i find it so hard to believe i was the only person to see this! \r\n\r\nthis is a big reason why i decided to file with your site as well--i got to thinking that with my report on these three main ufo research site, that maybe out of the three, maybe someone from my area might see my report who also saw what i did, and decide to contact one of you. i hope so, anyway.\r\n\r\ni made and am sending you two drawings i made via a computer paint program. one drawing represents pretty much the exact way i saw the object in the sky--the direction it was heading, as well as the size in relation to how it looked to me up in the sky from my van. \r\n\r\nthe other represents how large the 'orange planet' appeared to me when i first spotted it by comparing it to the 'north star'--(my north star isn't meant to say thats how big the north star really is, but only to show a comparison--in other words, this is how much bigger my object was in relation to how big the north star might look.)\r\n\r\ni also am sending a map that i located online detailing exactly where i was while seeing this object.\r\n\r\nthank you so much for your time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6346,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.6776507,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02082007-0006","longitude":-76.9224608,"occurred":1169610000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1169610000000,"summary":"Three

february 4rd., 2007 in mesa arizona but will try.\r\n\r\nat or about 5 pm i was sitting out on her patio of a friends house i am visiting when watching the late afternoon aircraft heading into land at phx, they were shinning and practically glowing in the low afternoon sun with a clear sky. i was facing east when i noticed off to my right a small object, traveling north, seemingly floating along rather lazily, almost hovering and assumed it was a balloon some child had lost grab of.  i was hard to tell how high it was as it never was close enough visually to judge if it was in ���front��� of or ���behind��� the path of the aircraft.\r\n\r\ni really didn���t give it much thought however with the approach of the next aircraft i noticed it was till there and seemed to be almost at the same place. this caught my attention since it had not appeared to change position or altitude in those several minuets.\r\n i then observed this object for at least another 15 minuets.\r\n\r\nmy first impression of it ���hovering��� was incorrect in fact it was very slowly ���drifting��� south along the same direction as the aircraft were heading toward phx.\r\n\r\ni specifically say object since observing it i was able to determine it had volume and some colors;\r\nthis was due to that low sun; although i was observing something that was approximately an eight of an inch to my eye at that distance and height (still unknown) it was enough to determine shading associated with a visual volume. i was still under the impression it was merely a balloon or perhaps a bunch of balloons sine there seem to be changes of color; orangeish yellowish and what seems to be either a whitish light of something reflecting, these color changes were not in sequence or of any discernible pattern but then i was looking at some rather tiny in my fielded of vision. \r\n\r\nafter a few moments either i simply first noticed or it appeared suddenly behind this object (i will explain later how i determined that too was solid) another smaller bright silver ���dot���, i assume this was a ball.\r\n\r\nmy first reaction up on seeing the second object was this indeed must be nothing more than a bunch of balloons but no sooner had i thought than i realized this was mostly likely not the case. i say that because it was about two and a half inches behind the first object. if it was a balloon that had separated from the bunch it was on a string of unlikely tremendous length. if it had separated from the bunch unattached it was following at exactly the same speed and altitude and in fact never altered from the full course of this event. in other words it maintained its relative position to the larger ���first��� object even during an interesting change of course.\r\n\r\n after several minuets of observation during which time it traveled from my far right to a position to just past my left, a path in constant speed and altitude for several minuets, i realized it was slowly turning toward my relative position, that is toward the west. as i continued to observe it drifted along making a large u-turn so as to be slightly in ���back��� of my position but almost to it, much closer than it was before.  it then straightens out to what seemed a parallel path to its first observation and finally retreated out of my view.\r\n\r\nonce again there appeared to be no change in speed or altitude or the color changes and the same held true of the small following silver object. however after completing the u of the turn the small silver object behind turned dark, this indicated to me that it might be a reflective surface since the sunlight on it was now in a different position relative to my position and this was the ���shadow��� side i was now seeing.  after a short time it was hard to see the small following silver object but the first object was at a constant level of brightness thorough out the observation leaving me to wonder if in fact it was self-illuminated rather than from the sunlight.\r\n\r\ni was never able to fully distinguish a ���shape��� for the first object but i was left with an impression it was more vertical, that is higher than wide.\r\n\r\ni did point these objects out to my friend who was coming in and out during the observation time but she was less interested so i at least have a witness who in fact saw the same thing.\r\n\r\ni have no idea if this is of any interest to you. as to my feelings? well i have no strong opinion as to what this may have been but, however, it was most interesting to me and unlike anything i have ever observed, enough so to take this time to report my first very own ufo sighting.  \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

was about 12 years old which puts this event in the 1967 time frame.   sorry i don't have a better date.\r\n\r\ni remember it was a very nice summer day and i was on summer vacation from school.   i had gone out in to our back yard to play about 9am.   temperature was very pleasant (i remember having a t-shirt).   i could hear the pounding of the drop hammers at the local forging factory several blocks away (american logging tool).   the sky was beautiful and had occational big puffy fair weather clouds floating by (can't remember their direction).\r\n\r\ni looked up in the sky to the west and saw something.  i thought at first it was an aircraft and i loved aircraft so continued watching.   it was tracking straight from west to east and came right over our back yard.   \r\n\r\ni saw a show on tv a while back (discovery or history channel) and they showed a picture that clicked as to being very similar to what i saw.   that is what piqued my interest in learning more about this ufo.\r\n\r\nit appears to be in the cigar classification.   it was silver in color and the closest shape i could liken it to is the goodyear blimp on the ends.   some pictures i have seen look more pointed than my object and just don't fit.\r\n\r\nthe object did not have any lights.   the object was totally silent.  i remember birds (robins) singing the entire time.   the very odd thing was the object was rotating.   not in a spiral like a football but about its lateral axis (like a boomarang).   i would estimate its rotational rate to be 1 revolution per second.\r\n\r\n\r\nas i said it tracked in a perfectly straight line from west to east.   i yelled at my mom to come out and see but she said she was busy.  i yelled again and she yelled back she was on the phone.   so i just stood there and watched.   the total trip was about 30 seconds.   it passed below the clouds.\r\n\r\ni have been unable to find anything similar in the time period i have estimated (+/2 years in michigan (or elsewhere in this region).   \r\n\r\ni had pretty much forgotten about the incident.   i worked for mcdonnell douglas in flight test for many years and saw a lot of very cool stuff.   i have worked with structures, flight controls and propulsions groups and nothing i have worked with would give me any clues to what i saw.   when i saw the picture on tv it clicked and i remember thinking \"damn, what was that thing?\".   i am also a licensed private pilot.\r\n\r\nin reviewing your points to be covered i would like to mention the flight path of the object and its maneuvering were not radom or irratic.   everything was smooth and deliberate.   there were no course changes or apparent altitude.\r\n\r\nmy feelings were neutral.  i didn't know what it was and i was looking at it with more wonder than anything.   i was not afraid of it.   afterwards i returned to my playing and bike riding.   \r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object as it traveled east and traveled beyond the tree line.\r\n\r\ni would love to see some pictures of cigar shaped objects to see if i could identify it.   when i see it i will know.   it is hard to estimate the size as i don't know what it's altitude was.   something in the area of 100 feet long and maybe 30 feet in diameter would probably get in the ballpark of size and proportions.   rounded ends, not very pointy though.","distance":"501 Feet -

stopped i noticed a spherical object moving across the sky from north to south  slowly at maybe 45 degrees above the horizon. i thought to myself,\"what is that?\" as i continued to observe the object i did not think it was a ufo, i simply tried to figure out what it was and i could not fit it into any familiar category that i knew of. i thought perhaps it is a bird, but as i kept looking i could not detect any head or wings or feet or tail. it appeared as a distinct sherical object moving at a steady pace, not fast. the side of the object that was towards the sun was very shiny like polished metal. the side away from the sun looked dull greyish. at this point i could not tell how far away it was or how high. then i saw a large bird in the sky that appeared to be a hawk or a buzzard, or some other large bird. this bird then began flying towards the object as if to check it out. when the bird appeared to be about two feet or so away from the object, the bird abruptly turned away at about a ninty degree angle and flew away and did not return. this gave me an idea of the size of the object, and about how far away it was, by comparing the wingspan of the bird. the object appeared to be very near, and perhaps 200 feet in the air(this is merely a guess) it is hard to estimate the height. even at this stage, i did not think i was seeing a ufo, i was just trying to figure out what it was. i've seen balloons in the sky, and this did not look like that. balloons usually seem to rise, this object moved laterally. also, it was very shiny. i had to go ahead and make my left turn, so i lost sight of it as i turned north. it was at this point that it hit me how odd this was, i had never seen anything even close to this. at he next block i turned around to go back and see if was still visible. this took probably little over a minute. but when i got back there was nothing to see. i then remembered video i had seen on tv of sightings in mexico i think of shiny spherical objects, and what i saw was identical to those videos. later in the day when i thought about it, i felt that it was strange that i did not get excited or afraid when i was seeing this. it was like i had suspended judgement and was merely an observer. as i left the scene of the sighting, i went about my business running some errands and then went to work. i didnt even think about it for a while, until i was at work and i told some people about it. they were all skeptical. i cannot say what it was i saw, but it was so distinct of an object, not fuzzy, or in the sun, or obscurred in any way. it was as plain as day.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

debbie. we were camping for the weekend at applegate lake in southern oregon, near the small town of applegate. i can't remember exactly what month it was. i do know that it was sometime in the summer because we were camping at hart-tish campground and it is only open during the summer months. it was a fairly warm, saturday evening. it was a beautiful night, the water on the lake was so calm, and the stars were abundant.\r\n sometime just prior to midnight, shawn and debbie were fishing off the shore of the lake. ray and i joined them about 30 minutes later. as soon as we reached them, they excitedly told us that about 15 minutes before that, they both witnessed what they described as the most spectacular meteor/falling star/fireball shoot down from the sky. they both stated that they had never seen anything like it before and they wanted to know if we had seen it. we told them that we did not and debbie went on to describe it as something that looked like it was exploding as it fell from the sky. she said it was huge and that it seemed like it landed across the lake in the mountains. they were very dramatic about the way that they described it to us and very excited about what they had witnessed. \r\nbeing that i am a stargazer and it was such a gorgeous night, i asked ray if we could float around the lake in our tahiti. i had never been on the water at night, so we all decided to float around the lake. by the time we all got situated, the water had lots of ripples but there was no wind. the air was very still and calm. we did notice however that the sky was lighting up all along the direction of the opposite side of the lake from us. we thought that there must have been some lightning going on in the far distance, although, it was beautiful and clear where we were. shawn and debbie took off before us in their rowboat and headed to the left.  as we started to paddle off, we were having trouble getting anywhere.  our tahiti kept spinning in cirles.  we thought that maybe we needed to switch places so we did but that didn't help. it seemed as if we could only stay near the edge of the lake.  the more we would get near the middle of the lake, the more we would spin and get nowhere. it just seemed like we couldn't get anywhere no matter how hard ray tried to paddle. by this time, we could no longer see shawn and debbie. it was too dark. we decided to stay to the right since we were having trouble. as we took off, i noticed what looked like maybe a tanker truck/fire truck of some sort, driving down the road across the lake from us. it turned onto a dirt road, headed up the mountain. we couldn't see it anymore but it was headed in the direction that debbie had earlier described as the area that the fireball seemed to have fallen.\r\nfrom our viewpoint, there was no one else on the lake other than shawn and debbie. although at this point, we still could not see them. the direction that i was facing was the direction that shawn and debbie had gone. i was in a reclining position, looking up at the constellation pleiades [which is my favorite of all constellations]. suddenly, at the top of the mountain, some bright lights came on. they were so bright that i thought it was possibly the truck that i had seen disappear up the dirt road. i thought that maybe they had reached the top and that they were facing the lake and turned on their bright halogen lights.  it was very eerie. it frightened me because i figured whoever was in that vehicle was looking right down on us in the lake and that they could probably see us very well.  ray had a cigarette lit and i even made him put it out, hoping that it would be harder for them to see us. we just looked like an easy target for anyone who might be target shooting! ray turned the tahiti around so i wasn't facing the light and told me to relax.  i kept turning around and looking because they were not turning off their lights. then, i noticed that the lights were getting higher in the trees, which didn't make sense.  i then became very startled when i realized the lights were actually now at the treetops. i said \"oh my god ray...Look!!! it's rising!!! we watched it get higher and higher, above the trees!! as it got higher, we could see that it was much bigger and brighter. we were both freaked out and started heading back to shore. i then spotted shawn and debbie's flashlight waving and although we couldn't make out their boat yet, we started screaming for them and they were screaming for us.  as we got closer to them, we could hear them screaming, \"do you see it???!!!?...Do you see it????\"  it was so huge and soooo bright and just ever so slowly rose in the sky. as it rose, it was going away from us. we all sat in our boats and watched it slowly rise for about 2 hours. as we compared events, the told us that they too could not get far from shore because their boat would spin. debbie said that shawn picked up his flashlight and started waving it when the light was at the treetops. she got scared and made him put it out. she didn't want to draw attention to them. she thought it was a ufo at that point, and she believes that whatever it was that she saw earlier in the sky, had something to do with this object that we were now witnessing.  after it was quite high in the sky, all the ripples in the lake suddenly subsided and we had no problem paddling our boats. we were thoroughly exhausted by this time and getting quite cold so we decided to go back to camp.  shawn and i took up the first load from our boats.  when we came back, debbie and ray had noticed that they could see what looked like thousands of fish across the lake from us, all along the shoreline...The same side as the earlier flashes which we thought was lightning, the same side that the object seemed to fall from the sky, the same side that the light appeared on the mountain.  co-incidence??? i doubt it. phenomenon?...We perceived it as some magnetic occurrence in the water due to whatever it was that rose off of that mountain. i couldn't let it go. everyone else finally fell asleep, but i sat on the ground watching this light move further and further away.  finally, around 7:00 in the morning, i couldn't watch any longer. the object now appeared to be the brightness of a distant star. the sun was out and all the stars in the sky were gone...Except for what was left of this object that rose in the sky before my eyes, several hours earlier.  i tried to draw the shape of this incredibly bright object. i'm not sure how to explain it. it was a shaped most like an oval but it kind of had an indentation on top of it. it's hard to describe the shape of a huge, bright, moving, light.\r\na few years after our sighting, my son was watching a program on t.V. about ufo sightings. he yelled for me to come listen because a couple of men were telling their story and it was very much like ours. same scenario...On a lake, at night, even waved their flashlights towards it. but they said their light came towards them and now some 10 -20 years later, they are having dreams of abduction! \r\nabout 2 years ago, i received a phone call from a friend of mine whom i had told my experience to.  she said that she was listening to one of the radio stations in our area. the subject was talking about ufo's and someone called in saying that they had experienced a ufo sighting at applegate lake. according to my friend, the caller had been camping in the area around the same time that we were. \r\ni know that what we witnessed was paranormal. i am so thankful that our friends were there to collaborate our experience with this unusual event!","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
