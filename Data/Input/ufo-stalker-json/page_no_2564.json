bluffs east of the south tower of the golden gate bridge looking west north west at the queen mary 2 awaiting her entrance to the gate. the qm2 had just started to proceed toward the gate as this sphere came from the direction over our right shoulders into our line of sight, from the south end of the gate heading west first, then south west on an arcing trajectory in, toward baker beach.  at first i assumed it was a balloon that had been release but then it was not acting like a balloon in that it moved so fast (approx 30-50 mph)and it did not move with the winds.  the winds were very light, which is unusual for that location. it was perfectly round and i saw it change direction and stay perfectly round. a balloon is not perfectly round; it always has some tail shape.  its speed and smoothness of movement combined with no sound reminded me of the video images i have seen on tv of other ufo's, specifically, the ones over the crop circles in england.  i had pointed it out to my friend who, watch it with as much interest as i did and we watched it until it landed in the water and disappeared with no splash. we could not come up with an explanation and both concluded it to be an unidentifiable flying object.  if i were to hold up my hand at arms length (i'm 5'2\") as it went by it would have been no bigger than my thumb. it was approximately 100-150 yards distance from us and about 100 yards higher at first, and then dropped to sea level. what is interesting is how much air traffic was in the area at the time. we counted three small planes and 6 helicopters.  the helicopters were flying close overhead so i had had a good perspective to judge the sphere's size by. slightly bigger than a basketball.  other's must have seen it given the amount of air traffic in the air and people (approx 300-500) on the bluffs. there might be a picture of it too as everyone was taking pictures of the qm2.  except for me.  :(","distance":"501 Feet - 1

city.  he was driving.  while we were talking, i looked up at him, and happened to see this stationary object in the sky hovering over the land, just to the north of where we were, from one to two thousand feet away, i would guess.  it wasn't large.  we were travelling east, and were about to pass over hwy 321, a four lane divided road.  between us and the craft was a shopping center with a lot of lights.  there was a lot of traffic, so i can't have been the only one to see this.  it was rather low in the sky, and there were buildings between us and it, as we travelled along.  we'd pass a building, and then i would see it again.  i remarked to my husband, \"what am i looking at!\"  i thought i'd wait until we got passed this brightly lit service station (petro express) and then i would get a long look at it as we passed over 321.  well, we got past the station, and it was no longer there.  \r\n\r\nwhat i had seen was an oblong shaped disk that had some sort of bluish light in it, but what was also spectacular was the cone-shaped, white beam of light emanating down, pointing to the south, much like a helicopter beam would be like.  i've seen those.  but this was not a helicopter.  there was a plane behind it, that was probably approaching the charlotte airport (we are 40 minutes from there).  when i got to the overpass, the plane was there, but the object with the beam of light was not.\r\n\r\ni  have never really given any credence to such sightings, so i was a bit slow to tell my husband.  but i did, about two hours later.  then, two days later i read a story in the charlotte observer about all these reports that had come in, along with a photograph of the vehicle one man in kings mountain (just south of here) had taken.  it was exactly the same object i had seen, but without the beam of light going down. the paper just laughted at it.   but they did insert a map showing locations of all the calls that had come in---there were 19, not including any from lincoln county, where we live.  the sightings were from union, iredell, cabarrus, gaston and mecklenburg counties.  but there was  a man from lincoln who called 91i, granville angell, who wrote a column in our local paper about it.  i was so glad he did, because i did not want to be the only one here who had seen it.  i talked with him today, and he said he is going to be interviewed on cnn by anderson coopeer tonight or tomorrow, at 10 p.M.  he is going to be in touch with me about this this week.  he is connected with your group.\r\n\r\ni told him that i would not have believed people talking like this had i not seen it.  but i also told him that i was a bit surprised that i felt not any fear at all about seeing this, that i felt that whoever they were, they were curious and investigative and had gone to a lot of trouble to be here, but that none of that adds up to anything that would inspire fear in an observer.  they might be quite friendly.  \r\n\r\nif you want to be afraid of something, be afraid of global warming.  that's the big one.  i have seen al gore's video three times now.  and my husband, an environmental geologist, has been worried about this problem for 25 years.  that is the real catastrophe around the corner.\r\n\r\ndo you think these beings know about this calamity that is about to befall us? our government is hiding its head in the sand about climate change.  and probably you think it's doing the same regarding ufo's.  i can't understand why they seem to want to hide this from the public.  but maybe knowledge is power, and they want all of it.  a real democracy, we do not have.\r\n\r\nwho knows.  all i know is, god is still in charge.  he is over everything, including life from elsewhere.  and he is a kind and loving god.  so my feelings are not against whoever is in these vehicles.   i don't have anything against them at all.  maybe they are positioning themselves to live here when we have really ruined the environment for ourselves.  maybe they have reason to believe they will be able to live in it, for all i know.  we may see more and more of these now, as the climate problem escalates.\r\n\r\ni'd love to know if someone in your group agrees with me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

about my daily routine.  i let the dog out, got the kids out of bed and dressed, made breakfast and got everyone fed, prepared school snacks, ensured everyone had their teeth and hair brushed and off we went to await the school bus arrival of 6:45am.  in other words, i was awake, not dreaming.  luckily our bus stops just 20 feet away from my long driveway so i don���t have far to go in the morning.  the bus arrived on cue and i watched the children step in and as i was turning to head back inside, immediately out of the corner of my eye, about 10 feet up above the bus, i saw something flying over it.  my initial reaction was a ball was tossed by someone and my body reacted out of protection and i shifted and turned to see who did what.  i scanned the neighbor���s yard to see if anyone was standing there since that was the general direction that the object apparently came from.  as the kids were getting on the bus, my eyes shifted up and i caught ���the ball��� with my eyes and stared in awe as it glided gently now over the bus and across the street over the other neighbors roof and into the wooded tree line in his back yard.  it first appeared as a softball sized object and it was lit up like an ember.  my next thought was why would someone be shooting fireworks because as it glided across it became smaller like the size of a tennis ball and slowly dissipated and dematerialized somewhat like what you would see in a 4th of july fireworks display.  there was no sound and this was not a firework.  i stared at ���the lit ball��� in total disbelief as it disappeared into the tree line.  i knew i had witnessed something peculiar and as i walked back up the driveway, i turned around one last time to see if anything else was going on but i saw was nothing.  this ���thing��� was traveling at about ��� less the velocity of a tossed ball.  in other words it was slow, like a butterfly, so i was able to watch its every move.\r\n\r\nnow the second phase of my daily routine would entail numerous chores and home management activities and i am typically off and running as soon as the kids get on the bus and i don���t normally slow down until their return in the afternoon.  that day was different.  i walked back into the house, felt an overwhelming desire to crawl back into bed and that is exactly what i did.  in fact i immediately fell into such a deep sleep that i was shocked when i woke up after 11:00 that morning.  the only reason i woke up 4 hours later, is that i heard what sounded like two helicopters flying past too close to my house.  i really thought my windows would shatter.\r\n\r\ni got up and was ticked off that these people would have the nerve to fly by so low and especially in a quiet northern atlanta suburbs near the polo fields.  it���s an area with many small pastures, some horses and cattle, a couple of schools which means plenty of ���young uns��� and nowhere near any military bases.  i looked out the window on their second or third ���fly by��� and noticed there was indeed two helicopters and they were dark colored but now they were too high up above for me to see any details.  in the 3 ��� years we have lived in this house there have not been any airplanes or helicopters utilizing this airspace and especially not any flying so low as to rattle my windows.\r\n\r\nanyway, as the afternoon progressed i was glad when my husband called to ask if we wanted to go out to dinner.  i was still very much lagging behind, feeling exhausted and the thought of schlepping in the kitchen once again was the last thing i wanted to do.\r\n\r\nwe returned near 8:00pm and after giving the kids their baths, i went downstairs to the kitchen to review the next day���s schedule and prepare the kids backpacks for morning.  i caught another light out of the corner of my eye and heard what sounded like a tractor behind my house.  this seemed odd and since it was dark out.  i stepped out back to look past our pool and fence which separated us from another pasture to investigate why anyone would be ���mowing��� this pasture with headlights so late in the evening in the middle of winter.  as soon as i scanned the pasture, i saw nothing.  no movement, no light, and then suddenly i hear another helicopter in the distance and the darned thing flies towards and above my house at a close enough distance to once again rattle my windows.  i stepped back inside annoyed and closed the door. my husband walks in and sees i���m agitated, says he heard it too and i proceeded to tell him they had been flying by earlier that day and they need to quit!   again, nothing else was mentioned.  not that i did not think that i could openly reveal this paranormal experience, it���s just that it really was not in my immediate mind.  it���s like the memory had not been erased but somehow it was pushed back into some section in my brain and would not allow me to experience it again. i must have been in shock.\r\n\r\nover the course of the next few days as i processed and integrated the events i have now come to the conclusion as i write of my experience a week later that i was in a state of shock.  i have since told my husband of my ���lit up flying ball over the school bus��� experience.  i know a few things more now of that day, but i am still awaiting the full spectrum of knowledge as to what really happened. after processing this material over the last few days, and still trying to wrap my brain around it, i know now that the lit up ball was really an organic and living and intelligent entity of some kind.  i don���t know where it came from and i don���t know what its purpose was.  i do know that it knows that i saw it.  that is when it dimmed itself so as to camouflage itself.  yet i could still see it.\r\n\r\ni don���t know if i was supposed to see it but i did.  i think that i was somehow pulsed and told to get back in bed to either forget about my experience or either i got more information downloaded by this organic ���ball��� to me and i will unravel it at some later date.  i think the helicopters flying low by my house were indeed either a special kind of military operations getting wind of this ���ball��� or other dimensional beings making themselves appear as military helicopters.  i very much want to figure out what their business was with me. \r\n\r\ni���m pretty sure that neither of my two other neighbors who take their kids to the bus stop would have seen ���the ball��� above the school bus that morning.  since we have big lots between us, they drive in their minivans and wait in their cars for the bus to pull up.  i was the only one standing outside with my kids after they were getting on the bus and the other moms views would have been blocked by their automobiles.\r\n\r\ni���ve noticed that there is reporting today on similar sightings although it is being claimed to be meteors!  no way���that would not explain the military helicopters or the fact that the lit up ball i saw just happened to be smart enough to fly just above the school bus and not hit it, or my neighbors house!  i think this living ball is what witnesses have previously described during crop circles?  \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path

abt. 1 km from the beach.\r\nit was very strange as he describe it.. it was sailing a bit under the sea with only a small part over the waves...What took his attention is that  it was that it was full of lights . the man said at most they were red lights but also withe ones. it just didn't look as a submarine (or something from the navy) as it ha such a different shape and it w too big.\r\nwhile

newfoundland. i would like to know if it was received and if and how i can find out. the event i am reporting this time is a very recent one. i had been walking on the beach at port hardy on northern vancouver island  on a early september evening of 2006. i was taking pictures of cloud formations and had shot the same formation three times within seconds of each other. i am attaching  the middle shot to this report. the first and third shot had only the clouds and the trees in them. the middle or #2 shot had a red object in it. i had no idea that there was anything unusual about the scenery until i had downloaded to my computer. i was photographing the clouds only. this came as a complete surprise. i have taken hundreds of shots of cloud formations and never encountered any thing like this. in the photo the rays from the sun can be seen to the right of the object. the object is not touching the sand and seems to be suspended above it. it certianly is not a ray of sunlight and my beleif is that it has nothing to do with the sun. i have had other photographers look at this photo and everyone is at a loss to explain the object. if you look close you will notice a green haze around the object. i have zoomed it up to over half the size of my monitor and i am still at a loss to explain it. it might be or might not be an alien object however it is unidentified and it is an object, whether it is flying or not is another question. i am calling it a \"uo\" instead of a \"ufo\". i will leave that to you. i would appriciate it if you would not use my name or personal information except for your own use. i repeat, i have no idea of what showed up in my photograph but i expect there would be a lot of\"expert\" skeptics who would have some \"solid\" explanations for it. thanks for reading this, if you need more info concerning the photo you can contact me. c.J.

had a clear unobstructed view of most of the harbour and a completely unobstructed view of the sky from the dartmouth side, facing towards the open atlantic ocean. with a military air base and an international airport nearby, i am used to seeing all kinds of aircraft from there. i was sitting outside at approximately 7:30 in the evening. the dark sky was fall-like and clear other than a couple strata of low lying clouds. i noticed what looked like a star moving over the harbour from inland towards the open atlantic ocean. my curiosity was peaked by the fact that it appeared to be drifting silently. i watched and listened as it moved past the strata of clouds, an estimated one mile away. the object was almost to the open ocean (approx.One and a half miles away), when it stopped on a dime and started comimg back in the exact opposite direction. it then stopped just as suddenly in the cloud strata and lit it an orange color. after about ten seconds the object came out of the cloud and i could clearly see it as it became a large ball of amber light. this light was extremely unusual and hard to describe. even though i could see it clearly it seemed to have a blurry quality to it. then a streak of amber light came out from the side of this ball in a direction that would be roughly 90 degrees from the path it had been travelling. this streak got faster as it extended out until once again the object returned to it's star-like condition and took off like a sling shot. there was no sound associated with any of this whatsoever. i immediately went inside and told my wife. this whole event was awesome to witness and i have spoken about it often since. unfortunately the date is a guess because as i didn't know about mufon at the time and thought others must have witnessed this phenomenon. the account as described is accurate however.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

one object seen this time) seen & reported on 1/15/07 returns for 10 minutes. another photo taken.  4 witnesses.\r\n\r\nvasquez family reported earlier sightings on 01/15/07.  carlos vasquez stepped out at 20:10 hours local standard time to smoke an after dinner cigar in his front yard.  he immediately noticed the a single object (exactly the same as in their earlier reports on cms), and quickly called out his entire family.  wife (anna lisa) & two daughters (elisa - age 16) & (tatiana - age 10).  all saw the object, to their north east, slowly moving to the left (northwest), elevation 40 degrees off horizon.  duration - 10 minutes.  elisa (16) took another photograph of object.  object again was round orange ball - about the size of a city street lamp from directly across a typical suburban street.  no strobes, or flood light, and importantly, no sound.  object departed into overcast high ceiling.  i estimated ceiling 4 to 5 thousand feet.  i based this on two helicopters flying in area after sighting.  one at 1000 feet minimums, and another seen clearly entering ceiling, guestimating the size of the helicopters, one low, the other higher altitude.  \r\n\r\ni told witnesses earlier if the object or objects ever returned, to call me immediately no matter the time.  they did!  i received telephone call from vasquez family at 20:18 hours.  object was still in view.  i ran out side, but did not have a clear view from my home 4.8 miles away with many trees blocking view.  i told them i was going to drive to their location immediately.  i left home at 20:20 hours - arriving at their home at 20:27 hours. object had departed before my arrival.  i could not see anything driving to their location.  they were all standing milling around in from yard excited and amused to be so lucky to see object again.  they immediately showed me on their computer screen the latest digital photo taken ten minutes earlier - time stamped and dated.  object seen in latest photo was the same strange red lights, but a slightly different arrangement of the three lights, and framed in the photo differently.  this indicated the same or exactly similar object, but was a new photo, not confused with the older photo taken on 01/15/07.\r\n\r\ni telephoned my state director ruben uriarte on site.   kept a vigil w/ family in the front yard for one hour.  husband had to turn in for work at that time, and so did i.  also it seemed inappropriate to stand around after husband turned in, even though the wife and daughters chose to stay up longer to catch any chance of object returning.  left scene at 22:00 hours.  no further reappearance of anomalous object.  a modern power plant is 1.58 miles away to the north of family residence.  also high power tension lines, though not in view from home.  sky high overcast.  broken clouds.  full moon.  \r\n\r\nat 20: 35 two police jet ranger helicopters - one a b&w bell 407 jetcopter and the other a b&w bell 206b-3 (seen clearly bvy me in full moon light) appeared flying at approximate. 1000 feet traveling at high speed.  one flew from the west in a direct flight line to the north east horizon.  another flew from the same direction, and flew in a direct line flight pattern directly east at the same altitude.  both helicopters made sound (even heard over telephone by my state director).  both aircraft showed normal strobe light patterns.  why did they appear?  co-incidence?  they flew around the same area as the object for 40 minutes.  next day, i telephoned local police dept's (pittsburg & antioch).  they where very kind, and checked their computers, using various 'search words'.  no reports of strange or unusual airborne activity, or strange lights.   they did confirm the presence of the county sheriffs' helicopters.  indeed there was a shooting reported, and the helicopters were responding to this.  so it was a co-incidence (no 'black' helicopters this time). \r\n\r\nawait witness photo from latest sighting to be attached here.  \r\n\r\ni a few days earlier i closed the 01/15/07 pittsburg sighting reports 'as completed' - the objects classified as 'unknown'.  i am now at this time reopening this case, awaiting possible further sightings.\r\n\r\nwitnesses 'armed' with digital camera and binoculars.  they are now keeping their video camcorder charged and on the ready.\r\n\r\nsubmitted

at a red light waiting to turn left, when i commented on a very bright light in the sky ahead of us.  my husband (a non believer at the time) said it was only a light on a tower in a neighbouring town straight ahead (west) of us.  the traffic light turned green, and only for me did he go straight towards the light in the sky.  we no sooner crossed the intersection and this now huge thing was directly above our car in plain view. i rolled my window down and stuck my head out to look at it. it just sat there above us not moving and not making a sound.  we then got frightened, rolled up the window and locked the doors. it was amazing as we were now watching it through the front windshield of the car.  it was like looking at a factory in the sky with jut outs and i think i could see inside it. it was not that far above us. i can't remember exactly how to describe it as it was so bizarre for the human mind to accept what it was looking at. a couple of minutes later it started to move slowly (east) in the direction we just came from.  we turned the car around and started to follow it. this only lasted for a few seconds because like a rocket it sped away at an unbelievable speed and was out of sight.  i have always been a believer in ufos and this sighting confirmed my beliefs.  i have seen other sightings but not like this one.  there is no denying that this was not man made and from that morning on, my husband is now a true believer .  our eyes now are always in the skys hoping to experience such an exciting event again.  i'm now sorry that we didn't report it

again���. we notices 2 objects moving west, south west over the track. i slowed down, rolled the window down and turn off the radio and watch them move more to the west so i took a right on martin luther king blvd. there was a car in front of use going about 25 to 30 mph. the objects were on my side of the truck, i was looking towards the south west. we could see the front object underside. it had 4 or 5 blue lights under it, a yellow light above it and a red blinking light in front of it. we could not see the blue lights if any under the second object, but we could see the yellow light on top and a blinking red light in front but it did have 3 white lights on what could be the side. we have seen these white lights on the front object just before we could see the blue lights. we could not tell the shape of the object.\r\n\r\nmartin luther king blvd. curves north and stop at jackson landing rd. i turn off the engine. there was no sound at all coming from the objects. the objects were now in front of use, about a quarter mile away. we made a right turn east on jackson landing rd.  which turns into bruce st.. we took a left on main st. heading north. the objects were to the left of my windshield and moving away. the only thing we could see is there white light and a blinking red light. they were about 2 miles away. we caught the traffic light at hwy.11 n. and forth st. the hwy. runs north, north east. by the time we arrived at the intersection of hwy. 11 and hwy 43 the objects had went over hwy 11 and now moving east. we turned right on hwy 43 and finally lost sight of them over the horizon north east from us. the objects had appeared to circle the city. we took i-59 south to nicholson about 4 miles and then north on hwy 11 for a mile to our house. it was now 8:20 pm.\r\n\r\n??? are we seeing military aircrafts? \r\n\r\ni know there is navigation beacon north of us that the military aircraft use in training and there is stennis space center, south from us. \r\n\r\ndo these lights fit any types of aircrafts???\r\n\r\nthis is our second sighting, dec. 5, 2005, tuesday 7:25 pm was our first sighting. is there any other people in our area see these things??? names & numbers would be nice so maybe we could form a watch group.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

loaf of bread speeding across sky on a very straight trajectory.  thought it was a hawk at first, but object was brownish cylinder shaped, no bird features, moving way too fast, no wing flap, no variation in altitude or deviation from flight path.  appeared to be fairly low, but perhaps that was an illusion, but no more than 1000 to 1500 ft. up.  jumped up on a bench to watch as it went behind fence line and saw object a mile or more away taking a downward turn towards the treetops/rooflines.  too small to be manned craft, some kind of monitoring device perhaps.  possibly could have come out of pine woods across the street from my building....I can't say.  there was something distinctively odd about it all and the smooth way it flew, like something from another dimension.   it was very, very fast.  i was excited to see such a thing and i've been out everyday since looking at the same spot in case i see it or something like it again.  i've been going over and over it in my mind, telling myself it was only a bird, but then i think, \"nope, that wasn't any bird.\"  immediately after this, the sun started reflecting on some high cirrus type clouds to the south and prismed into a rainbow patch appearing on the clouds and looked like a portal into another world.  this was just a natural phenomenon i'm sure, but the timing was most coincidental.  i felt that i had attracted it, brought it out of wherever it was or that perhaps i was being shown something.  i had been contemplating an orb i saw suspended in the sky two years back and wondering if our govt. could possibly have some anti-gravity, gyroscopic device which could hover stationary in a high wind...And that's when this cylinder appeared zooming by.  pretty strange, but i am not one for making things up or hallucinating.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

of town.  when i got to his house i noticed 4 odd contrails (i think they were) in front and around the moon.  i thought it would be a cool picture to try and get with my cell phone camera.  just to see if it would take it.  as i started to snap the shot, a bright white light just apppeared above the western horizon. just as if someone turned on a switch.   i thought it was odd so i took the picture.  as i went to save it on my phone the light shot directly in front of me to the right side of the moon. it didn't slowly go there it just went from point a to point b in a flash.  i then snapped another picture just as a pale red ball appeared along the left side of the moon and started bouncing and  going back and forth and up and down seeming to vibrate.   the odd thing is that when the red one first appeared, the white light on the right developed a white circle around it  with a hazy center as to protect it.  i was able to get out of my car by then and snap another picture just before they both completely vanished.   this took place in a very secluded rural area. there are no street lights nor was there any sound at all, nothing, and the night was so still and quiet at 4 am. \r\n\r\nim sending 3 pictures.   the first picture i took was with the gazeebo in the foreground.  you can see the first light just above the horizon. the bright light is the moon.   the other 2 pics are after the red ball showed up and the white light got a ball of light around it.   the third picture is when i zoomed in on it and you can see a shadow of some kind blocking out the moons light over the plane contrails.    i now am wondering if the clouds were plane contrails after all.","distance":"Over One
