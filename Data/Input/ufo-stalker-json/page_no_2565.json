stars. i was just about to walk inside my home when i looked up. what i saw through the breaks in the clouds was the most spectacular thing i have ever seen. i t was like a large globe, like you would see on top of a large light pole, round, large, clear with kind of a black lines jumping airound inside, like one of those static balls that when you touch the sides of them the electricity jumps to where you move your finger. this thing was huge. it passed through the break in the clouds and disappeared for a couple of seconds. ididn't see any stars when it went back under the clouds, just black. then another globe of the same size , shape and color passed through the same break in the clouds. the two globes wern't moving very fast which gave me the chance to view the detail. there was no sound, no vibrations, nothing but a very beautiful light comming from what ever it was passing over my house. i wasn't scared as i watched it pass over head. i was just in awe. i stood there for a minute just looking up wandering what it was that i had just seen. i then went inside and told my wife what i just seen. i can still see this thing in my minds eye even today. i watch the sky alot even before this and have seen things that you normally wouldnt see but i usually put them off as high tech aircraft or metiors etc. just a few month before this sighting i was looking up on a beautiful star lit night sky. there were more stars in the sky that night than you would normally see, i was just amazed at the number of stars when i noticed a triangular patch of 5 stars moving across the sky fron north to southeast. i followed them across the sky for about a half minute untill they were out of my line of sight. they traveled across a good amount of sky in a short time till i lost sight. no sound just 5 stars in a triangle moving across the sky. my wife and kids think i'm nuts. i dont believe in ghoasts because i've never seen one. but as for machines from other worlds or wherever i know they are here.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

code.\r\n\r\nthis sighting occured in the united states, california, ventura county.\r\n\r\nthis sighting happend over aproxmately 30 years ago. it was either in 1978 or 1979--i belive it may have been 78. not important, but what i witnessed was important. i am reporting it now because of the internet and my access to high-speed downloads.\r\n\r\nmore importantly i also heard a ufo researcher on the art bell show several years ago talking about the same case--like it was very important. from his witnesse/s point/s of view they were obvserving it facing east--i realized that i was on the opposite side facing west with object fliying between us. have not been able to locate this researcher, but i'm sure someone affiliated with this site will be able to do so.\r\n\r\nsighting...\r\n\r\nwas a resident of ventura county, ca. at the time. living in port hueneme. was driving home, west bound on the santa paula (126 freeway) when i noticed a orange/red glowing cigar-shaped object flying slowly from the north heading south.  i pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car and watched as the object flew over a freeway overpass in the distance. object appeared about the lenght of the bridge from my vantage point.\r\n\r\nobject slowly pulsed red to a brighter shade of orange. observed flame dripping from the tail of the object. i reached inside the car and flashed my high-beams several times hoping to elicit a response from the object. there was none.\r\n\r\ni thought at first the object was a naval jet in trouble--with the dripping flame. but i heard no jet noise. i then realize that the object was flying below the stall speed of a jet aircraft. \r\n\r\nthe cigar shapped object continued to fly in a southerly direction towards the point mugu naval air station in the distance. remember seeing the warning lights above mugu rock (leading to the tracking station) in the distance very clearly that night. watched until the light could no-longer could be seen. \r\n\r\nobject did not vary speed or flight path. it made a straight line out to the ocean. \r\n\r\nmade this observation perhaps a mile or so from the highway 118 overpass. in between me and the city of ventura were west saticoy, county center (not there at the time) and the 118 los angeles avenue. i believe the object passed over the 126 freeway somewhere between the 118 bridge and west saticoy.\r\n\r\ni only caught the tail end of the art bell interview segment--but heard the mention of ventura/saticoy and \"cigar shapped\" object. and that this occured in the late seventies.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

not from memory, it's taken from the day it happened after i wrote it down in my book.\r\n my brother and i were playing basketball late one summer night but while it was still quite bright out, when we noticed a small opaque(seeming) circle in the sky, perhaps the size of a dime if you held it up and squinted your eyes.  this was in the northern sky. it had a bright silvery kind of ring around it, and a really bright spot off one part of the ring.We sat down to watch it because it looked like nothing \"normal\" to be in the sky.After about 10 minutes , the circle broke up into 5 white glowing , smaller circles. then a yellow triangle shaped object moved down from the center of the 5 circles( kind of like all these shapes had just 'appeared' from the opaque circle) and stopped in the middle of the sky.Then a smaller yellowish-orange cicular object \"came down out of \" the yellow triangle shaped ufo, and the two objects moved slowly sideways together in the sky.Meanwhile 4 of the 5 glowing objects in the sky shrank to pin points and started moving all around and then disappeared.The last white circle moved slowly west in the sky and disappeared.The small yellow-orange object that appeared lastly, moved west and towards the horizon and then out of sight. lastly the yellow triangle shaped object moved straight west and stopped, moved straight down, and then disappeared. all this, and no sound at all. judging only by sight, i'd say this all happened at the most a few miles north from where we were, in the middle of the town.\r\n i was 17 at the time, and my brother was 16. we were both pretty excited and ran home and told our parents. they believed us right away, and said they'd wished that we'd called them from a pay phone so they could have seen it too. i have heard a lot of stories of people seeing ufos in the sky by this small northern town. myself and a friend also had another ufo sighting in the town about a year a half later.

the right of the antenna. i observed it for about 20-25 seconds through the front windshield. if you were looking forward you couldn't miss it. as i drove down from the bridge i entered the bottoms, a large wooded area and lost sight. the object appeared to be somewhat high in the sky, but with the trees so close and all around i couldn't see it. i said to myself, was that the moon? what is it, a cloud? it was very strange, especially since i have driven over the bridge at all hours and all seasons, and never have i seen anything like it. so i stepped on the throttle to get up to the highlands to get another look. as i climbed a big hill, when i leveled out, i saw it again out of my drivers side window, this time i only saw the top of the circle with the missing upper left part. the rest of the circle, i presume was obscured by trees. i was headed north at the time. i observed it for about 5 seconds this time, before i was back in the trees. i was driving to the quad-cities, so i stepped

very familar to a jet airplane engine winding down caught my attention. it was dark out and i looked up and immediately saw the object above me moving to the south. my best recollection of its appearance after all these years, and points that i am very positive about, is that i saw four small points of light at the four corners of the rectangle shape (all four lights had the same color) and a fifth point of light \"detached\" from the four rectangle corner-points but in the \"front\" of the object as it moved in a southerly direction. that fifth light was of a different color than the other four lights behind it. at the time i was aware of what the two colors were, but i have since forgotten those two specific details. the object appeared to be approximately as wide as about 50 to 100 feet and maybe 75 to 125 feet in length (these measurements apply specifically to the rectangle portion of the object) and the fifth \"leading\" light point was a distance from the other four that i just don't really recall now. my estimation on the measurements may be highly incorrect, but two points that i'm absolutely positive about is that the object was very, very large (in the size range of a very large house or two)and that the object was moving through the sky at a very, very, very slow speed - not a whole lot faster than that of a person walking at a fast pace. i personally am not aware of any manmade object that large and capable of flight but able to move that slowly. i really have no exact idea how far up it was but would estimate 2-300 feet, but that is only a guess, especially after all these years. i initially saw the object and was absolutely stunned by it. i could see no actual object or superstructure, just the five lights. it moves, from its initial location where i first laid eyes on it, about 100 feet and then, while directly over my home, rotates to the right from its initial due-south direction and continues in the same fashion westbound. ironically, at the time this occured i was a press photographer and had my bagged equipment in the car. i did not make an attempt to photograph it because that would have required the time necessary to retrieve the camera and a flash, put the flash on the camera, make necessary adjustments to the camera and flash for a properly exposed picture, etc. even though the object was moving extremely slowly for a manmade object, i knew that its slow speed was going to be quick enough for it to move out of sight before i could get the camera equipment ready for a hand-held flash exposure. i was so completely fascinated by what i was seeing (instinctively i knew i was seeing something extremely strange) that i did not want to take the time to avert my eyes to get the photo equipment out of the car. i then ran to the house and pounded on the front door to attract my wife's attention, all the while not taking my eyes off of the object. she came to the door in bewilderment and i pointed upward and told her to look, taking my eyes of the object just long enough to glance at her to make sure she was seeing the same object. she was seeing the same thing, with her mouth dropped in amazement, and i immediately returned my gaze to the object and we both watched it continue westbound until it flew over a tree line and out of sight. the entire episode lasted no more than about three to four minutes. at this point, i do not recall if the loud jet engine-like noise continued throughout the entire episode or if at some point it died out or just what was occurring audibally. i truly have no idea what the object was, but based on the facts presented above, and just a deeply instinctive feeling that it was not a \"normal\" machine, i have elected to provide this report to mufon.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

moved in from texas and i became friend with a girl my age i slept over that night, about sometime in the early a.M. i awakend to use the rest room and got out of bed the rest room was located on the right side of the room i was sleeping in at the end of the hall and the hall was shaped like in l. i heard a noise a door moving i walked to the long side of the hall to see who was awake with me the light shinning from the bathroom located on my right side allowed me to see what i thought was a small child holding onto a door knob peering out from behind the door i could see his sillouhette and i thought wow! he must be hungry he looked skinny so i took a step closer blinking my eyes as to clear up my sleepy vision and as my vision became more clear i turned my head to the left and it mimicked me and that's when i saw the eye it was large and black so i turned my head to the right and it mimmicked me again and the mouth and nose tiny slits for a nose and a dimple for a mouth appeared from behind the door and then i noticed the 3long fingers holding the door knob and it had no clothes on i could only see its one shoulder and its skin although dark in hall with only the light from the rest room appeared to be grey a dark grey ----i took a deep breath and urinated on a oldfshioned wax floor the kind that leave water spots the urine ran down my left leg and i fainted i woke the next morning and remember i urinated on the floor but there was no evidence and i didn't know why i would do that my underware were bright white almost glowing and i was back in the bed, no urine in the bed -- i felt no need to tell my mom or my friend that i urinated in the hall there was no proof the wax floor was not dammaged and my undies were better than new and so smell i did not know why i did it, it was like a dream-- well fast forward to 1986 14 years later--time life  magazine advertised a give-a-way book aliens are they really out there and flashed a picture of the alien and i was 8years old again stading in the hall re-living eveything over again like a time warp - they are here they have been here for years they could restore the floor because there was an example to go by but they could not restore by undies because they did not know what they looked like before i soiled them they were glowing white that next morning- for two weeks i could not walk that year i forgot about that a relative told me i believe there is a chip in my leg may they hit an important nerve inserting it and there was deep inditation there for some time i gained so much weight its hard to see now - i'm not crazy.- this happened to me and i will not go on acting as if it did not - there is more to the story the family i was visiting came from texas from a farm and after many years i saw them again and told them my story and they confirmed it to be true a family member commited suicide as a result of watching the alien move about the residence quite fequently in the evenings he was born after i lost touch with my friend it was a younger brother to her he was dead before i saw her again - they did not beleive him so he killed himself i wish i could have been there because i saw

him.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6272,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.4055925,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01302007-0007","longitude":-83.096868,"occurred":176022000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":176022000000,"summary":"It

sometime after 1:30pm, nice sunny day, blue skies, not a cloud in site but the temp somewhat cool. looking around as usual i noticed this white object moving in the distance from the nw, which at first i thought it was merely a plane (it was still quite aways off) and i really didn't think much of it at first. but as it drew closer overhead i could tell it wasn't a plane, it appeared to be round and very, very bright and high up.  the speed in which it were traveling was about the pace of a passenger aircraft at that altitude.  i ran in grabbed my camera off the dining room table where i normally kept it when i'm at home.  replaced the 38mm lens with the 300mm lens and start snapping shot after shots.  i called for connie,(my wife who was indoors and a neighbor who were doing some work next door). my wife was the only one who was able to witness this object, the neighbors view was obstructed by trees on both our property. at first i didn't know if i wanted still shot or video footage, my video equipment was in my truck at the time so i didn't want to waste any time messing around.  i started out taking pictures holding the camera in hand but because i was shaking somwhat i ran in and grabbed the camera/video tripod which took only seconds to setup.  i was then able to take these amazing and remarkable shots before i lost site of it in the ssw (sun light). not until after i was able to download these imagines of this object that the true shape was revealed. \r\n   see my website at: www.Howconcreation1.Photosite.Com for more photos. in fact another incident

dec.31, 2006. i was leaving a friends house, which is in the middle of town, around 6:20 pm. i was headed west towards my home when i looked up in the sky and saw a very large object that appeared to be hovering over neighborhood which was about 30 street blocks from where i was. it was still daylight, i was on the phone with a friend who could also see the object. i was very interested in trying to see exactly what it was so i continued west about 60 blocks from where i first saw the object. that was when i realized that the object was not hovering over a neighborhood. the town i stay in isnt very big, everything is pretty close together, so once you past all the houses and stores, you are pretty much in the country(open fields, trees,etc). i drove south until i was at the very edge of the town. i could see the object very clearly hovering over a field where i believe there may be cows. i could have easily gotten a much closer look if i would have gone down this country road, but it was dark by then and for some reason i was getting the feeling that what ever was in this craft was watching me. so i pulled over at this retirement home and begin recording it with my cell phone. i would have to say just guessing, that the size of the object was about 2-3 times larger than a commercial airliner. it was saucer shaped with very bright blue and white lights around it, spinning. the object appeared to change shapes a couple of times, and a very bright white light, which was on the bottom of it, was circling around it kindof lke some type of search light or something. the object simply faded out and reappeared like miles away, and then disappeared. since then i've seen the same object about 4 more times, and all around the same time in the day, around 6:30 pm. and it always seems to be visible for about 30-40 minutes. i have video from three of those sightings. thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my story.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

about 1500 to 2000 feet high. as it moved northward it steadily gained altitude until it passed through the clouds which were very high.  at first i thought it was a hang glider or a large kite but

passing time by the river when i saw a object come out from way up in the sky. it came down the side of this hill down to the river just maybe 2 feet off the water and was moving around in short little jumps inside a confind area. fast movements and would stay still also for 2 to 5,6, seconds then move again. it moved back up the hill like it was back tracking a bit then shot back up in the sky in way less than a second and was as small as the stars. my friend an i kept our eyes on it and watched it moving around up there. when it stood still it was so small it looked like any other star. after a about 20 seconds it came back down just as fast, and stopped above the water again. it was moving around like before and came moving up towards where we were at. my friend an i got out of the car an began walking towards it. it was no farther away than 200 feet. at this time at eye level.I was hanging on to him and him me we were telling each other to go get your parents but neither of us would go. we walked closer to it as it hovered and was moving around. this time when we moved toward it, it started to come at us so we both stopped. we must have been 150 feet away from it. there were lights going around in a circle on the outside of it like a billboard sign. it was disc shaped an about thirty feet in dia. it did not make any sound at all. it then started to go back up the hill somewhat, then shot up and out like a 45 degree angle way out in the sky , stopped for a sec then shot straight up from there. it was very far up this time an looked like a very small star but you could still see it very easy. it started moving south, southeast, slowly then picked up quickly then plink it was gone. it moved so fast it just left a streak. i could see it for 25 to 30 miles cause it was so far up, maybe futher.It ate up that distance in maybe 1 tenth of a second if it took it that long. my friend and i just looked at each other an couldn't believe it.  it was clear that night no moon no wind no clouds. there was a small airport nearby and during the day i would always see small airplanes making their final approach to go and land. rarley would you see airplanes

neighborhood(will not put exact adress because for our own safety) at exactly 2:45pm. we noticed mannys neighbors were pointing at the sky above. we both looked towards the area they were pointing at,we were astonished by a silver unidentified flying object. paulo and i rushed to mannys house. as we rushed in screaming \"manny look a ufo!! a ufo outside in the sky!!\" his family ran to the door looked outside and just stayed looking at the ufo as it moved with so much intelligence from one spot to another then back where it was at first. \r\n\tthen we notice that this ufo had two small sphere rotating around it. then mannys neighbors yelled \"look over there!! over there!! there is a giant black one over there!!!!\" just across the silver ufo. as we all looked at the black ufo it started to leave west towards del rio, then vanished. the silver ufo remained at the same spot. as manny tryed to take a picture of this ufo. \r\n\tsuddenly, the ufo began to move slowly and just a little closer to land. then moved back higher into the sky. all of a sudden the silver flying object left the area going north with incredible high speed(this defenetly wasnt no weather balloon). this scenario lasted 15 or 20 minutes. manny, mannys brother ray, paulo and i got in mannys truck and tryed following the ufo going toward rocksprings. but, the ufo was not seen again. myself being a longtime ufo & extraterrestrial life believer couldn't feel any happier then ever. my most desired perseverance came true.","distance":"21-100

both stop running when the object started flying towards us.  the object two sphere's glowed at approx 60 watt blub.  as we continued watching the object it came to hover over a pine tree about 20 yds away.  it hovered level to the ground above the pine tree making no sound.  i looked at my freind and said \"do you see what i see\".  we both were fixed as if a statue. as we watched the object it tilted down towards us like pointing a light on us.  then the front sphere incresed in brightness to about 125 watts of light.  the rear sphere remained at about 60watts.  for about 3-5 sec the brighter light remained pointed at us.  then the front sphere decresed back to about 60 watt light intensity. then the object rotated 180 degrees pointing toward the sky and in a split second was gone out of sight. again no sound was made by the object.
