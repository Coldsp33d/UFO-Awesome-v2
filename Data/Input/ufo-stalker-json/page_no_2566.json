will submit this report followed by another which occured on a more recent date.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am a licenced private pilot. \r\ni was arriving at our clubhouse at cnl3 to attend a club meeting one night in february of  1999 at about 20:00 hours. bright clear night. rural area with very little light pollution. i don't recall seeing a moon that night. as i exited my van parked in front of the clubhouse and parked facing about 040 degrees ( runway alignment) i happened to look up and see a bright object ( about venus intensity) directly above my head at an undetermined distance. my immediate thought is \" no star there! what is that?\" i began walking forward towards the clubhouse almost tripping on a small six inch snow bank and looking down to avoid falling. quickly looking up again to the object noticing then that it was visibly  increasing in size as i watched. it increased in intensity proporionate to its' size. to this point maybe 10 seconds had elapsed. i was standing still looking straight up as it increased in size for a few more seconds to maybe double venus intensity. it then began to slowly shrink in size although still same brightness in relation to size. at one point it began veering to the nw maybe 300 degrees in direction. at that point i realized that the object was moving away because it was no longer moving in a vertical line directly above me but moving in an arc . the speed increased as it began to dim and arc to the nw at increasing speed ( many times faster than a satillite) and within a few seconds tremendous speed. as it increased in speed it appeared to be in an arcing trajectory. at the same time it gradually dimmed from bright white star like to a dull orangy colour which i could follow for several more seconds as it speeded, arced, turned orangy and disappeared as a dull speck in about 10  seconds or less. it looked like it was going into orbit. i could make out a barely visible vapour trail which lasted about a few seconds. total elapes time was less than a minute but somewhat more than 30 seconds. that is my impression of the time lapse. i could not determine how close it was and there was no sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nfeelings: at first i found it odd to see a bright object in that location of the sky. once i noticed it was getting brighter i was really curious.\r\nonce i determined that it was moving in an arc at increasing high speed i knew it was something i could not explain. although i was calm, i was very exited inside. i remember saying out loud wow!........Wow!................Wow!!!!! i interpreted it as very personnal because i realized that the object had been moving directly towards me and away soon after the lateral movement started.  with the beginning of the lateral movement it was obvious that the object was moving rather than getting larger or smaller. \r\n\r\ntelling the pilots inside the building was a let down......... typical old flying farts more interested in reliving memories of the glory days than a truly current and unique event. \r\n\r\n\r\nsecond sighting\r\n\r\nclear summer night perhaps 22:00 hours  later that year and possibly a year later. i am not sure of the year as i did not write a diary. it was about 5 to 6 years ago and since the sighting above.\r\n\r\ni was parked at the waterfront in brockville ontario canada. brockville is on the north shore of the saint lawrence river opposite and slightly west of morristown new york. note that brockville is almost exactly due north of fort drum new york, about 50 kilometers or more. fort drum is a very large us army base.\r\n\r\ni had rented one of my residential apartments to a young man who was struggling to pay the rent and follow the rules set out in the lease. we went to a public waterfront park to have a coffee and try to work out the problem.\r\n\r\nfacing the river and  parked in my van facing about 150 degrees. i noticed a bright light at about 180 degrees about 5 to 10 degrees high. i thought to myself.... an aircraft landing light perhaps a helicopter maybe from fort drum. within seconds a light appeared of same intensity and close enough to the other to appear in formation slightly to the right. i pointed this out to peter and said they are likely helicopters rather than fixed wing because they are not moving. suddenly two more identical lights appeared slightly east and slightly higher in the sky. \r\nthe group of two and two were close enough to be in formation. i was watching earnestly now because this was unusual as none of the the lights were moving in relation to each other or the ground. very unusual for even helicopters to be frozen in one spot this way. the four lights were the same intensity and size and appeared to be the same distance away. all four lights reflected in the river leading me to believe they were either above the american shore or somewhat back from the shore but not to far. note the river is  more than a kilometer wide and perhaps a little more than a mile. i judged range to be less than two miles due to the 5 to 10 degree angle and the lights reflection almost all the way across the surface of the water. the altitude based on a very rough triangulation in my head would be somewhat above 500 ft agl.\r\n\r\nwe watched them for about five minutes or more when the one furthest to the right appeared to dim slowly and go out over about 10 or more seconds.\r\nabout 30 seconds to a minute later the second of the pair dimmed and went out the same way. after about two or three minutes more the remaining pair dimmed and went out at more or less the same rate at the same time with one slightly ahead of the other.\r\n\r\ni should say that they didn't really dim. my impression is of a light where the size and intensity decrease proportionally. such that while getting smaller the light was of the same relative brightness until disappearing. as if a manual shutter effect was in play to diminish the amount of bright light getting through. the objects appeard stationary even while \"dimming\" because the reflection off the water did not move but \"dimmed\" at the same rate.\r\n\r\nno sound only bright white light. like a larger landing light or helicopter spot light about a mile or so away\r\n\r\n\r\ni remember that the fellow i was with acknowledged seeing what i saw and hearing my commentary with little reaction even to my suggesting ufo's\r\ni looked around at a waterfrot park with perhaps a 100 people enjoying a warm evening on the riverfront and appearing not to notice the sight. i should note that i have always been a sky watcher and take a keen interest in anything in the sky from birds to aircraft to moon and stars.\r\n\r\nas a pilot i think a am a reasonable judge of something which is out of place in the sky. i've watched stars and planetary bodys. i've been picking out satilites since sputnik and up to the space station. i have seen comets and also meteors bright enough to turn night into day. these i would consider normal. my two experiences noted above although not dramatic like some reports are honest and accurate accounts of the only two times in my 55 years that i saw things i couldn't explain.

friend chris and i were just finished swimming and we got out to sit in the sun, when i looked up and thought i saw what seemed to be a star in the middle of the day, as i tuned to chris and went to show him, it was a sif it disappeared from the sky. not thinking anything unusaul of it, i laid back again only to find the same star on the opposite side of the sky i had just seen it in, just seconds before....I then just stared at it, watching to see what it would do and i as i watched it it slowly seemed to evaporate or something, i mean it slowly disappeared.  ithen told chris what i saw, and was extremely amzed myself to what i had just witnessed. i then searched across the sky to see if it would randomly show up somewhere else in the sky, and chris was there searching with me. in about 6 min after watching this star disappear infront of my eyes, we found it. again in a far distance from where it was the last time we saw the \"star\". i told chris then to watch it with me to see if i could show him what i had just seen. and within a few seconds it started to disappear. we then out of instinct both looked ahead, where we were facing an empty space in a clutter of trees in the country side, and the star and that we had been watching was what seemed to be falling from te sky. at first we thought it was shot down or something weird like that, but then coming from below, on earth, were two missle like objects, both at the same speed and distance from the falling star, i have to admit it was pretty weird. but then as the missles got closer the star seemed to grow larger and as they were to have hit, everything vanished, not a sound, not an explotion, nothing.?.?....I think its strange what i saw that day and although i remember everything about the incedent, i cant quite seem to remeber exactly what happened when it colided. i mean, i remebered it was as if they just disappeared but, i cant really remember it. i cant quite eplain it as weird as it sounds.....But i never spaek of what i saw not even with chris, i seemed to always forget to bring it up when im with him. i have no pictures, and i dont have the time to sketch it out but, if anyones interested let me know and ill draw every detail......But this was all just a silly day dream or something, i just thought that maybe if i posted this, maybe someone else has seen something like

cloud formations that had been massing that afternoon. a massive black cloud had been building for hours, and i was monitoring it to see what kind of storm it would produce. in the foreground was a large, white cloud bank, low enough to give me an unobstructed view of the black cloud bank. oddly enough, it was intensely sunny, despite the clouds. our office was on highway 43, in west linn, or., which looks out in a north easterly direction (mt. hood is east of where we are). as i looked at the huge, very dark cloud behind the shopping center across the street, i noticed a large number of objects hovering around in a kind of slow, corkscrew pattern. at first i thought it might be a huge flock of birds, but then realized they weren't moving like birds, and everything was at half-speed. the objects appeared to be gold, metal balls, moving in slow motion, carefully avoiding each other as they hovered up and down. i estimated there to be about 100 of them, but i can't give a exact number. the orbs, or balls, were gathered in groups, moving along 3 motion paths. a column of orbs in the center moved up and down, (like an elevator), while other orbs travelled around the column, corkscrewing their way up; a second group corkscrewed their way down, giving the appearance of an animated double-helix moving around the column of orbs. they appeared between the two cloud banks, and they must have been sizable for me to be able to discern them as balls and not birds or something else. they may have been over the willamette river, a short distance away. it was an amazing display, but i can't imagine the purpose of the strange formation.I was awe-struck; i watched for 30 seconds or so, and then called for my office mates to come see the swarm. two co-workers came out, (everyone else was gone) and i asked them what they thought we were looking at. at first they seemed astonished, but then frightened, and couldn't really articulate what we were seeing. one went back inside, deciding he couldn't explain the sighting. the other person sort of shrugged and followed him into the building. later, they both seemed unnerved and didn't want to discuss the event, even though i was overly excited and curious. i also had my two small dogs with me (they were allowed at work). they came out with me when i first noticed the orbs, but they seemed unconcerned. they are pomeranians (one is particularly excitable), but they acted completely normal through the whole event. it was as though nothing was in the sky at all. the balls appeared solid and opaque, with no wings or exhaust decernable. the only sound was of the traffic passing by, and i wasn't able to detect any sound from the orbs. (no one else seemed to notice! i figured someone would see the orbs and stop, but no one did.) the sun was very bright, not at all blocked, and the rays fully hit the spheres, making the sun reflect off of them as if they were metal. the sun made the cloud behind the orbs particularly dark, and one could not see through it. this event lasted about 10 minutes, until all the orbs had drifted into cloud cover, and as cloud cover moved over them.

date but i can find out from my auto repair man. i was coming home from the auto repair shop when i turned down the road i live on something caught my attention a bright light. when i turned and looked to the left there was a very bright orange light in the sky. in the sky west south west it was setting still not moving it was low in the sky. it glowed real bright then slowly dimmed till it went out then it moved because it came on in a different place.If you held a wooden ruler at arms length against the sky it moved that far to the right or west. i didn't see any object during the movement the only way i know it moved was because it glowed in a different place. after it moved it glowed again very brightly then it dimmed and went out. then it moved back to the original place, and glowed again then it went out .Then i saw a jet fighter coming from the west south west from the other side of the ufo object from where i was. it came almost to the place i last seen the glowing object then the jet turned south. then it looked as if a silver disk flew up and down the side of the jet. i saw what looked like a small silver disk fly up the left side of the jet to the front tip then back down to the end of the jet or rear of the jet. then it flew up to the front once more then flew away to the north. then the jet appeared to try to follow but could not turn fast enough  and looked as if it began to slow down. i am sending this because i feel it is important to make a record of all sightings. for all of our safety.And i would also like to say where i live piedmont missouri is having a lot of these types of sightings just the other night my friend called to ask if  there was a fire over this way, said she was listening to the scanner when a report was made of a

brazil,russia,and australia on sts-69 through a real time video feed at 1:30 am on day 2 of the hubble repair mission.It was around 1994-1995.I was working second shift in satellite beach,florida. nasa select was our local cable channel,and broadcast live video when the shuttle was in orbit.The video is now delayed 15 minutes for editing.I saw this giant bicycle tire slowly spin into view,and said \"what the hell is that\".Then the astronauts said \"what the hell is that\",then three flying saucers came up from earth and got in line and got in this thing.One astronaut said \"houston you copy,and then silence for 45 seconds,then came back \"copy\".This mother ship is the size of an nfl stadium, with lots of windows and about 300 antennas pointed at the earth.It had 5 spokes that went into the center like walkways and support cables in a cross section configuration.In the center top and bottom there was like a ground control tower similar to an airport tower on top and bottom.The craft was perfectly symmetrical top to bottom,just like the flying saucers and flying triangles.The saucers are grey in color,no windows or doors.They are 25 yards in diameter. the triangles are black in color and 100 yards wingtip to wingtip, and 10 yards high top to bottom. again,no windows or doors.The triangles have red and green wingtip lights. they seem to circle the planet and only come down on the dark side,so the best time to see one would be 10pm to 2am.I am tired of seeing phony ufo's on television and hearing someone with a phd try to explain what a solar flare is.I am an avionics technician with 30 years experience,that has worked on everything that flies,but i also am a model maker,so i decided to make some fiberglass models of the saucer and triangle this summer when the

star like light to the west, around 200 feet in the air and around 2 to three miles off. we were headed to quanah on  north 287 and once we were on the highway, i aquired the object again and watched it as we left town. i watched as much as possible and after a few miles, i concluded it was moving parallel to the highway had moved to about five miles off the highway. i had to go through chilicothe, tx about 15 miles from vernon and reaquired the object on the other side of town and now it seemed only about 1 1/2 miles off the road. as we were aproaching medicine mounds outside of quanah, i pulled over and filmed the object for a few minutes, trying to get a close up but could not hold the camera still but managed some footage. i noticed it slowly moving off and we got back on 287 and headed for quanah. as we neared quanah it's attitude lowered to the point of only being around 100 feet, still heading west, but was changing hues still having a constant light with never a flicker such as aircraft do. we took a side road and went around the south edge of quanah as fast as i dared with my dad in the car, but when we cleared the town lights we could never reaquire the object even though the land dropped off giving a clear veiw of the horizion. the one thing i concluded was it travelling around the same speed as we were aproximately 68 to 70 miles an hour cause it never gained on us till we stopped. i only once before had seen a similar object, but was to far off to intercept and at lease wanted to get a few frames of this one, sorry but i don't have a tv card to down load them to my computer maybe later. but this is the first time i've taken the time to tell anybody of my sightings, yes i have some more and one day i'll tell y'all but not tonight. seeing this one really stired some feeling and if my dad had not been with me i think i could of intercepted it and got a good picture but i have got to start somewhere. i hope someone else confirmed this

she went to the front door to see if it was raining or windy and saw a very large object hovering over a nearby house about an 1/8 of a mile from our house. it was larger than the house, seemed to be at an angle to her view with the bottom exposed and had lights all around it evenly spaced. when it began to move away, several lightning flashes were seen and then it was gone. the power returned two hours later\".\r\n\r\na second email was received the next day stating that he had a chance to talk to his wife about this sighting and he added that it would seem that his wife might have actually observed \"balls of lightning\". he also wrote: \"what she describes sounds just like a multiple ball lightning display which she says disappeared as she watched it, and then a bolt of lightning went up into the space above the house from the ground to where the lights had appeared to be\".\r\n\r\na little more details were obtained during a telephone interview that was conducted  march 31st: sighting took place around 12:30 am, march 23, during a thunderstorm, as she was facing south, towards manassas. the length of the appearance lasted just a few seconds, from the \"balls of light\"

thought was an aeroplane,except i couldn't see any wings, traveling in a northeast to southwest direction at approximately 15,000 feet.The weather was very clear with no clouds in sight.As i watched to see if i could see the wings,the object disappeared.Once again,no clouds or anything else to obstruct my view.There was no discernable sound coming from the object,but i can't swear to that because a southwest airlines jet was taking off from albq. int. airport and was swinging around to head on a northwest heading taking it pretty much right over my head.I did not see any lights associated with the object and it looked like a fuselage of dull grey with no wings.It did not reflect the sunlight,which was very bright at the time.The other thing i remember was that it appeared to be starting to bank to the south and that is why i was looking for shadows of wings or a tail when it \"disappeared\" from full view,still at the approximately 11:00 position.","distance":"Over One

was apx 8:20 am and it was just beginning to turn daylight.  my daughter and i saw a single bright light in the sky ahead of us, off to the left.  it looked slightly smaller than a dime from our view.  we watched this bright light, first it looked like it was hovering, but then it was slowly moving.  real slow. the light was shimmering, not blinking, but like it would dim then grow brighter, dim again, etc. we watched for abt. 1 min and it just disappeared.  like a light switch, it was on and then it was off and there was nothing there.   we saw it again about 2-3 minutes later, except by the second sighting it had moved it's position in the sky to where it was directly ahead of us.  we watched for about a minute, and again, like a light switch, it just vanished.  it was totally light out at this point now and there was not a cloud in the sky.  we found it a third time in the sky, and we could tell it was moving slowly again. we followed it with our eyes, and within a minute, the bright light went totally out again, but this time instead of being nothing there, as soon as the bight light went out, we saw some kind of object (resembled a tomahawk missle) with three blinking lights running parallel  underneath it ( two white, one red).  it had two small...Wings, for lack of a better word, positioned midway on the object.  it looked black (possibly dark grey, dark green).  it was not made with shiney metal, it was more dull. the three lights underneath the object were not the same bright light that we had originally saw when we first spotted it in the sky.  these were different lights, much smaller. this object just disapeared in the sky, just like the  bright lights had disappeared. no trail, no haze, no nothing.  there one minute and gone the next.  it didn't fly off, it just disapeared into thin air.   i should also mention that this sighting was near the fermi nuclear power plant in monroe, mi. the 'wings' that i mentioned were very small.  it was like this thing had some sort of cloaking device that made it invisible. \r\n \r\nattached is a animation, only to give an idea.  i had a hard time making the missle type object, and lining it up with the bright light. there was  apx. a ten minute duration from the time we saw the first light, until the time the object vanished in the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":6224,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.9205843,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01242007-0003","longitude":-83.3934401,"occurred":1169306400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,

2305 my fiance' points out an odd orange light on the western horizon. i initially dismissed it and went back about watching the southern sky. she once again got my attention and said \"look, it's moving!\" the light she had pointed out had risin a few degrees off the horizon and it came toward us. we watched for around 3 minutes and the object became closer and easier to make out. it had 3 lights in a triangular pattern with a red light in the center that was bright then dim, kind of like a gas lamp being turned up and down. i called my brother who lives a mile away to confirm if he'd seen it and he saw it as well. when the craft was overhead i could make out the outline of an equilateral triangle against the backdrop of the sky. the object was approximately 200 feet above the ground and appeared to be very large. i would estimate roughly 40-50 yards in diameter. we continued to watch the craft move slowly and noislessly toward the eastern horizon. it seemed as if time stood still during this time, we were very intrigued by the craft. my fiance' also noticed a jet come in from the south at very high speed headed in the direction of the object followed by 2 more jets. the object was to the east of us and before the other aircraft got to it, it simply seemed to \"fade to black\". the sighting ended at around 2320. we stayed out a bit longer to see if anything else happened. with no further activity i went in and filed this report.

path off 11th street in eugene, oregon when i spotted an unusual structure about 1,500 to 2,00 feet or so in the sky moving slowly in a generally southern direction.  it was black, round, approximately the size of a large airliner, but shaped differently. another object appeared to dangle from the back of it that looked almost like another circular ufo, but much smaller. several times it appeared to catch up with the larger object and meld into it, then re--emerge. at that height and apparent distance it might, of course, have been circling the larger object.  i also saw what appeared to be another object leave the first and fly southwest ahead of the object.  at this point you are the only person that i have reported this strange object to. i stayed to watch the slowly moving object (that at times appeared to accelerate and hover for about ten minutes), then continued my run back home. when i left it was still moving south-west but somewhat faster.  i am sure it was not a conventional aircraft, a helicopter, a bird or balloon, but was some kind of self-propelled round, cylindrical-shaped device.  what the main larger object was or the smaller ones, i cannot to specifically identify.  one more point, i have excellent near-sighted vision and don' t wear glasses for driving.\r\n \r\nnahu lanham\r\n01/22-07\r\napproximately 5:15 pm pst \r\neugene,
