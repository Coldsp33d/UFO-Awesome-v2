traveling in rear seat of the plane video recording the flight since this was my first flight of this nature, when on our way back from mississippi we encounter this light on the sky. nor the pilot or the copilot witnessed it. while enjoying the view from the plane, i noticed a light on the left side of the plane. at the beginning i thought that it was the sun reflecting on the pyramid (sports and events arena in memphis) but we were not even close to its location and it was not in that direction. then i noticed that the light was located a little higher than the horizon. this indicated me that it was on the sky in an altitude greater than our plane. i had the perception that the light was just floating either without moving at all or moving very slowly. unfortunately due to the high vibration of the airplane it was almost impossible to make a zoom of the object, but i tried. i was a little puzzled by the sight since i didn't know what to make out of the object, but i was positive that it was nothing that i know. i wanted to make the pilot and the copilot aware of the object, but i didn���t have a headset and the noise was too loud to speak; besides since they were talking about the flight i thought it was not safe to distract them. after a few minutes the object just disappear fading out into the sky. i'm submitting the video i capture. although i���m just submitting

when i looked up at the east mountains, it was dark and you couldn't really see the top of the mountains, but from experience it was towards the top where the mountains kind of come down a bit, i saw three bright lights, they would slowly and randomly take turns fading off and quickly turning back on bright, i asked my husband what the heck they were, he told me they were headlights from someone on the mountain, i told him we were to far away for them to be headlights, he then decided it was a radio tower, i then started to think well i'll check in the morning, i don't remember them ever being there before.  the next morning i didn't notice any radio towers large enough to explain the lights and then thought oh well, it was probably nothing.  the next night there was nothing, a couple night later, my husband was in bed and i went out for a smoke and they were back. i came in the house and grabbed my video camera which has really good night vision (0 lux) and i started zooming in on one (they were about the size of an eraser at the end of a standard pencil, and i almost had one zoomed in it was looking slightly oval then all of the sudden it got really bright and i almost dropped the camera, my eyes looked almost like i had been out in the sun for a while and walked inside, i couldn't see real well for about 2 minutes, then when i looked back out they were gone. the next night they were back and i had to run in the house because they looked like they were getting closer and it scared me, even when i came in i had a strange feeling like i was bein watched, it was odd! i have seen them a lot since then and they scare me!!! i will not go out back alone to smoke anymore. i see them through kitchen window though, mostly in the summer but they do show up in the winter too. i'm freaked out because i usually don't believe in this and my husband makes fun of me saying what would they want you for? i don't think they want me, but do they know i saw them? lately i have been going on the front porch which faces west, but there have been a couple times i've seen odd lights that way too, maybe i should just quit smoking (ha ha) but everyone thinks i'm crazy so i don't know who else to tell about these odd lights... i almost forgot, there had also been a few times where there were only one or two lights instead of the 3, all i know is there is something out there. there was one time the news was showing images from the helicopter they use for traffic (morning news) and there was an odd light in the sky and you could hear the news lady saying what was that, what was that light, but everyone ignored her and nothing more was ever said about it. i would like to stay annonymous because everyone thinks i'm crazy about them.","distance":"Over One

(which would be to the east). i sat up to see what it was, there was an amber glowing light a few miles out, from what it looked like, hovering over some mountains but it was very dark, so it is hard to say for sure... anyway,  there was one light, then it looked like it split in to 2 amber lights! of course this could have been a trick of the eye, so now there were 2, i thought maybe it was a jet from a fighter plane or something but then they seemed to pace with us, saying in the same position in the window frame for 87 miles, they would go off and on, sometimes 1, sometimes 2, never more than 2, at about midpoint around scotty's junction, we stopped to watch at a pull off, however, while we were parked they did not light up, once we started driving again, they began to light up again. once we got to beatty there was a turn in the road and we lost sight. shortly after leaving beatty we witnessed 2 fighter jets flying fairly low and very fast directly above us heading towards the

was about the size of a car and was falling from the sky from east to west over 272 in the area of shiprock road.  my girlfriend and i were taking our dog out when we noticed it.  it was a reddish pinkish color with a reddish haze around the outside.  the light from the object was so bright that the pavement on the road had the red light cast on it.  it fell slowly towards the west and once it was close to the ground suddenly disappeared.  i am extremely skeptical as to what this was.  i know it was not a flair, this was far too big, high and bright but similar in color. i called wgal (news 8) right when i had seen this and reported it. then on thursday a friend who was traveling north about 2 miles from where i was on the 17th, at 11:30, had reported seeing the same mysterious light.  our stories were identical when we compared notes.  i know more people had seen the object, there were cars traveling on 272 at the time and there's no way you could miss this thing.  i would greatly appreciate if you looked into this further.  this was a large object, again about the size of a 4 door car, where ever it landed it should be visible.  it went down behind the tree line somewhere starting from the west of 272 in the shiprock road area heading towards the frogtown area.  please let me know if your hear anything more or find anything out.  it would be greatly appreciated. thank

and on the water. this happened when i was around 10 years old. me and my mom and grandmother were driving back from visiting family along blue angel pwky. which also runs along some unused navy property that is all wooded with large pines. i was sitting in the back seat and was leaning forward inbetween the front seats of the car when i noticed what i thought was a helecopter in the distance ahead to the left of the road. being a kid i got really excited and said to mom and grandmom \"look, a helecopter!\" as we continued to drive we were intersecting with the flight patern of the craft. as we got closer i noticed it was no aircraft i had ever seen growing up along the base. it was a ufo. the large saucer was the size of a small house and was not flat. it was like a puff star fish, or round loaf of bread in shape. it was the same color as the night sky with a few small colored lights in no certain order around the bottom. i noticed all of the other 7 or 8 cars on the road were obviously seeing it as well because they were running off the side of the road. i asked mom to pull off to the side of the road so we could see it better but it made the line of sight blocked by being closer to the pine trees. we then pulled back onto the road were we observed the saucer moving very slowly to the right, south, over the tree line and even though the craft was moving in a staraight line it was tilted about 40 degrees almost skimming the tree tops. there were a couple other sightings i have seen also through the years. one was red balls that were the same color as a red laser and just as bright. they all flew over the road in a wooded area between milton and pensacola around 9pm and they took a 90 degree pivot turn down into the woods toward the ground. they were so fast they left streaks as they followed each other. maybe 10 to fifteen orbs. this was also witness with 2 of my best friends. the other was in a storm cloud above the beach. five lights would light up then go out in a intelligent looking pattern. then several military helicopters showed up scanning the area. there are more but i am tired of typing!","distance":"21-100

with our 2 teachers. we'd been playing bastketball, the boys had already gone in to the showers and the girls were heading inside for the showers, somebody said, look! we all turned and saw 6 egg like things flying toward us coming from over the field that was just beyond the playground.  they were flying in formation like a triangle, like an arrow pointed toward us. going about 15 miles per hour, very slow. i'd say they were about 75 yards up. flying from the north southward. then they slowed and stopped we all had the idea that they we watching us watch them.\r\nthey were kind of egg shaped though both ends were the same shape. there were no windows, no lights, no exhaust, no noise, there was no wiggle in their movment, smooth. they were white i'd say they had a bit of a sheen to them. this was the middle of the day in a very populated area, 1 block off the main street in the town,the el camino real.They hovered for about a minute then they moved away-westerly, what had been the left point of the triangle of the formation was now the lead as they moved west in perfect formation again slowly but faster than the approach. we were all excited and a little afraid, the teachers made us go inside they also saw them. now this next part this is why ive never reported this..I also kind of remember that before they went west one went east then down into an orchard just to the east of the school. i went to the orchard after school but i don't remember anything else. i do have about 2 hours of missing time.\r\ni came home from school late..2 hours nobody else from the school went to the orchard and i had never been there before. weird. we weren't allowed to talk about it at school, the event very stangely died away in 1 day. the kids weren't even talking about it. very

and i was rushing home to see led zeppelin perform. i was in my friends car and we were dropping off a friend of ours at her house. for some reason we all got out of the car when we arrived at her home and talked a bit. just as we were getting ready to return to the auto ii looked up after i had seen something out of the corner of my eye. i looked up and noticed a weird object flying from west to east in the sky. i froze in my tracks and brought it to the attention of my friend allen who was driving. he looked up and saw it too. it was hard to tell how far away it was and thus so  equaly diffacult to judge it's size. the frame of refrence that i used was the size of the 5 large white lights shaped like a v underneath the craft. one light front and center with two more on each of the lenghts that made up the v. my estimates are that the object was about 60 to 80 feet long and about 4 or 5 hundred feet in the air.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6182,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9196954,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01172007-0003","longitude":-74.169981,"occurred":490086000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
