is known as the horseback road.My girlfriend was driving ,i was in the front passenger seat and her mom was in the back on the drivers side. we were in a chevy s10 blazer. as we were making the turn mom in the back,(who never curses) said loudly,\"what the hell is that???\"\r\n my girlfriend stopped the vehicle as she looked out the window. i leaned over to see and looked up .Beyond and above the trees which were still bare of leaves was a huge silver thing in the sky. it looked to be about 300 feet long and 50 or 60 feet thick. it filled the sky from my perspective ,and i estimate it was less than 1000 feet away. it had a pattern of lines on it that reminded me of the old jiffypop popcorn dome.It was so close that i could not see the entire object but i could see clearly underneath it and there was no lines or tethers, no gondola as on a hot air balloon, no cockpit or any kind of control surfaces. my girlfriend said that the top of the object had a reddish glow but i did not see this.\r\n  as we looked my girlfriend took her foot off the brake and we started rolling,up the road. the object stayed motionless with absolutely no sound,and was very visible through the bare trees. as we moved on there was a row of evergreens that screened the sky for about 5 to 10 seconds when we could see that spot again the object was gone.\r\n    one of the strange things is, i had a 35mm. camera right next to me on the floor, and i never thought to use it. also nobody in the vehicle felt like staying there to watch longer than we did, it was almost like something was saying \"nothing to see here, move along.\" \r\n  we rode all the way to the end of that road still watching the sky for another glimpse,but nothing was said between us about it for over an hour. \r\nall of our descriptions matched when we did talk. i mentioned the sighting to a friend and he said that he and his sister had seen almost the same thing in the same place 3 years before.\r\n  the next day i drove by the small pond that was under the spot we saw it,and there was a hole in the ice of the pond that looked to be around 30 feet across and appeared round from my perspective.  this was in late winter and this pond was frozen since december it was also frozen the next day.  for the next week or so there was a red bumpy rash on my left side that itched and burned and my side really hurt,like i had been kicked .\r\nnoone else had those symptoms.\r\n   i have also seen many lights and other phenomena in the area ,as have others i have talked to who live in this valley. there are also episodes of missing time, that i have personally experienced,with some corroboration from others.\r\n feel free to contact me at the addresses listed, i can probably getthe others to talk to you as well but they don't live with me anymore.\r\n \r\n      sincerely, steve camden","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

had arisen early, and had gone out to the front yard of my home. it was a nice late spring morning, the sun was up fairly well to the east, and there were no clouds in the sky. i glanced up, for whatever unknown reason, and saw an object, it appeared to be a craft without no fusilage, just a wing. from its rear and front trailing edges, there were rows of red flashing lights. but there was no sound, and i felt uneasy. later on i found myself in the kitchen at the rear of the house, and my father and mother were quite angry. i was told i had missed breakfast, and that they were looking for me and couldn't find me anywhere. i told them i had been in the front yard. my dad got angry and told me i was a lier because they had checked there and i was no where in the yard. i looked at the kitchen clock, at that time, because they were so angry with me. the clock showed 8:30am. to this day i do not know how where the time went, because i am sure that i had gone outside, at 6:30am. to this day, i often have vivid rememberances of that object i saw in the sky. i know i saw it and it was travelling from northeast to southwest. at the time i was eleven years old. i used to walk in my sleep at that age and my parents used to put a table knife in the door jamb so i could not walk outside the house. \r\nbut i feel that i was not walking in my sleep, nor dreaming what i saw, and there was no knife in the doorjamb,i am sure of that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6176,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.4547222,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01162007-0002","longitude":-104.6066667,"occurred":-585334800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Saskatchewan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,

three rather bright lights in a line to the left of the car.  i guess it was around 8:30-8:40 p.M.  it consisted of three bright white lights in a triangle with a red light positioned just behind the forward point.  the front light was brighter than the others.  the red light did not flash like one on a jet, but rather it pulsed fairly slowly, growing bright then fading out.  at its closest, its wingspan looked fairly consistent with orion's belt in the night sky, if not a little larger.  there was some noise associated with it, but if it was a jet, the noise was far too soft- almost just like wind blowing, and sometimes a low hum.  when we first witnessed the object, my girlfriend, who was following us in her car, called me about the time i reached for my phone to call her.  it was hard to miss.  the object stayed on our left side, thought the road turned a bit, but it did get almost directly overhead at one point.  as we passed under it, it was out of sight for a couple moments, then ended up along side us again travelling a completely different direction from when we first saw it.  a couple miles down, we parked to see if we could snap a picture of it on our camera-phones, but they're pretty usless for that sort of thing.  as we were parked watching it, it turned at almost a 90 degree angle and started heading away again.  this time, we decided to head home.  once we arrived there, we saw it cross overhead infront of us, head into the tree line.  it then turned away again and came into view, and it then came directly towards us, and when it was at about a 45 to 60 degree angle infront of us, it a sharp turn to the left and headed into the horizon- still heading away from the nearest airport or military base.  as i stated before, the sound was nothing like a jet, more like a steady rush of air as if from a fan.  my girlfriend and i left to run some quick errands, and my brother called me back to tell me he could hear the noise from inside the house, much louder this time, but when he got outside could not locate the object.  the reason it baffles me is that the nearest airport is 30+ miles away.   if it was a jet, it was very lost.  it was circling our little town randomly, making very un-jet-like turns.  ontop of that, as i stated before, there were no strobes, only the three brights and the one red pulse.  i hope this helps! good

noticed a white light on the other side of the lake. i figuered it must have been another fisherman's lantern. the light appered to be moving slowly as though someone was walking with the lantern. all of a sudden i saw two bright red lights from the area where the lantern was. at first i thought who ever had the lantern was getting into their vehicle and leaving. it seemed strange (too big for a car or truck)so by this time i was entranced on the lights. they slowly moved up the side of the mountain and as it moved up it turned sidways and there it was, a cold black triangle shaped craft, the lights had become three light fading from red to amber almost pinkish. i watched the craft, which was probably 100 feet long in comparison with the background which is very familiar to me, move back down the side of the mountain and began hovering over the lake. it moved silently around skimming over the top of the lake. all of a sudden the red lights went dark and they were replaced by one very bright white light. at this time i heard the sound of something spinning, it made a wobbling sound that would speed up and slow down. this went on for sometime. i was very afraid of this thing, my hair was standing on end, there seemed to be a electrical or magnetic feild in the area, so i walked back up toward camp. i watched it for about ten more minutes, then all at once the lights and spinning sound was dead dark silence. i have had other experiances from that area if you guys are interested. this thing was for real.\r\n\r\ni reported this on the national ufo repoting center some

trips----as high as three weeks at a time.I have seen many things i cannot explain other than it was an un identified flying object. but always at night.\r\n\r\nthe fishing has been so good for years in this place that a friend of mine has made this quite the gathering spot for us men who never grew up.\r\nlast year, there was at the height, 85 of us camped out in a canyon 4 miles north of the town of bridgeport, california.Just over the hill from hawthorne, nevada. about twelve years ago, our campsite then was in a canyon along the little walker river. just one canyon south of the marine camp and we were \"buzzed\" by them on their night manuever's with their blacked out and relatively quite helicopters.\r\n\r\ni have seen an entire mountain range glow from two bright objects that did things no helicopter could and then flew out towards space and dissapeared at an incredible speed without making a sound.\r\n\r\non a beautiful, clear, calm day a group of about 15 of us did our traditional hike to an alpine lake (emma lake)on the eastern crest of the sierra.Three of the next generation (one an ex-marine)had brought snowshoes and snowboards and hiked to the top of emma peak (3208 m) and those still at the lake were just fishing and following their progress when this absolutley huge thing came into view from behind emma peak and glided accross the distant horizon. i, like an idiot, had a camera around my neck but instead of taking a picture of it, all i did was question the two guys right next to me what they thought it was. i yelled at the group accross from us who had their backs to this, to look up and tell me what they thought it was.They were too close to the steep hillside and could not see anything. the guy on my right said he had binoculars in his backpack and i started digging through it while still questioning these two guys if they heard anything and what they thought they were looking at. the guy on my left said he heard a plane and i pointed at the plane flying 4 miles just east of us  and said yeah you hear that plane but what about that thing up there? the first thing i dug out was his camera and got it out of the case only to see it was not the binocs and by the time i got his binocs, i saw this thing for only long enough to say it was not like any blimp i have ever seen. and it slowly drifted behind the mountains going to the crest of the sierras.\r\n\r\nthe total to travel this approximately mile long horizon visible through the saddle was just about 2 1/2 minutes. just a stroll in the park. from the beginning of the sighting until it dissappeared. how or if it crossed over the sierras is beyond me. \r\n\r\nby the size of the trees (thirty feet tall) in the saddle that you could see this object through, our best guesstimation of the size of this would be well over 300 feet long. (two trees at it's width) at one time, it nearlly filled half the sky seen through the saddle in the mountain. it was shaped more like a cigar than a blimp and flying on a slight tilt in the direction it was headed. it could have been a disc seen only on it's edge. but it was not like any blimp i have ever seen. and it had to be just skimming the mountains.Barely clearing the range.\r\n\r\nonly a fool flies that low in the sierras and during the same time a high flying eastern bound jet (30,000 feet?) could be heard as well as the single engine plane flying around 10,000 feet going north to south following us highway 395. between the mountain ranges. this thing was travelling west bound right up the little walker river canyon not more than a mile away from us and not making a sound.\r\n\r\nthere were no windows. no bottom carriage. no rear stabilizers.No markings. it appeared to have a stubby small wing-like object in the middle. and by small, this is relative as it would have been huge, as big as a single engine plane would not this object itself been so big. the wing was visible easily with the binoculars. no exhaust. no lights blinking. no red on the right returning. it just kind of shimmered.Like glowing mercury. kind of like the objects (toys) you could hold up to a light source and they glowed. \r\n\r\nthe three who saw this could not say what we saw this day. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":6170,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2557045,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152007-0010","longitude":-119.2313932,"occurred":1150395600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,  Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1150395600000,"summary":"A very large, silent, silvery object flew slowly by the crest of the sierras. no sound was made and we could hear a very high jet and an airplane in the distant but thi thing made no noise as it glided low and slow over this point near the sonora pass.","tags":["sound"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Bridgeport, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483532"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Toronto","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on a break at work!

anyways i wasn't about to fall asleep! i tried to focus more intently! \r\nas i looked on, i saw smaller lights moving quickly to the flashing red object from opposite directions! how many, i am not sure! it might have been about 20 smaller objects (than the red object). they looked like white lights and disappeared at the moment they reached the larger red light! after the 2 rows of lights were gone, the red light disappeared! it was like the red light was turned off. it didn't move from its' spot for the approximate 5 to 7 minutes i watched it in the sky.\r\nafter this event, i thought that the red object was a 'mother ship' signaling to other (smaller), ships and then moved on after all the ships in the area were back aboard. i am not sure what the lights were or what they meant, but if i was going to tell anyone, this is how i would describe it. this is the third time that i seen something in the sky that i thought was an unidentified object in the sky. i guess i'm just a good observer.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":6168,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.661756,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01152007-0008","longitude":-79.3807043,"occurred":180012600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":180012600000,"summary":"A motionless, red flashing light in the sky!","tags":["lights","ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Detroit","timeZoneName":"America/Detroit","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Toronto, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483533"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Knoxville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was letting my cat out and since its still unseasonably warm here still, 54 degrees, i decided to step outde with my first cup of coffee. it was between 5am and 5:45 maybe even 5:30. i was facing northwest to north and i was looking up at the relative fast moving clouds. it was not totally overcast. i saw a very bright object, brighter than a plane but it did not illuminate the sky. it was a white light not a blinking one. i do look up qite a bit at the evening sky and know what a plane looks like and this moved much much faster than any jet i have ever seen. although it was the size of a plane traveling at a normal altitude it moved faster than anything i have ever seen. it moved from left to right and if i extended my arm the object could be covered with my thumb but traveled the distance of a yardstick if held in my hand. i noticed that it traveled in between clouds. maybe a shooting star, i don't know. the brightness and the speed made this unlike anything i have ever seen. probably explainable but i thought i would report it anyway just in case anyone else saw it. my feelings? glad that i had seen something unusual but it was probably shooting star or space debris reentering the atmosphere.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":6167,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.9628784,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152007-0007","longitude":-83.9168592,"occurred":1168868400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1168868400000,"summary":"Saw an object move very very fast between clouds, not a plane, too too fast","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Knoxville, Tennessee","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483534"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Toronto","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I lived at 25 martha eatonway, suite 2102 and this is where the event took place.The time can be closer tracked by rental records.\r\n first of all i do not drink (alchohol) or smoke. a few of us were hanging out at my place on this warm summer evening, when i noticed this very large ball of light outside the balcony window, i yelled for every one to look at this thing. i had the presence of mind to remove the screen as not to ipede my view of the light and stuck my head out the window. rolin, fred and myself all had our heads through that window in seconds. that light zoomed away from us in the direction of the pearson airport silently and disappeared within 6-7 mins.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving home, from at that time my girlfriends house to my parents home where i was living at the time. i was 22 years old. this event occurred in southwest wayne co., mi. which was at that time and still somewhat is suburban/rural. i was travelling west on sibley rd., and had just crossed u.S. 24, known as telegraph rd. i was in a line of 4 cars, the first three in a group approx. 100 feet long, the forth back about an 1/8 of a mile behind. we had a green light, traversed the 'crown' of the cross st. and continued west about 1/8th of a mile. to my immediate right, somewhat on the outer peripherery of my line of sight, i saw a light travelling at a high rate of speed at approx. a 35 degree angle downword. it was behind a patch of woods about 200-300 feet to the north of the road i was on.  i had grown up and lived all my life at that time exactly 6 miles due south of detroit-metro airport, i imediately thought, \"well i'm about to see my first plane crash\". at that same instant i lost sight of the object for no more that 2-3 seconds, then i saw it begin a slow climb over the trees at a very step angle. also, it was coming at an angle back towards me, in other words not only had it changed altitude at a very steep angle, it also did an incredible change of direction from due west downward to very near the ground below the tops of the trees, to now climbing at a steep angle and travelling south-southeast. as it crossed the street i was on, it was going no more than 30 mph at a height of no more than 200 feet. i was the third car in a line of 4 cars, and i noticed that both cars in front of me had stopped, as well as myself, and i had pulled somewhat over with 2 tires on the shoulder, and 2 tires still on the road. i had my window down about 3 inches, as i was a smoker at that time, yet as this craft crossed the road no more than 100 feet ahead of me and continued s-se, it made absolutely no noise. i did feel what i have described as a vibration or hum in my sternum/chest, but no noise. i had to 'cran' my neck to my extreme left to continue to track it. when it was about 150 ft to my left/rear and about 200 ft high, it stopped and just hovered. again, no noise. i got a good look at this craft. it was metallic, but i couldn't say if it was gray or not due to the poor ambient light. it's shape was round or oval but it had a distinct flat end to it. the best way to describe it would be if you had a round or slightly oval sting ray fish, and you chopped off 1/3 of it. it was about 40ft. in circumference, and about 9-11 ft high. it had some type of bubble or 'hump' in the middle, about 10 feet around and perhaps 3 ft. high, which looked to be made of a slightly different material or color, which appeared to be in the exact middle of the craft. upon the 'hump' was a red light that glowed bright, then dim ,bright, dim. it did not shut off or strobe , just sort of increased and then decreased in intensity. the thing that struck me most was, there was a red light and a green light that appeared to be port and starboard markers, which seemed to be approx 2-3 feet up on either side of the top surface, on a type of post or mast. they did not blink or change in intensity, they were not very bright, but they were red and green for sure. the flat'end' or rear of this craft,had three hugh white lights,(they were about 3 feet in diameter) that seemed to be flashing in some type of code or pattern, each of the 3 would flash in an independant pattern. my thought was that this was the rear or propulsion part of this craft, but i'm not sure of that. it hovered yet this flashing pattern continued. i observed this for no more than 5-7 sec of hovering time, when the forth car slowly passed me. it seemed that that driver was not aware of why the 2 cars and myself were stopped there, but when that car passed me, it drew my attention to the road ahead of me, at which time i realized that the 2 autos ahead of me had also left, as all i saw were taillights ahead of me. i glanced back at the craft, and i became aware that it was just me and this thing there at that time, and i'm not proud to say, but i felt very apprehensive and scared and i floored it and left the craft hovering there. as far as i know, it did not follow or tail me, and i have no idea how long it remained there. my thought at that time, after some reflection, which i still feel to this day, is that having grown up just a few miles from one of the largest airports in the country, and i must add i continued to live in that area until i was 42, and having seen almost every type of commercial and many military aircraft,(metro airport was a afng base when i was a child/teen) in every type of weather and time of day, altitude,etc. i can say for an absolute fact, and i would affirm with all that i am, that what i saw was not anything that i had seen before or since. i am not willing to say it had little green men, or grays or anything else in it, but i know it was not an identifiable craft, either in design or propulsion. i have often felt that perhaps it was a gov't. craft of some type, because of the 'port' and 'starboard' lights. also, one thing i remember is that our local weekly paper, the \"news herald\" reported that during that same time period there were numerous sightings, and even our local township police, (huron township, michigan)had spotted and followed a craft, and actually went into a ditch following one of these sighted craft. i am at work right now, so i cannot attach a sketch, but if you contact me and provide me with an address, i will mail you one i drew up.I wish i had contacted you years ago, but this event made such an impact on me it was like it happened last week. thank you, harry timothy slomers           ","distance":"101-500

happened about a year and 2 months ago, in november of 2005.  this essentially was the impetus which led to my initiation of ufo/et research, and this is why the report hasn't been filed until now.\r\n\r\nit was about 10 p.M. on approximately november 15, 2005.  i can't recall the precise date and i didn't write it down.  i was with my friend driving to tim horton's (coffee chain) and something above in the night sky caught my attention as we drove through the neighbourhood to get to the coffee shop.  at first i thought i saw a plane or helicopter but i kept staring at it and it seemed to be stationary and did not have blinking lights or lights in the standard setting that a plane or copter would have equipped.  it had these 4 steady blue-white lights that were in a square formation on the bottom.  what struck me as bizarre is that it was very low to the ground- about 250-300 feet.  \r\n\r\ncurious, i asked my friend to stop his truck.  i got out of the truck and stared straight up at this thing.  it was completely silent and moving very slowly above.  my friend stayed in the truck but was staring at the object.  more info on the craft:  i looked carefully and could see a black circular silhouette with those four blue lights in a square pattern.  they were not shining brightly but had this strange conistent glow to them, unblinking and not glittering.  i watched in awe at this thing as it completely silently (it was quiet on the road we were on) passed overhead.  it eventually passed behind a spruce tree so i ran over the side of the tree to get a better view.  about 5 more seconds passed with the object in full view, and then it did a right turn and shot off incredibly fast- about 10 times the speed it was going.  it did a 90 degree turn and shot off out of view.  after this happened i had an intense mix of fright, excitement and... emotions that i can't really describe with words.  to be honest it was really shocking and scary to see what happened but incredible at the same time.   what i remember about the craft is that it was circular and black.  the four lights did not light up the underside.  they seemed succinct and had this strange steady glow to them.  i have attached a paintbrush picture.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

transcanada highway somewhere near sudbury (within 150 miles). it was a cool summer day with very large clouds which were 2000 feet tall at least, fluffy white tops and very dark, spread out bottoms. there were many openings in there clouds in which we could see clear blue sky. i recall that it had sprinkled a bit just before we were dropped off from our previous ride.\r\nthe area we were at had many bluffs of deciduous trees with hay fields winding in-between the trees.  there was a 3 or 4 strand barbed wire fence on the other side of the ditch all along the highway on the north side and the south side was all bush that we could see.\r\non this day there were not made cars going either way on the highway and as we sat and had a smoke while we waited, we were wondering if we should get rain gear out of our packs because, judging by the clouds, it could rain at any time. as we spoke, we were both scanning the sky and that is the time when we saw it.\r\ni saw the craft just as the nose of it appeared about 800 - 1000 yards away as it very slowly came out of a cloud. at first, i thought of a hot-air balloon as it was absolutely noiseless and moved at about the same speed. then, i thought it looked like 737 for a moment, but it was hanging there and hardly more that 1000 feet in the air, then realized i was looking at something with a row of windows down the portion i could see.\r\nit was at this time that i looked towards doug. as he looked at me, i could see the fear in his eyes. he said, \"lets get out of here\", but i said, \"no, don't move\", as i looked back at the object.\r\nas i focused back on the object, i noticed that all lot more of it was outside the cloud by now.  the front of it appeared to be pointed, and it was huge.  the area that i could see had to be hundreds of feet long (the right-hand side of the ship), and the row of windows (almost like looking at the side profile of a 747 aircraft) appeared to be backlit. then i noticed that there were shadows in the windows and that the shadows moved around. at this time i saw that it humanoid shaped shadows, and that they (approx 20 or so) appeared to be walking along a hallway just inside. as i looked more closely, i saw two of these shadows stop at one of the windows. they stopped, and appeared to be talking, when one of them turned and looked out the window towards us. immediately, the other one turned towards us also. when i saw this i said \"oh, shit\" and just as i spoke the words, i heard the screeching sound of something running into a barbed wire fence and as i whipped around to see what it was.... that is the last i remember until after.\r\ni came to a split second later, falling over and on doug as we tumbled down the side of the ditch along the highway. when we came to a stop at the bottom, we knew something major had just happened. there was nothing in the sky anymore, but the strangest thing was the screech i had heard before was doug as he jumped over the fence and said he was about halfway to the nearest bluff of trees when it happened, and i had been still standing on the highway( at least 50 feet from each other), and yet when we came to a split second later, we were on top of each other partway down the side of the ditch.\r\nit took days until we could understand what happened. i have some memories of what when on and so does doug.\r\nthey had taken both of us into that spacecraft! \r\nmy memory is of being on a sort of hospital bed and of someone leaning over me with a long hypodermic needle and sticking it into the centre of my eye.\r\ndoug remembered a lot more about what happened than i did and he was terrified. he had nightmares for months after. we agreed that based on the section of the ship that we could see ( which could have been more than the wing span of a dash 8 airplane, based on the assumption that the dark humanoid shapes were the actual size of us humans) it could have easily been only one-half or even one-quarter of the whole thing. i have seen a number of documentaries on tv about different types of et craft, but have never seen this huge dart-like shape anywhere. it was a small city.\r\nwe returned to toronto in the hopes of telling someone, but even the cops didn't what to hear of any of that stuff at the time. then we discovered that each of us had a souvenir of our experience. doug discovered a mysterious lump under the skin on his hand. at that time i mentioned that i had a lump too, only mine was put on my chest! we both have implants.\r\nmy implant has puzzled many doctors over the years as it show an x-rays, bone scan and mri. they said it must be metal in me. about 10 years ago a doctor was going to make a small incision to remove this metal, when he stopped and called an other doctor into the room, and he concurred; the thing under my skin actually moved away every time the doctor even brought the scalpel near the protrusion.\r\nover the years this lump (about 1/4 inch wide to 1/2 inch long appearing oblong at times, otherwise rounded) and will get very big at times, so big that it shows through light shirts, then will shrink until barely noticeable at other times. i have known what this is and have carried it for years, still where they put it.\r\nplease help! i want this removed and will give this implant to anyone who would want it for research.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

the pine trees.  it was very bright and it wasn't up very high in the sky, i was gauging where the object was exactly by where it was in relation to the tree branches.  i watched for about 15 minutes when i decided to run downtairs and get the binnoculars.  the object was so bright i could not make out the exact edges but i could see lights coming out from the top intwo different directions (like attennas going in different directions but i could not describe an exact shape) the object did move but very slowly, it drifted upward and to the right of the tree and as it got lighter in the sky it floated up until it was a dot in the sky at aroung 5:30 a.M. when it was light enough to see i looked at the tree branches to see exactly where i saw the light first and it was in front of one of our mountains called black mountain (it is on the very outskirts of kelowna where not many people live.  i told my husband and children what i saw the next day and was very spooked about the experience.  i phoned a t.V.Station and newspaper to ask if anyone had reported a light and one fellow told me it was venus.  i thought it could be possible so a few nights later i got up at 4:30 a.M. so i could verify in my mind if this light was venus but to my surprise when i looked out the window hoping to again see the light it was black.  i was quite  upset to think what i saw may have been a ufo.  i went back to bed and when i awoke a couple hours later i walked out to our driveway to get our daily paper and to my surprise the front page had a picture of a crop circle that had been found in a nearby field.  the crop circle was the same shape as the light that night and the crop circle was found july 31.  i started screaming for my daughter to take a look at the paper and she was also very freaked out looking at the paper and seeing in print what i had been describing to my family for days.

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First of all, this was 1 year ago, first at the end of december 2005 and then again within the first week of january 2006. my wife, 8yr. old son and i were driving home and i noticed a bright orange object flying in the normal route of airplanes that take off and turn and then head south. i assumed at first it was an airplane but because of the bright orange glow i joked to my family \"look there's a ufo\". this was actually just a joke not even being serious myself. we drove for a few more seconds and my son said \"daddy, the ufo's dropping fire\". and of course i thought he was playing along and i was like \"yeah right you're really funny\" . and then when my wife said, \"he's serious, the thing's dropping fire from underneath. so at that time we were just turning  right on atlantic avenue and i looked to my right and saw the thing still heading south. i didn't pull over yet but they kept looking at it. we were almost home. anyhow so i turned left on avenue g and actually pulled over and rolled my window down and the thing looked as if it wasn't moving although it could have been traveling away from us but it looked like it wasn't moving and fire would come out of this thing. the best way to describe it was: deliberate. this was not any kind of aircraft with electrical problems causing sparks. the fire would come down. obviously for it to be fire, something had to be \"on fire\" but whatever it was it would just dissipate after falling hundreds of feet. by the way this was over rural suburbs. not subdivisions(although it did fly over subdivisions at first but where it was actually dropping fire, there was houses below, not many but nonetheless-houses. it wasn't fire shooting out the bottom. it wasn't a beam. it could have been a solid object or a group of small objects being let go at once. but the point is this \"spec\" of fire would fall and fall and fall and then just disappear before it hit the ground. then a few seconds would go by and nothing. then another fire thing would come out. the truth is i was angry when this was happening because it appeared so deliberate that i was afraid that somehow, even though the fire disappeared before it hit the ground that it would somehow catch someone's house on fire. i was very upset about this. so altogether there were about 5-10 of these things that dropped out. i contacted the airport authority to see if they knew anything about a distressed plane. they said there were no reports of any kind. the next day i contacted a \"hotshot\" forest fighter. he told me that during forest fires they drop fire things that are used to fight the fire somehow by diverting it but that there's no chance that these things would be used so near a town and especially when there's no forest fire. i contacted an airplane mechanic that told me that it did not sound like fog \"seeding\" because the seeding is a white color. i agreed with him because there was no fog that night. there was low clouds though, both times we saw them. i contacted the faa in portland. they were kind of like\" well who knows what you saw\". they actually told me about mufon at that time but i didn't know you guys investigated. i would have loved to talk to you about it but after the faa guy didn't seem too interested i figured nobody would be. we contacted the radio station. it is 1400am located in medford, or. that's only a few miles from white city. they invited us on the next morning to tell people what we saw. we didn't use our last name on the program, just the real first names. i found 2 other accounts of people seeing this same exact described object in 2003. july i think, in concord, ca.Ultimately both times we lost sight of the object as it moved upward and disappeared. by the way, the second time we saw it we had actually just got home and got out of the car. on this occasion i actually ran to my front door, unlocked it ran to the office with my shoes on which is breaking the no-shoe rule grabbed the camcorder, ran outside. i had plenty of minutes of film available but of course the battery was virtually dead. for the last year i've been hoping to see it again. i always have my camcorder ready but what are the odds i'll see it again. we do have an airforce base about 80 miles to the east, but why would they drop fire over people's houses if it is classified? thanks for your time.  you can ask my wife or son of 10 now what they saw too.

crisp night. went out to stand on my patio with my former son-in-law to get some air after moving a lot of boxes. clear night with lots of stars. this was very close to the dorval international airport, now called pierre elliott trudeau airport. we were facing west, just standing there. \r\n\r\nall of a sudden we both saw four round yellowish lights above us - can't remember if initially they were moving slowly or not moving. then they moved, or started to move, very, very slowly to the north (to our right). i think what made us first notice these things was that 1) they seemed low so as to be seen from the \"corner\" of our eyes, and 2) with it being such a beautiful night i naturally wanted to look up at the stars.\r\n\r\nwhat did i think it was when i first noticed? immediately ufo came to mind.. what \"type\" of unidentified flying object, i didn't know, but nothing i'd ever seen before. i knew it was most unusual.\r\n\r\nthey were not pinpoint lights, like stars. there were two and then a bigger space, then another two - i.E., four in a row: one, then a space, then one, then a bigger space, then one with the same smaller space as between the first two, then one. couldn't tell if it was four objects, or two, each with two lights. the lights were not bright like airplane lights. there was no sound, no vibration, no wind, no markings on them. they moved slowly to the north, then the two on the left side took off together at an astonishing speed, to the north. a couple of seconds later the other two lights, together, took off in the same direction at the same astonishing speed.\r\n\r\n---i realize this was over 20 years ago, but i've always wondered about it and would like to know if you're aware of any other reports from that night. i went into the house and immediately wrote an account of it, which i still have.\r\n\r\nbecause the night sky was black, it was very hard to get perspective, so i can't say if they were close to the ground, although i think so, or if they were very big things and high up.\r\n\r\nright after all four lights took off, i looked way down at the sky westward and saw a very thin red line of light pointing in our direction. it looked like a laser, that's the only way i can describe it.\r\n\r\nwe were absolutely spellbound. neither of us blinked, moved, nudged each other or said to each other \"hey, did you see that?\". i also think we didn't even breathe, not wanting to miss a second of it.\r\n\r\nmy former son-in-law said he \"felt\" like they (the four lights) had come into our atmosphere, then left. i didn't see them coming, but i sure saw them going at lightning speed.\r\n\r\nthe next day i had a bad intestinal upset, which kept me running to the bathroom (sorry, don't want to be graphic). i was to start a new job that day at 4:00 p.M. and was worried that i might not be able to go. i did though - the upset lasted for a only few hours in the early part of the day. i have very rarely ever gotten upsets like that.\r\n\r\ni have never forgotten this, and i'm really interested to know if you've ever heard of this. i remember, although this part i did not write down, that somebody told me the next day that there had been reports on the radio of people seeing what we'd seen.\r\n\r\ndo you have any information? it would be much appreciated. thanks.\r\n\r\ncathy

thought i was safe in my bed. what follows has been haunting me ever since. i was a young boy, about 6 or 7 years old, living out in the country with my mom, dad and two brothers. my dad was in the air force and worked at offutt a.F.B. in bellvue, nebr. we lived probably 15 miles west out in the country near plattsmouth. i shared a room with my middle brother and was asleep in the top bunk while he was in the bottom bunk. i slept facing the wall on my right side, and still do, when all of the sudden i woke up, still facing the wall, and felt as if i was being watched. i slowly turned over only to come face to face with something. even though it was only 2 or 3 feet from my face, i could not make out its face. i could only see an outline of a head and what appeared to be part of a cape extending out from both sides of its head, reminded me of dracula. needless to say, i was petifried but heard or felt a voice say dont be scared, turn back over. so i did. facing the wall again, i was wide awake and scared shitless but dont know why i never called out for mom or dad. i dont know how much time passed, but i stayed looking at the wall and hoping whatever it was would just go away. finally, getting enough courage to turn around and look, i seen that whatever was there was gone. let me tell you, i never, ever made that trip to the bottom bunk faster than i did that night. flying through the air over my brother to get between him and the wall took seconds flat. he woke up wondering what the heck i was doing and i told him dracula was in our room. now both of us are awake and scared with the covers pulled up just below our chins. our bed was located in a way that when we were sitting up with our backs against the headboard, we could see out into the hallway. we both heard something in the hall and then silence. what happended next, i will never forget, a big green head with big eyes peered around the corner and looked at us and then was gone. we slowly looked at each other as if to say \"did you just see what i saw?\". needless to say we spent the rest of the night huddled there awake and waited till daylight. i know this happended during the winter, because we went outside the next day to look for footprints in the snow that was on the ground, but did not find any. to this day, i dont know why we didnt scream bloody murder for our parents as was the case when we would have a nightmare. i told our parents, but they said i dreaming. i wish i could remember more, if there is more, from that night. i have one more weird thing that happened to me but wont go into that now. growing up, i put these down as bad dreams but would always think about them from time to time. gradually they faded from memory until i happened upon a book in the library when i was about 16 or 17. it was about ufos and aliens. as i read it, i became engrossed and couldnt put it down, until i came to an artists rendering of what is now the classic grey. seeing that picture sent chills down my spine and scared me to where i put the book away only to get it out later because i couldnt stop thinking about it which brought me back to this night. about ten years ago, i brought up that night to my brother. he remembers something happened that night but doesnt recall much. i showed him a picture of an alien from a book and he probably thought me to be crazy so i havent mentioned it since even though i think about it time to time. i dont know if what i saw was an extraterrestrial, but i pretty sure it wasnt dracula and frankenstein!

flying object zoomed (cant think of a different description) into the sky extremely fast. then, completely stopped over a tree that was across the street, behind a house. it stationary, but it was spinning in place. while it was spinnging, there was a big, blue, diamond shaped light and it was very bright. as i kept looking at the light i noticed that the ship was beautiful. it was the brightest silver i have ever seen and it was perfectly clean not one spot. there were windows on it, i could see them, but i couldnt focus in on it enough to see inside of them. i wouldnt say that i was scared when i saw it, i would probably say i was more stunned than anything. my eyes got big as i saw it fly into the sky. \r\n\r\nbefore i saw it, i was sitting in my room next to my window. i  had starting the news. there was nothing interesting on so i looked out my window. i was probably staring for like 2-3 mintutes and then i saw it \"zoom\" into the sky. i automatically thought that it was a ufo once i first saw it. at that time i was thinking, \"am i seeing things?\". after about 45 seconds to a minute of staring at it, it flew out of the sky very fast.","distance":"101-500
