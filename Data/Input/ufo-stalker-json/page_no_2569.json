search for satellites in the night sky. being from the mojave desert, i've always been a sky watcher, and i take advantage of the few clear skies that we have in oakland. after a couple of minutes looking up, i saw what i first thought was a white owl, or a flock of birds, but it turned out to be a triangular set of lights overhead travelling north at a high rate of speed. there were six lights in a delta pattern, and i'm still not sure if it was one craft, or a formation of smaller craft. they appeared to be the size of a 747 flying at approximately 4000ft. my friend failed to see them, as they were faint, and difficult to spot. no noise accompanied the sighting. i should also mention that there were absolutely no jets travelling overhead at the time (which is unusual for an area with three major airports). the lights disappeared over the horizon within seconds. now my eyes are glued to the sky, and within five minutes, another craft or formation flew overhead in the same direction, at the same speed. this time it appeared to be in the shape of a chevron. there were six faint, white lights. my friend unfortunately missed this one as well, but instantly after it faded into the mist and city lights, another set of lights followed it. this last craft (or set of craft) was odd shaped. there were approximately seven faint lights that started as a triangle on the right, but with a couple of lights sticking out to the left. i have a feeling that this was a formation of individual craft. we both saw this odd sighting, and my friend described it as \"a set of bowling pins\" moving through the sky. the following night we decided to take a look to see if any more appeared overhead. it was 7:00 and after a half hour, we spot another formation, this time moving nnw. it started out as a v shape, but by the time that it was overhead, the lights changed position with respect to one another. i don't know if it was one object that was pivoting as it was flying, or if these multiple craft were able to change position within close proximity of one another, while moving at an incredibly fast speed. the strange thing about this sighting, was that there was plenty of air traffic at the time. a boeing 737 and a 767 flew over within seconds of this \"thing\" passing overhead. i don't know how they wouldn't have been able to see it. what we saw was not a flock of birds, a conventional aircraft, or any other object commonly known to man. they were large, very fast moving, and were silent as can be. their lights were defined, and were round and white/cream colored. the craft were able to move from horizon to horizon in about 8 seconds. if i had not been focused on the sky in an attempt to see satellites, i would never have spotted them. thanks for your time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6142,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.8140237,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01122007-0002","longitude":-122.2683537,"occurred":1168313400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron,

usual i miss you chit chat, when all of a sudden this bright flash flickered up in the sky .My first reaction was excitement, because right away i knew this was no ordinary aircraft. it was close no more than a mile away and it almost made me run like a scared baby. this first flash\\flicker lasted only about 5-7 seconds. my first thought is a meteor, or a firecracker, only this didnt move. then suddenly the second flash; this was not at all like the first, this was more like a spotlight on a lighthouse with a greenish hue color. this lasted for more than 6 minutes long enough to get a good picture; oh how i wish i had a camera.The most peculiar thing about it was it stayed in the same spot,and where it was dark it was diffucult to tell the distance. there was also a plane flying over ,(and i know the pilot had to see it also)in the sky almost where this light was. the next time it came on the light changed to almost a solid red ,it was more like the first  flickering, not like the spotlight.Judging from the distance i was looking it couldn't have been more than mile or two off and not more than twenty five hundred feet up. this color also lasted about 5 min. (i had a clock on my phone.) it still hadn't moved horizontally or vertically ,and also it didnt have any trails like meteors and fireworks normally do. after this last flash dance it went out and never came back on,like it was extinguished, nor did i see it on any more of my shifts later. i was not a beliver in ufo's or alien lifeforms,mostly i didnt believe without proof. again i am sorry for not getting any photos of this spectacle,(that i regret the most). thank you for taking the time to read my story and if there is anybody out there with similar encounters please email me at jared@kymail.Com//              ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6141,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.4751689,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01122007-0001","longitude":-82.5236484,"occurred":1167206400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,  Flash,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1167206400000,"summary":"Mostly flickering up in the sky but not no constant.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Pikeville, Kentucky","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483589"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live in riverside,california and the reason i decided to post this picture on a forum (generally a ufo site) is to find an explanation to this object i caught with my camera. i decided to take pictures of clouds to put it in my desktop when i noticed a bright object on the sky above the hill after i took the pictures without knowing that there was an object in the sky. it does not look like any aircraft that i know of or a bird and if you look closely a redish trail is visible. i took 3 pictures of this (the last one came alittle blureish) and if anyone has any idea of what this object can be please respond.

(my house was located about two miles away from the historic zapotec ruins of monte alban and so people were passing by my neighborhood all the time trying to get there,the house was located on top of a hill and very few houses existed around it back then, the other hills also had houses scadered all over so all the homes were visible to eachother )......I remember sitting in the yard of my house playing with a stick and a toy car ,i leaned over to reach for a bag of something but i lost balance and fell on my side. when i picked my self up i, i looked across to the other hill (about 1/8 of a mile)and noticed that something bright and shinny was hovering over my neighbor's house(at that time in my life i had no concept of aliens or ufos). i went inside my house and called my two sisters, they were about seven and ten years older than i. we went outside and just stood there and watched the bright obeject hover or the neighbor's house. it was almost as if someone was using a huge mirror and was holding it perfectly still and then moving it about 90-100ft in the air. the object was bright no matter what movement it made, it would go up in a perfect line and then come back down, it would also move to the sides super fast and then stay ferfectly still. at some point the object came down to the front of the house and remained unmoved for about 2 minutes, we did not say anything to eachother because we were still trying to figureout what it was in our heads. finally the object got up to about 50ft off from the top of the house and it slowly faded, until we couldn't see any of it anymore. our neighbor was not home, she worked at the local market and her children were at church at the time, only one other neighbor saw the ufo and they were freaked out by it, i had no idea why, but they were praying like crazy for the next few days.\r\ni had forgotten about the incident until about three years ago when my family was having dinner and we started talking about our old house, then i realised i had witnessed a ufo along time ago.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":6134,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":17.0669444,"location":null,"logNumber":"MX-01102007-0012","longitude":-96.7202778,"occurred":680857200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oaxaca","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":680857200000,"summary":"Bright object hovering over my neighbor's home in oaxaca mexico","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Mexico_City","timeZoneName":"America/Mexico_City","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Oaxaca, Oaxaca","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483596"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Little Rock","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in the car with my friend parker and his dad after i had went to his house to study for exams and we were driving and we saw a big ball of light traveling about a couple hundred miles per hour in a straight line with a little bit of smoke like substance coming out of the back but it had like a light rainbow color to the smoke and we saw it and it just dissapeared out of nowhere and we had no sight of it after that. p.S. it didn't look like anything like fire works.

official report i have made, however it is not the first time i've shared my experience.  in fact, when it happened, i was not alone.  altoona, the city i live in, is a small city nestled in the appalacian mts., thus having lots of hills and valleys.  it was atop one of these hills that my story begins.  i remember being with two of my friends in a section of town called pleaseant valley.  we were invited to go to a girls house, because she liked one of my friends and her parents were'nt home.  while we were there my friend \"jon\" and i went out on her 2nd floor deck to smoke cigarettes and leave them alone.  it was then that i looked up and saw what i can only now describe as well the single largest object that i have ever seen.  and to think that this thing was flying is astonishing.  at first, i just noticed stars disappearing and then parts of clouds.  i told \"jon\" to look up too, and although i took his eyes a while to focus on the object, for it was jet black, he said in his slow norther drawl, and i will always remeber this, \"what the f*%k is that thing!\"  next thing i did was call into the house for my lucky friend and his female companion.  my sheer excitement made them come rushing out and just as they reached the deck the object was flying over the sunken space between two hills.  in this sunken area sits a lowes hardware store.  lowes lit up the night sky and the valley like a beacon in the night, as it has until the recent development of a mall at the top of the very hill it rests beneath.  but for the first time we could really see the object.  it was massive, dark, overbearing, silent, frightening.  this was not your usual sighting.  no lights, no supersonic speed,no sound, nothing.  it just moved silently through the night sky swallowing it up as it passed.  it was truely amazing.  in the light, what we did see was also very unusual.  the front came to a point, while the back was squared off.  underneath, there was large structers that hung down, while dented crater shaped areas pocked the bottom.  other than that, there was no more detail about the object i can report for certain.  eventually it just glided away, the same way it came, soundless, lightless, and very very slowly.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

returning and coming out of the park, back at the beginning of the trail, after a 2hrs round trip hike. the trail here appears as a dirt road, getting into the park from mule deer drive. the way we were coming out of the park, this section of the trail (a couple of hundred yards), goes relatively steeply downhill, facing west and pikes peak. we were admiring the sunset sky and the beautiful view next to home. despite the cold, the day has been nice and sunny, then it turned overcast later and we were glad we got out for a hike. as we were coming down this last section of the trail, i noticed a strange light, appearing approximately as a horizontal segment of light, against the evening sky, just above the saddle to the south, in the skyline of pikes peak. i hiked pikes peak (14,110ft., or 14,115ft. lately) about half dozen times and i recognize the profile of the peak and its skyline. on top there is the cog train station, a meteo station and a few poles. from where i was (near mule deer entrance in ute valley park), the light was to the west. the white light (like that of a headlight) was significantly to the left of the peak, from my vantage point - that is, south of the peak. it was shaped like a horizontal segment. initially i thought that might be the landing lights of a plane, facing in our direction, though i have never seen anything like that, in that position (i live in the area for seven years and i have a view of pikes peak from home). the size was not right (it was way too large), given the apparent distance. the intensity of the light seemed way too much for a few headlights, even those of a plane, given the apparent distance to them. plus, the light was not moving, which was unusual if it came from a plane. the light seemed to might have moved slightly around, but remained approximately in the same position. initially, the light appeared like a stronger source of light, not circular or star-like, but more linear, oriented horizontally. it appeared larger than the apparent size of the cog train station, plus it was located clearly south of pikes peak (left of the peak, from my vantage point). the sky was quite bright, after the sunset, when we first noticed the light. initially, my friend thought it might be a star, but the light looked quite different from a twinkling star. it gradually looked more and more different than the point-like source of light (like stars are). the sky was also getting gradually darker. the light slowly appeared like the top sketch (\"obs 1\") shown in file attached. it was not a clear, big image, but that\\'s how it appeared to me, after it started simpler, as a horizontally oriented, linear source of white light. about a couple of minutes later, the light appeared to me as shown in the second sketch (\"obs 2\") in the attached file. i was trying hard to explain away what i was seeing, but i could not, so i tried to observe the sight as well as i could. images in the attached file show what i saw with the naked eye. we rushed home - i wanted to grab a pair of binoculars - where we arrived at h17:50 mst. the snow and ice on the road slowed us down. as we were exiting ute valley park (towards mule deer drive) and losing elevation, the light disappeared below and behind the mountains / pikes peak skyline. i grabbed two pairs of binoculars from home and rushed back to ute valley park. by this time (about h18:00 mst), the sky was dark and i saw no light in that particular region of the sky. i did see other stars in the sky, but no light like the one i have seen earlier. this sighting remains unexplained to me.","distance":"Over One

night sky. i called for my neighbors to come out and see a ufo. they immediately came and out and  i told them where to look. a bright white, cigar shaped object, traveling nnw to sse at a high altitude and great speed, was visible. it was visible until it dropped past the horizon line. it made no sound, no changes in direction, and no contrails were observed. my neighbors brought a digital camera outside with them and took a photo of it. we all agreed that whatever it was, it was unique to anything we had ever seen before. that's when i learned of the photo.We then downloaded the pic into my computer and opened it. to our surprise, it showed even stranger things.The object was \"fishook\" shaped, with a black field surrounding it, and some kind of aura outside of that. i then decided to enhance and rotate it for a better perspective view. the results are even stranger still. we were all 3 in awe and amazement as we watched it cross the sky and after an initial \"wow, what's that\" we watched in silence until it was gone from view. object was brighter than any star and didn't look like any satellite. it is hard to estimate an overall size, but it was between  1/8\"-1/4\" long to the naked eye, and was at a high altitude. there were no other aircraft visible in the sky, which was totally devoid of cloud cover, with an unlimited range of visibility. all 3 of us are amazed that it hasn't been mentioned on any news, and don't believe we could be the only 3 people who saw it. i have filed reports with ufoseek, nuforc, and komu news which is the local nbc

talk to anytone.  he has the power of mind control over me and my family. or anyone else, i have seen him do amazing things with physisists at nasa.  he never has sex with me, he is only a roommate, the same with my sister.  they are  trying to kill us off.  they treat us like children, commanding we do what they say, and then they interrupt any conversation we have so we can't talk.  my sister had her throat cut up 3 times and she no longer can talk, she is on life support for oxygen to live, she is dying and she can't speak, all my family has disappeared.If anyone comes to see me at my home, he dies.  i have had 32 deaths of people in my family and friends who have died after contact with me.  many many suicides.  my sister tried to commit suicide, my daughter tried to commit suicide my neice tried to kill herself, her baby and her fetus.  my granddaughterr had 4 abortions, killing 4 of my family.  many many suicide have i learned of since being with him.  i fear he will kill me too eventually, he tried to strangle me once and none of my family can sleep at night.  we all stay awake at night.  they have invaded texas and are immigrating here, replacing us with clones of us.  the government is cooperating with them and won't help me or my family, i have tried hundreds of times to get help on the kidnappings of my kids, and the law won't help me.\r\ndkimmons@aol.Com","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

south of san jose we turned onto hwy 152 to go to hwy 99 (this was before hwy 5 existed).  as we drove east on hwy 152 we were just west of the town of los banos.  the area was mostly farmland and cattle ranches.  george was driving.  i was looking up at the partly cloudy sky when i saw something through the front window.  it was darting into and out of several clouds.  i said, \"george! look up there, i think i see a ufo in the clouds!\"  i was pointing and george saw it too.  it spent several seconds in a cloud then darted to another cloud.  it visited many dozens of clouds over a wide expanse of the sky.  we both saw it and were a bit freaked out, hoping it wouldn't stop us or abduct us.  there were hardly any other cars out and we decided to not stop and get out, but to just continue on. at one point the flying saucer hovered over some cattle grazing adjacent to us which is when we got a very good look at it.  it was classic flying saucer shaped with a bubble on top and on the bottom. both our mouths were wide open.  i can't recall most of what we said to each other at this time.  time seemed to slow down.  then as it darted into a cloud about 1500' high which was close to being overhead, george had his head out the window as he looked up and i had my head on the dashboard looking up.  we both saw it dart up towards outer space in a southerly direction at a rate of speed so great, that any human being aboard would surely have died from the g forces exhibited. i have never seen anything move that fast before or since. it may have left a \"comtrail\" but i can't recall for sure. george and i are still friends to this day, but we haven't talked about what we saw together for a long time.  i frankly don't recall how much he still remembers but i intend to call him when he returns from his vacation to ask him.  i'm not sure what county los banos is in but i think its san benito.

so in the evening. i was bored and was on my parents sofa on my knees looking out our window that faced north... my arms were folded on the back of the sofa with my chin resting on my arms... i use to like to look out of this window at night as there was an old train depot north of town that i could see from this window..\r\n \r\ni had been looking out of the window probably for 2 or 3 minutes looking at the train depot when my eyes glanced upward... still looking north and i thought...\"wow the moon is perfectly round and orange tonight and it was the biggest that i had ever seen the moon...I stared at what i thought was the moon for a good minute then happened to look off to the northwest and saw the actual moon which was bright in the sky as it was a clear night... i then looked back at the orange object and noticed how perfectly round it was and it was a deep dark orange in color... i watched it another good minute or two... the size of the object was probably about 1 1/2 times bigger than a normal full moon. \r\nthen all of a sudden this orange object shot off and stopped ...It then appeared to be about half of the size as when i first saw it ...It stayed in this location for about 2 seconds...Shot off again...Looked to be about an 1/8 of the original size...Then shot off again and disappeared...\r\n \r\nthe speed this thing was traveling at reminded me of  when on the old tv series startrek the enterprise would take off and quickly disappear into space...\r\n \r\nthe strangest thing about this was that i remember that i must have been staring right at the object when i first looked out of the window but didn't realize it until all of a sudden i was looking right at it...I guess i must have been daydreaming to not see it right way because all of a
