walked out of my room, and, due to the fact i had seen what appeared to be flying saucers in the sky for 2 weeks prior, i decided i should look out the window and see. then, over the hills of conway, wa, i saw an extremely bright light hovering by a radio tower. even before noticing it's very odd movements, i recognized the light to be just like the previous craft i had seen. it was incredibly bright, like a star, but bigger. it also appeared to have a crescent shape to the light, as though part of it were darkened, exactly like the previous lights. after noticing it, i watched carefully it's position in the sky compared to the hillside. i am a trained aircraft observer, so i am certain it was no aircraft i have ever seen. i saw it begin to move in insect-like patterns, to my surprise, exactly like the last sightings. i had recently returned from flight training in california, and was staying with my parents. my mother had been very skeptical about my previous sightings, so i went quickly to get her. she came upstairs to the window with me, and i had her watch while it moved in strange ways, darting hundreds of meters in random directions. i believe seeing this made her uncomfortable, so she left after trying to disregard the lights as a helicopter. after she left, i watched as the light suddenly dissappeared, then reappeared about a mile to the south, much closer to my house. i grabbed binoculars, and looked at it. to my shock, it was a saucer, like the other ones. i watched through the binoculars as it moved strangely again. i ran quickly to get my mother, so she could join in the craziness. i flashed my phone lights at it, like i had previously done. it seemed to flash back the same pattern. it's response was unnecessarily bright. being an airman, seeing that while flying would have been highly distracting, and no aircraft i know of would have any reason to flash lights so bright. \r\nafter this, there appeared a second light, brighter than the first. it moved around, and then stayed in place for the remainder of the event. while it was moving, the first light appeared to eject several smaller lights out of it. upon exiting the craft, the smaller lights were either too dim to see, or they simply dissappeared.\r\nshortly after, the first saucer moved below the treeline, and slowly continued south. upon doing so, 3 equally bright saucer shaped craft appeared by the radio tower, about a mile north from the current position of the lights. i was very shocked to see this. they began to move in a steady path to the area where the other 2 lights were. both my mother and my sister were now watching. next, i saw something i cannot accurately describe. the light furthest to the north was very big.  it was moving slower than a helicopter, and had flashing lights brighter than the moon. i can only relate it to how a police car flashes its siren lights, but only with the color white. it was like a diamond. or, perhaps the flashing of the lights made it appear that way. if i had been flying close to that light, i would have been blinded. nothing i can think of even relates to the light i saw, other than a flying saucer. this strange object continued to the south, and dissappeared behind some tall trees. there were 3 remaining lights above the horizon for a while, then they vanished in an instant and left only the 2nd brightest of the objects in the sky. it remained there, pulsating for quite some time. i remember that my final observations were recorded at 11:45 pm. i went to sleep that night with a flying

something like this.\r\n\r\n*message to investigator, not for website*\r\ni apologise for not submitting this sooner. i did not know how to describe what i saw, and i was bewildered. then i went to the san juan islands for a week. i am now back and am devoting myself fully to further investigation. we should request radar data asap. i have some sightings from march 10th-16th that we should also request radar data for. time of sightings were all from 8:30pm to 12 am. thank you, i look forward to hearing from you.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

(we did not notice anything strange at that time though.) all of us were sitting/standing around the fire and talking, laughing, etc when i started to hear \"something\" in the sky. for the first second i thought nothing of it, but it almost instantaneously got very very loud and sounded very very close (about 2 blocks away). i can't describe or understand how it got so close so fast. we were in a very rural area away from airports or city commotion so one would expect to hear any vehicle approaching from far away before it sounded as close as it did sound. there was no sound of anything approaching until it was that close. my friends heard the same noise which was so odd and disrupting that it caused us all to stop talking and look around at one another slightly puzzled. i remember my boyfriend joking \"what is that, a flying lawnmower?\" it was a very good description of the sound. none of us had an explanation for the sound, it was very obviously not commonplace. it also sounded like it was very low in the sky , just a few hundred feet maybe. the loudness and closeness of the sound gave me that impression. it sounded unlike any commercial airplane i've heard. i thought of the possibility of a small private plane but it sounded so low for so consistently long that i no longer thought that was possible after a few minutes. the sound also sounded just completely unlike any regular engine i've heard but familiar in some ways as well. at first this sound kept going slightly farther away and then coming closer as if it were going back and forth in a straight line, maybe about the distance of a block, that was perpendicular to our location. that was when one of my friends suggested that it could be a streetsweeper. but everyone including myself and the property owner thought it sounded like it was in the air. (also i had lived around that area for 5 years and never heard of or seen a street sweeper whatsoever. i am not sure they're even used on these very rural roads outside of town.) the sound continued for about 5 minutes and then it sounded as if it were constantly changing direction. it was moving around, kind of randomly at first, a lot. i couldn't hear a pattern to decipher what is was trying to do or where it was going at first. but then it started sounding as if it were flying a circle around us that tapered-in closer and closer to us each rotation like a spiral. it was clearly in the sky above us, tree-top level. and it was obviously it was circling our general location (which is just forest). these actions continued for an additional 5 minutes until the object sounded like it was right over our location above the canopy. it sounded like it hovered there for several seconds or a minute before moving away and eventually stopped, ,though this exact information is foggier than the rest for some reason.  i cant remember how it left or what it sounded like when it did leave. i cant remember if it abruptly stopped or sounded like it flew away from the area completely like a common airplane would do. i don't remember exactly what happened after it sounded like it was above us. only in writing this report am i realizing i don't remember that exact part. since none of us had any answers and nothing had actually resulted from the sound, we just got back to our regular socializing/bonfire activities after the sound went away and after discussing for a few minutes how odd that all was. i'd also like to mention that none of us did anything when this whole thing was happening, we continued to sit/stand in our positions around the campfire and we just were basically waiting to figure out what was happening while looking at each other, and up in the air, confused. during this whole experience i had started to get a little anxious when the sound continued for more than the initial few minutes and got more anxious as it drew even closer to us. i was a bit worried and scared when i realized that the object sounded like it was changing direction with virtually no effort. and that it seemed to be circling around our location. the sound was going on for so long without anyone being able to rationalize it, that i did eventually feel like i was just sitting waiting for \"something to happen,\" a very suspenseful feeling. (i would also like to note that i'm getting anxiety writing this report having to mentally go back to that night.) i did definitely think \"ufo. aliens.\" and we all suggested that possibility during this, though hesitantly and with an  \"oh that's silly, haha, hopefully we're joking\" kind of attitude. we were all unsettled by it. i also remember wondering if this was some sort of new police drone investigating what was going on with our bonfire in the woods. this is an area near niagara falls and the boarder to canada, so i thought maybe boarder patrol would have technology like drones or something. i also am aware that there is some type of air force base in the general niagara falls, n.Y. area. i was trying to rationalize what i heard but it was very hard to do so. none of us ever saw lights in the sky of any kind. another friend who was there did also suggest the drone possibility. it was the best answer that any of us came up with. this was suggested based on the elevation (tree-top), lack of lights, lack of ascent, apparent interest in our specific random location and activities, and amazing capacity to seemingly move in any direction at any moment, at slow to very fast speeds, without ever seeming to ascend or descend.  none of us could ever see anything, though we were under pretty thick canopy of trees where we couldn't even really see stars. and we were around a decently sized bonfire which probably contributed to our night-blindness.   the final thing i would like to mention here is to make note of what happened less than 12 hours after this event when i went back to my place of residence. i had a contact experience with an actual entity. i am going to make an additional report about that after i place this one. i'm putting them in two separate reports because i can't directly relate them to one another and i have no proof that they are related except for the \"alien\" aspect of both events and the close proximity of time in which they occurred. they are very different events though, which, again, is why i'm separating the reports.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

we watched the total eclipse of the moon from the staples shopping center. when that ended, around 9:00 p.M., we headed home in our car. we were near the top of pearl street, heading west towards lake champlain, when the event happened. from there we had a clear view of the lake, the adirondack mountains, and the sky above them. suddenly, a very bright whitish/pale-yellow sphere of light came into view on the far left. \r\n\r\nthe sphere was moving slowly across the sky in front of us. for most of the time we watched it, it was moving in a straight line, parallel to the lake, from south to north. just before we lost sight of it, it seemed to be moving in a slight downward arc. from where we were observing, it appeared to be just above the mountains, and to be about the size the sun looks at midday. it had a thick trail of bright whitish/pale-yellow sparks behind it that was so long that at one point the sphere plus the tail stretched across about two-thirds of our view. this tail was coming from the whole left half of the sphere, and coming to a point at the end, forming a cone, like an ice-cream cone, with the sphere itself the ice-cream. the right (forward) side of the sphere emitted no sparks or flame. we heard no noise. we estimate the total time elapsed to be about 30 seconds from the time the sphere first appeared to our left until it disappeared from our view. \r\n\r\nas soon as we got home, about 3 minutes later, i wrote down all the details of the sighting and called a local radio station to report it. the station wasn't interested. we then called the police, who took down the report. the police called us back. they had called the airport and been told nothing had been observed and that it must have been a meteorite. it wasn't a meteorite. it

in my hot tub. i glanced up at the sky and noticed what i assumed was a plane traveling from south to north (towards me).  as it got closer i noticed 5 or perhaps 6 solid orange lights on the front of the craft. the sides of the craft had blue and white flashing lights. as i continued watching trying to figure out what it was i was seeing the craft stopped moving and began hovering directly over me. by then the sky was darker and i couldn't make out the shape of the craft i could only see the lights.  it stayed in that position for several minutes so my instinct was to wave, so i did and a few seconds later it turned off slightly to the east. i thought it was leaving until it then backed up and repositioned itself directly overhead again. it stayed hovering for a few more minutes so naturally i waved again and once again the craft began moving only this time it curved off to the west and then reversed directly back overhead. \r\n\r\nat this point i knew this was something highly unusual and i was getting both nervous and anxious and wanted my family members who were in the house to come out to witness whatever this was. still keeping my eyes on this craft i got out of the hot

when i lived a few hours from here, i had a very close encounter with a triangle ufo that dropped straight down very quickly out of the sky above me, while i was in my car.  it hovered above me about 20-25 feet in the air, was silent, and i was terrified.  i instinctively started praying and when the thought occurred to me to grab my cell phone and try to take a photo of it, i found myself too frightened to take my eyes off of the ufo to look for my phone.  i had this fear that if i took my eyes off of it for even a second, something was going to happen to me.  it doesn't seem like it all lasted more than 30 seconds or so, but i can't really be sure because i wasn't paying attention to what time it was before the incident.  i just know it was sometime between 10-10:30 p.M.  the triangle had a red light in the center that was lit the entire time, and it had white circular lights on the underside corners of the triangle.  suddenly it shot up straight in the air at a high rate of speed and made a sudden dart off to my right and it was gone.  i never had believed in ufos prior to that, but that experience changed my whole perspective on things.  i had afterward seen photos of the triangle ufos from the belgian wave and that's what it looked like, however, this triangle was very small in comparison.  the triangle i saw was probably about 18-20ft on each of its sides.  since i was looking up at it above me, i have no idea how tall the craft was because i could only see it from the bottom.  i shared with my father, best friend, and some others what i had seen.  \r\n\r\nbetween the triangle sighting in 2010 that i had, up until my abduction on october 17, 2016, to my knowledge i didn't have any et contact or any other incidents.  in february 2013, i moved to fairfax.  \r\n\r\nabduction incident 10/17/16 :\r\n\r\n(this is my initial memory.  a mufon person recommended a hypnotist that i went to see, because i knew i had missing time because there was a lapse in my memory that didn't make sense).\r\n\r\nthe abduction:\r\n\r\nmy husband had left to go to work shortly after 4:00 a.M. i'm a very light sleeper and i heard someone come in the back door (it had been locked).  initially i thought maybe my husband had returned, but i quickly realized that it was not the sound of his footsteps walking across the wooden floor in the living area.  it didn't even sound like normal human footsteps (it was a shuffling sound instead of normal footsteps), and i could tell that it was not just one individual.  somehow i knew then what it was, but i also told myself it couldn't be and must be an intruder. our bedroom door is a set of french doors that connects to that living area, and i was laying in bed on my left side with my back to them.  i quickly decided that i would wait until the sound of the intruders opening the french doors because i knew i only had a matter of seconds, and then i would jump up out of the bed and fight.  the problem was that i didn't hear the french doors opening (they must have walked right through them instead of opening them) and before i knew what was going on, 3 individuals/bodies were holding me down on the bed on my side, one of them had pinned down my right arm, and they were dragging me off of the bed, sheets and all.  it was very hard for me to get my right arm free but i did and i started fighting and punching them as much and as hard as i could.  i made contact with the bottom of my fist on one of them a few times and i remember that it felt almost like i was hitting a rubbery tire like material, but it wasn't as dense of a material as a tire is.  it was like a mix of flesh and rubber.  they suddenly let me go and i got my feet under me (they had dragged me half off the side of the bed).  i was a mix of terrified and really pissed off.  my room was pitch dark but i could sense them about 5-6 feet away watching me.  i was so scared that i didn't dare turn the lamp on next to the bed because i honestly did not want to see them.  i stayed sitting up on my bed for several seconds because i was afraid that if i laid back down they would try to overpower me and take me again, and i was catching my breath from fighting.  part of me also wanted them to see me sitting there and know that i was going to fight them if they tried it again.  the next thing that i can recall, i was laying down and had just started to pray, and then my memory goes blank.  it's been bothering me because i know as scared and angry as i was, i wouldn't have just laid down like that, let alone i would not have been able to fall asleep for hours after that.  after the blank part of my memory, the next thing that i remember is my alarm going off in the morning to wake me up for work.  i noticed that i had a lot of pain and soreness all over my body, almost like severe aching muscles and joints from a bad flu, however, i was not sick and did not get sick after that.  i felt like i had a lot of bloating and inflammation in my body as well, and had a bad headache.  i felt like i had been poisoned or something, and it took approximately 2 weeks to recover from the physical effects.  when i saw things that had been knocked on the floor by the bed during the fight with them earlier, i just began crying because it was a reminder that what had happened was real.  i called my husband and told him about it.  even though i couldn't see them due to it being so dark in the room, i could tell by the way the 3 of them were laying across my body putting pressure on me and dragging me off of the bed that they were much smaller creatures than me.  i feel like they were thin to medium build,and probably only around 4.5 feet tall.\r\n\r\nsince i was a light sleeper, before this incident, all the lights had to be off in the house for me to sleep and if my husband was staying up watching tv or anything, the slightest noise would keep me awake and bother me.  now, to even try to sleep i have to have the outside light on, some inside lights on, and the tv on with the volume up some...My husband was shocked to see this because he knows that before this incident, i couldn't stand the slightest noise or any lights being on because i was such a light sleeper.  i went through a period where if he wasn't here because he was out working, i was too scared to sleep on my left side with my back to the french doors anymore.  i went through months where since it would be dark when i came home from work, if my husband wasn't already home, i would call him and stay on the phone with him until i got safely inside of the house.  if he was busy, i would call my kid or someone else so that at least i was on the phone with someone as i was walking from my car into the house.  because this incident caused me so much anxiety, i ended up getting an anti-anxiety medication from my doctor to take at night to help me sleep and help lessen my anxiety because i was so afraid of them coming back.  i told my doctor it was for another reason.\r\n\r\ni'm going to now include the info from the hypnosis session, then i will explain the physical affects this abduction had on me and what i've had to go through because of it.\r\n\r\nhypnosis session:\r\n\r\ni went for my hypnosis appointment on 11/19/16.  under hypnosis i was able to fill in the gap that i had. if you recall, after i was fighting with them as they were pulling me off the bed, they let go and i was sitting on the bed trying to catch my breath with my feet on the floor. i could sense them in the dark standing about 5 feet away from me and i was very angry and very scared at the same time. originally my memory jumped from this, to me laying on my pillow praying and suddenly falling asleep.  what happened in between was missing, and i knew it didn't make sense that i would go from fighting and terrified to suddenly going to sleep like nothing happened.  normally, even if i just have a stressful or bad dream that wakes me, it may take me over an hour to fall back asleep, sometimes 2 hours because my adrenaline and everything has me so awake that it takes a significant amount of time to settle back down.\r\n\r\nunder hypnosis i was able to recall that as i sat on the bed i could sense that they were surprised i had fought them the way i did.  i heard their feet coming across the carpet toward me. i saw a very bright, very neon purple light.  it was almost like they were holding a small lighted wand of sorts.  the next thing i remembered under hypnosis was suddenly getting very calm and sleepy.  the light changed my whole mood state and made me not care what was going on...I just became passive and docile.  i remember being floated horizontal and i didn't really care anymore because it was like i was drugged and i was very groggy.  they floated me through the house and outside to a craft.  the next thing i remembered was feeling someone holding my arm and i was in a white room with a round dome type of ceiling. it wasn't a big room, it was somewhat small. i had a very hard time trying to keep my eyes open because i was so groggy. the being holding my arm was shaped like a grey about 4.5 feet tall, but was a light colored--pinkish/kind of fleshy colored being. it wasn't the grey color i've seen on tv. it had big black eyes like a grey, and i remembered it had some large, thick wrinkles. the alien on the cover of the book, \"communion,\" looks most like the beings i saw, just mine had more wrinkles on it's face and i could see small veins on the side of the one's head that was holding my arm.  i felt a pain in my neck and started to feel very heavy and couldn't move. i could feel a rush in my brain and got a bad medicine type of taste in my mouth that was bitter and my tongue felt tingly. this one grey was holding my arm and i felt love from it and that it didn't want me to feel alone. the sense of love it telepathically conveyed to me was very strong, and i haven't ever experienced feeling love that strong before.  the fingers of the being holding my wrist were very long, and the bone structure of the fingers reminded me of the texture of these light plastic, flexible nerf darts my son had as a kid for his old nerf dart gun.  the bones in the fingers were a different density and texture than ours.  i felt the other two beings down by my legs and felt some pressure and cramping in my uterus because they seemed to be looking for something/doing an exam, but then i went unconscious. the next thing i remembered was the sensation of starting to move again waking me up, as they were levitating me out of the room in the direction of my feet. i was very, very groggy. i remember them floating me outside toward the house and it was cool outside and the wind felt good to me. all 3 beings were with me but only the one that had held my arm seemed to feel a connection to me, the other 2 seemed focused and rather detached. i'm an energy sensitive person and for some reason, i remember the one being that was loving and holding my wrist having an energy that reminded me of my maternal grandmother, who passed away before i could ask her about the ufos that had been landing behind her house.  they floated me through the back door without opening it and left me on my bed. i remembered still feeling numb and groggy and just being glad i could go back to sleep.\r\n\r\nwhile i was very angry about the way they initially tried to snatch me out of my bed, i got the sense during my experience that their intentions were actually good. i felt like the one loving being wanted me to know that they wanted people in the world to evolve and reconnect with who they really are because they feel like humanity has lost themselves. they want people to be more sensitive, empathetic, intuitive, and compassionate. i felt like they probably knew i wanted to get pregnant again so they were trying to intervene in some way. i'm not sure if that would be by somehow genetically altering my eggs, or what their method is.  (in july and august 2016 my husband and i had been going through a fertility clinic because he had some fertility issues and they wanted to test me and be sure i didn't have any.  all of my hormone levels were excellent when they tested them, and they also did an ultrasound of my ovaries on the 2nd day of my cycle and said that at my age, they would expect and be happy with seeing 10 developing egg follicles...Well i had 23.  they told me that my ovaries were, \"rocking like someone in their 20's.\"  this is important to note because this was in august, and after my abduction in october, my reproductive system developed major issues, that ended up requiring me to have surgery in february this year.   \r\n\r\nwrapping up the hypnosis piece, the next memory i had was waking up later that morning when my alarm went off, and crying when i saw things knocked on the floor from the initial fight i had with them, because it brought back the trauma of them trying to snatch me from my bed. i then called my husband crying that morning and told him what happened.\r\n\r\ngynecological problems start:\r\n\r\nthe abduction was october 17th, and in november, i had a very light period which was abnormal for me.  i had taken a pregnancy test prior to getting the light period...One of the ones that you can take several days before your period is due and that one was negative.  when i started getting my period, although it was light, i didn't bother taking any other pregnancy tests.  then in december, i woke up in the middle of the night passing a baseball to softball sized blood clot, and had to go to the emergency room.  they did an ultrasound at the hospital, and i talked to my gyno who told me that if i kept bleeding heavily to go to a different hospital because that's the hospital they work with.  which i ended up having to go there the same day because the bleeding wasn't slowing down.  when my gynecologist reviewed the ultrasound, he informed me that i wasn't bleeding from a period because i had no uterine lining to shed, it was all gone somehow and my uterus was just straight out bleeding out.  they had to stop the bleeding so they put me on a regimen of 5 birth control pills per day, tapering down over most of a week to doing one birth control pill a day.  \r\n\r\ni couldn't tell my doctor about my abduction event in october so i couldn't say anything when he thought that somehow my hormones (which had been perfect just months earlier when tested) had magically gotten suddenly whacked out, so he decided to treat me with hormones.  well, the bleeding stopped for just over 1 week and then started back up again.  the doctor tried tinkering with hormone doses, etc. to try and fix it, but the reality was that my problem wasn't due to hormones so no matter what he tried, it wasn't working.  eventually after about 8-9 weeks straight of bleeding, i became anemic and required emergency surgery.  i had an emergency d & c, where they go in and clean out everything from the uterus to try and restart my body's system.  when the doctor met with me in the recovery room, he showed me some color images of the inside of my uterus and showed me this white growth/substance that was in there and told me he was having it tested to be sure it wasn't a cancerous growth or infection.  it wasn't cancer or an infection when test results came back.  what was it?  who knows?  i think that whatever the ets did to me, my uterus was trying to expel whatever didn't belong in there and it just couldn't do it,, that's why i kept bleeding and bleeding and ended up having to have the surgery to empty it all out.  \r\n\r\nmy father and my deceased maternal grandmother also had contact with ufos.","distance":"20 Feet or

was around 4 a.M and i had finished a movie on the couch with my husband but he fell asleep. once it ended i went to the door to have a cigarette before bed. we lived in a basement apartment and our door was ground level at the rear of the house facing south with a small backyard about 15-20ft deep with 3 large tree lining the edge backing onto bush and swamp. when i opened our big door and looked out the screen door (which had glass at the top and screen at the bottom) i typically open the screen door a bit and set the bar to hold it and stick half of my body outside to have a cigarette. as soon as i set the bar and looked up i immediately noticed 3 large glowing lights hovering in the very top of those 3 trees. 2 white ones were in the two left trees and 1 red one in the tree on the right. i was taken off guard a bit and figured it was a reflection from the stove or microwave so i concluded that if i moved or blocked the light the light would go away so desperately i ran into my bedroom which had a huge picture window right next to the door i was poking out of, if it was truly a reflection i'd see nothing in a dark room?. so i peaked out of the blinds and there they were. i was blown away so i ran back out into the living room and looked again. for some reason i cannot understand why i didn't wake my husband to show him, it was like i was i  a state of shock or like everything around me froze and i forgot about him. this time when i looked out the door it was still open a little bit so i stuck my head out and all of a sudden i had this overwhelming feeling of being exposed and just as i jumped to shut the door in fear i could make out multiple beings walking around in the backyard eith 2 of them coming towards me at th3 door. but the way they moved was strange like in 1 place 1 seco d then another the next. i freaked and slammed both doors shut and ran to grab my video camera and ran into my bedroom to record. when i looked out i could still see them, it scared me so much i couldn't handle the though of opening the blinds so i set my camera up and stuck it in the blinds. by this time it was probably around 4:30-5:00 a.M and i was wide awake in a state of panic in a half seated position at the edge of the middle of my bed (bed was against the wall with large picture window spanning entire bed) holding the camera in the blinds recording and taking the odd terrifying peak, when all of a sudden i'm waking up and it's sunny out! only then i realized i was sitting or half falling off the end of my bed very awkwardly and the camera was on top of my dresser. i grabbed it immediately to review the footage. first 2 playbacks were nothing and the third was only 30 seconds of blackness. i was devastated. then it was like reality snapped back in and i looked up and it was 7:30 in the morning! fyi i cannot just fall asleep sitting up or not in a bed laying down comfortably so the odds that i just passed out are highly unfavorable because it has not happenned since. so i barreled out of the room to tell my husband and i couldn't not speak fast enough i was in a total moment of panic and anxiety. the first thing he asked is why i did not wake him and to this day i'm so mad i didn't but i can't figure out why. i 4emem er looking right at him laying there sleeping when i first seen the objects then it was like time around me was frozen but i was still i  real time.\r\nprior to that experience myself my husband and our at the time 3 years old daughter would see strange lights moving erratically always flashing white and red in inconsistent patterns. we live under a flight path and are used to seeing planes and small water planes or helicopters pass over but these flew much differently and very low also typically sighted and remained in the same area. after the experience the sightings got more intense. walking the dog i would spot a large light or craft that would seem to stalk me. my husband would often notice lights following him while driving home from work. i'd go out into my driveway to see the stars with my daughter and end up always having a sighting till 1 night i put out the garbage and a red light about twice the size of a yoga ball hovering above the middle of the road very low and i looked directly at it and yelled \"go away!\" quite a few times and returned inside. after that we would rarely see them and we're never stalked again. though i do fear and am almost certain we are still visited, since over the past year ive had a few very strange vivid dreams that almost seem like memories of being on board a craft with my husband, tons of other humans gathered in a large room with multiple entities, some larger ones in robes at the front watching, and others walking around when 1 female entity comes over and takes my husband by the hand and escorted him to a private room, to briefly cover it....\r\ni am aware there are no answers to these strange events but am more concerned finding out if there were any related sightings or experiences in my area around that time and about my story bein documented for research, ect...\r\nps: i almost forgot to mention the area on trees that the ufos were hovering in seemed to be affected and the top of the trees died, exacly within the top of it.The white ufo that placed itself in the farthest tree had to have the entire top cut down last fall and you can clearly see in the photo the damaged area of the top of the tree that the red ufo was in.","distance":"20 Feet or
