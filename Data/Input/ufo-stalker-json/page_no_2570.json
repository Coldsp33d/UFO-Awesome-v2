(i used the horizontal blinds as a means to measure the movement of this \"star\").  this star or object moved unlike any airplane or helicopter.  in an up-down, zig-zag motion this object moved in a southwestardly direction.  it was at this time i got up from my bed and moved closer to my window.  i moved the horizontal blinds as to not obstruct my vision.  the object was actually pulsating and would appear larger and brighter at times, and actually went from a whitish color to a more amber color when it was at its largest.  the object continued to move in a southwestardly direction all the while it \"pulsed\".  the pulses seemed rythmic, and continued, as it moved for about 3 minutes.  i had to look away from time to time over the three minutes, as to make sure the object was actually moving in this unusual manner.  i used other stationary stars as a means to determine the movement of this object.  it is important to note that at end of this sighting i had a feeling that \"it\" was aware, that i was aware of its presence.  it was unlike any experience i have ever had.  i was not scared, but more like a feeling of not being alone.  i felt like it knew i was watching it.  this whole experience lasted about 3 minutes.  the object simply pulsated and then disappeared.  no one was with me when i saw this object.  my dogs were on my bed with me but seemed unaffected by it.  once the object disappeared, i immediately got online and looked up ufo sightings in utah, more specifically moab.  after about 1 1/2 hours of research online i went back to bed around 4a.M.  it was when i woke up again around 7am i decided i would try to contact elaine douglas of mufon. it is important to note that my home phone (land line) was working without incident, however beginning this morning there is alot of static with little to no volume.  i will be calling fronteir communications to rectify the problem, but could the object i saw last night disrupted my phone service?  i live in a rural community, so i do not want to start asking neighbors if they saw this object last night.  i certainly saw something unlike any other in the sky last night.  i hope this detailed account helps anyone interested.  i will make sure to look in the sky tonight in the same direction to see if it returns.","distance":"Over One

because i thought i saw a plane in the air but had some unique festive like red, white and green bright lights. the object was estimated to be 50 feet above the tree tops, hovered slowly, with no engine sounds. it would make a complete stop and then continue slowly south east. ok..Festive lights on a airplane is possible but i can not give a good description because it alsmost seemed foggy er transparent but did notice 2 long pole like objects attached to it. the second sighting was at 8:30 p.M.\r\n\r\nunfortunately there are no witness that i know of. usually the winter in ohio is windy and cold but it's been warm and calm. that night the sky was clear, calm and with a full moon. i called it festive because the lights had no pattern to distingish. a light that was once red would turn green or white or skip and stay green when it was exsposed to turn red. it was not a normal aircraft light pattern. it did have three main areas that the lights seemed to come from. \r\n\r\nback in the summer of 2001 i had another sighting of a triangle shaped what ever it was crossing over head while i was camping in kirkersville, ohio. i stood there with my jaw dropped until it passed behind the trees. the sad part was that the three other friends i was with went to get more beer while i watched the fire when it happened and i never said anything. this time it just bothered me so much

air planes,satalites shooting stars and such on the lake  quiet you can here and see propeller planes in the area of  1-4 miles away no problem.At approx 1:40am this constant orange light  over near larkin point(south shore)slowly moved towards the lake no sound. i thoght it was the local sheriff helicopter at first but once it was over water only 1/2 mile from us there was still no sound and i knew it was not the sheriff helicopter there is other lights  on the bottom of the chopper. this object moved appropx 3 miles in 40 minutes we stared at this object in total curiosity not afraid or anything.The object i can only say was a large light 20-30 feet across the light was constant not a strobe. watching this was more exiting than the fishing(nothing biting) after sitting not catching any thing we decided to call it a nite,the object was in line between us and the boat launch i say to my friend we will go under it on the way in (it now hovering over the lake) we were only 3/4 from the launch.As we headed in this object went in reverse  from a stopped position i was moving slow at first it moved slow as we headed init took it same flight path back inland  we only go as close as 1/4 mile still no sound it went back over land inland 1/2 mile or so. now were approching the boat launch not taking our eyes off it for a split second and it was gone. i have seen many aviation

late afternoon; to the best of my recollection, the sun was just setting near the end of the events.\r\ni was in my backyard setting up binoculars for a coming evening of star-gazing and picking up around the yard. looking at the beautiful clear sky, i happened to notice what i recall as three \" glowing objects \" approaching from just south of east over the neighborhood. as a beginning amateur astronomer, i'd made a habit out of trying to guage sky conditions.\r\ni thought that these objects were either helicopters or some kind of hover -craft, and remember thinking that this sighting could be associated with the\r\noshkosh air show which i believed to be taking place at the time. these three\r\nobjects, however , put on quite a show for me! each of the three objects looked identical . the shape was roughly circular. the size was about the\r\nsize of a pencil viewed end-on at about 6\" from my eye. the color was an\r\nunvarying , glowing red-orange. the luminosity of the object was very striking.I could best describe the effect as blazing . the colored shape\r\ndid not have a distinct border , but rather seemed to emanate with an even\r\nlight that nevertheless had a \" fuzziness \" at it's outer edge . the actions\r\nof the objects were as follows: they approached in an organized looking\r\ngroup of three covering an area of 20 to 30 degrees in length, north to south, with rather even spacing between them. their altitude was demonstrated\r\nto me when, of all things, a commercial airliner , possibly making an approach to o'hara field , passed over the group of objects! i'm not sure about the timeframe of the next events ( in terms of how long after the\r\nairliner pass they took place), but i do remember the sequence of following\r\nevents.The southern most object slowly moved further south while not appearing to gain or lose altitude, until it was no longer visible due to\r\nbeing blocked by tree lines to the south. the next most northerly object\r\nhovered, and then began to gain altitude without any apparent east to west\r\nmotion. it simply seemed to ascend in place until it was no longer visible.\r\nthat left the third object, which seemed to pass directly over my backyard\r\nand neighborhood while maintaining a constant, slow speed and altitude.I\r\nwas able to view this object with tripod-mounted 10x binoculars arranged\r\nin such a way that i could view straight up while reclining in a lawn chair","distance":"501 Feet - 1

noticed the object/objects because i'm a retired air force flyer and always look up to see any air traffic in the area.  i can tell by the traffic if there's been a wind change at the airport requiring airplanes to use a different approach to the field.  there was no wind. \r\n\r\nthe object looked like two pale amber lights that appeared to be subdued by some sort of haze or fog.  but the sky was absolutely clear in every direction.  there was no street noise where i was standing but the object was completely silent.  it appeared to be only about 150 yards from me at the most.  it also appeared to be no higher than 500 feet agl, which would be an faa violation for any aircraft in this area.  if the craft was further away from me or higher than i thought then it was moving at an even more incredible speed and was much larger.  either the two lights were on the same craft or they were in perfect formation.  and they were exactly the same size.  they did not blink.\r\n\r\nthe object was moving towards the southeast at an extreme rate of speed.  i should've been able to hear something at that range if it were a normal aircraft.  as it passed my position it faded rapidly as if becoming somehow invisible.\r\n\r\nmy reaction to seeing this was a complete loss of situational awareness.  i had no idea what my dog was doing and just kept staring up even after this thing had disappeared, holding on to her leash.  i must've stared up at nothing for a full 5 minutes, which is pretty long just to stare at nothing.\r\n\r\nwhen i returned to my apartment my hands were shaking and my palms were sweating.  that thing just shouldn't have been there, and shouldn't have displayed those flight characteristics.  i guess it was shaking my reality a little bit.  it almost looked like it was semi-transparent, or enveloped in a fog or haze that moved with it.  i almost hate to make this reference, but the way it disappeared looked exactly the way a romulan ship looks when it's cloaking itself on star trek.  i should have been able to continue to observe this thing as it flew away, but it just faded out. it didn't just wink out...It faded out.","distance":"101-500

light and no clouds in the sky, aperfect blue. i noticed the a large loosely organized flock of blackbirds flying about particulary slowly, thinking it strange. the traffic was slowing for a stop light so i sat watching the birds looking northeast and then north, and that's when i saw the object.\r\ni watch the skies frequently and this object caught my attention. this is a regular path for the airport (perhaps eight miles to the ne of where i was stopped in traffic), but what i was watching didn't seem to be flying like a plane, as you would normally see.\r\nthe sun was quite low on the horizon, so the light was good. i rolled down my car window, so i could see without distortion. i just sat there and watched as the object traveled slowly --- not ascending, or dropping. it just seemed to cruising slowly, at an even height. no exhaust. no blinking lights. no apparent wings or tail fins. there did seem to be a darker marking at the east end -- but it wasn't protruding like a plane tail would.\r\nthe object was high enough that one needed to raise their eyes above the horizon, but low enough not to crane your neck and raise your head to see it. it was low enough that you couldn't see under it --- just the side of the object. for those familiar with omaha, it was on a course -- perhaps in a line following blondo street straight west (again, i was watching from 43rd and dodge).\r\ni wanted to pull off the road and watch it longer, but traffic and my location wouldn't allow.\r\nrushing up to my apartment, i let my food get cold as i called the number on the omaha mufon sight, which happened to be a number in colorado. i spoke with james and he suggested i fill out this form.\r\nhope others saw it. the first thing that came to james' mind was a blimp, but it didn't look that fat. \r\ni was quite excited after seeing the object and wanted to yell to others stopped at the light to look, but it was chilly and everyone had their windows rolled up. the first thing that came to my mind, was rush home and report the sighting. after traffic started moving i continued east, the object continued west. i lost sight of it because of the trees in my neighborhood blocked the view when i was able to stop again.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

77, after she noticed the object in the sky. we watched until it faded, or, as i think of it, blended in with the sky. the object flew slower than a jetliner, was very long and seemed to be in rectangular sections that were stepped or tiered. there were several lights on the object. some were bright, as at the nose and amidship about 3/4 of the way back, and some were dull, but they appeared to be individual lights. i remember one being blue, and it had one bright white blinking light. no red lights were present. it seemed to me that the lights reflected a highly polished chrome-like surface that was difficult to make out because it seemed to take on or highly reflect the color of the dark sky. the lights on the body made the object stand out and suggested its shape of being tiered rectangular sections. it flew north to south. it appeared to my field of vision underneath the nearly- full moon. it wasn't that far off the ground. i'd guess 5-10,000 feet, about the altitude of a small plane. we watched until it faded. we should have been able to see it for a longer period, but it faded tail first, and the last we saw were the bright lights on its nose.\r\n\r\nthe object was definitely not some kind of meteorite broken apart as the pieces would have been flying apart and burning. this was not burning. all of the lights were at uniform distance relative to one another and moved at uniform speed. i immediately believed the object to be some kind of ship. it was definitely a manufactured object. my wife says that it appeared to emit a vaporous trail behind it, but i didn't see that.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, we did not have a camera. however, numerous others saw the object as well we later found out from a friend who was listening to the radio.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
