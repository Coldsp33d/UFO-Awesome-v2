appeared to be moving because of the fast pace in which the clouds were passing overhead. it seemed too obvious to me that the objects were moving against the cloud direction. well, i kept on looking

but here goes....\r\nwhen i was approx. 11 years old, ( i'm now 40) we were having a large family reunion at my grandparent's house \"out in the country\" of rural southeast missouri. there was approx. 45-50 of us outside in the heat of the summer, churning an old-time ice-cream churn. it was just starting to get a little dark out, when the kids ( including myself) noticed a very bright object in the western sky, up over the next hilltop from our location. we thought it was just the \"evening star\", and being kids, were oohhing and aahhing how pretty the \"star\" was. but the \"star\", although remaining stationary, kept getting brighter and brighter, until all of us knew it could not be a star. after getting intensely bright and bigger, it dimmed down again, to it's original form. then the light went out completely, and changed into a repeating light pattern. it had individual lights around it, that were going on and off in a circular/oval pattern. the object definitely had form, structure, and mass. all of us could plainly see it, and tell that it was \"saucer\" shaped. it slowly began, to move to our right, and then 6 more disc's \"appeared\" and joined up with the first object. all of the objects were \"disc' or \"saucer\" shaped, and had rotating circular/oval lights, and were hovering around by each other, in no particular pattern. i can only estimate that the objects were probably a half mile away from us. the objects began to kind of fly together, moving to the right. just one disc would always be flying different than the rest of them, almost like \"herding\" the other's. i can remember all of us being absolutely petrified. the children were screaming running into the house ( me included ). the adults were scared, and some were running for cover, as well. i believe all of us thought that, for a lack of a better word, we were going to be invaded, bombed, or something. the disc's stayed outside, hovering close, for about 1 hour and finally left. we don't speak of this, and i still have nightmares.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

have been sitting on this story for 30 years and feel the obligation to report it. a friend and i were moving belongings into an apartment near aschaffenburg, germany in february 1977.\r\n\r\nwe dropped off a car load at the apartment and started to return to aschaffenburg(after this town)in my car. the time was about 1130-1200 at night. as we left the village my apartment was in, we saw an oval shaped light pattern, football shaped, with 1 red light at each end, 3 red lights at the top, equally spaced and 2 red lights with 1 green light between them, also equally spaced at the bottom. none of the lights were blinking. we were in a very narrow valley, about 500 meters wide and the object was at our same vertical height above the ground. i estimate no more than 300 meters away. i also estimate, due to the apparent distance to the object, taht it was about 35 feet in length and 15 feet from top to bottom as indicated by the lights. i was driving and did not stop. we only commented to each other that neither of us had ever seen that particular light pattern on an aircraft before.\r\n\r\nwe continued our trip to town and began our return with another car load of belongings. our route took us up and along the side of an open hill with a superb view to the north and west i believe. we were overlooking the town on a bright, clear night and at this time it was about 1am. i am an observer wheh i drive and am continually looking around at the vicinity aroung my car at all times. as we neared the top of the hill we were driving up, i looked to my left and saw a very large, bright, round light in the sky. i am a professional soldier and know that we humans have no depth perception during darkness so i won't speculate on the distance to this light. i will say without a doubt that i knew that it was out of place. i pointed it out to my friend , he saw it, and when we got to the top of the hill, i stopped the car and turned off the motor. we both got out of the car and this is what we saw.\r\n\r\nthere was a very large, round bright light hanging motionless in the sky that was completely out of perspective with every other light that we could see. because we were on a hill top, the light was not apparently too much higher than we were. i will estimate it's height above the ground below it to be less than 3000 feet. this will become clear in a moment. we stood outside the car and it was a brilliant clear cold winter night with zero cloud cover.\r\n\r\nas we watched this large light, another light appeared dropping from what was apparently the bottom of the large light. (imagine looking at a spot light and having a 100 watt light bulb fall out of it) the small light fell apparently 100-200 feet below the large light and stopped in the air. it held that position for about 2 seconds and winked out. about 2 seconds after the small light winked out, the same oval or football shaped red and green light patern that we had seen on the way to town appeared in it's place and this object travelled toward us and to our right, apparently following the path of the original object we had seen down the same narrow valley. this valley was to our right front, and as the object approached and passed us it was within no more than 1000 meters and as it passed, below us so that we were looking down on it. at no time did either of us hear anything at all.\r\n\r\nthis act was repeated at 4-5-6 minute intervals 5 more times, for a total of 6. (7 including the original spotting about an hour before) we didn't have a watch and no other clock so the times are approximate. assuming a 5 minute interval, we witnessed this activity for about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nthe only speculation i am willing to make about this sighting is that it was not anything i have ever seen before or since. it appeared to be a large aircraft of some kind, air-launching several smaller aircraft. i don't know of any power on the planet with that capability.\r\n\r\nafter the 6th  object, no others appeared for about 10 minutes. we were cold so we left the hill top and continued to my apartment. during the entire 30-40 minutes we were on the hill top, the large, bright white light remained stationary in the sky as far as we could tell and was still in the same position when we left.\r\n\r\nif i were given a relatively accurate map of the area, preferrably a military 1:50,000 with grid lines, i could pinpoint where these sightings took place within 50 meters or so.\r\n\r\ni know that what i saw was extraordinary. we had no camera so there are no pictures.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

as i finished the sharp bend at the old cathole road intersection. i was driving home after visiting a friend and was alone.\r\nhome was about one quarter of a mile away. i slowed considerably and kept the light in my peripheral vision as i turned into the home street (gary road) and then up the driveway, then another turn to park which positioned my view directly where the ufo was located. once parked i turned off my lights and the light in the sky, which had remained stationary, made a slow move toward my position. it was at that moment that i realized i was seeing a ufo. i watched in amazement for what seemed to be a short time  then turned to see if anybody else was home. to my dismay, it appeared that i was the only one at the house, but my younger sister may be inside. the ufo would float closer and move back but never to the same location, changing it's position each time i made a move of some sort such as taking the keys out of the ignition. i decided to make a run into the house to see if anybody was inside. as soon as i opened the car door, the ufo made an incredibly fast relocation quite a distance away. i ran toward the house and up the first section of stairs, which required turning my back to the ufo. once at the first plateau of the steps, i turned to look at it again and it shot away and almost instantly was out of sight. once i got into the house, i was disappointed to find nobody there. i did look at the clock and saw that the time was 9:30. i distinctively remember the clock radio in my car reading 8:00 when i turned the car off in the driveway. what seemed to be only a few minutes of watch the ufo had actually consumed 90 minutes. the realization was startling and a bit frightening.\r\ni waited until the next day to get the newspaper to see if there were any reports of ufo sightings and found none. i never filed a report with any authorities. understanding that i was one of the privileged few to have this experience was enough satisfaction to me.\r\ni have told many people about my sighting. some time in the late 1990s i watched a television show on public television's nova on ufos and was very excited to hear the description of a very similar experience that a priest in mexico had. the uniquely colored very bright light moving in smooth but radical ways and eventually flying away in a split second.\r\ni have checked \"circle\" and \"sphere\" as a shape description, but all i could really see was the intense light that appeared round in shape. the most recent report of ufo sightings in chicago inspired me to file my report at this time. i am sure there are many more citizens like me that have seen ufos and have never reported them wishing to avoid attention and the criticism that always comes from authorities and the non-believing public.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

just glide past on their own way. near the end of the clip during the zoom in, notice the speed of circulation and realize these craft are 25 to 75 miles away from the camera. the pattern must be

no flashing or colored lights. in the center where it was bright and solid there was a perfect vertical narrow black rectangle. very un-organic looking! this rectangle was vibrating and moving left to right always staying within the solid area of white. i kept hoping that another car would come up the exit but colchester was a pretty dead town after 9pm back in the 80s. after about 5 minutes the object began to move directly north.  it slowly moved over what once was the chestnut lodge restaurant. i got in my car and tried to follow it but it headed north towards hartford. this is over a small valley so following mainstreet colchester i quickly lost sight of it. early the next morning i called a friend of mine about the incident. he later called me and told me that there was a rash of reports of ufo sightings to the hartford police dept that night on the television news.  i wish i took note of what station he was watching, what day it was, checked the newspapers for any writeups ... i didnt realize at that time that 26 years later i would still be dying to know what it was i saw and wanting to hear someone elses account of it. for the record i dont subscribe to ufo magazines, or own any books, or have any desire to visit area 51... it is not a hobby for me. i have shared what i have seen honestly to alot of people. i would hope that my general lack of interest would give a little more credibility to my sighting?
