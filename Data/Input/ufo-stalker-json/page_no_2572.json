place, date are approximate. i always wondered what i'd observed but never said anything due to my job, my reputation, and the fact that i wasn't sure what i really saw that day. it wasn't until today, when i happened upon a soviet mig 21 film that showed them chasing an object exactly like the one i saw, that i decided to tell someone about it.\r\n\r\ni was a first officer on a md-80 aircraft flying across the midwest eastbound to chicago. it was the middle of the afternoon, early fall, and there were numerous scattered to broken cloud decks below us, and a higher stratus deck above. i think we were still in cruise flight, somewhere between 31000 to 35000 feet, somewhere over kansas or missouri. i remember it being not a bright day, sort of broken overcast as far as illumination goes. not a bright day, but not gray or gloomy.\r\n\r\nthe captain and i both noticed a black dot quite a ways ahead of us to the left, and lower. i think i made a comment about it, as it was a habit to call out any air traffic when we noticed it. both of us watched as the object came closer; our interest increasing mostly because it's coloring was so dark and it stood out quite well against the white puffy clouds below and ahead of us. as we approached, we could see that it wasn't another jet as we expected, but instead could clearly see a long, flat-black cylinder with squared off ends, maybe 3-5000 feet below us and traveling slowly in the opposite direction. it looked to be as large, or perhaps slightly longer and thicker than our aircraft. there were no markings or openings that i could see. \r\n\r\nboth of us were sort of stunned by it's shape, mostly because of it's size and the fact that the ends were squared off and it appeared to be moving. my initial reaction was that it was some sort of odd balloon, but somehow moving at  speed opposite the jet stream. it passed behind us to our left and below, rather quickly. it seem to maintain the same speed, not accelerating or slowing. we queried atc about other traffic or weather balloons in our vicinity but they told us they had nothing on their scopes. both of us looked at each other and i think made some nervous jokes about what we had just seen, but due to a sort of unspoken creed of our profession, neither of us said much about it after that... i think more due to the fact that it was such an odd shape that neither wanted to bring up the \"ufo\" theory, at least not seriously. i had never heard of a ufo shaped like a cylinder before.\r\n\r\ni have been a pilot for 35+ years, 19 years at this airline ( the last 6 years as captain), and a military pilot for 10 years prior to that. i am not one of those guys wearing a tin foil hat and seeing the mother ship in every cloud. i would best be described as a skeptic, until now. we don't talk publicly about these sorts of things. i have only mentioned this quietly to one or two people since that time, and only as one of those stories where you couldn't figure out what you saw. it wasn't until today, when i saw that mig 21 video on the internet that i was shocked back to that moment, literally stunned, and realized that the object in the video was the exact same thing i had witnessed. it bothered me enough to report it to you, though i doubt it will help much since it was so long ago and my details are a bit fuzzy.\r\n\r\ni hope you will keep my name, email and phone numbers confidential. my company would definitely frown on this being connected to me or their company.\r\n\r\nthis is the link to the

turnpike(i-80) around midnight and as we were about a mile from our exit(exit 8)he called my attention to an small bright light high in the sky whose behavior was inconsistent with any normal aircraft. it would zig-zag from north to south at an impossible speed coming to a dead stop for a second or two each time it changed direction. as we exited the highway, rick shouted \"it's right over the car! pull over! pull over!\" i did so at a spot about halfway to the tollbooth on an incline, and we both sprang from the car leaving the doors hanging open. unbeknownst to us, right behind us was an ohio state patrolman who also immediately pulled over(probably to ask us just what in the hell we were doing). he exited his cruiser, took a step or two towards us, and then probably due to the slack-jawed look on our faces, turned around to see what we were looking at.\r\nmoving west parallel to the interstate on the south side was the strangest thing i've ever seen. a large rectangular object which i would guess was about the size of a railroad boxcar was drifting along probably about 30 to 40 yards from us at an elevation just barely below level with our position on the higher embankment. it was traveling very slowly-maybe 10 to 15 mph-and was completely silent. there were a few small whiteish lights on its side allowing just enough illumination to make out its basic shape and its dark black/gray coloring. it then made a slight rumble/shudder sound followed by what sounded like a couple slight jettings of compressed air, though i couldn't pinpoint from where on the object the sounds came from. it appeared to accelerate somewhat and drifted out of view due to the adjacent terrain.\r\nthe patrolman spun around and gave us each a look(i'm told i don't have a good poker face-i imagine i looked somewhat stunned-i should have!),and without saying a word to either of us, climbed into his cruiser, turned on his flashers and sped through the toll-gates. i quickly paid the toll and we tried to see which way he'd gone. rick said\" it's going that way!\" pointing at the south side of the split and i took that. at the time i didn't know if he meant the cruiser or whatever the hell it was we'd just seen-i just took the southbound ramp that took us towards lake avenue as fast as i could. we shot up and down lake ave. a few times trying to see it again to no avail. what we did see though was one hell of alot of cops-sheriffs, local police, and state patrol all over the place. none of them pulled us over even though we were well exceeding the speed limit(and if you knew this area, considering the time of night, that in and of itself was about as strange as whatever we'd just seen!) after about 20 to 30 minutes we gave up and headed home.\r\nwas it the same object that we'd seen moving so fast overhead? who knows? it sure didn't look very aerodynamic, but i'd certainly think that it was somehow related. later in the week the local paper reported that the same and following night residents in the russia road area just southwest of there had reported strange things in the sky. i never saw anything like that again, but i'll certainly never forget it!","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

week, and we unfortunately have dial-up.   \r\n \r\n   it was wednesday morning, december 20, 2006. i had an apppintment with a local car dealership, as i am leasing my vehicle, so there was a lease-pull-ahead going on, and my truck qualified, not to mention i had alot of other errands and last minute christmas shopping to finish. i told my daughters that instead of riding the bus to school, i would drive them. it was starting out to be a gorgeous day, as the sun was coming up, and the sky was absolutely beautiful and blue...Not a cloud in the sky, not to mention unseasonably warm for michigan this time of year. \r\n    we left our house at approximately 7:15am, and i drove my older daughter to her high school, and dropped her off. as i headed east on saginaw hwy, towards my younger daughters school, as we neared the intersection at nixon rd, we both noticed a large bright roundish white light in the north, just a few hundred feet over the woods. we turned north onto nixon rd, and noticed the light still there. at this time, the sky is so blue, and cloudless where we were. i drove north until we pulled into the school lot, we looked, and now the object is lower, and is over the woods directly across (west) from the school now. it just looked like a huge round whitish light in the sky. i wanted to pull over and take pictures, but the school and parking lot is so busy with traffic, and i didn't want to draw attention and have parents think i was taking pics of their kids. i watched my daughter walk into the building, and then pulled out of the lot, now heading south on nixon rd. at the intersection, i turned east once again onto saginaw hwy and headed for the i-96 freeway, which was about 3 miles form where i was at that point. i looked and the object was now gone, nowhere in sight. i looked at my cellphone clock...It was now 7:40am.\r\n    i got onto the i-96 eastbound ramp, as i was heading for shaheen chevrolet in lansing/holt area. for a about 5 miles, i-96 eastbound actually heads in a southerly direction, until you pass the i-69 (ft. wayne) interchange, then i-96 heads east. as i went past the i-69 interchange, i notice in the far east...Ever-so-slightly north, a big solid white aircraft, like a jumbo 747 with a contrail, and it appeared to be heading west. it was just so bright white against the beautiful, clear blue sky. it was pretty to see. as i drove east, i kept watch of this aircraft. as i drove another 5 miles, this aircraft was still there, as was the contrail, and then it seemed it didn't appear to be moving. i assumed this was due to the distance away it was form me, and that it just gave the \"illusion\" it wasn't moving, since i was heading east and this was heading west. i continued to watch this aircraft the remainder of the way towards shaheen chevrolet. now i was directly south of the aircraft...It still had a contrail, & that's when i noticed...The aircraft wasn't moving. it just hung there in the sky, with this contrail behind it. i wanted to pull over immediately and take video/pictures of this, but this is not a safe place to just stop along the freeway at this point, because of all the exiting traffic. as i turned onto the cedar st. exit ramp, i kept watch. this was the exit i always took to shaheen chevrolet/sam's club/celebration cinema theaters/etc. there is a stoplight at the end of this exit ramp, and it was red. as i stopped, i glanced up at the aircraft (which is just barely west of me now) and suddenly this other white object just 'appears\" out of the clear blue sky, and is under/lower the original aircraft. now...It too is just sitting there in the sky. \r\n    my husband is self-employed and his warehouse/office is located in holt, approximately 3 miles southeast of where i was at. i quickly got on my cellphone and called him. i asked him if he was at his office...Which he replied yes. i then asked him to quickly step outside and look into the north sky, and tell me what he sees. i told him to hurry. the light turned green and i am still driving at this point as this is a major intersection with many inter-connecting streets...A very high-traffic area, and i can't just pull over. as i finally get to near the dealership, i pull over into the sam\"s club parking lot, that is adjacent to shaheen chevrolet and wilx tv-10 station. the aircraft is still just sitting there. my husband says he sees an aircraft...I ask him what color...And if he sees the contrail...I then ask him if he sees anything else, and i tell him to look very closely...Then he sees the other whiteish object below. i then ask him if it appears to be moving, he said no, and he says it's probably just a trick of the eyes, then very quickly i explained that i had watched this all the way from grand ledge, and how i too thought it was a trick of the eyes, until i got closer. then...Suddenly, the lower craft object starts moving, and quickly passes this huge aircraft. (it was like you were watching a little 4 seater plane pass a huge jumbojet...It just doesn't happen). i said...Its moving now...Do you see it?...He confirmed yes. i told him i had to go, as i could not hang onto my cell & talk and i had to quickly take pics/video....I then hung up. \r\n    i stepped out of my truck and tried so hard to get the video to focus, but because of the bright blue cloudless sky, and the sun, there was nothing for it to keep a good focus on and not blur. i tried everything, so i then switched it to picture mode, and managed to get 15 pictures of this. it still did not want to focus good at all, especially when i tried to zoom in on them. in 4 of the pictures, i zoomed out, so as to capture tree-tops and part of a sam's club parking lot light, for distance/size comparison. i could not take any more pictures, as you could no longer see them. \r\n    i then pulled into shaheen, and went into the sales rep's office. while there, after a little bit, i remembering glancing at the clock, and thinking wow...Time went so fast. i had so much to do, so i told him i had to get going. i didn't download the pictures 'till a few days later. when i noticed the time on the pictures.....They show the first picture taken at 8:45am..And the last picture taken at 8:47am. the entire distance from my youngest daughters school, to shaheen chevrolet is 13.16 miles according to mapquest., with a driving time of 16 minutes. it shows taking m-99 exit, but i always go to the next exit (cedar st), which is approx another 2-3 miles east. i am missing alot of time, and yet can not remember anything being out of place...Besides witnessing the bright whitish objects...1 at the school, and the 1 under the large aircraft. \r\n \r\nwhat i find very odd, is the fact that i could see this large aircraft very clearly for the entire time. it was the most beautiful white against the very blue cloudless sky. i could see the wings, engines, tail section, everything. then the smaller very bright white object appears below it...Also very white, but i could not discern a clear definite shape/object. it looked like a very white blur/orb if you will. and the way they both just sat there in the sky, then suddenly the small object starts moving as well as the larger aircraft, and yet the small object is able to pass it, does not make sense in conventional terms, as i know them. \r\n \r\ni have attached 3 pics...1st is \"original\", 2nd is \"labeled\" 3rd is \"inverted colors\" (dark is light, light is dark), so you can see how even the large aircraft just doesn't seem to show hardly at all in the pics...Yet this is not how my husband & i both saw it. when we saw it, it was plain as day a large aircraft, and a very white smaller blur/orb. remember when i took these pics, the objects were now moving. you will definitely have to zoom in to see to see clearly. also remember when i first noticed a whiteish objectin the morning, was a few minutes before i noted the time as 7:40am. the 7:40 incident was in eaton county, the 2nd incident was in ingham county.\r\n \r\npatty d\r\nmufon int'l fi &\r\nmichigan mufon fi (clinton

watching this \"thing\" in the sky that seemed to just stay in one place and change colors quickly from red to green to yellow, etc.  we sat on the bleechers & watched for a while and noted that there were about 5 helicopters and several airplanes flying around also.  surprisingly, this was one of the few nights of that summer that we were all sober, so i can't blame this on substance abuse!  we watched this \"thing\" in the sky for a while & were talking.  i'm not sure how much time passed (maybe an hour?) and then there was a craft hovering over the top of the football field right where we were.  it was probably no higher than the top of the high school which was four stories high and was about 30 yards long & the almost the width of the field.  it did not make any noise, it was the wierdest thing.  i think we were all in shock, so i'm not sure how long it hovered but when it took off again, it made maneuvers that we've never seem regular airplanes do.  then, the wierdest thing, about 2 soccer fields down there was a purple strobing light flashing for a while.  no idea what it was, but i remember getting freaked out when my boyfriend started walking towards it.  everyone kept saying it was just someone's tv, but it was so bright & fast i didn't think that was the case.  it flashed for about 2 mins and then just stopped.  after a while we walked down the field to where it would have been and didn't see anything (although it was dark out...).  we all know we witnessed something strange that night, but no one knows what.  we haven't talked about it since.  i wish i had reported earlier since almost 18 years have passed and i probably would have had more details before.'","distance":"21-100
