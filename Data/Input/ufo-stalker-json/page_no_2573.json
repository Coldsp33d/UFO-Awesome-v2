about it the stranger it gets. i am not one that hopes or wishes to see a ufo, i had witnessed a huge one some years ago and that was enough to tell me they are here. \r\n\r\ni believed i had seen a meteorite but now i am not so sure, i have seen many but this one was far different from all the others. so i will describe this the best i can.\r\n\r\n i was working outside on the morning of dec 25th at 5:26 am. this object caught my eye coming from the west to east or so i thought at the time. i was able to view it for 4 to 5 seconds before it went out of my sight behind a building not more than 100ft to 200ft off the ground. it was moving very slowly compared to other meteors i have seen before but this was also closer than any i had witnessed, much closer. \r\n\r\nthe best way to describe it i think would be to say it was half the size of a basketball. it was white and round, i mean pure white and perfectly round. odd. like a perfect white, beautiful. it had two trails of sparks that were seen clearly coming off the top and bottom of the object trailing behind it coming closer to one another the farther back they went.\r\n\r\ni was able to talk to a fellow security officer who was 1/4 mile to my north who seen the object also. this person said it came from the north west and past over his vehicle and he lost sight of it while he tried to turn the vehicle around. i forgot to mention it was descending, i really cant say how high it was when i first seen it but it was not on a very sharp angle. i would say about 12 15 degrees but this is only my best guess. what really got me thinking about this was the shape and speed. it just all seems a little odd. i would have loved to chase it down but i was unable to get relieved from my post to investigate. i half expected to hear fire trucks but never did. well no matter what it was, it was a special treat on a special morning. \r\n\r\ni decided to repost this event here after finding this post elsewhere.\r\n\r\nvineland ��� on december 26, 2006, my mother and i were about two minutes away from my house when she saw a very bright ball, white in color moving very fast but it was silent. i wasn't able to judge the distance or size of the object. we were pretty startled. i have seen meteor showers, but nothing ever like this. meteors i have seen before were very small visible for a split second. it didn't appear to be moving as fast as the meteors i have seen before, but it was moving very fast, and it was clearly visible for about 5-8 seconds before it went past the horizon.

light signal -refractions were the first conscious perception of the ufos.My first thought was not turn around, go on.\r\n\r\nwhen this \"light\" then got more intensive and also acoustic signals were sent, i left the way out of fear and beat a bend to hold the direction further.\r\n\r\nafter approximately one kilometer i then came, onto these meadows on which the three tractors were in a distance from approx. three to four hundred meters with the aliens.\r\n\r\nthere was clear to me, the signals should persuade me of the turning back.\r\n\r\npart from the report \r\n\r\ni have watched the following event on 5-19-1991:\r\n\r\ni watched a strange nature of another planet in the champagne between epernay and dorman toward 1.00 hours at night.\r\n\r\nyou sat organized on three tractors distributed respectively with respect to sizes. on the first one per 8 of 1.60 m of size, on the second 8 of 1.80 m of size each and on the third tractor 8 extra-planetary living beings of 1.95 m of size each sat.\r\n\r\nours is shape your body very much, very much! similar. prominent distinctive marks are the lack of the earlobe and side of the nose as well as the reddish head and neck area. the hue of the other body came on violetly, blue, red and skin-colored. as similar as the colors of the rainbow.\t\r\n\r\nparticularly striking was, every group was different from the other group in the body form-great, thick, thin, corpulent. the organic appearance is stressed, shall be said the proportions of the individual parts of the body to each other were that way! even. with respect to sizes, form and weight these living beings looked just too \"natural\" so.\r\n\r\ni left this place and went to the vineyards. a lamp suddenly came on there between the vines in 4 m of distance, otherwise i could recognize nothing. the light dazzled. i stopped and then moved further at the side. the \"lamp\" followed my movement. hastily i turned round and wanted into contrary to a sedate direction make way. but another lamp was coming on in 10 m of distance at this moment.\r\n\r\ni stopped, looked around and hurried toward the road lying below the vineyards. a gaseous cloud was rising of a near situated meadow at this moment ���this was the laser-sign for the aliens around this area. i marched down now direction road and the vineyard accelerated my operations in the direction of the dorman.\r\n\r\nan extra-planetary living being suddenly came at the side from the meadow goose-step-likely\r\n-no man can go so or imitate this movement rhythm, from the darkness toward the road and wanted to cut the way off for me. the body color was black like the night and i could do this only thanks to the moonlight. recognize well.\r\n\r\ni ran as fast as i could and added a bend to some 100 m on the fields. a larger lamp in form of a heart also came on there between the fruit-trees. this one i ran to the river and direction dorman got bright as fast as i could to it

over the years.  i am 36 now.  \r\n\r\nwe had just finished our fall sock hop at adams middle school in grand prairie, tx and were all standing outside waiting for our parents.  teachers, students, and administrators were all present and witnessed this event in mass. \r\n\r\nwe were standing there when we realized there were lights dancing rapidly in the sky making odd patterns around what seemed a central light.  it went on for about 20 minutes total and moved perhaps 5000 meters in every direction.  the colors of the spheres were orange,red, blue, and the central object was white and oval/cylindrical in shape.  the lights did not pulsate, but they did seem to phase in and out in vibrancy as they moved around, and i had the sense there was some sort of communication going on. \r\n\r\nwe were all terrified.   the principal at the time kept looking around to find spotlights or something to explain it, and he could find nothing to explain it.  we were all dumbfounded.  we looked over at the highway, i-30, which is visable from the school (it was a four lane then), and traffic had aalmost stopped dead, but their lights were on...  it was like looking at rubber necking at the scene of an accident.  people were pulled over on the side of the road watching the sky.\r\n\r\nthe objects were obviously very high in the atmosphere, as you could not hear anything from them at all.  i knew the area very well as i lived in the apartments across the highway, and was very familar with the night sky in the location.\r\n\r\nthe spheres moved around forming odd cross patterns, and geometric (circles, stars, flowers, triangles) patterns, and then four of them attached to the central object and the others zipped away, and then the large object zipped off, and at the same moment we felt an odd wave of sudden static electricity.   i had very long hair, and i had serious static cling out of nowhere, as my felt skirt was stuck tight to my leggings, as were all the other girls.   we were all affected.  another odd thing i remember was seeing what seemed like spurts of glowing orange \"spits\" when the four went in to the larger object.\r\n\r\na few minutes after they took off we saw fighter jets doing circles around the area.  there were also a few helicopters in the air looking for something on the ground with spotlights.\r\n\r\nthe following day the principal came on the announcements and told us not to worry about anything, that it was a beautiful light show, and nothing more, and to dismiss it. i volunteered in the office, and there were air force officers there that morning. at the time i called around everywhere in the metroplex and there were no light shows of any kind in the metroplex.  i also called the media stations to see if anything had surfaced in the news, and nothing had.  i was a very determined child and my parents had witnessed it to from the appartments before picking me up.\r\n\r\ni should add here that i am former air force intell.  i am also highly educated, and am naturally a skeptic.  i am also a former archaeologist, and am detail oriented.\r\n\r\ni am convinced beyond a resonable doubt that what i witnessed that day was not a man-made or natural occurance.  all of the children of our school felt that we had witnessed a ufo sighting.  it is the only event of this kind i have had.\r\n\r\nthank you for your

was my last christmas eve in puerto rico, before enlisting in the u.S. army.  christmas was the biggest holiday in my neighborhood, so it is hard to forget. i lived in the city of aguadilla, on the northwest coast of puerto rico, in a residential complex, on a hill facing the aguadilla bay, known as ���cuesta vieja���.  it was some time between 6:30 and 7:30 pm.  i had come outside, after getting ready for the festivities, and was talking to a friend, we were standing by the steps, leading to the playground, across from building #6 and behind building #11.  (i lived just across, in building #6, second floor, apartment #75). at some point in our conversation, we looked up and noticed a star moving.  \r\n\r\nat first, we thought it might be an aircraft, being that there is an airport on the north side of aguadilla. but it was moving way too fast to be an aircraft.  i mean, that thing moved from the equinox to the horizon in less than ten seconds.  this moving object seem like a regular star or satellite to the naked eye. seeing that it was moving so fast, we then assumed it might be some kind of satellite but then, it did something no satellite we had ever seen did; it stopped and started moving across the horizon, first to the left, then to the right at a very fast rate of speed. then it returned to the middle and retraced its trajectory back to the original position on the equinox.  again, it started to move towards the horizon. at this point i remembered that my then, brother in-law was in my home so, i ran home and asked him to bring out his binoculars so we can get a better look at the ���ufo���. he immediately followed me outside.  by then, there were other people outside looking at this ufo, some with binoculars and at least one telescope. i don���t remember who they all were, but i���m sure they were neighbors, some adults and some kids. the object was just above the horizon.\r\n\r\nwhen i finally got my chance to look through the binoculars, the object seemed to be the shape of an upside down saucer, it looked brightly illuminated with color lights that seem to be changing fast on its bottom half.  it looked to me like the colors of the rainbow.  the object was stationary for e few minutes, then moved to the left, then to the right, back to the center as before. this time as it moved toward the equinox, it started picking up speed. once at the equinox, the object zip out of site at an amazing  speed. everyone that was there that evening got a chance to look through the various ocular devices and get a good look at the ufo. even after all this years, i have not forgotten so, i am sure the others must remember also.\r\n\r\ni never reported it before, since i was joining the army and did not want to be labeled a ���nut���.  although, once during an interview for my security clearance, the investigating agent asked me if i had ever encountered a ufo.  i related to him the facts as stated above, but added that i did not believe it to be of extraterrestrial origin. i told him, i imagine it was some kind of secret experimental craft.\r\n\r\n   i now live in morrow ga, and may be contacted at the number above.  last i heard, my friend works, or was working, at a restaurant ���carr 107, barrio borinquen��� in aguadilla, pr.  my ex-brother-in-law, lives somewhere in fort lauderdale, fl. since he and my sister divorced, we don���t keep in touch. \r\n\r\nduring the two years preceding this incident, i had heard of other sightings by other kids at school and neighbors.  i assumed they had mistaken the identity of some man-made aircraft and ruled out any other possibility.  but, this incident made a believer out of me.  i now know this was not a man-made object.  at that time, the fastest thing in our air fleet was the sr-71. the way this thing moved, it can play loops around the sr-71. i have seen a lot of military planes and this thing is still the fastest thing i have ever seen. i believe, we are not alone in the universe.  keep getting the word out. people need to know these things.  yours truly,\r\n\r\nroberto alago\r\n","distance":"Over One

watching t.V.  at 6:45pm a looked out of my window.  the reason why i know it was 6:45pm was because when i looked up and saw the object i made sure to look at my cable box and check the time, it was 6:45pm.  so as i am looking out of my window i noticed planes going by overhead.  i've lived hear all of my life and i know that over my house is a plane route to laguardia airport, and i have watched planes go over my house all of my life.  i say this because i want you to know that i know what a plane looks like.  as the planes are going by i noticed on my left a very bright light.  that is when i checked the time, and it said 6:45pm.  i then steped out of the window onto my fire-escape.  i live on the 3rd floor of an apartment building.  i looked all around the light.  i looked for wings, and a tail, i did not see either.  i looked for a nose and saw nothing.  i looked for blinking red lights that planes have under them i saw nothing.  i continued to focus my eyes in a circle around the object and saw nothing but a very bright object.  i bent my head over and covered the ear facing the ground, and the ear facing the object in the sky was uncovered and i heard nothing, not a sound.  the object was as high as some of the planes that go by.  i can hear them when they go by, but when this object went by i heard nothing.  i had no camera at the time.  believe my i thought of it first but my neice had it.  i am used to seeing planes passing by, but when i saw this object i really did not know what it was.  i was going in a striaght line on my left towards my and then pass my.  i was moving with no sound.  i knew that i did all  the checks that i knew to do, so after i did all of that and knew that it was not a plane that i ever saw i was a little shocked that i saw it.  then happy that i was able to see something that i could not explain.  i lost sight of the object when is pasted over and pasted the buildings next to my building.  i have never seen an object that bright in my life.

time were on our way home.  it was around 2am and we were driving on the old springville highway (sr-89) heading south towards springville.  this highway runs north and south right next to the wassatch mountain range.  my freind luke was driving, my girlfreind was in the passanger seat and i was in the back seat sitting behind the driver seat.  we were heading south towards springville.  i was in the back looking out the window like i normally do while im in a car.  we were about 1 minute from the springville border when i saw a light come from over the mountain and over the valley.  at first i thought it was a plane flying over like i've seen so many planes do before.  i was watching the light moving and it was moving at the same speed i've seen comemercial airlines fly, so i didnt really think anythying of it at first.  after watching it for about 20 seconds i saw it split in-two.  the best way to describe what this looked like is if you've ever lit the end of a plastic straw on fire and watch it drip in flames.  i remember the lights being a whitish-orange color.  that is what this looked like.  it split (dripped) in 2 pieces.  the bottom piece that dripped away from the main light dripped south away from the main object while the main object remained in the same place north of the dripping object.  the lights looked to be the same size and what appeared to be about 100-200 yards away from eachother (north and south.)  at this time i said \"oh my god, it split!  look out the window.\"  they didnt immediatly look at first and i remember how mad it made me because i really wanted them to see what i was looking at in the sky before the lights went away.  so i said it again more agressivly to look out the window to the sky above the mountains.  and before i got finished telling them to look out the window the second time the 2 lights took off at a very high speed in the same direction (slanted upward direction) and the lights just disapeared.  i asked my girlfriend and luke if they saw the lights in the sky and they said they did not.  i explained what i had saw to them and what happened and still remember the feeling i had inside me and how upset i was because they didnt look out the windows when i told them to the first time.\r\n\r\n       the reason for me writing this now is beccaue i had no idea who to report this to.  i wanted to tell people about what i saw but had no idea where to go.  i watched a episode on the history channel tonight and they started talking about mufon and your website and it reminded me of these lights i saw i and got a pen and paper and wrote it down.  i've only told few people about what i saw and most seem to blow me off and dont take me seriously.  thats why im so glad there is a place i can report this and get my experience out there.  i know i saw something weird in the sky that night and nothing of this earth can explain the manner in which in moved and  behaved and the speed at which it flew away in.\r\n\r\n      if you would like any other information on this please feel free to email me.  my name is brett.  thank you so much for your time in reading this.  it means alot to me.\r\n\r\n

campsite(crane flat) around 1430 on sunday oct 9, 2005 to rest my back that was bothering me. i had just laid down on the picnic table in my campsite and was watching some large black birds flying in between the trees in the camp. there were no clouds in the sky that i could see and the temperature was around 70 degrees. there were some fires burning in the park (one small one to the west) but no smoke visible in my area. even though the sun was still high in the sky it was about to set behind a mountain to the west and the campsite was in partial shade.\r\nas the campground was closing for the season the next day, there were only a few campers left and the place was almost deserted. i remember it being so quiet that i could hear the flapping of the birds wings. i was just about to get up when i noticed the object. i was facing south and the object passed overhead travelling west to east and about two hands width from the zenith. because of the tall trees in the campsite i was only able to observe the object clearly for about 10-12sec before losing sight of it. \r\nat first glance i thought the object was a large bird or plane but within a second or two it was clear that it was not a bird and the shape definitely was not like any plane i had ever seen.\r\nthe object was dull/matte-gray in color and more rectangular than square but not by much. the surface/texture of the object was difficult to describe. it was not really smooth skinned or shiny/metallic looking but more for lack of a better description...Organic looking...Almost like a highly compressed light-gray cloud. i could just make out somewhat defined edges but could not determine its depth. in hindsight, it appeared to be about the size of a small aspirin ( ~5-7mm dia. ) held at arms length. \r\nthe object moved at a fixed speed and did not change its direction while in view. there were no visible protusions ,wings, tail, lights, contrail, or noise emitted by the object and i could not see any reflections off of the object from the sun. as the trees were blocking the sun, i was able to view the object without squinting or shielding my eyes. i do not wear glasses and only wear bifocals for reading/computer use. as it turned out, i was unable to get to my camera fast enough to record the sighting.\r\nin comparison, an airliner passed overhead north to south 5 minutes after the sighting. i heard the jet a minute before i could see it and when it passed over, the sun brightly lit up the side of the jet facing west. \r\n\r\ni have thought about this sighting for the last year. the fact that it was so radically different from anything i had ever seen in the sky before and could not explain bothered me. i happened to be watching the history channel today while they were running a \"ufo diaries\" marathon and in particular the show about mufon and the training of investigators. i went to the site and decided to file a sighting report if for no other reason than maybe somebody else happened to see the same thing that day.\r\nas backround, i am 55 and retired. majored in physics and spent 20 years in pharmaceutical manufacturing. i come from a military family, my father serving 20 years in the navy working on fighter aircraft. growing up on military bases i am very familiar with military aircraft.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While driving home to albuquerque one night on i-25 north after a \"gig\" in socorro (i played guitar in a c&w band at the time), shortly after passing the los lunas exit, and then onto the isleta reservation, i noticed a faint glow originating from the canyon pass area northwest of my location, where the train normally comes from points west, into belen, nm. at first, i thought it might be the train, then realized it was a very faint glow, but i saw it moving, so i then thought small aircraft, possibly a helicopter or plane. as i continued watching, i noticed that the object was travelling toward the southeast at an apparent high rate of speed, and seemed to be coming toward the general direction of my car. i watched the object move toward me for a minute or so, then i became even more interested, as it appeared to move right in an intersecting path with my vehicle.  there was not another vehicle on the highway in either direction at the time of this first sighting.  i watched it approach, and then became very perplexed, as it seemed to be glowing somewhat like a fluorescent bulb, not lighting the area around it, but glowing sort of within itself.  in the second it flew directly over my vehicle, at what was seemingly an exact 45 degree angle to my car (remember, i'm heading north), i looked upward over the steering wheel, to see that the object was actually a living being, glowing white, and at the last split second i looked up, it turned its head slightly and looked down directly at me. since it was moving at what i estimated to be at least as fast as i was moving in the opposite direction, i could not make out much detail, except to say that i noticed that it had two huge black eyes.  no wings were visible, as i immediately tried to rationalize what it was that i had just seen.  the rio grande flyway is very close to this location, and i initially thought i saw a great snowy owl, and thought it may have been on a migratory journey.  the more i thought about this explanation, the more i couldn't resolve in my mind the fact that it was not only moving at such a high rate of speed, but also that as it moved it did not waver, as a bird will do, but seemed to be mechanical in its flight path.  the owl hunch also didn't account for the fact that it was self-illuminated, and that there were no wings visible.  it passed over my car at an estimated 100-200 feet in elevation, as there was no real scale to compare it to.\r\n\r\ni tried to reason this away for days afterwards, but kept coming up empty with a rational explanation.  two weeks after the initial sighting, i was heading down the mountain pass from magdalena, nm toward socorro, again from another gig with the band, and this time, i wasn't alone, as the band was travelling in two other vehicles behind me.  something caught my eye at about 9o'clock high outside the car, and i watched in amazement for a few short seconds, as the same being was again coming toward me (at the same 45 degree angle to the road), only this time it was significantly lower, possibly only 5o feet above the car. i again peered upward over the steering wheel at the last split second, and again, the thing turned its head and looked at me with its big black eyes.  even though it was alot closer overhead this time, i still could not make out much detail, except to say that the body seemed to be almost trapazoidal, with it tapering toward the head, and being about five times longer than the head, which was also huge compared to the body size, and had definate bilateral symmetry along its length.  again, there were no wings to report. when we (the band and i) arrived at the \"circle-k\" convenience store in socorro for our usual \"string cheese\" party a few minutes later, i asked if anyone else had seen \"something\" fly over my car on the way down the mountain. \"yes\" was the answer from the two riding in the car behind me...This was the rythum guitar player and his wife.  when i asked them what it was, they said they didn't know, that \"it probably was some kind of big bird or something\".  they did admit it was moving really fast, and also it was comforting for me in a sense that someone else identified this as possibly a bird, which supported my initial rationalization from the first sighting.  again, i remained unsettled about this second sighting, for again, it was self-luminated, and displayed no wings. also, why would i happen to have the same thing happen to me two weeks later in a totally different place?  it was about 1 1/2 hours driving time between the two sites, although alot shorter in a straight course, however.  i started to become a bit paranoid about this fact, and began to feel \"targeted\" or \"stalked\" by whatever this thing was.\r\n\r\nabout two weeks after this, the band was having a practice at our recording studio, which was at the house of two band members, in south belen, nm.  i had my son james, then 5, and daughter amy, then 3, along with me.  the studio was located about 25 feet or so away from the main house on the property. there was a porch light above the side door of the house, which had an eaved roof over the doorway...  at one point my daughter said she ahd to use the bathroom, so i asked james to please take his sister in to the main house.  we played through a song twice, say about 5-6 minutes, and i began to wonder why it was taking the kids so long to come back outside.  as i was ready to leave the studio, both of the kids came running inside the studio door, screaming at the top of their lungs, my son james excitedly told me that he saw a \"creature\" above the door.  we all immediately went outside to see if we could see anything, and james then described what he saw: he said it had a pair of arms, wings, and clawed feet, big dark eyes, and big ears. it bent over toward them as they approached the house, and put one of its hands up to its mouth, then james said it \"spoke\" to them, saying, \"shhh...Be quiet!\", prompting james and amy to quickly run into the house via the front porch and front door, so amy could use the bathroom.  james said he stood guard in front of the door, until amy was done...Then they both ran as fast as they could back to the studio. \r\n\r\nafter this incident, i was sure i was being targeted, but also began to feel angry, as now this was somehow involving my family.\r\n\r\nabout a month passed from this third incident, when the band played a gig in mountainair, nm., the annual 4th of july ball.  i had been stung by a fire ant that night as we were unloading our equipment, so that night is also memorable for another reason, as it stung me in the groin area, and i was in excrutiating pain for several hours into the show. while on a break, i was talking to the drummer about all the things which had happened re\r\nlative to the sightings. he asked me if i ever thought i'd see it again, and i told him i had a \"wierd feeling\" that i would see it that very night.  i was riding with the rythum guitar player and his wife, who was driving their vehicle at the time, as we headed home from mountainair. i was seated in the back seat, along with their daughter. only a mile or so out of town, the wife screams to her husband, \"what is it?\"  the rythum player says, \"oh, it's just an owl\"...This of course, woke me right away from my semi-state of sleep in the back.  i looked out the front of the car, seeing a large, white thing swoop down toward the car, head back up again slightly, then dive right toward the windshield.  as the entire windshield became totally bright white, the wife took both her hands off the wheel to shield herself from the \"inevitable\" breaking of the windshield.  luckily, the rythum player grabbed the steering wheel at the last second, as we were going about 60-65mph at the time, and the road here is really winding.  in an instant, there was nothing ahead of the car except total blackness of night, and we drove home, all of us shaken up from what just happened.\r\n\r\nas the years have passed, i have never again seen anything which i cannot explain in my experience, and have never had any similar encounters with anything like this. i have read compellingly similar accounts, and seen similarities with some sightings on ufo shows on tv since then. one such account i read in a book only a few years ago, \"the goblins of hopkinsville\", where alien beings are described to be similar to what my son james described, and also that they \"fly\"...Also that they were perched on roof eaves as well. \r\n\r\nthe sightings of \"el chupacabra\" also i have found to be of interest, and\r\ncan even relate to seeing a cattle mutilation post-mortem while doing geological field work in colorado in the summer of '75.  a few years after my sightings, a neighbor of mine in bosque, nm, where i lived for a short time, relayed a story of how he shot at a creature who was flying from limb to limb on a nearby tree (next to my property), and he was unable to hit it with his shotgun, as it was moving too fast. the name \"chupacabra\" wasn't even mentioned while he told his story, albeit he is of local hispanic heritage. \r\n\r\nanyway, to this day, i still don't know what the heck i saw out there in the desert, and i still am at times a bit unnerved by the idea that i was the apparent target of this thing's interest. thank you for your attention to this account, and i will be glad to answer any more questions as best as my memory can muster. i will be sending a typed document of the account done in 1998 to james carrion as soon as i can get a copy made.","distance":"20

witnessed by myself and my mother. i was approximatly 13 yrs old but remember it as if it happened yesterday.\r\nas a hobby me and my mother would lay in our lounge chairs and stare at the night sky when no moon was present and shut all lites off. the stars were viewed incredibly! \r\nwe did this and would be able to actually count what we figured to be satillites. star like objects slowly moving across the night sky passing stationary stars. some nights we would count as many as half a dozen within a few hours. this was our hobby for years!\r\non night .. all of a sudden... the biggest falling star we ever witnessed came streaking down from the sky.\r\nbut then to our shock.. it stopped and started hovering and became the size of a dime in the sky. it was very bright.. started changing colors...And we could even make out uniform lights circleing around it. as it was changing colors it was very slowly making a u-turn. upon its full u-turn it turn a bright white and shot back out to the stars the same way it came in.\r\nthe inceident took about less than 5 minutes in total.\r\nme and my mother were holding each others hands in shock.\r\ni felt some fear along with shock which soon turned to a smile on my face. i didnt want it to leave.\r\nto make a long story short...Less than a week later a dutch naval vessel was docked at the town peir. it look so funny to see such a big ship at such a small pier.\r\nthere was on man who my mother identified as a high ranking officer if not the captain himself. holding my hand my mother walk up to him and said,\" i have been coming to this island since im a little gir, and i never seen a ship like this come to the island. why are you here? \" his answer was they were searching for a fallen satallite. my mother then stated,\" no your not! me and my son saw exactly what your really looking for,.. a couple of days ago clearly in the night sky!\" he look at my mother...Then looked down on me.... and said to my mother leaning over close to her ear and with a low volume voice and said, \" well why dont you both do your best to try to keep that to yourselves.\" he then walked away.\r\ni will never forget

note is the fact that i was with someone else and we both saw/watched it for about 20 minutes.  i haven't seen her in 10 years or more.  last i heard she lived somewhere in so. cal.  her name is/was melody nelson.  \r\nwe were out on the beach at folsom lake.  it was well after dark.  the lake itself was closed and we had hiked down from over where my folks house was.  not a public access.  we were splitting a six-pack, talking, and making out, but mostly talking and looking at the stars.  \r\nwe noticed a small light down on the water.  i figured it was a litle fishing boat because you would see more of it than just the light if it were any bigger.  plus it was out in the middle of the lake so i know it wasn't a person.  it was definately moviung along the water, very slowly.  we didn't think much of it , just watching it, and not really thinking it was anything, but it was in our scope of vision.  it got a little closer so we started watching it and talking about it.  suddenly it just darted across the lake faster than you could go by boat or even fly.  it was as fast as your eyes could follow. then it just kept going slowly again.  like it was looking for something.  then it darted again,across the lake.  this is about 1/2mile movements in less than a second.  we both saw it several times, and we both sensed 'it' knew we were there but didn't care.  (maybe it didn't)\r\nwe both knew it was either some top secret thing or a ufo.  we weren't scared because we knew we were with someone to validate that it wasn't just us.  i've always known it was a ufo, and always knew if she was asked, she'd say the same thing.  if you do ever find her, and ask her about it, you might jar her memory by reminding her we went to my folks' house after and had sex in the living room. i didn't last long and she was a little bit frustrated (i made it up to her, when i saw her next at the ten year reunion).  also,give her my contact info, please. \r\nthanks, jim","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5988,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.7290838,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262006-0032","longitude":-121.2261284,"occurred":520498800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":520498800000,"summary":"Two people witness object at lake","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Roseville, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483855"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Las Vegas","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was visited by the mit they had tan suits in 1968 the man came into the\r\nplace where i was working and said that i was being invetigated by the \r\nhouse ways means committie on unamerican activities i can prove it\r\n\r\n                                             sp gray","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":5987,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.121256,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262006-0031","longitude":-115.164456,"occurred":-40842000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-40842000000,"summary":"I saw the disc over nellis afb when i sighting in my telescope at the water tower","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Las Vegas, Nevada","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483856"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"DC","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was out front of my mothers house one night smoking a cig and staring at the stars.It was so clear out that night, then i noticed what looked to me like a star moving and i wasnt a falling stat or anything this just kept going .Im not sure how fast but to be that high it seemed kinda fast.My eye sight is good and i wasnt tired. plus ive seen this before sitting on a golf course with a friend, he saw it too .The problem i found with watching this thing is there are so many stars out and it looks just like a star that glancing away for just a few seconds u will loose it .","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5986,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4775575,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262006-0030","longitude":-77.4182414,"occurred":1164268800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1164268800000,"summary":"It looked just like one of the stars but moving and i watched it for like 20 mins","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"DC, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:483857"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2573}
