it was a nice night, so i decided to take her along my usual route.  \r\n\r\ni walked out onto my driveway and saw the object in the sky.  it was hard to see, because it was so dark, but it was rectangular, black, with five white lights in an x-shaped pattern.  there was a strobing white light on the top and a strobing red light in the middle.  the way it appeared to my eyes, it was flying just over the tree tops - not literally, but in the way it appeared.  at first, i thought it was a plane.  planes fly over my neighborhood all the time, both in the day and at night, so this didn't seem to be anything unusual.  but then i stopped walking and noticed that it didn't make any noise.  i wasn't quite sure of its altitude and size, but i knew for a fact it was either flying low and average size (about a single engine prop plane), or flying high and big (passenger jet size).  i'm inclined to believe the former, but once again, i'm not sure.  in either situation, i knew the plane should have made more noise than it did.  i thought i heard the sound of a plane at first, but there were a couple other planes flying higher up, and it was a little windy.  but as it flew further east, there was no noise whatsoever.  \r\n\r\nmy mind was completely empty; i was very mindful throughout the whole experience.  the only sounds were the sounds of cars in the background (i live in a suburban area near a road that is used often).  it was moving at a slow, constant speed, very smoothly.  it never sped up or slowed down.  as it flew further east, it gradually disappeared from sight.  i continued my walk, trying to make sense of it.  i'm still debating with myself whether it was a plane or something else.  i don't know.  it was the noise that really did it for me.  planes, even small ones, make lots of noise.  i'm not on expert on aircraft, but that i know.  \r\n\r\ni waited about a week to report this, because frankly i think people would think i was crazy.  after doing some research, this is the only organization i believe i can report this to and be taken seriously at the same time.  i don't want to talk about it on some random internet forum, because a lot of those people are prejudiced and will believe almost anything.  it hasn't affected my life that much.  i've been continuing on without obsessing over it.  but i just thought somebody should know.  if you absolutely have to contact me, i would prefer email, please.  i don't want this to be common knowledge.  once again, thank you for your time.  i hope i can be of some help in your research.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\ndan crowley   ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":5983,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.0697771,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262006-0027","longitude":-88.1013687,"occurred":1166416800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectagular,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1166416800000,"summary":"Walking my dog, saw object above trees;

and looked at it.  it hovered behind us for several minutes, then moved off to the south slowly.  we actually watched one from our front porch one evening, and i called the sheriff's department to see if they could identify it.  they said that they could not.  these lights have been seen by many people in that area, and there is one story of a very close encounter to, according to him a space ship.  he was a teen age boy, and for years, he was afraid to go out by himself after dark, after this encounter.  i am a commercial pilot, and have never, in over a half century seen any ufo, while in an

over deep woods, south and west of the city of emory, texas.  if you should go to the flats community, just ask anyone about the lights.  they'll tell you.  the lights seem to appear. and ,move around

and i can clearly remember saying \"god, look at the moon\" and greg looks up from what he was doing, at the same time i glance over to where he's standing and realize that the moon is over there, to my left!! this thing what ever it was, looked about twice the size of the moon and it made no sound. at first it was very still, then began to slowly move untill it was directly across from us and above the field. then it began to slowly lower, straight down, and the intensity of the light, still circular in shape but as it lowered it suddenly went from huge to about the size of a car. we watched it untill it went slowly down behind some thickets but i could still see where it was from the red light which then began a strobe like sequence of flashing and intensity of the light would go bright, brighter, brightest then repeat still no sound at all! i felt like i could'nt look away from it and when it began the strobing i felt this overwhelming urge to go toward where it was, but i managed to turn away from it and looked over at my friend.  he was absolutly fixated on it like a transe or thousand yard gaze!! i turned and ran. i just left my friend standing there staring. about ten or twenty minutes later , began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt for leaving greg so, i started back toward where he was. we met about half way and although he could hear me run away greg seemed to have lost track of the amount of time and also couldnt say what happened to the light or really didnt have any recollection of what happened (after i left his presence). i asked him a million questions but greg seemed to think that he almost immediatly turned and followed me when in reality it was actually some time..We were in the seventh grade when this happened and it was like early 1980 january or febuary and i will never forget it!!

address.\r\n this is more of a group of sitings that spans at least a decade. \r\n1. first siting: now im not sure about this first story. i was so young at the time that i have a hard time telling wether it was a dream or reality. \r\nits more like an impression.\r\n at the time i was living in mississippi. in a little town called clinton. \r\n as a 5 or 6 year old child i tended to be more of the fearfull type. didnt like the dark or any thing else i was uncertin of. \r\n now, i can remeber that i did for sure take a bath. as i did every night befor i went to bed. every thing from there is kind of fuzzy but ill explanin as best i can.\r\n i remeber i woke up about 9pm. i started walking from my room to the front door. i look over at my dad, who was up watching tv and its like hes looking at me but not doing anything. \r\n i opened the door and walked out. this was very strange considering i was scared of the dark and my father would have stopped me im sure. \r\n when i got out side there were 4 to 6 silver dollar sized ordbs of red light. they seemed to orbit each other and then thats it and i woke up in my bed.\r\n but heres where it gets strange. my feet were slightly dingy. as if i had been walking on concreat bare foot. which i was, or was i?\r\n i told my dad but he said i had a dream but it felt like so much more.\r\n\r\n2. secound story: now, the first story didnt have any signifigance untill that is i moved to clarston, michigan. \r\n i know the exate date on this one. july 4th 1995 or 96. i was about, anywere from 12 to 14 years old.\r\n i was walking around my nieghborhood(appartment complex) looking at people lighting fire works.\r\n i was walking back to my apartment and there was a property fence straight in front of me. i saw this red ball that was about the size of a soccer ball. it slowly floated to the ground behind the fence. i ran to see what it was because it was like no firework id ever seen. \r\n i ran up to the fence and pulled my self up so i could take a peak at what it was but there was nothing. no singed grass. no smell of black powder. nothing.\r\n i ran and told my dad and of course \"it was probobly a firwork\" he said.\r\nand thats were this ends and a new begins.\r\n\r\n3. third story: a few mounths after the secound story i had another run in with this red ball.\r\n i remember i had got a good report card from school and my dad said that i could get this junior circutry kit from radio shack. that i had my eye on for somtime. similar to this http://www.Radioshack.Com/product/index.Jsp?Productid=2102913&cp=2032062.2032398.2032405&parentpage=family \r\n when i got home i went right to work. i made a motion circute that detected motion. i set it up next to the door of my room and called in my dad to see if it would work. my dad walked in an a high pitched screach pored from the tiny speaker.\r\n proud of what i had done, i placed the circute i built right under my bed and went to sleep.\r\n i awoke to the sound of my motion circute. \"strange, i thought i turned that off.\" i thought. so i reached down and removed the wires from the battery. as i was rising back up to lay down, i saw a red glow comming from the window that was next to my bed. i stuck my fingers in between the blinds and pulled down. this red ball was inches from my face. only a thin piece of glass came between me and the ball.\r\n then it was like i woke up from a dream. and considering the other sitings ive had, i would say it was real.\r\n i didnt tell my dad about this one cause he wouldnt have beleved me anyway.\r\n \r\n4. fourth story: now, it had been somtime since i had any other type of event happen. but a few years later. i was about 16 or 17. \r\n i was now living in a house. still in clarkston, michigan. \r\n i went out on to my back porch to have a ciggaret behinde my dads back. i lit the smoke and it was like i blinked and more than half the ciggaret was gone. ?. i had no taste of tobacco in my mouth no smell of smoke and the ash was still there, still hangging loosly to the coal. i would say i have about 2 to 3 minutes that i cant account for. \r\n ive heard other people explain this happening to them and belevie they were abucted. \r\n after a day or so my big right toe started to itch. i scratched it so hars i made it bleed. after cleaning the wound i noticed a callis with a black dot deep in the center. ive heard stories about things being implanted inside people befor. and lot have been found in the foot.\r\n\r\n i can say in all insatnces, ive only seen this ball for in upwards of minutes. not very long at all.\r\n basicly i just want answers... ive found stories of there red balls that have been seen since the late 1800's. so i know im not crazy.\r\n thank you for listening to what i have to say and i hope i hear back from sombody.","distance":"20 Feet or

marker 70 (30 miles south of columbus) when i noticed a bright white light off to the left (east) side of the road.  at first i thought it was an airplane because i saw a center white light with two smaller lights on either side of the object, like landing lights on wings.  also, i could tell there was at least one blinking light on the bottom, which appeared red.  as i got closer i could tell the object was stationary at an altitude of approximately 300 feet and a distance of perhaps a ��� mile off of the highway.\r\n\r\nwhen parallel to the object i could tell this was definitely not an airplane, due to being stationary, and definitely not a helicopter, due to several bright white lights being on top of the object as well.  at this distance i could still not determine the exact shape of the object, but could tell that it had very intense white lights on all surfaces, a red blinking light on the bottom and perhaps a blue blinking light on the bottom.  due to the blinking lights i was not very suspicious since blinking lights usually signal to me that it is some type of known aircraft.\r\n\r\nas i continued south i saw 11 more of these objects, all between mile marker 70 and 50, for a total of 12.  all had the same description as the one above and all were stationary between 200 and 400 feet off the ground and from ��� to 1 mile off to the left the road.  most were somewhat equally spaced in distance as i traveled down the road, but i saw one occurrence of 3 in a triangular pattern with a distance of maybe a ��� mile in between each.  this area of ohio is mostly flat open farmland with small gatherings of houses and buildings (maybe 4 or 5 in a group).  all of these objects seemed to be above these groups of houses.\r\n\r\nwhen i approached mile marker 50, i hadn���t seen one of these objects in perhaps 5 miles when i suddenly noticed one off to the left again but this one was moving parallel to i-71.  after a mile or so the object turned southeast and left the area very quickly, followed closely by 3 more of these objects.  they finally faded out of side just before mile marker 50.  i believe these to be objects that i had previously seen so i did not add them to my count.  this was the last i saw of these objects that morning.  i was heading out of state at the time and returned at the end of the week.  while out of town i thought about what i had seen and came upon the idea that these may have been the tops of radio or other communications towers and i would look for these the next time i traveled through the area.  i was skeptical of this idea however since i looked for frames under the lights but could not see anything.\r\n\r\non friday, june 16, 2006 i traveled back through the area at approximately 10 p.M. going northbound.  i began watching the skies around mile marker 50 to see if any of these objects remained.  i saw several radio towers, but all of these had blinking red lights along their frames and these frames were easily visible in the dark.  i approached mile marker 60 near jeffersonville and still had not seen anything when i noticed 2 lights on the left side (west this time) of i-71 and they looked very similar to what i had seen earlier in the week.  these lights were still about 5 miles ahead of me perhaps around mile marker 65.  \r\n\r\nas i got closer i could see the lights better and they were on the west side of 71 approximately ��� mile apart and much to my surprise, one was slowly moving out overtop 71.  even more to my surprise i knew i was going to be driving directly under the object.  the object was a very pronounced ���v���, with large circular blue lights running along the entire bottom of the shape, perhaps 6 or 7 on each length of the ���v���.  on the tip of the object, there was a flashing red light on the bottom.  the leading edges of the object were covered with bright white lights as well as the top.\r\n\r\ni was not the only person to see this object, since i noticed several truckers and motorists looking up.  realizing that i was now going only 40 mph as well as a few people around me, i became aware that this object could perhaps cause an accident.  because of this fact, and the fact that i now needed a new pair of pants, i called the state police and talked to the sergeant on duty at the wilmington branch.  he was very professional and said he would have a trooper report to the area immediately.  \r\n\r\ni do not know if anything was ever reported by the state police, or if anything else ever came of the situation, i left the area very quickly and have only been back through during the day.  if anyone doubts my thoughts and views on this matter, please let me give you a bit of my background so perhaps you can understand my reasoning.  i am a mechanical engineering student at the university of cincinnati, so i understand the basics of what is and isn���t possible with aircraft.  i grew up near the naval air station in pensacola, florida where my father was stationed with the marines in the air wing.  over the years i have seen my share of aircraft fly ranging from biplanes, wwii era prop fighters and bombers, to modern day fighters and bombers including the f-117 stealth fighter, b-1 and b-2 bombers, and specialty aircraft such as the sr-71 blackbird and uavs such as the predator.  besides fixed wing vehicles, i have also seen several examples of helicopters from loaches, hueys, blackhawks, apaches, cobras, and chinooks, to private crafts like medivacs, and other search and rescue craft.  being from east central ohio i have had my encounters with blimps (goodyear) and with hot-air balloons too. \r\n\r\ni know that this area that i was traveling through is in the approach and exit patterns for wright-patt air force base and port columbus international, but i have never seen any fixed wing aircraft that can hover or move as slowly as these objects did, or any other aircraft with this distinct shape and light pattern.  hopefully someone else saw these events too. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

now\". my brother and i jumped out of the car so my dad could drop off my mother.My mother did not want us to get out but the amazement made us do it anyways. we told our dad to grab the camera and come back. my dad took off peeling the wheels as he left. as soon as the car was gone there was no noise. nothing at all. the object had moved closer to us and was floating right over the pond. it was right at tree level so you could see it really well. it was black with a white light glowing at each corner. i think after the shock and wonder wore off we starting getting scared. my dad was not back yet and we were out in the country by ourselves with this thing. my brother and i started to run towards our house and next thing you know it was following us. it came over the street and followed us 1/4 mile. my dad pulled up and right then it started back over the trees. we tried our best to follow it but it got away. this is not the first or last experience that i have had, but it is one that i had more than just myself there to witness it. all that i can say is that i have never been able to forget the feeling of wonder and fear that i had at the moment we sat there and watched this thing float around without a sound.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

an hour an object that would dart from one horizon to the other and at amazing speed. and at dofferent altitudes. it would move at right angles as well.\r\n\r\nthe real amazing thing is this object moved slowly from the horizon to a position exactly over our ice fishing house on the lake. there it hovered for seemed like forever, probably 20 minutes. it was straight over head. it made no noises

(i found out later that i had my thumb over the lens.) right after i started recording, the lights quickly faded until they dissappeared. i put up the cell phone and we kept driving in astonishment. a couple of minutes later, the three lights lit up again and began to rotate. this time, i quickly pulled the truck over on the shoulder and came to a stop while getting out the cell phone. i started recording before the truck came to a stop and immediately the lights began to dissappear, one by one. the footage is very rough because i was stopping an 18 wheeler and jumping out at the time, but i did catch one of the lights on the footage. we stood out there in front of the truck for at least ten minutes waiting for it to happen again so we could get a clean shot but it never did. we kept our

plastic kite flying in the sky to our northwest.  my first instinct was that it was a large kite that had broken loose from its string, but then upon starring at it, it began to move against the wind and started radiating a colorful swirl withing its exact diamond shaped structure.  the best description of the multi-colors i was observing was comparing it to spilt gasoline on top of water. it was as brightly colored as a rainbow but the colors swirlled in a random pattern within the diamond.  after a few seconds or so, i realized the object was probably not solid and i wanted someone else to verify what i was seeing so i hollered to my cousin and my brother who were in the field to look.  they ran to me and i pointed out the object.  we all stood in silence for a few seconds, then looked at each other.  the object appeared to be about 100 yds away and maybe 100' off the ground. i used a line off power poles to gauge the height and distance.  we decided to chase it for some unknown reason.  as we approached the object it went higher in the sky and randomly and quickly moved in numerous directions.  we wondered why it was moving away from us. as we stopped to catch our breath it began to grow in size or come closer, couldn't tell which ,then it shot north at the speed of a lightning bolt and disappeard.  we ran back to the house to tell our parents, but they all laughed. the strangest thing about viewing this object was that it seemed semi-clear but had a perfect diamond shape.  seems impossible. it was not a \"sun-dog\", i have seen many of these around the sun.  the object was viewed during a thunderstorm while the sky was full of lots of clouds and the sun was not directly visible. my best guess as to the size of the object was that it was about 6' wide by 6' tall. after telling our parents and calming down we went back to the hilltop about 30 minutes later to look for the object with some more cousins, but we saw nothing. my cousin and brother all agree about the size, shape, color, speed, and distance of the oject.  we have not been able to explain this observation at all.","distance":"101-500
