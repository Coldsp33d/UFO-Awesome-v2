my ufo education. i was taught how to spot them in the sky. i was taught to differentiate between them and stars, satellites, planets and planes. they simulate these things so that it is easier to drift thru our skies. \r\n\ti was living alone although cayce (kayceo) did come to live with me that year. i began to notice that a certain star would appear and disappear at the same times each night while the other stars would remain still. this one particular star also did things that the others never did. it shot out little orange lights and hovered. it also communicated with other red lights in the sky. i assume that these were smaller related vessels. i didn���t know much about ufo���s at the time but i did have a firm belief in the probability of their existence. i was 18. \r\n\ti remember watching them while outside on my balcony. one night i asked, ���what do you want from us? why can���t you just leave us alone?��� that���s very funny to me now. anyway i turned around to go inside after asking the strange star that question and before i could get both feet in the door i heard a loud mail voice in my head say, ���it���s an integral part of being.��� i repeated what i had just heard a couple of times aloud. i ran to the dictionary to look up the word integral because i didn���t know what it meant. it means necessity for completeness. thank you but the last thing i expected to receive was a response. from that point on i trusted that the strange stars were not stars at all.  \r\n\tin 1998 i channeled for the first time in my life. i was now living in venice, ca. i was on my way out the door of my friend strider���s  house when suddenly some dear old friends began to chime in. i call them the intergalactic federation of light. beings of light and love from all over this universe and beyond whose job is to help maintain order without interfering very much or at all. this meeting had been pre-planned and was not in any way an intrusion into my reality. i expected it and welcomed them. they were very excited and speaking over each other. i became flustered and asked that they speak one at a time. strider asked questions. he asked when they would be coming to see us. we felt that we needed to see them because although we believed and knew that they were real, we also knew that our logical minds would need more proof before being able to truly accept the reality of their being without doubt or question.  strider offered to meet them in the desert. i rejected that proposal since the ocean was much closer. one of the entities said, ���ok see you soon. one month by the lagoon.��� three weeks later i asked strider the virgo if it had yet been a month and he snapped gruffly, ���no, it���s only been three weeks!��� the following friday (sometime i think in november of 1998) my friend and co-worker charlie, led strider and i up the side of this hill just past topanga canyon over pch. charlie also brought two dogs. egypt and i could never remember that other dogs name. charlie was not too aware of ufo���s but she was open to it. strider was working at ufo central in venice at the time and i was working at the psychic eye as was charlie. \t\r\n    as soon as the sun went down i spotted the first one. as usual strider proceeded to argue with me about it. he tried to tell me that it was just a star. he put his hand up as if to measure it against the other stars in the sky and at that very moment all the stars over our heads fell out of the sky and disappeared. that tripped me out because i really had thought that those were all stars. then in my head i hear someone say, ���that was the first of 80���. after that we saw so many different types of craft. it was really awesome. there was telepathic communication going on throughout the experience. we had sat and watched the flight paths for a while before the sun went down so we new that these craft were not on the flight paths. we saw what looked like the mother of the stealth bomber. we also saw a large craft that looked exactly like  a rocket ship except that it flew side-ways like an airplane. we saw one really large round ship with lights all around it. we saw one very odd craft. it looked like one of those 4th of july sparklers. it was long and skinny stick like craft which had big bright sparklers at each end. i have seen a similar effect on planes but those sparklers flash these did not. so many craft. there were also orbs, little robotic spies. the list goes on and on. i can hardly remember all the different types of craft that we saw. at one point we were sitting me in the midddle, strider at my left and charlie at my right. we were all looking in different directions at one point while trying to get the others attention. this seemed to go on for hours. strider says about two hours although i felt like we were out there for six. at some point strider walked away into the darkness. he was gone for about ten minutes before i began to worry about him and yell his name. suddenly charlie, the dogs and i hear footsteps. i yell out, ���strider, is that you?��� no response. ���strider?��� \r\n\r\n\r\nsuddenly the figure coming toward us came into view. it looked as if the mountain was coming toward us. the dogs growled. charlie and i confirmed that we were both seeing the same thing. the closer the figure got the clearer it became. strider who was wearing a tan poncho, looked as if he had camouflaged with the natural surroundings and the mountain. he smiled deviously. i said sarcastically, ���why didn���t you answer me? you shit, you scared us. you totally morphed with the mountain it was crazy it looked like the mountain was walking toward us.��� close to the end of the night i realized that some of our friends were probably around us and yet undetectable to our eyes. soon after that realization we began to see what i call the invisible people. i say invisible because you could only see the outlines of people it is difficult to explain.  we began wandering around the mountain that we were on. we began to notice that certain spots were much warmer than others. we could walk in and out of these warm spots or stand half in and half out. it was strange. after a while the warm spot would get cold and we would move until we found another one. we did that a few times before we left.\r\n\tthe last event of the evening was when i was told telepathically that someone was waiting to meet us at the top of this hill. i lead our group to the hill and began walking up it. i had not given charlie or strider any explanation for why we were walking up the side of a mountain without a path but they gladly followed none the less. about a quarter of the way up i decided not to continue. i stopped and turned around. at that moment strider screamed, ���damn it!!!��� i jumped and said, ���what?!��� then he said, ���they just told me that it was up to you if we would go and you stopped and turned around.��� i just smiled and apologized. i wasn���t in the mood for poison ivy and mountain climbing besides we had a great night and i wasn���t sure if we were already overloaded on the experience. so i just decided to take a rain check with our friends. i���d like to take this moment to thank them.  thanx���.\r\n\tby the way, strider went back to work at ufo central that monday. he and his co-workers received many strange activity in the sky reports from people in the topanga/ malibu area.\r\n\t\r\nthe woman with no white around her eyes���.\r\n\r\n\tabout one month or so after the ufo sightings over pch  (approximately december 98��� or january 1999) i had an encounter with a woman from another world. i was working at the psychic eye bookshop at the time. it was probably a sunday because i liked to work in the annex on sunday���s. the annex was the used section of the bookstore. i was standing behind the counter at the register as was strider and paul. strider was to my right and paul was to his right.  paul was always skeptical about our sightings. three years after this incident, it occurred to me that i could have totally gotten fired for allowing the guys back behind the counter. it was not something i normally would allow but in hind sight the only way the fellas would have been able to see what was about to take place. suddenly a very tall, thin caucasian woman came around the corner from the main side of the store. i knew that she was headed right for me. she was bald, wearing sunglasses, a white wife beater, khaki shorts and sandals. she was also holding a stack of flyers. as she began to speak to me she took off her glasses. strider and paul for once were silent. she asked me if she could put her flyer up on our bulletin board. i, always surprised at how calm i can be in extraordinary situations, casually responded by saying, ���no, i���m sorry that is only for our psychics. people ask all the time.��� she said thank you. put on her sunglasses and left. paul started talking as if he hadn���t just seen what we know he did so strider and i at the same exact time said woe woe woe back it up. it took paul a couple years to admit to me that there was something very odd about the tall lady. strider and i spoke about where she may have been from. why? because although her eyes were shaped like a human���s, they were anything but. as a matter of fact they looked like the eyes of a grey alien. where we have pink her eyes were charcoal grey. there was no white around her eyes either. they were a filmy black color with a slimy looking texture. definitely not hollywood makeup. i grew up around the biggest special effects guy in hollywood and this was not his work. unfortunately we never got a look at the flyer because we were too busy being mesmerized by her eyes.\r\n\tabout an hour later i was sitting outside taking a break when i spot that woman walking with a man and a tiny chihuahua. they were walking down main street in venice toward rose ave. i was across the street thinking about how odd they appeared. they were both wearing identical outfits and they were like carbon copies of each other. both the exact same height and build. both bald. the only difference was that you could tell one was female because she had breasts. they appeared to be acting as if they were boyfriend and girlfriend but once i realized that we didn���t have male and female identical twins on this planet i knew that they were alien. i immediately began speaking to them telepathically. without a word, i said, ��� i know that you can hear me. i know that you can read my thoughts.��� at that very moment they both stopped and turned and looked at me in unison. i said, ���thank you. thank you very much.��� and they walked away.\r\n\tone week after that while sitting in my car at lunch with jaeneen the store manager, i had another encounter. jaeneen and i would often sit in my car (ethal may) during lunch. we rarely ever spoke or listened to music. we were just so happy to be away from the madness of the bookstore that we would just sit in silence. this day we were parked in front of the ocean exactly two blocks away from the eye. i am the type of person who is always looking around and in my mirrors even while at a standstill. i had just did my momentary security sweep of the situation and there were no humans to be found in any direction. i had looked around, i looked in both my side mirrors and then finally my rear view. the moment that my eyes shifted away from the rear view mirror two car doors slammed. the tall woman, her identical male twin and the tiny chihuahua dog all got out of the green car behind us. the woman walked by my side in the street and gave me a glance. the man and the dog walked around the passenger side and down the sidewalk. perplexed i asked janeen if she had heard the car doors open. she said, ���no��� and i said, ���neither did i.���  a silly question because they literally had no time to get to the car, get in and then get out between the time i had looked away from the mirror and heard the car doors slam. then i asked.  ���do you remember me telling you about those people from earlier this week?��� jaeneen said, ���yes��� then i said, ���that���s them��� jaeneen just said ���nooo��� nervously. then she asked, ���what do you think they want?��� i said, ���i don���t know. i think they want to talk to me but either they aren���t ready to talk to me or they don���t think i���m ready to talk to them. either way as long as they keep walkin we���ll be alright.��� and they did. i haven���t seen them since. that was probably january of 1999. shortly thereafter i flipped out and quick that crazy job. i just couldn���t take anymore. there were so many strange occurrences at that place. one time a guy actually accused me of swelling up his feet. i���m not makin this stuff up. i promise. i���m not that creative. trust me. he said, ���i came into this store the other day and you walked by me wearing that star of david and now my feet are swollen.��� \r\ni wear a star of david religiously although i am currently jamaican irish french english african

a ufo?\"  i followed her out the door and immediatly saw a unfamiliar light in in the southeastern sky. it was over bear butte area in southern humbolt county. the light would rise in the sky and then seem to waft down like a falling leaf. all the time chaging color but more like several colors changing at once. the light appeared not to shine outside of itself. we watched it for approximatly 15 minutes. at 1820 i walked to my neighbors house and asked if he wanted to see. my wife and i have seen it on two other occasions in the past 4 weeks and had mentioned it to our neighbors. when we,returned we had to stand 15feet left of where we could we stood earlier to view the object. the object then started going back and forth, fast in a northerly direction then back south but moving very slow and steady.I then said aloud in a non-threatning voice \"we can see you, please give us a sign if you are real.\" the object emmited a bluish pink lighting like flash that filled the sky. just then my other neighbor came up and ask ,\" what the f was that. the four of us proceded to watch the ariel display for approx. 30 minutes. our visibility was getting poor due to storm system in the area. we loaded up in my truck to see if we could go up the ridge and get above the clouds. unfortunately we could not. however we could see the clouds illuminated , like the ambient light on the clouds over a small city, on the butte to our south. the illumination appeared to rise and fall in the bank of clouds. we watched this for more then an hour. by now it was raining heavily so we returned home. while we stood outside talking about our experience, that was spiritual for neighbor 2, and needed to rationly explained by neighbor 1, we heard two jet fly bys 30 seconds apart. we thought this odd because we have no airport withi 75 miles that supports jet traffic. also the weather seemed very bad for flying low. like i have said above we have seen this object on other occaisions. we know of at least 10 other people who have seen it ,some of whom see it frequently. yesterday i was encouraged to \"report it to mufon\"  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

beginning.\r\n\r\ni am a 30 year old male living in calgary alberta i moved here from the uk when i was 17 years old.  i guess this starts off when i was listening to coast to coast radio, they were talking about sightings, i find this subject very interesting as i had a sighting myself in montana driving back from grand forks n.D, with a friend  (he was attending university there) i have told this story many times to many people, it was summer 1997 late at night we had been driving straight and we were on a secondary highway no street lights, all of a sudden the stars started to blink out, i didn���t see the them directly, more out of my peripheral vision. i looked up and there was a massive noiseless  black triangle right above the car, my friend was sleeping i turned and shook him violently and shouted blake blake  look look, the craft was so fast by the time my friend came to it was disappearing over a hill or mountain range several miles away, without even cutting the air for noise, you could hear absolutely nothing from it. i asked my friend if he seen it, he said he seen nothing.\r\n\r\n i asked him the same question just this past summer, this time he said��� well he seen some lights but it could have been anything. i don���t know if he did see that the first time and just didn���t want to say, however i have told that story many times, but just recently for one reason or another it dawned on me, i don���t think i was driving a hundred plus kilometers an hour with the window down at night time and yet i know it was because the fact that there was no noise whatsoever was so irregular that that fact struck me like a hammer, not only that, now i think about it i don���t remember stopping the car i do remember looking up at it through the ���open window��� and getting a good look at it, although i don���t remember it well which bothers me, and i know it was moving far to fast for me to get a good of a look as i did.\r\n\r\nmy memory seems to be irregular about this event, the little things don���t add up for me.\r\n\r\nlast year my wife and i were in bed, i was in that state where i was almost about to fall asleep when there was a great bright white blue flash in my room, i wasn���t sure if i had dreamed it i was about to ask my wife (not knowing if she was asleep or not) if she seen that? when she asked the same question, again no noise with the flash.\r\n\r\nthere are a few more things i won���t go in to, too many little details \r\n\r\ni just sent an email off inquiring about hypnotic regression do you think this is

towards the 134 interchange and to my left/west i saw a very odd sight.  the best i could make out was a helicopter with flashing lights/strobes and then what appeared to be another flying vehicle in front of it, possibly nose to nose.  please keep in mind that it was dark and i was at a distance of about a 1/4 mile, so i really couldn't make out any real shape of either vehicle.  the lights on the helicopter were as you would image, but the ufo had three constant lights in a triangular formation.  after nearly getting hit in traffic because i looking more at the lights than the road, i pulled into the breakdown lane.  from this vantage point i sat for approximately 2 minutes nearly across from them and watched the vehicles in their stationary position.  i'm new to the area, but i'm guessing these crafts were on the east side of where the griffith observatory would be - 1/4 mile west of the 5, past the colorado exit.\r\n\r\nwhile observing from the side of the road, the crafts appeared to be nose to nose, i couldn't hear any noise over the traffic sounds, and i'd guess they were in very close proximity, 20 feet or so.  these crafts sat stationary for a minute or so while i was parked and i didn't notice any movement between them for most of that time and then i began to see that there was a little more distance and shifting in positioning for about 20 seconds as they began to move north slightly - the distance shifting would have been something like under 20 feet.  at no time did i visually notice the ufo below, above or appearing to being suspended beneath the helicopter.    \r\n\r\nas the crafts continued to move faster to the northwest, they appeared to still be nose to nose and once they passed the 134/5 split they picked up a substanial amount of speed going to the northwest (helicopter fast).  my first thoughts about the helicopter and ufo was that it was nighttime filming and that the ufo was actually a filming platform, but if that was so, i would have thought it would have been suspended and by regulation should have had strobes on it.  furthermore, when i've seen filming by helicopters in the past (about 10 times while living in the glendale area), there are usually 3 helicopters involved and keeping a formation.  last night i scanned the skies while the crafts were stationary and as they flew away, and didn't see any other crafts in the immediate vicinity.  i did attempt a cellphone photo while i was across from it and it was stationary, but all i got was a black photo, no image appeared due to the distance.  \r\n\r\ni've had 2 or 3 other ufo sightings in the past 30 years of my life and will try to document them as soon as i can.  these other sightings occured mainly in great barrington, massachusetts,

friend derek.  this time we had an intellectual conversation regarding the interpretation of events in our realities and how useful it really is to define our experiences.  no matter how advanced the definitions might be, we may somewhat loose the experience in a mist of other visions.  we may loose the experience by intellectualising.  \r\n\r\nwe applied the argument to the experience and idea of merkabah in particular.  what became clear to me is that derek has seen wheels within wheels (spoken about in the bible) opening in the sky, and he believed.  at that stage, i was weary of definition, as i had not experienced something that had to be defined as merkabah only.  \r\n\r\nbut what a surprise it turned out to be the next morning when i had such an enriching experience of opening my eyes up and immediately gazing on something that made me eat my words.  i really felt that without the idea of merkabah i would not have been able to understand the beating heart of light that was flashing outside my window.  i had woken up without any conscious prefabrication and seen something undeniable that lasted for a half hour in the sky.\r\n\r\nin front of my very eyes hovered a sphere of immense dimensions (about an acre of sky) and it silently flashed brighter and duller for half an hour before i had to leave and get on with my busy day.  part of it was covered by a very, low-hanging cloud and it was bright enough at between seven to eight in the morning to light up the clouds with its distinct impression.  other than that cloud, there were no other clouds in the sky at all.\r\n\r\nafter the first five minutes i had to refresh myself in the bathroom and came back to the window after a few monites and after having splashed my face with cold water, only to realise that i had not been dreaming.  i checked to see where the moon and sun were and needless to say, they were in different places in the sky that morning.  i could see the object behind the cloud and showing itself between the puffs.  the light was not coming from a beam or anything of that nature.  it was made of light and the cloud in front of it slowly disappeared to reveal itself more and more throughout the experience.\r\n\r\njust two weeks before, a friend of mine (derek) and i were using the mantras connected with merkabah experiences in that very garden in \r\nriverclub.\r\n\r\nthe experience was such a shock that i found myself crying intermittently right through that day especially.  i wish i had broken my frozen stare when i went back to the window as my camera was in the next room and i would have a picture to show you.  it was due to amazement and shock that i didn't reach for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nseven green craft in formation\r\n\r\n\r\nmy most recent sighting was in september of 2004.  i was telling my friend justin about some of my sightings two weeks before and had a feeling he would see one soon.  to my amazement, looking out of my kitchen in linden, i noticed seven deep emerald lights flying in jaggered formation slowly across the sky in the distance.  we both observed the silent encounter in amazement.  it lasted about a minute or so.  then, within a half hour, another one of our friend's called from the suburb of morningside about six kms away and expressed that he had seen two of them more close-up.  he described two emerald-green chinese-lantern-like objects silently breeze past him in the sky above.\r\n\r\n\r\na bright ball of light in the sky\r\n\r\n \r\nsince prof hurtak's lectures and even earlier, i have always wanted to see flying craft of higher spiritual worlds:  aged about sixteen in 1983 my father and i were travelling north out of the city of johannesburg on the m1.  we had just come back from the cinema.  it was late december and most people were away visiting the coast for the holiday season, so the roads were very empty.  it was a little after midnight, and there was a drizzle coming down from low-lying clouds.  my father was driving, coming round a major bend in the highway.  for a while i observed a small light in the distance, what at first seemed like a low-flying aeroplane taking off or landing.  however, it staid in the sky under the canopy.  the light grew brighter as it got closer until it was very clearly visible above the car.  its path was smooth, and then it hovered for about ten seconds.  of course, we were driving and so i was leaning more and more forward in the car to avoid seeing the object through the blue visor-strip on the windshield.\r\n\r\nat that stage, i was not sure whether my father had seen it or not, and had refrained from saying anything in fear of ridicule.  but now i was sure this was nothing i had seen before.  it was a big, round ball of brilliant white light that seemed to be shinning inwards, and it did not emit a beam.  it was just sitting in the sky.  i had no option and said to louis, \"look dad!\"\r\n\r\nhe looked up and instantly the craft dashed diagonally down to the other side of the highway behind some bushes.  we both could scarcely believe the rapidity of this movement.  as he had not seen the craft stationary, the image left on his retina and upon his imagination was of a more elongated craft dashing towards the ground in preparation to crash in a big explosion.  he swerved the car across two lanes of highway throwing out his arm in front of me and shouting out by instinct.  he then proceeded to drive on, dazed and literally white in the face.  i could not persuade him to return immediately.  on arriving home, i persuaded wendy to backtrack.  it had gone, but the excitement of seeing it still lives on.\r\n\r\n\tsomeone switched the lights on in the sky\r\n\r\nabout a year and a half later, i saw something with two friends of mine, debbie and laurence, also while driving on the m1 north, but further out in sandton.  we observed normal, yellow-white lightning all around us as it was raining again, and had been for the last few hours.  \r\n\r\nlooking over the buildings in an industrial area on the left, suddenly we all saw a huge cloud suddenly lighting up with a more intense, blue-white light that seemed distinct from the thunder activity.  it might have been as much as half the horizon that was lit up as if in daylight, and we had now rolled back the sunroof to have a fuller look and slowed down the car to a halt. the light remained without flickering for about twenty seconds and then vanished.  it was so bright that the ground lit up bright enough to see the colours of the leaves on the trees and the green grass for all that time.\r\n\r\ni had half forgotten about this experience when i had walked into a cafe-come-market in about the year 2000 in the suburb of norwood.  i bumped into debbie who i had not seen since about the time of the experience.  she immediately reminded me of it, and i began to wonder why i had blocked it from my conscious mind.  i think that my schema could not incorporate an object of such magnitude floating above some clouds, or i couldn���t comprehend how clouds could light up that way all by themselves, and i had passed it off as some freak of nature or something. \r\n\r\n      fluorescent tube in the sky\r\n\r\nin late june 1999, i was at a party with lots of lights in a small garden of an acquaintance of mine (mark), and i began to feel uncomfortable with the low level of interactions i was observing.  i had a sensation that i was seeing through a weird social game and i thought of leaving.  i actually rolled my eyes and suddenly as i did so, i noticed a long cylinder about three times the size of a 747 with no windows, markings or wings but rather shining as a fluorescent light would.  it silently passed by for a brief moment (at most three seconds) and appeared from the bottom of one cloud moving in to another through a small gap in the canopy of clouds.  \r\n\r\nno one else at the party had any inkling of it being there and it was travelling just above the bottom end of the clouds.  it would really have looked like attention-seeking if i had mentioned something at the time.  there was nothing more to see and frustratingly enough, there was no one to tell.  i left very soon thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

2006, close to ten am. i was seated by the window and observed a weather front approaching from a distance. as we flew closer to the clouds deliniating the front i noticed a large round/ovoid opening in the clouds. the aircraft was above the clouds, clear skies at 20,000 plus feet. when we were what i would estimate to be within a mile of the opening in the clouds, i happened to look out my window again and saw what could be mistaken for nothing other than a large cross like object rising out of the opening. this object was perfectly straight, with a \"t-piece\" very near the top. the object appeared to be a dark reddish-brown in color. i observed the object for roughly ten seconds before i could no longer see it from my window. we were flying on a north-westerly track and the sunlight was coming from slightly behind my position on the starboard side of the aircraft. unfortunately, our airliner was not close enough to view the interior of the opening in the clouds where this object was rising up from. the object did not move. i was perplexed and fascinated by viewing something that by reasonable logic, should not have been there. also, having studied weather formations and knowing a bit about them, i found the large opening in the clouds quite odd. as a note, i had not had any alcohol during the flightand was completely sober and awake when i viewed this anomoly. unfortunately, my camera was in the overhead bin at the time of this event.\r\ni would be very interested in hearing if any one else has seen this type unusual event. feel free to contact me at

white vapor trail in the sky.��� she then added,���i thought it was the prettiest shade of baby blue, then, just as my car dipped down while going over the tracks, i saw all this white smoke pass in front of my windshield and crash into the ground. the only thing that stopped it from hitting my car was that the car dipped when i went over the tracks otherwise i���m sure it would have hit the

long about 5 mtrs high it just sat there like it was parked on the road we were speachless i was like in a trance then after about 10 minutes dark patches came all over the ship and small disc shaped craft came out from the dark holes and danced all around they looked about 1000cm across there were 10 in all they were playing it seemed, my freind got up and totally naked got out of the spa and ran inside screaming get inside but i couldn't move i was in total awe and i was saying to the ship come and pick me up in my mind but alais nothing happened i watched for ages i was so calm but so excited and so numb trance like then just as the curtain had opened it closed and it was black again. i will never forget that in all my life.My friend told me i was a silly bitch for staying i told her i was begging them to pick me up she will never forget it either i just wished i had my camera.\r\n\r\nanother time i was with my husband travelling 300 klm up the coast we had a convertable all

not beleive said it was a tractor but what farmer works in scrubland at 1 am and what tractor has such a huge light it blinds you and what tractor creates enough wind to flatten the cars roof by the time we got to our destiny the roof had sprung back but we had to drive for kls holding it up and if it wasn't raining softly we would have put it down. that night i got a bit

other people waiting for the store to open.  we were all aware that they would have the video game system we all wanted for xmas so we had to be in line before the store opened or we would not get it.  i showed up at 2:00 am and others arrived after that.  at 6:30 i happened to be looking south toward the city of guelph.  i saw what i thought at first was someone setting off a firework or flare.  a reddish orange ball shot up from the ground leaving a smoke trail underneath it.  when it reached it's apex in the air, it moved slowly east and then west and back to the east in a circle.  there was also a smoke trail of a circle where this manoever had occured.  then the object just blinked out and dissapeared.  i asked if anyone else in line had seen this and they all said yes.  there was many comments on how it was really weird.  there was no clouds in the sky that it could have gone behind or anything and like i said it did not shoot off in any direction it just dissapeared.  someone mentioned that they wondered if it was some sort of a plane that was having a problem.  someone else mentioned that they had heard there was solar flares occuring that day.  as all this commotion was going on the object suddenly appeared again exactly at the point where it had dissapeared.  this time though it was no longer red and orange it was a silvery colour.  the object had 2 red lights and a white light visible on it. then a bright white light shot out of it.  not towards the ground but out horizontally.  the light was brighter than any lights i have ever seen it was like a huge floodlight of some sort.  the light shone out from a single point but created a wide triangular like arc in the sky.  i then realised that i had my cellphone on me and i could take a picture of this object.  i fumbled getting out my cellphone to take a picture.  the object had now been visible this second time for approximately 30 seconds.  i snapped a picture of it and as soon as i snapped the picture about 1 second later it dissapeared again.  it did not shoot off real fast or anything, again it just dissapeared.  it left no smoke trail or anything showing which direction it went.  but the original smoke trail it left when it raised from the ground originally stayed visible for approximately 10 minutes.  none of us had ever seen anything like this before and none of us could explain away what it really was.  i do know one other person in line personally but i do not know who the other people are.  however when the store opened and we got our video game systems we all had to leave our name and phone number so zellers does have a record of everyone who saw this event if you would like to research this further.  i do not know how to get this picture to you but if you are interested in seeing this picture i still have it in my cellphone and if i am contacted you can explain to me how i can get this photo to you.","distance":"Over One

thought it was a helicopter until it stopped and enlarged to a circle about 50 feet across.The light was very bright white at first,then dimmed to a color that is hard to discribe,sort of a yellow orange.The size and color change happened together all at once.At this time i ask my wife to turn and tell me what she saw.She answered the moon, which i replied \"look over your head\" as the moon was above us.Next i asked what time is it? she told me the time and ask what the hell is that? i said what do you think it is? then the object started moving toward the kentucky side of the river.Stopping at the tree line.It appeared to turn and move back toward the ohio side of the river.About half way across it stopped suddenly as if it were aware we were watching it.Immediately upon stopping it shined a light on me the likes of which i have never seen.For lack of a better explaination i would call it a partical beam or like a bright white light with glitter all in it.My wife who was standing about twenty feet away off to the side of me said the beam came up my body feet first stopping above the knees and then retreated back to the object.The beam of light was just that a beam that only shone on me.The instant the light reached the object it vanished before our eyes.I am left with more questions about ufo's than i have ever had before.But one thing i can say i and my wife consider ourselves normal intelligent average everyday people.We saw something that we believe is not of this world.Also this sighting took place with the object only being fifty feet above the river and less than a mile away.During the sighting i got the distinct impression this is not good.After it left i wanted to stay and see if it would return.My wife felt uneasy and wanted to leave.We stayed about thirty minutes and left without incident.This is not my first encounter with lights up close and personal. however i have felt compelled to tell this story.Thanks. james d. packard  \r\np.S.The

 after, what felt like hours, the object took off at a 45 degree angle.  within seconds the object went from the size of half a football field to the size of one of the stars in the sky.  then it stopped moving and stood in one spot for a long period of time.  if we didn't see it prior to that, we would have confused it for one of the stars in the sky.  25 years later my brother, my cousin and myself were at a family reunion and were asked by other family members (who knew what we had saw years ago) for each of us to draw what we saw, and to draw the pictures while seated at different tables.  our drawings were basically identical.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":5923,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7239228,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12152006-0001","longitude":-74.0032131,"occurred":-5428800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-5428800000,"summary":"Me, my brother, my cousin and 2 neighbors were walking on a street in our development when we saw the disk obect over our heads approx. 100 yards","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"New York, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:486007"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Salina","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were traveling in a motor home east on i. 70  about 60 miles from salina,kansas when we saw two extremely bright light which we thought were from a football field.  we wondered about them and noticed they stayed the exact same distance from us as we traveled east.  after about fifteen miles we decided it was strange they were still there and at the exact same height and distance from us.  this was a very eerie feeling that something is watching you.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden the lights were gone so we thought nothing of it. we traveled about fifteen miles farther and the lights appeared again exactly in the same location.  they kept following us for about five miles and we decided to get the v c r camera and we stopped the motor home.  we stpopped the motor home and opened the door to get a better view, when we started filming, the light on the right suddenly veered off to the right and the other light disappeared completely.  that was when we decided there were two objects instead of just one.\r\n\r\nwe managed to get only a few seconds of the lights when it veered off.  it was very obvious whatever we were seeing knew what we were doing. we were very nervous knowing that ever we saw also was watching us and did not want any pictures taken. \r\n\r\ni know we were followed about 40 miles total.\r\n\r\nwe stopped at a truck stop in salina,kansas and another car pulled in with some hunters in it and they also saw the lights and were very nervous about seeing the lights.\r\n\r\ni have the film with the light but it is only a very few seconds showing the lights. i do not want to send the tape for fear of loosing it but i do have it for the right people to see.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5922,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8402805,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12142006-0004","longitude":-97.6114237,"occurred":814690800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":814690800000,"summary":"Traveling i 70 e. and saw lights, took pictures, lights disappeared,have picture of lights","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Boise","timeZoneName":"America/Boise","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Salina, Kansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:486008"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2575}
