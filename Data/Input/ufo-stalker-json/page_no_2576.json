sometimes off for 30 seconds and then flicker on in the same location. the whole thing was stationary - it hovered silently and did not move.  there were no smoke trails.  i watched for a couple minutes - the total duration from when i first saw them until they totally flickered off was about 20 minutes. i turned around to head home, and as i was driving back in my subdivision, i could see the one light again at the top of the triangle (maybe 10 minutes after i left). the whole thing was stationary, and didn't move the entire time.\r\n\r\ni felt compelled to watch it -

almost like a bird, but it was obviously larger than a bird and this object had no wings and no flapping or irregular movement as a bird would.  i would have thought it was a balloon, but it was the wrong shape, had no basket underneath and it moved in a horizontal straight line.  i called my 15 year old son in to look at it because i wasn't sure what it was.\r\n\r\nas it moved northwest it was not possible to see it out of the window at that point, we both ran outside in our driveway to look.  there was no engine or other type of sound - the object was silent as far as we could tell.  it was easier to see it outside even though it had moved farther away, because we were not looking through a pane of glass and window screen.  it looked at that point like a solid triangular shape rotating flat side down.  it was still moving at a slow, steady rate of speed but our view was blocked by some trees so we ran in the back of the house to see it further.  at that point it was no longer visible - it either had moved faster out of our sight or it had moved up into the clouds.  there are also bare trees out there which make visibility less than optimal.\r\n\r\nthe whole incident probably lasted about two minutes or so.  my son and i came back in the house and speculated a few minutes about what conventional craft/item it may have been (ranging from weather balloon to black plastic bag high in the air).  we've eliminated everything we can think of because it did not look or behave like any of those.  this is the second time that i have seen a ufo in my life (the first time was actually more definite than this one), so i made note of the time and then decided maybe i should report it right away.\r\n\r\ni don't want to call local authorities because i don't want to be treated with scorn.  my first sighting was when i was in the 8th grade (1968) and i was naive enough to mention it back then, thinking that the fact that my mother had also seen it was proof enough.  everyone's reaction was pretty bad.  this is also why i called my son to look at it - i wanted another witness.\r\n\r\ni would normally think this was a normal airplane (i live near blue ash airport and it lies in that northwest direction) but the shape was wrong, it almost appeared to be going too slow for an airplane, and it made no sound.  in addition, most aircraft have lights on by this time of day in the winter, although it would still be possible that the pilot didn't turn them on yet i suppose.  i see aircraft all the time and have all of my life because i've grown up and lived near airports for nearly all of my 52 years.\r\n\r\nif you can, please let me know if anyone else has sighted a ufo this same evening.  i realize it may yet be a conventional object, but i cannot think of what.  according to my computer, it is now 5:54 p.M. est. i have no working camera for this sighting, and it was getting dim outside anyway, so no pictures -

that it is a plane out of focus because of the trail it is leaving. i tracked this object halfway across the sky before i snapped the picture giving the cam plenty of time to focus. when i take a picture of a plane at the same altitude the picture looks just like a plane. i took the picture from a field in front of my house. i enclose the original and an enhancement. any questions can be

Lauderdale","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have been noticing u.F.O. activity from the front of my house located in ft lauderdale on two occasions while visiting my family at that time. one sighting took place on the night of december 4, 2006 past midnight and the same on december 5, 2006 past midnight. on the night of december 4, 2006, i noticed that this particular u.F.O appeared to maneuver through a thick fleet of clouds at a very alarming rate, it was as if were using the clouds to cloak itself but the light exhibited from the craft made it's appearance very noticeable. this object seemed to fly in a serpent like motion through the sky as it displayed drastic changes in speed before coming to a halt and doing the same thing again. i was excited as i have seen u.F.O's before, so this is nothing new to me. i have been observing u.F.O's since my first sighting as a child in new york city and i have seen many since that time. i have been interviewed on live radio by the likes of brian vike and jeff rense, brian was very interested in a sighting that i had back in 2002, it was a very close encounted with a triangular craft.\r\n\r\nso, this u.F.O was first witnessed by myself and then i went inside to inform family members of the craft that was dancing in the cloud scattered sky. i was now accompanied by my younger brother christian and we were patiently wathching this craft which appeared to be triangular in shape and although i may be wrong, due to not having equipment to have a better look, that will remain my best description of the object in question. now, on december 5, 2006 past midnight, it is fair to say that the same event took place but this time i was accompanied by my next door neighbor and we both saw the craft at the same exact time. \r\n\r\nit appeared to be the same craft from last night but my neighbor said that this trinagular shaped object exhibited some sign under it's belly that resembled the letter x, that x seemed to be displaying some form of light that fluctuated throughout the craft. what made this craft or shall i say sighting different from the night before was that it was much more active and that it was accompanied by what appeared to be other craft. i alongside my neighbor joseph (who was stunned by this whole event) stood outside for atleast five hours observing this craft until it escalated to a level that made it clear to us that the show was soon going to be over. at that time there was an even thicker fleet of clouds approaching the area and the craft ultimately was engulfed by these clouds and vanished. it was just about a minutes later that we spotted either the same or a different craft going at a magnificent speed in the same direction, i believe that it was a different craft.\r\n\r\ni would like to note that the weather conditions were very cool and have been the coolest so far. i had to travel back to daytona beach the next day because my dog was just to much for the family to handle. if not, i am sure that i would have been able to see something amazing again the following night, that's just my gut feeling. as i have said earlier, this is nothing new to me, i see u.F.O's wherever i go. i believe that it's time for people to see what i see or to be aware of what i see in the night sky. that is why i have decided to share this with mufon, in an attempt to possibly meet and discuss this with likeminded individuals in the u.F.O community.
