in front of me about a mile ahead. it was flying at i���m guessing 3000 feet. my first thought was that it was a kite or some type of debris in the air since it didn���t resemble a plane nor bird. but i drove onward i noticed it was not dropping just kind off hovering at a constant speed of about 80 miles an hour. judging by how fast i was going. i then realized that my eyes were not playing tricks on me it must have been a ufo. i then became very excited and sped up as fast as i could to get a better look. i reach speed of 110 miles an hour when it had seemed to speed up. it suddenly dropped altitude to approximately 500-1000 feet and took a sudden right turn flying right above the tree line. i drove as fast as i could to cut it off when it dropped again and i lost visual. i circled the area a few times to try and find it but nothing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

right and left in an upward movement.  we pulled over and watched the sky. off it the south about 10 miles away a large object with two levels of light all white from all i could tell, one large at the top not flashing and multiple lights pulsing below, i do not know if it was a military chopper it was too far away to tell it did not move it was just above the horizon about 1 inch by sight above the tree tops i think it was at a higher than tree top level, distance was not helping.. we saw 1 v fighter and a jet with red lights dropping flares first, the flares were red orange glowing bright

feel the after-burners. the v shape of the wing fighter was bordered by red lights underside,  we counted 1 v fighter and 3 jets un-known type, you could hear them. the jets dropping flares were at a

wear corrective lenses (glasses) and my vision is quite poor without them. having taken my glasses off for the evening, i quickly grabbed them from my nightstand and put them on. i then got out of bed and went to the window to get a better look. i was astonished to see a very round red object stationary in the sky at little more than tree top high. i stood at the window for a while watching the object. then i thought to go get my binoculars to get an even better view. i went downstairs and recovered them and returned to my room.  what a view !!!  i had the most incredible view of this object!  i remember thinking \" this is it... a u.F.O. i'm looking right at it!\"  the object was perfectly round it's image filled my field of view in the 8x50 binoculars. it was a rich molten red with black marble like lines in it ...Like molten lava.    the rich red colors ran together into lighter reds and a slight hint of orange color too. the colors seemed to be seperated by the bands of black marble. the outside edge of the object also had this black band. it was churning within itself like a minniature sun. at this time i went outside onto my deck and stood on a deck bench to get as clear of a view as possable . the view was no better as the object had already been in full view. i watched it for a few minutes more before i thought to get my camcorder and record it. i raced downstairs once again and retrieved my camcorder. i returned to the deck with the camcorder and proceded to film the object for several minutes. i was making silly comentary at the same time partly because i wes so very nervous and partley because it was so very quiet and still outside. i was so sure i was getting this all on tape. but when i later reviewed the footage all that i could see was \"snow\" , my comentary was on the aodio portion of the tape and that is all that i can give as proof of this encounter, there may be images in the tape that i am not able to see,i have not had it professionally analized. after a few more minutes the object moved off in a southwesterly direction,it moved very slowly away until it looked like a star,yet it could not have been more than a mile

noticed the disc i looked around to see if anyone else was watching it and strangly there were no cars or pedestrians around. at other times there always seems to be alot of cars on the road.  i watched the disc for 20 seconds at the stop sign and then pulled over to observe it for a minute more.  i thought it could be remote controlled but i didn't think it was by the way it moved and stayed stationary.  i also had the feeling it knew i was observing it. a couple of cars did drive by but either did not notice it or ignored it.  i started to drive home again and it started to fall in the sky as i left watching it over the houses on my street.  i decided to turn around and observe it again so i drove back and it was back up in the sky.  i decided to leave after 20 seconds  more of observing it and went home.  it was still in the sky when i went home.  i could see the disc very clearly although the memory of it is fading.  i am curious what other people that may have some experience with this type of thing think about this.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

appeared to be a plane ascending after take-off from logan airport in boston, a not infrequent sight. i watched it for a few seconds as i sometimes do, wondering where it was headed.\r\n\r\nthere didn't seem to be anything unusual about the object. as i said above it appeared to be a passenger jet with running lights until it made a sharp right turn of more than 90 but less than 110 degrees  to the best of my judgement while continuing to gain altitude. that surprised me, of course, as i have never seen a conventional jet make such a sharp turn. what surprised me is that a second or two after seeing the object make the right turn, i heard what sounded like jet engines at a much lower altitude. i should point out that i've seen many planes on ascent from logan but never heard a sound before.\r\n\r\nthen, i realized what i was hearing was a delayed sound that could only have been the result of the object flying at supersonic speeds. it's posssible that what i heard was a sonic boom. it's been many years since i've heard that sound so i'm not certain i could indentify a sonic boom if i heard one today.\r\n\r\nfinally, just after the object made an acute turn back to the left, again while gaining altitude, i had to look away, finding the whole thing a bit confusing and a little frightening.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what it was but i'd really like to know.

cigarette when i witenessed two silver-ish/white-ish maybe transparent spheres in the blue sky. these two spheres were rotating around each other in a cyclone kind of pattern, almost swirling. it almost seemed as if they were both locked in each other's inertia or gravity. this lasted for maybe 10 to 15 seconds and then the two objects darted in opposite directions in almost a sling shot effect. but they did not really go out of site into the sky or disapear into the horizon. they looked like they had slipped into (for lack of a better word) a \"fold\" or \"crease\" in the sky. like a pocket of some sort.\r\n\r\ni am not sure what made me notice the objects, i was just looking around while i was smoking. when i first saw the two objects i was not sure what i was seeing. so i looked away and blinked (i wear contact lenses). then i looked back and they were still there. then after a few seconds they darted.\r\n\r\nas soon as the objects disapeared i was pretty  beside myself with excitement and confusion. i looked in serveral directions of the sky in an attempt to locate them but they were gone. it was at this point i noticed a contrail high in the sky but far away from where i had witnessed these objects. at this point i went inside to get my cell phone to call my friend who was in the navy to tell him about it. when i was in my bedroom getting the phone i noticed another contrail outside of my bedroom window. strange, i though to myself.\r\n\r\ni then got another cigarette and my phone and went back outside to call my navy friend, i noticed a third contrail at the end of the street. the three contrails seemd to make a triangle around the area in the sky i had seen the two objects. i don't know if these are related but i thought it was worth mentioning. see attached phone pics for contrails, they are hard to see in the pics but it was taken moments after (3 minutes) witnessing the \"event\". note the date and times of the files' meta-data.\r\n\r\nthe first picture was taken from by back bedroom window when i noticed the first contrail. the second pic was taken from my porch, where i was standing when i noticed the objects. the 3d pic was taken from my side walk pointed north. as you can tell, the 3 contrails sort of make a tri-angle around my front porch.\r\n\r\noh, and i did get ahold of my navy friend and told him about it. he said that i should write it all down before i forget what happened. so i did. note: i was not in the navy.\r\n\r\nthis is about all i can remember of the event so far, please contact me for further detials if need

to look i was amazed at what i was seeing. i stood, transfixed on this huge floating object. it was at least 200 feet wide and had large rectangular flashing panels. it was as large as a blimp but it was totally silent. each panel flashed in sinc. from right to left, each rectangular panel was so huge and fashed with the brightness of a high power camera flash i just froze. i sood there in disbelief,but knew it was real. i just stood there and studied it trying to rashanalize what it could be. it was totally silent and the huge flashing panels were at least as big as a greyhound bus. i knew at that time there where blimps with lighting arays, but i know for a fact this was not a blimp! each panel flash was whole like a 15x25 foot window, not like tiny lights in an array. this object was floating aprox. 80 to 100 feet from the ground behind our high school next to wolfcreek. as i stood there on the sidewalk i started to count the flashes, 1 2 3 4 5, 1 2 3 4 5. it did not move at all. i could not stop watching, afraid it might disappear. suddenly i got very frightend. i do not know why, i had been stareing at this thing for several minutes, but suddenly it dawned on me that this could be very dangerous. so i turned and ran across the street to my friends house and banged on the door to get someone else to see this. when they opend the door i yelled at them to come see this huge thing floating behind the school. as soon as they came out it was gone. loooking back now, i find it strange that after that happend i just let it go. i mean i never brought it up in conversation for many years after it happend. another thing i did not mention was that when i went back into their house it was 9:45. i left my house at 9:00 it only takes five minutes to walk to his house. i do remember telling them their clock was very fast. i never gave it much thought untill many years later. i am now positive that these things are real, and probabley have been here longer

my 4th triangle since feb 14th of this year. however, for over an hour before this triangle made it's \"appearance\"...My 2 daughters and i were followed by a gold/white \"star-like\" object. here is my report, as it happened.\r\n\r\n my youngest daughter was invited to spend the night at a friends house, in delta township...(about 2 miles from my folks)....Maybe 10-12 miles from my house.  we left our house at 5:33pm. i know, because i stopped at the top of our driveway and took some pics of the house with the christmas lights on..(camera clock shows last pic at 5:33pm). as we headed south down wacousta rd, i was looking at how pretty the sunset was in the west. there was still plenty of light out. what i noticed, was this huge set of brilliant white lights just under the clouds...They were spread out...In a broad horizontal direction...Yet you knew there was an object there...Yet it was a strange sight...(there was blue sky...This object...Then clouds above it). i ran through every thought of what it might be, but nothing conventional came to mind...This was just spread out in too large of an area. it was maybe 3 miles west of us, and huge. i said something to the girls as i still saw it as we approached grand river hwy. i watched it for just a few seconds, then i turned east onto grand river hwy, so i could hop onto the freeway (i-96) by flying j truckstop. as i turned onto i-96 eastbound, i noticed the white lights were gone from the west sky, but then, i noticed there was this gold/white star-like object in the sky....And i noticed it was moving. \r\n\r\n   the sky was still light and blue enough out, and we saw planes passing near this \"light\" that was still moving along with us. as i drove to the westbound saginaw hwy. exit, we noticed it was now passing to the south of us. as i took the exit ramp, i had to turn west onto saginaw hwy. (m-43). at the end of the exit ramp, as we waited at the stop sign for traffic to clear, we watched this object just sitting there. you could tell there was some sort of actual \"object\" there...Then...Amazingly, as we turned onto west saginaw hwy....It too turned and headed west. it stayed to the south of us and it was definitely moving along with us. again, we saw other aircraft plain as day, pass by this. i drove approximately 2-3 miles to upton rd. (2 streets west of my folks road) and i turned south onto upton rd. i drove a couple of miles to the next major cross road...And turned west onto st. joe hwy., drove approx. 1/2 mile and turned south into my daughter's friends subdivision. as we drove, the object was still following us. as we pulled into her friends driveway, we then saw it above us. as we unloaded my daughter's stuff out of the truck (sleeping bag/etc), we looked up and we could no longer see it. i asked the girls if they could see it...And where'd it go?...They replied \"no....It's gone\". my daughter's friend then came out her front door, and walked towards my truck, to help us bring in the things. we stood inside for about 5-7 minutes talking with her friends' mother, about the holidays/etc. \r\n \r\n    as my other daughter & i left the friends house, we took the same route back to saginaw hwy. my daughter wanted burger king, so we headed east onto saginaw hwy. as we headed east....There it was..Still to the south of us....Still moving with us. we passed under i-96, to go to burger king first (3/4-1 mile east of i-96...Just past horrocks). after going through drive thru', i decided to go back (west) towards grand ledge to the car wash, before they closed at 7pm. i also quickly pulled off into the mcdonalds by walmart and got a diet coke. we pulled out and headed west...Still on saginaw hwy....And it was still there.....Moving right along with us...Still in the south...Now heading west. the car wash is 1/2 mile from the m-100 (wright rd.) saginaw hwy. (m-43) intersection. it was actually closer for me to head home that way now...But for some reason, after i drove through the car wash, i really hesitated...Thinking the roads would be wetter, (snow) and i knew the freeway was dry, and i didn't want to get my truck dirty after i just spent $10 to get it washed good. so i turned east, back onto saginaw hwy...And headed back to i-96. now we were backtracking our way back home.\r\n \r\n    yes...The object was there again, south o us, heading west along with us. i got onto the westbound i-96 ramp...And headed home. as we drove, the object was now west of us...Moving right along parallel to us...Still up in the sky. as i pulled onto the exit ramp at grand river, this object also turned...And as i drove west on grand river hwy, it followed. i started to pull over on the shoulder (of grand river hwy) by the light (by the watertown tnship fire dept...Just before flying j), but decided i wanted to be where it was safe to get out of my truck and watch this thing, and i wanted to be in a well lit area with people around. as we pulled into flying j truckstop, i pulled in so my truck was facing west...Yet i was near the fire dept....Which is right smack next (east) to flying j's parking lot. \r\n\r\n   i got out of my truck, to watch the gold/white object...And it was no longer to the south of us now....Now....It was above us...A tiny bit north of us...Almost overhead...Yet not quite. i am standing right outside my driver door looking around and jen is in the front passenger seat...When all of a sudden...I see these bright lights out of the corner of my eye...I turned directly east...Facing the fire dept...And this huge object appears out of nowhere....Just east of the i-96 overpass. it was huge....No more than 20 degrees off the horizon....But right there in front of us....It got closer and lower. it now was maybe 4-6 stories above the ground, and passing to the front (south) of the fire dept...Coming towards us. it was as big as a jumbo 747...Or bigger...It was over the fire dept parking lot...It had 3 bright white lights...And it was a triangle. just as my first triangle, (this had 3 equal sides...All rounded corners...Black...) i said to my daughter \"look at this\"...\"what?\" she asked...I said \"you have to look at this...Its big...Its so bright...You have to see this\"...I did not tell her what it was i was seeing...She tried peering backwards out the rear windows of my truck...She couldn't see anything...I said...\"no, please...You need to see this quick\"...She put down her window, stuck her head out and then pulls half her body out...Onto the window frame and then says, \"mom...Its another triangle\".....I said...\"i know!\"... she then says...\"you need your camera mom...I need to get your camera out...I'll get it for you\"...She then quickly pulls herself back into the truck seat, grabs my purse, (that was on the front passenger floor), gets the camera out and reaches across the front seat as i lean into my truck to get it from her. i did not take my eyes off that triangle at all. she then sticks her body back out the window and we are now both watching this triangle come right at us, bank to the north and turns back east. there is absolutely no sound....It has 3 white lights, 1 on each corner...A huge centered red \"portal\"...And a red light between 2 of the white lights. then, as it banks to head back east again, it starts blinking...Red & white lights. it goes in a quick pattern...Such as left to right.....White-red-white...Then back again....Only from the right this time....White-red-white.\r\n\r\n   i tried to take pictures first...It would not let my camera zoom in at all....It just froze...Then it finally zoomed in...And it would not let me focus...I took 2 pictures...That turned out crummy...So then i switched it to video mode...And once again tried to get the zoom to zoom in...It wouldn't...So i just pressed record...And started recording the best i could. now it is moving away from us...Still east...Ever so slightly northeast. after it was out of sight, we both immediately looked up...And that gold star-like object was gone. \r\n \r\n    as we sat there for a good 5 minutes, i made a couple of phone calls. i glanced around, and noticed that no one else seemed aware of it at all. when i first pulled into flying j...My instinct was to look and see who all was there...There was only 1 vehicle at the car pumps at that time. lots of semi trucks to the west of the main flying j bldg, all in their designated parking/sleeping area. \r\n\r\n   it was now 8 minutes to 7....And we headed home. when i got home, i called capital city airport and talked with the control tower. they are going to look through their radar. i will follow-up monday with more calls to other agencies. \r\n\r\n   i have included 3 pictures i captured from the video. i will add others into the mufon database. my first picture of the triangle was taken at 6:47pm...And the video at 6:48pm.\r\n\r\n   i also want to mention, that we could tell when this star-like object turned, by the white, which by the way it moved...Was the front of this object. when we would stop...It would just sit there in the sky...Not move...Only when we went to turn off the freeway at first, did it keep going....Then when we got off the freeway, it turned and sat there, until we turned onto saginaw hwy.\r\n\r\nthank-you,\r\npatty donahue\r\nmufon internatinal field investigator \r\n& michigan mufon fi  ","distance":"101-500

observed a very bright orange \"star\" through the kitchen window,in the east, apparently over lake michigan.  i observed that it did not change position for almost three hours, and became curious.  after dinner and a trip the the store, i noticed that it had just disappeared.  i went out to shovel the snow about 2000 hours.  it was very still outside and i was prompted to look overhead, at which time i saw this huge black triangular craft traveling east to west, very slowly, perhaps 50 miles per hour.  it had colored lights at various places.  it appeared to be about the size of a football field, and only about 500- to 1000-feet off the ground, but made almost no sound.  the sound it did make was akin to a jet airliner at about 15,000 to 20,000 feet.  after about 10 seconds, it disappeared into some passing clouds.\r\n\r\ni was so taken by surprise at what i had seen, i did not know what to think of the whole thing.  it was as though i was being conditioned not to think about it, because it was several days before i started to question what i had seen.\r\n\r\ni understand that there are triangular craft being flown from various airfields around the world in recent years, but this was 35 years ago and we didn't have anything like this at that time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5865,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.7261309,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12032006-0005","longitude":-87.7828523,"occurred":-63216000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-63216000000,"summary":"Huge

in the living room.  i was staying overnight because my mother was dying of cancer and she had taken a turn for the worse.  at 3:20 am i was awakened abruptly by a loud voice that said \"go outside and look up\".  i openened my eyes and looked for someone in the room but there was no one there.  i again heard the voice, this time i knew it was coming from inside my head - say \"go outside now - get up and go outside now!\"  it was very strong and adament. i actually said outloud \"alright, alright, i'm going.\"  i then opened the patio door on the first floor of the building and looked up.  i was drawn to look in an overhead location to the north east, where i saw what looked to me like a satellite moving across the sky at very high altitude.  the size of it was a medium size star. i thought about forgetting about that and looking elsewhere because i was sure it was a satellite, but something kept my attention.  i watched as it moved across the sky to the southwest.  i said outloud \"ok, if you are not of this world please do something so i'll know for sure.\"  just then, at approximately 60 degrees up from the horizon the object stopped, went backwards, then forward, then stopped again.  at that point, i knew it was not a satellite. i watched as two bright white lights decended apparently from the first, larger object in an upside down \"v\" pattern towards the earth.  i did not watch the other smaller objects but kept my eye on the larger one.  it then moved away in a west direction which was not its original path.  it moved away at a high rate of speed and got smaller instantly, then dissappeared.  i could not locate the other objects after that.  the experience was quite disturbing, as it appeared to me that some entity first woke me up to see it, then acutally responded to my question about showing me if it was not of this world. i am still somewhat shaken by the experience five months later.  note: this sighting occurred just 6 weeks after a previous sighting at my mother's house, which was at a different location.  i don't know if there is a relationship to her or her illness. see my other report in may, 2006.
