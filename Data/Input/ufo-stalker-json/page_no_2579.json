the shape of a blimp shoot across the sky just in front of me but only a short distance before it dissappeard into nothingness. the way i would describe it would be like from a science fiction movie of dissappearing into another dimension, because, the object did not shoot further into the sky and fade away. it appeared to be stationary at first and then shot off and just vanished right through the sky like it went through a portal. very weird and hard to describe accept to say like it went through a stargate of sorts and was gone. like it would appear for a person to dissappear into a wall. before reaching the end of the road, i was curious about what appeared to be an orange glow in the sky ahead of me. it was hard to make out for the trees but when i got to the end, and especially when i turned, i could see it more clearly and then it shot off and vanished. i am not a big ufo fanatic but this is the second time i have seen something this clearly strange since i have lived here in rowan county. i had reported another sighting around a year ago but i recieved back an e-mail suggesting that i was not being truthfull and the report was not accepted because i could not remember the date. it was some years before that i had that experience and i tried to then re-submit the report guessing at an exact date to that event but i still could not be sure. that is why i thought i would report this one right away. i am sure this time. i hope this report might be accepted.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

discounting military aircraft from pease ang to the north west of the location where kc-135a and r's along with a squadren of adf varient f-16's are based, agian due to color and brigthness. i am extremely familer with all the various lights on aircraft including tankers during refueling operations as i am a former employee of pratt & whitney aircraft and have family members in air force. i asked wife if she saw this light and she affirmed she did and that it was odd in it being steady and not moving. at this point i demounted my nikon d-70 and fired off one frame as i checked to see if

\"sightings\", when my husband, ray, yelled\r\nme from our bedroom,\"hey honey! hurry up,come here!\" i ran to the bedroom\r\nand saw my husband standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling, and wall-to-wall windows overlooking our large back yard. he was looking up over the\r\nhouse in the rear of our yard. i hurried to his side,and looked in the direction of his index finger. i nearly fainted and grabbed his shoulder\r\nto keep from falling. i had been seeing ufos all my life but none that\r\nclose without the help of hypnosis.It looked like two saucers, one upside down over the oher, with an outsized tea cup, upside down, on top. there\r\nwere six to eight  porthole windows visible from where we were looking,\r\nand there was a \"gray\" person loking back at us from each one of those windows. i also saw three or more human men standing behind some of the grays.Ever so often, one of the men would duck down to look over the\r\nshoulder of the gray,to see ray and i.One of the men had dark hair and\r\nwas dressed in a tunic with something tied around his waist.The other humans were dressed the same way, suggesting a uniform to me. the grays were busy doing something in front of them with their hands. the outside\r\nof the ship was sort of shiny but grungy,as if it had come through some\r\nnasty dust,oil,and acidic atmosphere. the underside of the ship was open and fire was blasting out and then curling back in on itself. the whole ship was so big, ti \"covered\" the space well over the rear house, the\r\nyards surrounding the house,and the rear house and it's surrounding yards on the next street over from us. that rear house was being rented by an el monte police officer. i finally yelled, \"now! do you believe me? now!\r\ngo ahead and tell me you aren't seeing this!!\" at my stunned husband. he whispered back,\"yeah, i believe you now.\",and whispered prayers to saint somebody in spanish. at that, the ship moved slightly, then rose and moved slowly to the west until it was over the el monte airport, two or so blocks away,and rapidly took off heading south and upwards. ray just as\r\nsuddenly sucked in his breath and yelled,\"jesus christ!! look at that sonofabitch go!!\" i helped him to our bed, and then called the police. i told them what i've written here. two years later the psychology director\r\nfred newmeyer, and his helper drove into our back yard and took measurements and notes. since then ive had other sightings, some of them \r\nfairly simple, and others,just plain otherworldly.I went to cero for awhile for help but had to stop from lack of money and transportation.\r\n i hope this helps to tie in other sightings in the el monte area. there\r\nhave been so many, both in my family and other people,a great many of them from the chicano families. \r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

favourite broadsheet newspaper, and enjoying some tea. my eyes wandered from the paragraphs to the windscreen and the darkness beyond. stepping out of the car, enjoying the cold night air, i marvelled at the beauty of the stars, watching for satellites far above me, i tried to imagine what early humans felt when they witnessed shooting stars.  as i acknowledged the familiar outline of stars in the plough, my vision picked up a movement between the stars, i though it was an aircraft, but this one had no port or starboard lights, no flashing beacons, and no familiar outline, and most significantly , no sound. my eyes to in the scene rechecking with co ordinates onthe ground to give me a sense of its altitude and speed, and also its direction of travel. i deduced that as the road i was on was above sea level, and i was observing at an angle of less than 45 degrees, that the \"object\" was at less than 1,000 feet, i observed it for over 10 seconds in which time it moved from my far left to my far right, and at a nne heading, and moving approximatley 80-150mph  . my disbelief continued as i realised that the \"object\" was triangular, and very sharp in appearence with red lights along its border. as i obsereved i made notes of its behaviour, noting that it was turning on its nose to tail axis in that as one \"wing\" raised, the other lowered. and most significantly, it made no sound whatsoever. having operated with american stealth aircaft during the gulf war, i knew this was no stealth fighter, though i also noted this was the size of a stealth bomber or bigger, though to the best of my knowledge the bomber had big noisey engines, and  is more v shaped than a full triangle. \r\ni have never seen anything like this, and later drving around other locations in the vicinity i felt that the craft flew directly over the city i was in, and must have been seen by someone else, becauze this thing was big. and in my opinion, by the way it was behaving , it was using its flight path to observe features of the land below. i do not think this was an alien space craft, but i do beleive that this is more probably a form of aircraft to replace the aging u2. i lost sight of it as it flew off to my far right over the brow of a hill, i also lost sight of it as it blended in with the dark sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

over the row of a-frame cottages, yet it was below the cliff line and other houses behind it. if you do a google earth search for the area where the flying object sat, it would be latitude: 33���11'53.93\"n and longitude:117���23'14.72\"w. where i was standing on the water's edge was latitude: 33���11'55.62\"n and longitude:117���23'20.90\"w.\r\n\r\nwhat attracted me to the object was a glimmer of light as if reflecting the sun's light into a mirror and then moving the mirror so that it would pulse. we walked closer to the object walking away from the water's edge. i could see the color of the light which to make a basic description, looked like gold spray paint sprayed onto water and then sloshed so that the gold paint would circle around inside the oval shape. gold spray paint has dark components in it especially if it is sprayed too thick.  imagine an oval tank filled with water, with underwater bright white lights inside the tank submerged and the thick gold \"paint\" material swirling around on top of the water as it won't mix with the water. there would be times when the \"paint\" was not too thick which allowed the light behind it to shine through making it brighter and darker as the \"paint\" material swirled around. the tank is on its side in this instance like a large picture frame. there was no pattern to the movement of the material inside the oval. random swirls as if stirred with a spoon and then reversed at will. the object was the size of a large van. it was a windy day, there were seagulls flying a few yards from the object at palm tree level, and they were having a hard time negotiating the wind. the object was dead still. i at first thought it was a gag blimp or some type of kite. i looked for wires, there were none.  nothing short of billboard scaffolding could have suspended that large object over the cottage roofing to keep it from moving in the wind. there was no scaffolding. nothing extended from the a-frame cottages and nothing connected to the houses on the cliff above the object. still not wanting to believe this object was hanging there by itself, motionless, i moved closer. it was the same thing. no wires, no poles no metal trusses, not even an electric wire to supply power for the light effects. the object was facing the sun which was setting in a northwest position over the horizon. i moved closer to the object and noticed that behind the oval that was displaying the liquid light show, there was a turbine. yes a turbine that spun counterclockwise. looked like what you would see on a jet liner. there were light blue and pink lights coming out of the turbine as it spun. no specific light recepticals, just shafts of pastel lights coming out of the the area of the spinning vanes.  but there was no noise at all. i could not understand how light could be coming out of the turbine as there were no bulbs, reflectors, etc. it was mystical to say the least. there were other people at the beach picnic tables across the cottages, gathered around, and i looked at them to see if they had noticed the object. they never glanced at it. made me think, is this a gag, and everybody else has already seen it and grown tired of it? a young boy crossed in front of my son and me as we stood across the row of cottages and i looked at him to see if he was viewing what we saw trying to get him to look up at the object. he looked at me and wondered why i was looking at him. he never looked up at the object. my son and i looked at the object for a good 30 minutes, the sun was still brightly shining. i had to leave to get the car home in time for my parents to go to 5 p.M. religious services. i was late. the car was parked on the street at the cliff line south of the cottages, quite a ways away from the oceanside amphitheater. i kept looking back at the object and it was still there in the same position. i reluctantly got into the car and drove home. i usually have a video camera with me. i'm a recording artist with music videos on mtv asia. that day my brother had taken the video camera with him. of all the times to be without a camera. and to think my rock video garden of eden that aired all over asia on mtv asia and channel v from 1996 on, had famous pictures and video of \"ufos\" in it. i can still remember the object. i did not see any windows, any beings looking out, any doors, wings, tires. above all no motion and no noise whatsoever. no smell of fuel, aviation or otherwise, no fumes, no exhaust heat mirages, no heat. \r\nthe gulls were the loudest thing at the scene. the turbine was molded onto the oval light frame. if i had not stepped to one side i would not have noticed the turbine. it had dimension. it was a solid object. whatever it was seemed to only be seen by myself and my son. this object was at rooftop of the cottages, which are still there on the beach access road at oceanside beach, and can be seen on google earth. it was not a misty hazy apparition. it was well defined, unmistakably within arm's reach and in more than  enough broad daylight to tell it was hanging there. it was definitely a flying machine. i have no idea where it came from. i did not see it leave as i left before it did. i went back the next day and it was gone. i wish i had stayed till the object disappeared. i wish i had video footage of it. i wonder why it showed itself to me and not to the others on the beach. i should make a rendering of the object to at least give a visual of what we saw and in case someone else has seen this same object and reports or has reported it, for posterity.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

9:00pm or so. i was sitting there looking out into the night when suddenly a white glowing ball of light appeared in the sky. i don't know how to tell you how big it was. to me, if i were to stretch my hand out to touch it, the object seemed to be the size of a baseball, perhaps that will help determine how far away it was. it was slightly to the left of our hotel balcony but i had a clear view of the thing. suddenly another light appeared beside it. several minutes later another light appeared also. these lights just appeared and then went out. they did not fade out or appear to burn out, they just went out, and then appeared to blink back on, one at a time. there was no sound and no evidence of the lights being flares. by that i mean there was no fire trail or sparks that could be seen. i yelled for my kids to come out and look after i saw the first one appear. all three of us wittnessed the lights. they were bright white and appeared to be burning or glowing. i can tell you is that the moon was almost full that night and we had a clear unobstructed view of the horizon. we could also see the water beneath the lights. i could not make out a boat or floating object of any kind.  a while later (maybe 15 minutes or more later), after the lights had dissapeared for the last time, we did hear military jets overhead. we often heard and saw jets out over the water during the week we spent down there, but we always \"heard\" them.  i told someone i was talking to the next day about the lights and he said they were the after burners on f14s. i told him that i didn't hear any jets at all and pointed out that we heard them all the time. he said they were too far out to hear. these lights were not that far out. if they were in fact farther out than they appeared, they must have been huge! i do remember seeing a large ship at the edge of the horizon during most of the time we were there, but these lights seemed much closer to us, at least closer than halfway between us and the horizon. we spoke with some friends who were staying a few hotels down from us who also saw the lights. several days later, they said they had seen the lights again and that they did seem to be flares. do you have any idea what these lights were? would't you hear or see the jets leaving these after burners? could it have been something the navy seals were doing out in the water that we simply couldn't see? i don't know what we saw, but it was an unusual sight for us. i believe we attempted to video these lights and may have captured at least one of them on tape. should i locate footage of these lights, i will figure out how to send them to you.

multi-colored lights on it. we could see it was about 500 feet up in the air, probably 100 feet across, perspective was something about the size of your hand exteneded above your head. we could hear the sound of a propultion system, similiar to a rocket thrust, but smoother and not so loud, not a prop. we stood there and watched for a couple minutes as it slowly moved towards us and was right over our the house below us in clear view, again at about 500 feet up. i ran in the house to get a camera but we had no film. i ran baclk outside and we all stood there for a coupel more moinutes and

looked like a colorful star move towards my direction which was odd for a star.  i had binoculars my 13 yr old son and my 55 yr old mother who all witnessed.  lights were blue red green bright flair bluish-white.  it moved as if sucked by a vacuum backwards and forward 2 times. when it moved backwards it actually disappeared and reappeared.  the lights seemed unnatural not like prisms of a diamond more like neonish but not like our aircrafts there were too many colors and variances.  sometimes the lights would twinkle like a star and others it would stay for a period of time. longer than the normal shifting stars do.  almost like it was communicating with someone and the colors were red or blue ect.  there is an airforce base in chicopee and i think they were sending out planes to look at it because they would fly by low and that is when it was doing the disappearing act.  then there was a helicopter that circled it up and down and around then left.  eventually the pretty colors went away and it looked like a star after that.  i know that sounds weird but its true.  i even ran up the street to see it better there was a lot of activity with aircraft checking it out.  my son saw it and my mother, all of us saw the colors in the binoculars when it was changing and moving, ect.  sometimes it would be all neon red then it would be the color if a camera flash bulb, then it was like a yellow white light.  i hope you get my other report because there are other sightings by me on that report, please let me know if you got them, if you can.  also, the ufo was being seen

could be my eyes playing tricks on me but i called my 13 year old son and we ran outside quickly just in case.  we watched it change colors like a diamond would sparkle but it wasn't natural.  it was like artificial neon? light or something different.  i had my 55 year old mother come out while i got binoculars. we took turns looking and it was too hard to decipher exactly but we soon knew it wasn't a helicopter.  it was crazy it was as if an invisible vacuum sucked it backwards and it shrunk, or sped backwards, and turned yellow white light colored (like a light bulb color) then with the same motion came forward to its original position.  during this whole thing the colors would change from yellow light to green, red, blue, bright flair whitish blue.  but it wasn't exactly like a star and was evident of such in the binoculars.  the ufo moved again in the same way i described above exactly, and then it stayed in one place.  i know this will sound weird or stupid but in the end it stayed in one position and didn't look brilliant or odd.  another words the rest of the night it looked like a reg. wht star. after all the showing off.  also we are near an airforce base and i see all kinds of helicopters everyday and airplanes of many different sorts.  another important thing is it seemed to have gained attention from possibly the airforce base because small planes kept flying by it but they appeared to slow down near it and there was one helecopter that began to circle it and then left.\r\nwe all saw this and we all agreed it had a strangeness factor to it.  especially the movement and color changes, they were not normal at all.\r\ni have seen things on 2 other occasions, one of which might have been a comet about a 4-6 wks ago. also, you may not be aware but the ufo diaries volume 1,crop circles, there are 2 ufo's the movie didn't point out. in the movie they were in england and two government helicopters were chasing a white light over a field. i don't know if the film maker noticed, but there were two ufo's going in and out of the clouds, zig-zagging, going up and down.  i only saw it because i was going frame by frame.  it is hard to see because they are going so fast you see blurring even in frame by frame. but it is still one of the best peices of footage i have ever seen.  nothing can move like this.  please let me know what you find.  \r\nthank you,

in. my son went in and i was packing up the telescope when i looked up and saw an object fly over my house from south to north. it was triangular shaped, but the points looked rounded. it also almost looked transparent, almost like it was a thick piece of glass. the only way i could see it at all was because the star light was being refracted at the edges as it moved through the sky. there was no sound, and it seemed quite large, but since i don't know how far away it was i don't really know how big it
