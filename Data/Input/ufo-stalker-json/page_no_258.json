heart was pounding. as i lay there , i suddenly became aware that there was someone else in the room , but it felt like they had stepped into my mind and were observing. at this point , i tried to move so i could see it. i could not move.As i struggled to move , the coils in the toaster began vibrating , and the harder i struggled , the coils in the toaster would vibrate at a higher pitch. finally , i was able to break free , and in one motion , i grabbed my loaded 1911 colt with my left hand as i sat up in bed. i observed a light brighter than the sun in the basement outside my door as it moved away from the bedroom , took a left turn , went up the stairs and through the glass in the stairwell. i looked behind me to see another light with the same intensity move up and away from the window well. i didn't observe the source of the light directly , but you could tell what they were doing. i got up and turned on the light and sat there for about a half hour before i laid back down , this time putting my 1911 under my pillow.\r\n  about half an hour later , around 2 am , i felt the same presence in my mind. this time , i laughed out loud because i knew who it was and thought it would be easy enough to break free as i did earlier. i struggled to move , but this time , they were immobilizing me with a higher frequency , and the coils in the toaster were vibrating at a very high pitch. but i was determined to at least see what or who was doing this , and finally was able to move my head enough to see a grey alien partially phased though the ceiling tile staring at me. the room was dimly lit , but enough for a good look. i have to believe it let me move to look at it , as they were prepared for me the second time. after a quick look , the room went dark and it

never seen satellites fly parallel to one another. then i thought it must be a plane, but the lights were travelling far too quickly to ever be a high-flying plane, and there was no sound coming from them, so it couldn't have been a low-flying plane either. during the event, i was mostly amazed. i had no idea what i was seeing, but it was absolutely incredible seeing two unwavering lights flying so fast in such perfect unison. i reacted by first standing there and seeing if anyone was around to see what i just witnessed. then, i proceeded to text a bunch of friends to describe what i had just seen. i was in a state of complete disbelief. i lost sight of the objects after about four seconds. they entered my view from the south, travelled in a straight line at an incredible speed, and
