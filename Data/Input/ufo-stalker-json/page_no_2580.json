ridge parkway in henderson, nv when i noticed two extremely bright objects just above the horizon and north by northwest of my location, which made them almost due north of north las vegas. from this vantange point i could see accross the entire las vegas valley. the objects were approximately the same size, shape (irregular circle), brightness, and color (a very warm orange) and were much bigger and brighter than any airplane landing or helicopter search lights. the objects moved together in synchronization and only in the vertical direction (apparent). one object seeming to be slightly closer and higher than the other. when the objects suddenly disappeared, i realized that they were quite far away, at least 18-20 miles, because they had dropped down behind a high mountain ridge (name unknown) just north of las vegas near the eastern edge of the nellis air force range. the lights moved vertically up and down a total of three times (observed) and then failed to rise again after their final disappearance behind the mountain range. brightness did not vary during their successive rise and fall behind the mountain and there was no apparent lateral movement. from my location, it seem to have taken about 10 seconds for the lights to rise to their maximum height, appearing one after the other, where they paused together for perhaps 20 seconds before descending again. two additional people riding with me, one adult and one child, also witnessed the event. the weather was completely clear with no clouds in sight, but there was a slight haze at the horizon.\r\n\r\ni frequently watch the air traffic over las vegas in the evenings during walks and drives. my location on a hill in henderson makes for excellent viewing.  when i noticed the two

(i was turned the complete other way, but noticed the entire sky in my peripheral illuminate blue). my friends who actually saw this light said it was an extremely large blue ball that flashed and illuminated the whole sky. after the flash we witness three other lights in the sky. i actually saw two of these lights. they were very high and very large, with tails, these were much brigther than meteors although they were not blue. at first i thought they were just meteors, but they were moving entirely too slow and were entirely to large to be meteors. also these lights were not falling but moving in a straight linear pattern. these lights only appeared for several seconds a piece. after we witnessed these lights, we noticed a huge surge in air activity, mostly helicopters but there were some airplanes flying low that we could tell were not commercial jets. mount weather is located close to where these lights were spotted, and we noticed all of the elevated air activity traveling to or from the direction of mount weather. at first i wasnt going to report this, because lights cannot confirm anything, but i've been thinking why there might be such elevated air activity from one of our nations most secretive military bases.\r\n\r\ni wish i caught this on tape, but they all happened unexpectedly for short amounts of time. \r\n\r\ni am really interested in ufos, extraterrestrials,

car. i was turning south onto menge from red creek. i was on my cell phone with my younger sister when i saw the lights above the trees coming straight in  my direction. they were low, or so i thought. at first i was frightened due to the level it was flying. i thought it was a large airplane headed to the gulfport/biloxi regional airport, but it turned in the same direction that i was turning. it made at least 3 or 4 turns from east to west as i observed it on my way home. it seemed to be in some type of holding pattern. i saw it twice as i traveled west on hwy 90 (the beach boulevard), and it seemed to follow the beach until it turned and then returned slightly to the north. i stopped at the winn dixie shopping center and parked to see if i could hear it if it came again and it did; all the while i was describing what was happening to my sister. i never heard any sound assoicated with it(i reasoned that the traffic from the highway might be why i couldn't hear anything)nor could i make out the shape from the underside. it almost appeared to be a string of lights only. it moved slowly, too slowly i thought for an aircraft that would have that wide of a wingspan. when i could no longer see it (as it was again headed west) i turned up the street on the west side of the shopping center to go home. as i neared the railroad track (which is elevated)it was coming again from the west. i stopped my car, got out and tried to make out the size and shape as it flew directly over me. all i could see was one small flashing white light and stars; and all i could hear was the distance sound of a small airplane which really confused me! i thought i should be hearing some heavy engine noise as close as it was. it appeared to be only 50 feet above the tree tops. i felt a bit frightened by the contradiction of what i was seeing and hearing. my sister and i laughed about it, but it was a rather nervous laugh on my part.I returned home and fell asleep almost immediately. i work a graveyard at the a hospital and i usually take a nap before going in. i lived by myself, so there was no one to tell once i got home. \r\n\r\nsince this experience i have been trying to find aircraft that fit this same description. i've sat in a parking lot that's in the path of the landing strip at the gulfport/biloxi regional airport and i have not seen anything like it. the noise aircraft make when landing is enormous and they have lights of varying sizes. the lights aren't spaced evenly either. the lights on the craft i saw were all white and spaced just like a

witness) reported that they were almost abducted while guarding the motor pool. the four were sitting in the back of an open 2 1/2 ton truck, when they saw a light in the distance. the light was amber colored so they used a flashlight with a colored lens to signal the object. the ufo turned a different color and the marines changed the flashlight lens to match and signaled the ufo again. the ufo then moved to their location, hovered above the truck, and then shot down a beam of light which began pulling the four marines to it. the four linked arms with the marine at the bottom holding on to the truck. the ufo let go.\r\n\r\n4 days after this attempted abduction, witness was himself walking his guard duty post at the motor pool. it became eerily quiet. the witness looked up to see a giant saucer shaped craft directly above his head. he could see right underneath it - was about 1000 feet across and was metallic. the center of the craft was lighter in color then the periphery (about 100

observer it, but the craft was gone. no sound was heard during the event. witness discussed his sighting with the marines who had the experience 4 days earlier but they did not report it up the

about a ��� mile before my exit i noticed the vehicles ahead of me (two cars, and a semi tractor trailer) were putting on their brakes. i immediately thought ���oh great, an accident��� i was tired and wanted to get home. it was then, out of the corner of my eye that i seen very bright lights out my drivers window.  these lights were tree top height and were i���d guess about 50 yards away. i quickly took my foot off the gas and slowed way down while looking at these lights. there was a very large bright white light at each corner, 3, and in the middle, on the underside was another very bright white light. the lights were in the shape of a triangle. after a moment i quickly pulled over to the shoulder, rolled down my window and was reaching for my camera which was in my purse on the passenger seat while at the same time keeping my eyes on these lights which continued to move east. as i am struggling to get my camera it was moving further away. i could then see four to five, long slender, tube like red lights at the back end of it in between the two bright white lights and behind the center white light which was underneath. now, at this point i had to take my eyes away because my camera strap got hung up on the center council. by the time i got it loose and looked back i couldn���t see it. i then noticed heavy traffic was coming up behind me so i got back onto the highway and drove up to my exit. just as i got onto the off ramp, i looked into my rear view mirror and seen it again. when i got to the light at the end of the off ramp i turned left, drove down to grandriver, then turned left again to follow the lights, only now i couldn���t see them. i am now heading east (back-tracking) towards flying j���s gas station on grand river (two-lane county road) just opposite i96. i am also now on the phone with a friend of mine, telling her what i seen. as i am talking with her i spotted the lights again through the trees just before granger landfill. by the

the sky with telescopes, binoculars and the naked eye. i have observed venus, mars, jupiter and saturn, solar and lunar eclipses, comets, meteors, variable stars, the aurora borealis, nebulae and more. i am also familiar with the local air traffic and have tracked artificial satellites from horizon to horizon. i have never seen anything like what i witnessed in june, 2006.\r\n\r\nsometime near in june 2006, i was observing jupiter using my meade etx-90ec astro telescope (approximately 3 ��� inch primary mirror) with a 26mm plossl eyepiece which yields a power of 48x.\r\n\r\ni live in the western suburbs of cleveland, ohio, so the sky is never really great for viewing. but relatively speaking it was a good viewing night. it was a warm, clear night. i was observing jupiter and its four satellites, attempting to view some detail in the bands of jupiter. i could just make out three distinct bands on the planet. the 4 visible satellites were all lined-up almost horizontally (which is typical).\r\n\r\nafter about 10 minutes, i observed an object enter the field of view from about the 10 or 11 o���clock position. it was white and roughly the same brightness as the moons of jupiter, which means that it would not have been visible with the naked eye. it was moving in a straight line fairly quickly, traversing the distance from the edge of my view to where it stopped in about one second. it came to rest about 25% to 30% from the center of my view. it remained there for about two seconds then proceeded to move away off the right edge of my view in a shallow but definite arched curve. this second movement probably took a little less than one second.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object during its initial appearance, i immediately thought that i had happened upon an artificial satellite (in earth orbit) or perhaps a meteor. this would have been quite unusual given the limited field of view, but not unprecedented. one second later when it stopped i knew what i was seeing was quite unusual. when it moved off to the right in an arc i knew i was seeing something very strange.\r\n\r\nthe entire event took about four seconds. \r\n\r\nthis is my first report. i wish that i had documented the sighting earlier. now i don���t remember the exact date or time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

main ball fit intierly within the inside of the ring, and the ring was flat and smoth. the main ball had very loarge holes in it. the holes were a mirror imagage to the spots on the sun at the time. the size of the holes and the sun spots got bigger as the ufo moved closer to the sun and smaller as it moved away from the sun. the surface of the main ball looked like a thin tatered rag. it had a rainbow on it. \r\n\r\nthe ufo left a trail of heat behind it that lasted for a long time. it was about the size of a gulf ball when it first came up, it got smaller as it went around the sun and bigger as it came down again, to the size of a beach ball (bigger than a basket ball). as it moved around the sun it tilted so the same side always faced the direction of movement. \r\n\r\ni was a 5 year old child alone in my back yard facing north, when i felt something very hot on my back. i turned around and saw the ufo behind me, it did not seem to be moving so i turnd back around and noticed that the ground was sparkling and beeping. then the heat had increased, it felt like a hot pipe near my back. i looked again and the ufo had moved up and to the east. it passed under the sun and went up on the west side and over the top then down to the west at about a 30 degree angle and went down west of were it had come up.
