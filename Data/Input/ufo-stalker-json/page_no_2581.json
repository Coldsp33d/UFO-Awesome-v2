me that the star had moved!\r\n     i went out on deck to see (star) and it was about the same bightness and size as one, however it was moving and was getting larger.  when it went below the tree

not think it was all that bright.\r\n     i figured if it kept coming the same way it would pass over the local  high school, a perfect place to drive and wait, in parking lot.\r\n     we waited for a while, nothing happened, were almost ready to leave.  at the time the ufo came into view from behind some very large pine trees and stopped just as still as can be.  it gave off now noise at all, did not waiver or move for at least 20 minutes, we stood there beside our car and watched it for all 20 minutes.  it was flat on the bottom, domed top, about 30 ft accross, had glowing red and blue lights on it.  these lights were different however, they seemed to stay the same size, but moved around the craft at will, kind of like bubbles out of a bubble pipe.  it was a very cool and clear night, the ufo gave off a red hugh, must have been more red then blue lights.  after 20 minutes of just floating there, it moved, this was strang as well, it seemed to just start off at the speed it wanted to go, did not built up speed.  it also did not follow the conture of the ground/earth, it took off very level and stayed that way.\r\n     we (daughter and her friend and myself) tried to follow it but

olympics was on t.V....And that i was a teenager then; having been born in 9/13/1962. back then i used to love to go out on summer nights and look at the stars. i was out alone in my parents backyard--it had to be sometime between 9p.M. and 10p.M.--twilight time. this was in burns, oregon. i think i had been outside for just a minute, and the street that went alongside our backyard---we had two fullgrown trees of the same type--i don,t know what tyoe they were--just average height i guees--anf they were probably about 20 feet apart.  i forgot to mention the address--788 n. buena vista blvd.   burns, oregon. i was looking that way when suddenly mid tree top level a ufo appeared out of nowhere...It was glowing red colored and cigar shaped; and i judge it to be around the size of a fullsized 70's car! it appeared at about    betwwen the middle of both trees and moved very slowly and like an up and down erratic way-and when it moved just past the other tree it just disappeared into thin air; almost like it just blinked out and became invisible!! i felt like i was frozen in more of awe than in fright at the time! and then just a few seconds latter antor ufo appeare much in the same spot as the first--it was perfectly round and about the size of a vw and glowed a yellowish-white, like a lightbulb. it moved in the same erratic pattern as the first..And just suddenly dissappearedin such a way as the first ufo!!! i felt felt awed; amazed; and really scarred at the same time--like an adrenaline rush. after that i ran inside through the back door and told my mom-mrs. garnett sahlberg. of course i felt as though she didn,t really believe me.                                      in my life since then i've probavly have sighted ufo,s at least a dozen times. one thing i wanted to add that i just remembered from when i saw those two ufo's in 1972---when i saw them it only seemed like a couple of minutes at the most---but it was still twilight when i saw the first-and when i ran back inside it was totally dark--so if i had missing time it would't surprise me one bit!!!!! i also wanted to mention that sometime in the late 1980's or very eary 90's when i was living at an apartment at 1235 e. 7th st. in reno, nev.--one night i know i was awakened out of my sleep--i remembered i couldn't move any nor speak--and i remember one of those grey type looking aliens with the large slanted totally black eyes--except this one had pure white skin and seem around my height-5\"0 feet tall. it was standing on my right side and leaning over me; and i remember it saying telepathically to me-( i will father our children!); and that's all i remember! i have no proof--but i know it happened!!! and i know i would passed a lie detector test!!! i know--but not how--the whatever race of being it was that it was male--and that he would have had to have either of taken an egg-or an embryo--or not a very far along fetus from me! because if was pregnant any around that time i never new it consciously!! and i just know that he has been keeping track of me my whole life!    # if you should want to contact me please do so only by

orange, like a welders arc in brightness.This was at 8:45 because i remember right before looking at my cell phone to see the time. the object looked like two great big balls of light each about the size of the moon. i noticed some kind of structure{very dimley lit}between the balls of light.I followed it as it moved slowly and silently along to my right,and i was able to keep up with it until it got to my house. i was so suprised and stunned at what i was seeing that i forgot to call my wife on the phone and tell her to come out the front  door and see it! it went down our road until it got over the woods and then circled back twards me! it was only about three houses down when it then went up our back hill and off to the west. as i was watching it go west twards the ocean, it like blinked off and was gone. after this event i have become obsesed with finding out what this could have been. i also called our police about it but that went no where. our coastguard was doing work

worked for local newspapers (as a courier) for 20 years. my wife is the deputy editor of a local newspaper series here in n ireland that covers the area of this event.She has worked on these papers for 26 years.To the best of both our knowledge no one has ever reported what i am going to relate to you below, either before or since. very few people have ever been told this story as those who have (in a weaker moment!)  laugh! therefore it is one of these things that you tend to keep to yourself. i watched a documentry last night on the history channel about your organisation and this has inspired me to seek an answer elsewhere (if possible) after 34 years. my many years of trying have come to nought. in my army days i asked many questions of pilots (both helicopter and aeroplane) who flew this short stretch of water on a regular basis and none had seen anything out of the ordinary.There is also a regular ferry run to scotland (on a daily basis) from larne and those i have spoken to who worked on the boats again reported nothing.\r\n i have attached a picture of the area that i found on the internet and although taken from 5 miles more northerly on the coastline will give you an idea of the area. in 1972 i did not have any camera. in the backgound you can see the scottish coastline (22 miles away) the lighthouse is arrowed in red and the approx area of exit of the objects is in black and the path followed in green.\r\n\r\n  'at approximately 10.45pm on the evening of november 3rd 1972 (i remember it well as it was my 17th birthday) i was with a girl in a covered seafront shelter at larne (co antrim, n ireland) and we were enjoying each others company! the shelter was on a hill top (100 feet above sea level) that looked out over the irish sea (north channel) towards scotland that lay about 25 miles away to the east. a lighthouse (called 'the maidens', manned at that time and 75 feet tall) is situated about 7 miles out to sea from this point and warns ships of rocks that crop up out of the sea here. i had lived beside the sea all my life (up to this point) and was familiar with the lighthouse and the pattern of it's beam. i had been out to it on field trips while at school to study the rocks it sits on.\r\n  on this night (we had been to this place many times before) we had been friendly for a while when the girl drew my attention to a blinding green light out to sea. i turned out to look towards the sea and some distance beyond the lighthouse ( which was continuing it's usual pattern of horizontal flashes) we watched for some 15 minutes as a blinding (much much brighter than the lighthouse beam) series of green fluorescent cylinders exited the sea and shot straight and vertically heavenwards.They came every 30 seconds or so and we knew when they were coming as the sea itself around the exit point would glow bright green for a few seconds before we saw the cylinder exit the sea and fly at great speeds upwards and disappear into 'space'?  even at seven or eight miles away this glow in the sea lit up the whole area around it. after 15 minutes it just stopped! no more came, we watched for another hour.\r\n these  cylinders were huge as i was able to determine (using the lighthose as a guide) that they were at the very least the height of the lighthouse (80 feet) and certainly as thick as it. they left no trial behind. pattern was that the sea glowed green, cylindar emerged and shot upwards so quick that  you almost cricked your neck with the upward movement of the head following it. they came at regular 30 second intervals,almost perfect timing.They all followed exactly the same path upwards,something about the timing made me feel very uncomfortable. nothing natural would be able to do this.I was absolutely awestruck.'\r\n  the nearest that i have come to an explanation was several years ago when information came to light that an area beyond this (the beaufort dyke, a deep underwater trench in the north channel) had been used to dump munitions in since ww1 times. these munitions included phosphorus items. i wondered if some of these munitions could have caused such an event. i have since discounted this as it does not explain several things. why has it never been reported again, does not explain the shapes (in each case they were identical),the timings of the exits, the identical path they followed up and the enormous speed of the things. the intensity of the green light was again the same with each one that emerged. they were perfectly controlled and not a random 'explosion' of anything.\r\n  it was nothing to do with the lighthouse beam (which has always been white and horizontal) as we had a clear sight of it all the time, as the exit point was on an almost straight line between our eyeline and the beyond the lighthouse.\r\n  submarines have always been about in the north channel as they make their way to fastlane (scotland) but what the h*** would a sub be doing launching such enormous cylinders (even if they could back then) and these things were faster than any rocket, their speed was breathtaking. \r\n  i went out with this same girl for eight years after this event before we parted company. we had shared many many things to-gether. i met her a few years back after not seeing her for 20 years or so and the first thing she said to me was ' remember that strange night\". it had stuck in her mind all these years to the extent that it was the first thing that sprang to her mind after such a long absence.She also told me that it had 'freaked' her out and that she had never told anyone and never will speak of it again.She told me that even now she wakes up and gets very scared when she thinks of it. at the time she was too awestruck to be afraid.\r\n  i never saw anything like this again and even to-day after huge amounts of 'logical' thought time i am still at a loss.Even with all the advances in military technology which i try to keep up with, i would still say \"i have never seen anything like this\"! i am glad that i have taken the time to write this down as it has vexed me many times over the years, i like explanations and this thing i cannot get to grips with even now.\r\n  only one other event troubles me. a few years back i woke from sleep (was at home, just a normal night) to find that the skin on the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet were bright red and burning. had trouble walking on my feet and had to take a few days off work. this went away after a few days and a lot of cooling with water. on waking that morning my wife told me that i had  something like a small black 'thorn' stuck in my right temple. it was so small that she ended up getting tweezers to get it out with. it was about one eighth of an inch long and black.I have no explanation how it got there. we thought it was some sort of wood thorn that had managed to get on the pillow and i had 'rolled' on to it in the night. i decided to cut it with a small penknife and to my great surprize it turned out to be metallic like a needle point. i then tried to cut it with a small pair of scissors but again was unable to. it started to show silver under the black as the implements had 'rubbed' the black coating off. it was the broken tip of a black needle. sharp and pointed at one end and rough and jagged at the thicker end.\r\n i still have it somewhere in a small sealed plastic bag. not sure where, but am pretty sure that it is here somewhere, unless the children have made off with the bag not knowing what was in it. so unless my wife was trying to inject me in the temple during the night without my knowing (she assures me she wasn't!!) then i have absolutely no idea how this point came to be there .I was nowhere where such a thing would have been and if it had happened i think that i would have felt the pain, after all this fragment was lodged an eighth of an inch in the side of my head.I have no recollection of anything unusual that night, went to bed, slept and got up next morning. no explanation.\r\n    i have never spoken to my wife in great detail about the cylinders and have always insisted that i was alone, as the 'girl' with me at the time was my first wife and my present wife of twenty years and her have never been anything closer than enemies!! would appreciate not mentioning that i was other than alone if you decide to send any emails on this subject. i have never written these stories down before and never contacted anyone about them.\r\n   thank you for listening and if you can offer any ideas on these events i would be more than grateful as they have perplexed me for a very long time. i know it was a long time ago and it may be of little interest to you but i felt i needed to pass it on as i have been convinced since that night that, ' there are more things in heaven and earth. horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy' .     thanks,  george martin.\r\n ","distance":"Over One

barn.  we took the back way from the barn to my cousin's house so that we could possibly spot a few deer along the way.  we were approximately 2 miles from my cousin's home when he slammed on brakes and pointed at the sky to my right hand side.  i followed his finger until i too noticed the light.  it was a very bright yellowish color and it was just hanging in the sky in one place like a second moon (that's how large the light was).  we both thought that maybe it was the moon behind cloud cover until we looked around and saw the moon, and there was hardly any clouds in the sky.  it must've stayed in one place for only 30 seconds before it started moving horizontally across the sky from left to right.  the rate of speed was beyond anything i could possibly imagine, in less than 1 second it shot across, roughly, a quarter of the horizon i could see and stopped again.  the second time the \"object\" stopped the light reduced in size and started blinking in bursts about 3 times a second.  it stayed in that place for maybe another 30 seconds and then the blinking light stopped, and shifted to a deep red color (not blinking).  i was unable to see an outline of the object at this point because of the distance it was from us.  after it stayed still for 30 seconds or so, it immediately changed direction coming straight toward our vehicle at an extremely fast speed.  we were both unsure of what to do, and honestly we both were having a hard time believing what we were seeing at that point and time.  it got close enough that i could see the shape of the object.  it was a perfect equilateral triangle shape and now i could notice that the lights weren't changing colors, but on two points of the triangle the lights were yellow and blinking and the forward facing point the light was a deep red.  so i guess when it was on the horizon it was simply rotating, or changing it's direction and that's why we were noticing a change of color on the lights.  it took only about 15 seconds to get directly above our location from it's distant point on the horizon.  by this time i could clearly see it was some kind of unknown craft and it was huge.  it was entirely silent, no smell of fuel burning, no wind or anything.  we were so dumbfounded i can only give a rough size estimate, i'd say it was the size of half a football field.  my cousin was in a bad position being inside the truck to get a good look at it once it was so close to us.  i had my head out of the window of the truck and was getting a good view of it.  it must've stayed over our heads and slowly lowering towards the ground for a couple minutes.  at this time i look over at my cousin and notice that he's not even trying to look at the craft, he had his eyes straight ahead on the road and was scared enough to be shaking.  it happened so fast it all gets blurry from this point.  i wasn't scared up until the point it got directly overhead from us and at this point i remember having an immediate and overwhelming fear like i was in serious danger.  i remember while looking at the craft, yelling to my cousin to take off because it's going to fall on us.  he kind of came out of a daze (i'm not sure if he was even consious because he kind of jumped like coming out of a deep sleep) and took off towards his house.  i looked back at the object as we were taking off and could no longer see it.  in what could only be maybe a few seconds the craft was gone.  no trace of it anywhere in the sky.  as we were heading towards the house we both were still shaking and were trying to explain to each other exactly what we saw.  i had the best view of it and had to tell my cousin about it's shape and size.  at this point i asked him why he was staring ahead at the road and not looking at the craft, and his only answer was he didn't know why.  it seemed like time froze for him he said for a few minutes.  when i yelled to him he came out of it and that's when he remembers taking off.  it took maybe 2 hours for the full effect of the fear to wear off and i still didn't sleep well last night.  i was constantly getting up and peeking out my window, i wouldn't go outside because i was honestly scared of what i might see.  i remember looking at the clock just before the sighting so the time is very exact.  the time of the encounter was only about 5 minutes and we were less than 2 miles from his house, but it took us a lot longer than it should have.  we both have missing time gaps of maybe 20 minutes.  my cousins recollection of the event was very clear up until the point that it flew directly overhead of us.  my recollection of the entire event is crystal clear.  i really got scared when we got home and noticed a small time gap, i'm not sure if the encounter lasted a lot longer than i thought, or if i made a mistake judging the time (which is unlikely).  but it's all very strange to me.  also, after we arrived at the house we noticed two helicopters heading toward the spot where we saw the object.  i hope someone else spotted it and can give another account.  also, if anyones witnessed this before i'd like to hear information on the subject.  i'm too scared of what people will think to really ask around town, so any information would help put my mind at ease.  if you would like to contact me by phone or email to explain the sighting, please do so.  i'd be happy to answer any questions.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then

was between 7:30 and 8:00 p.M.. i had either read or saw on t.V. recently that our sun actually gives off white light and not yellow or orange like our eyes see during the day. because of the spectrum effect our atmosphere has. so i was looking at the stars saying to myself, the stars do all appear to give off white light, no sooner had that thought crossed my mind, when i see 2 lights move across my field of view very quickly. i am going to do my best to relate this incident exactly as it happened. my viewing of these objects lasted between 7 and 10 seconds. if i would have been in a treeless area, i could have seen them a lot longer. and i'll tell you why. my very first thought on seeing these ufos was that they were shooting stars, nope-- i've never seen 2 shooting stars travelling together. they were white lights, kind of dim with fuzzy light blue around the white(you could barely see the the blue) at first they were moving parallel with one another. the second one maybe 5 to ten miles behind the other one, while i was watching, the second one left the path it was on and flew close to the other one, then went back to it's original trajectory. i would estimate they were 5 to 10 miles above the earth, moving north to south parallel with the earth. it was really weird, but i knew i was witnessing something that was not from this earth. judging by the time i saw them, i would say they were travelling at between 600 and 800 mph. oh yea, they made no sound. it was a very clear night,not much wind at all. all you could really see were the lights. i couldn't make out any shape. they stayed the same brightness the entire time i saw them, the trees in my neighbors yard blocked my view, when they flew behind them. one other thing about them was how smooth they moved, i am almost 40 and i have never seen anything move like these 2 lights. if they were extraterrestrial craft, i wonder what they were doing? where were they going? we have air force bases in mississippi and florida relatively close to us. i can saythat a weird sensation went over me, but i don't know if it was from finally really seeing a ufo or something else. it was amazing to see and i probably will never be the same again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5739,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.6980766,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11132006-0004","longitude":-88.0417541,"occurred":1163390400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1163390400000,"summary":"2

flashing light in the sky, towards the northwest.  being a pilot myself i was aware that the flashes were not those of an aircraft, they were not flashing at a set speed.  the light was amber colored

they were gone, moving rapidly south.\r\n\r\nmy friend was sure this was a plane, but i explained to her that aircraft have a different set of strobe lighting, plus the lights couldnt have been more

snow arrives.  after moving the table we went up the stairs to the deck again.  it was a very clear night, the stars were bright, and i was just enjoying the view.  as i was looking up and around, i saw a section of sky that appeared to be moving out of sync with the stars.  at first i thought it was a dark kite, but it was going too straight and smooth in its direction.  i said \"what's that?\"  out loud as i pointed at it, and my friend looked up and saw it too.  it was traveling south almost parallel to hwy 94, i'm just on the north side of 94, west of 25.  my friend and i watched till it was out of range, about 15 seconds or so.  we didn't really have enough time to speculate out loud to each other much, we were just watching.  afterward, we described to each other what we saw.  we both agreed it was somewhat boomerang shaped, traveling in a straight line, maybe a hundred feet in the air or so, no sharp outline, just a set of white points similar to stars fading in and out, but moving together rather slowly, too slow for a plane.  my friend described the shape shifting in and out of view, as if it were trying to cloak itself.  it occurred to also that that was why it didn't seem to have edges, it seemed to blend into the sky and stars, as if the light was bending around it.  neither of us could say what it was for sure.  it was the first time either of us had seen anything like it.  i'm 33 and he is 28.  i wear glasses for driving, which i had on that night, he doesn't wear glasses.  the only mutual feeling we had was wonder and disbelief.  i wished we had

patrol approximately one and a half miles east of detroit, texas on u.S. hwy. 82.  i pulled my patrol car onto the shoulder to meet another deputy, john penny.  we were parked on the shoulder and both of us observed a large disc-shaped object hovering about twenty feet above the ground on the south side of the highway, over a field.  the object was initially moving toward us and looked like two dinner plates, one inverted on top of another.  around the midline of the disc was a bright band of very white light.  when the disc stopped moving foward, it was approximately 50 yards from our position.  when the forward motion stopped, the band of light around the center ceased and only a smaller bright light, like a landing light on a plane, was visible in the middle.  there was absolutely no sound.  the disc was very large, probably 100 feet in circumference and approximately 10-12 feet in height at the highest point.  no windows or portals were observed.  the object appeared metallic, but was not not shinny like tin foil or polished aluminum.  after watching the disc for several minutes, deputy penny decided he would attempt to get closer to the disc.  he got in his patrol care and drove across the highway and south on a county road which ran parallel to and very near the disc.  at about the time deputy penny's vehicle was adjacent to the disc, the bright light around the midline returned and the disc moved slightly upward and accelerated to the west at a phenomenal speed.  the sun was setting in the west, so i was able to observe the disc for some time.  it seemed to achieve a very high altitude.  there was a trail from it, though not like a vapor trail.  it appeared more like the tail of a comet.  the disc moved in an arc over the horizon and
