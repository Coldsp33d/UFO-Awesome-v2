was our air guard starting night practice, but then i realized this this was moveing too fast and too low to be a plane.. i noticed 1 pulslating blue lite on its underside, and if i had to guess it's shape i would have to say. sort of triangle.  i would guess it was no more than 1000 feet above ground.I didn't know what to think when it just stopped, after going so fast. i could hear no sound, not even when it took off again for the south east. i didnt tell anyone about this cause folks up here are pretty skepticle about such things. me included.The object stood still for maybe. four minutes and then it was gone.  funny thing,tho, after i saw it ,whatever it was, i slept like a baby.  i slept very late the next morning, and didn't remember the event untill the next evening.Well there it

guards, standing, (with arms length) all around the hanger... we just wondered why..Later on (days later)i went to see a new airman friend. i had no promblem going and coming on and off base. my father had been in the police and we had a sticker on the car. my friends \"barracks\" was real close to the runway, with the hangers in back. i ask him why all the guards\r\naround the hanger.. he said that, he heard, \"the marines are guarding a ufo\r\nthat crashed in new mexico last week.\" few days later, i went to pick him up. (we had dates for a party)i noticed the \"marines were gone\". i ask him about that. he said \"they (?) came in here last night, with a big flat bed truck, and later pulled out with a large

between 11 pm and midnight we heard what we thought were lots of sirens going off. the house we were sitting at was at the bottom of something the locals call high school hill. the school sits on top of a very high hill. tom and i left my sister with the kids and went to the top of the hill. we wondered if there was a fire at the local refinery. we started up the hill and thats all i can remember except for bits and pieces. i can remember standing beside tom in the middle of a bright light. outside the perimeter of the lights, in the shadows were what i thought were people trying to speak to us. i remember saying to tom'\" they're trying to talk to us \". at which time he replied \" no, its only the wind in the trees.\" the strange thing was that when we talked it was without speaking and i told him \" no, they are trying to talk to us!\". the next thing i remember was a beam of light, it lit up the hillside like daylight,but it was a funny color. the next thing i remember was standing and staring staight up in the air at a tremendous ball of light, it was  like fire and as i stood there and watched it, it got smaller. i don't remember us coming back down. and the funny thing was it took me awhile to remember that much. it just came back to me one night like i had been slapped in the face. when i called my sister to ask her if she remembered anything about the night we heard the sirens, she got excited and said \" thats so weird, i remember you guys came running down off the hill saying \" we saw something, we saw something!'. she said you know whats really funny?, its kind of like somebody threw a switch or something because we all forgot it at once. she said we had been up there for 2 to 3 hours. all i can remember are those brief bits. i have tried and tried to rememberwhat happened that night, but to no avail. i had one strange conversation with tom after that. he and my sister had gone their separate ways by then and i had to track him down. when i asked him if he remembered the night we went up the hill, he seemed to get agitated and said he couldn't talk about it. that was 30 years ago, i would give anything to remember and get those missing hours back. there have been other strange occurances since then.

driving east on balzerscak drive near mankato state university in summer of 1982 (approx june or july)when i caught a glimpse of a strange object moving from north to south near the eastern city limits of mankato. we immediatly stopped the car and got out to see if we could get a better look and to make sure it wasn't a reflection on the inside of my windshield. the object was a series of spherical orbs redish purple in color. i couldn't tell if they were connected but they moved as if they were. when it passed in front of us it was clear that it was three dimensional. we could not hear any noise from the object. it was very early (approx 2am) and no other cars/people were in the area. we observed it for 10-15 seconds as it steadily moved over the tree line to the south until we were unable to see it anymore. we were a little scared and excited about what we observed but pretty much kept it to ourselves because we didn't think anyone would take us seriously. a day or two later, there was a small story in the mankato free press newspaper about a law enforcement official who was at the mankato airport about 3 miles northeast of mankato at the same time we observed the object. he described the same object except he was 3-4 miles east of us looking west. that info allowed us to locate the object approx 1 mile east of mankato. altitude was difficult to estimate but it was below scattered clouds. i cannot remember the exact date which is unfortunate because i would like to read the story the officer gave the newspaper again so i can get the exact date and time.

did you see that?!?!?\" my wife replied \"yeah\" much more calmly than i had asked.  i was stunned and i still couldn't believe what i saw, so i told my wife (who was driving) to follow it so i could get another look at it; however, the object was already out of sight at this point.  we tried to follow it anyway.  we drove through the park and then south on howell ave. all the way to the airport.  we never again saw the object.  i am sure that the airport had to have seen the object, but i do not know who to contact to find out if my wife and i are the only people who saw it.  additionally, this all happened inside of the city of milwaukee, in a very heavily populated area; therefore, i am sure that someone else had to have seen this object.  i have always liked aviation, so i have at least a basic knowledge or aeronautics.  there is not a single aircraft that i am aware of that can hover and move silently.  furthermore, i am not aware of any aircraft that can move without having to accellerate in order to get up to speed.  it was not a helicopter because first of all it was silent, and second, it was way too big.  so assuming that it was not a helicopter, i don't think that it is possible to fly any large aircraft as silently and slowly as this object was moving without staling and crashing.  i'm not crazy and i'm not a kind of person who sees a ufo every time a plane goes over our house.  i am 100% possitive that i not only saw what i saw, but also that there is nothing in the known world that can move like this object did.  i plan on doing a sketch to submit, but i wanted to get this info down while it is still fresh in my mind.  please contact me if there are any other reports of this object from either the airport or other witnesses.

awake.  i was facing towards my window, and high in the sky about two thirds of a mile away, i saw 4 orange circular lights in a perfect square, not to far apart from each other yet not close enough to be an object i have seen.  i kept staring at it, and it didn't move an inch or change.  because of that, i started to feel scared, so i watched tv for about 5 minutes but that didn't help.  i looked and it was still there, in the exact same spot.  i closed my eyes for a minute or so.  then, the 4 orange lights blinked twice and then a large, thick, grey streak of what looked like jet fuel came from beneath it and it flew off very fast straight up into the sky.  \r\n\r\nafter the event, like anybody who saw a ufo, thought of the possibilities it could have been:\r\n-at first, a helicopter.  but i doubt a helicopter would stay in the exact same spot for 10 minutes (especially at 4 in the morning) and have orange circular lights arranged in a square.\r\n-then, a space shuttle or a rocket.  4 circular lights, the heavy trail of fuel and the speed makes sounds like a space shuttle.  but i live in a northwest suburb of chicago, where there are no space stations for at least 1,000 miles.\r\n-then i thought maybe i just had a very odd illusion.  but i am not on any illegal drugs and i don't drink.  the only medicine i had took before that day was ibuprofen, which doesn't have any side effects of that nature.  i don't think it could be that i was tired because like i said i was wide awake at that time.  \r\nand i highly doubt it could be an object such as a plane i was mistaking it for, i have very good vision, especially far away.  also, my uncle is a pilot so i learn a lot from him.   \r\n-then, i realized that it was maybe an actual 'ufo' (time travelers, aliens, ancient astronauts, etc)  about 15 hours after the event, it still remains to me as the definition of ufo-unidentified flying object.       \r\n\r\nas soon as i woke up before the whole event, i felt scared even though the sighting hadn't taken place yet.  like i said i felt scared through out the sighting, and didn't really fall asleep until an hour after the moment.  i felt like i was being watched the whole time.  i wouldn't say that i was terrified though.  now, i am over the moment and i am not scared at all, but curious if anyone else saw what i saw, or more, and what it is.\r\n\r\nthe attachment is a microsoft paint drawing of the object(s).  it isn't very good, but it somewhat gets to the point.  if you have anymore reports from people in the st charles/south elgin

years ago, near the same spot but up a block, i was walking along in the evening, and this van drove by, of course, and everyone was partying in it, and it appeared to drive up close to me.   after it passed me, i heard a bang, and looked around instantly just a second after it passed...No wreck, but no van either. \r\n\r\nthat's all...Anything else has been fancy on my part...Staring too long at a

mum told me to look outside the window. there were 6 fairly large orange orbs extremely high up flying in a formation (see attachment) \r\n\r\nthey drifted across the sky for a few minutes before disappearing behind some clouds. \r\nmoments later three other orbs (two of which were the same and one was slightly larger with a white core) went across the sky travelling in the same direction. \r\nthen just as i began to think that they were planes, an actual plane began flying from over my house towards them (still very high up). \r\n\r\nmy house is on the top of a hill and all of the fireworks that are in my range of view are relatively no higher than my house, and these were miles up (i'm not informed enough to make an accurate estimate) \r\n\r\nthe first objects took about 180 seconds to pass over. of the next three, the smaller two disappeared (as in now you see me now you don't) after approximately 90 seconds, but the larger one stayed for 180 seconds like the first ones.

very dim lighting (looked almost like it was reflecting the star\r\nlight off of it) then as it flew towards the tree line it banked towards the west out to the ocean.\r\n what really stunned us all

exactly describes what we all saw, slow,low,big,silent and dim lighting.\r\nwe live in eureka,ca we have some military aircraft training here in\r\nthe mountain ranges just east of us where the they

from the gutters and had been doing it for about a half hour.  it was a beautiful day for us in november, blue sky with almost no cloud cover.  i climbed up to the apex of my roof to just take a break and lay down on my back and looked up at the sky as i was laying on my back.\r\ndirectly above my line of sight i saw a white \"dumbell\" that was moving east.  it was way, way up in the sky, and thus was quite small i would say slightly larger than you would see if you see a jet flying over at high altitude where you can still make out a perfect shape of the plane but it is still very small.  i could cover the object with the tip of my little finger if i strechted out my hand to full length.  \r\neven though i initially saw the dumbell shape, i realized there is nothing that flies in the sky that is dumbell shaped so i kept watching it trying to figure out what it was.  i thought it might be a white pelican as we have these around our area, though not this time of year.  they fly very high, have about a six feet wingspan and when they fly high and soar on the thermals as high as they fly, you can still tell they are birds with the naked eye, can see the wings etc.  from all the ones i have watched before.  i quickly ruled out a bird, no flapping, this had a \"bar\" connected to two white spheres on either side of the bar and the bar was a perfect line, a bird would be thick in the center with smaller wings seen on each side.  i thought could it be 2 white balloons somehow tied together and floating high in the air, but quickly discounted this as well because if it were two balloons connected, from the distance this thing was away from me, there would be no string or rope that one could see from that distance.  yet, i could clearly see a  white horizontal line that had the same color white spheres on each end.  \r\nthe object was oriented perfectly horizontal with the bar parallel to the horizon and the spheres on either side, right and left.  as the object moved at a rapid pace east, the object rotated clockwise slowly 90 degrees so the bar was perpendicular to the horizon and the spheres were facing up and down.  it did not seem to rotate any more and seemed to stay in that orientation.  there was no change in color, no sound, no pulsation, no metallic look or any change shape that i could tell.  as far as the speed of this thing i stretched out my finger and followed it across the sky for about 20 seconds in a slow arc of my arm, until it dissappeared (not vanished) as it continued to move further away until it was not visible anymore.  nothing was emmitted from the object, no sound, no vapor trail etc.  \r\nas i layed there for the next 15 minutes thinking of what i saw, i saw a jetliner above heading eastword and compared the size and speed of what i had seen to this jet.  the relative size was just a hair larger than the jet was at its full altitude (can make out the jet shape) and the speed was about the same as i tracked it with my finger and arm. it was out of sight at about the same length of time as the object i saw.  i remained calm as i saw this, and tried to be as objective as i could.","distance":"Over One

upstairs, and saw white lights moving in such a strange pattern that he woke me up to see what i thought of it.  he is very much a skeptic on the ufo subject, but he and i ruled out everything in our experiences that could explain what we saw.  the sky was overcast.  there were four, and sometimes five, round lights with hazy perimeters (as opposed to circles with perfect outlines) that circled a large area in the sky in an intercepting pattern - reminiscent of a diagram of the path of atmomic particles, but two dimensional - for about two seconds, then converged in the center of the cirular area for about one or two seconds, then zoomed outward to repeat the pattern.  before waking me up, in  addition to the circling lights, my husband had observed another, larger white light glowing over the neighbor's house a short disctance away, which had disappeared when i came to the window.  we watched the circling lights for about 20 minutes until they appeared to ascend higher and fade a bit, at which time my husband left the window.  i continued to watch until they again seemed to ascend and completely fade out, which was at 6:30 a.M.  they did not look like search lights.  at times we could barely see a beam or two, which radiated from closer to the center of the circle, rather than outside of it as a search light would do.  also, the circle of light that a search light makes is more defined and connected to a beam.  these were not like that, and, as i said, were so strange to my husband that he wanted me to see.  he called the snohomish police department this morning, but they had had no reports of this sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
