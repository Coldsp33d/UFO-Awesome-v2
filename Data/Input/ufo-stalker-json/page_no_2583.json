they finally passed over one another for a brief moment they seemed to be one object, to switch sides and then continue parallel as they were before crossing each other. these things move like no aircraft i have ever seen.  other times i have seen lights that move and shift angles suddenly.  last night was remarkable but another sighting i have had was equally as breathtaking.  about three weeks ago i spotted a glowing light in the eastern sky about 1/4 of the way up the horizon.  it glowed bright at first.  as it moved it began to angle west to head toward belle river.  i watched as it came closer and closer at a very high speed toward my area.  it did not blink and its light effects altered as it moved growing dimmer to an orangish colour.  it came at an angle and over the town passing directly over my street and it angled down as it passed. i would say its lowest elevation was maybe 1000 ft.  as it passed over its glowing orange light shifted to a vertical straight line of light and then flattened to a horizontal light still orange.  as it passed over i could notice a shape which was light in colour(grey to white) and shaped like a wide cylinder which tapers off on the ends.  i should mentioned that the shape that this object exhibited as it passed  over was one i had seen before.  when i had seen it before i thought my eyes might have been playing tricks on me as it was so fast and brief.  when i saw that shape the first time it was after i opened my eyes while relaxing in the hottub.  it passed over so fast i thought maybe it was a really fat seagull but i took note of its shape thinking if i ever saw it again i was recognize it and i did see it again after all.  i should mention something about the location of where i live.  belle river is across from michigan bored by lake st clair.  there is apparently an airforce base in michigan across from belle river.  we are in line with windsor airport and close to detroit metro airport across the detroit river.   \r\n       i am alarmed at what i am seeing but not fearful.  i feel that it should be looked into.  i do not know if i should be calling the police or what.  it is a very alienating experience and i cannot believe that i am the only one around here who is seeing these things.  i am a regular person, a nurse with a full time job,a mortage, a husband and a dog.  i am not depressed or seeking attention.  mufon to me is the top investigators of ufo phenomena.  i hope someone contacts me because i don't know if i should do anything else about it and maybe you could let me know what i should do if anything.  i have had 12 sightings too many to describe right now.  i do not own a video camera but i am seriously thinking of investing in one.  i would appreciate a contact back via email.  thank you so much for your help.

patio at the rear of our house in novato, ca, around 11:00 pm, enjoying the unseasonably (for sf bay area) warm evening weather, gazing north towards a local mountain called mt. burdell (1558' high & about 1.2 miles away). i was looking at the stars & the occasional commercial jet on the familiar flight path coming from the pacific northwest heading to san francisco airport. there were no clouds in the sky, no moon was visible (it's always in the opposite direction anyway), and no wind. it was about 85 degrees f.\r\n\r\nsuddenly & seeming to just manifest from nowhere, a goldish circular light appeared in the sky. it was about 1/3 the size of a full moon when the moon is at it's apex. it was an intense (but easy to look at) soft gold color, that seemed to be pulsing on the outer circumference of the object, which had no visible defined edge. no other shape or features within or without the object were visible. there was total silence as it moved laterally & very slowly in a westerly direction, above (700-800') the crest of the mountain. no commercial jets or other aircraft were in the area at the time.\r\n\r\ntotally surprised by what i was seeing i quickly thought about fireworks or flares, both ideas which i discarded immediately (the ever present summer fire danger & other reasons). i called to my son to join me as i continued to watch this amazing & mysterious celestial display. then just as my son was about to step outside, there was a soft, low frequency popping noise, with a very noticeable accompanying feeling of something like static electricity in the air, & the object seemed to disappear, or transform, or perhaps accelerate at an incredible speed. instantly in its place was a dot of light, looking much like a small star, except it was moving, now appearing like it was ascending high above the earth, after the seemingly instantaneous burst of phenomenal speed. it was like it somehow jumped through space, from one point to another (bypassing the distance between points), like distance for this object was a non-issue. it was difficult to continue to see as it became fainter, until it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\nfor the record, we (my family & i) have seen other ufos in the night sky from our patio (interestingly only this year) as well as other locations in northern california & nevada (other years, including the often seen triangle [which had a transponder light]), although this gold object was the most impressive. it seems like ufos are a very common, natural occurence in space-time, just above us, all over the planet.

(we both forgot our watches but had a good idea of the time because we checked it whenever we stopped), we stopped in connecticut (one hour) and then arrived at boston around 5:00-6:00 p.M. since it was still daylight we decided to travel up route 3 to new hampshire.\r\n\taround 9:00 p.M. we returned to boston. we entered boston on route 9���something slightly odd happened at a filling station here, but i don���t remember what it was now��� then, unable to find a motel room in boston, we decided to search the boston outer belt. at about 10:00 am, we were traveling west on route 9 and noticed an unusual object to our south. we hadn���t been thinking about ufos and had previously paid little attention to this subject.\r\n\tas we traveled on route 9 and then south on route 128 we watched the object intermittently. part of the time trees obscured our view. the object was as bright as or brighter  than airplane landing lights, but moving in an erratic pattern and blinking. sue said she thought it might be a ufo. i  told her that it was a helicopter blinking its landing lights. awhile later sue told me that she once had a sighting of a possible ufo. i was surprised because our parents were negative on the subject of ufos and hadn���t permitted us to talk about it during our childhood. 1 told her that i might have made a previous observation and also mentioned a small object we had seen in our bedroom when we were children. (see my ������bedroom light,������ iur, marchlapril 1988.)\r\n\tas we continued on 128, we could still see the object to the south in front of us. it was impossible not to notice it. i informed sue that if it were a ufo, the radio stations would announce its presence and people would come out to look at it. since no crowd was watching it, it couldn���t be a ufo.\r\n\tto our south we could see airplanes coming in from the east and traveling to the west with their landing lights on. some of them may have been landing at the norwood memorial airport on route 1. the object appeared different from the airplanes because it took a meandering path, its lights were blinking all the time, and it was lower, showing less angular displacement from the ground than airplanes the same distance away. it appeared to be traveling south along route  95.\r\n\tbecause i was driving, i didn���t watch the object as closely as sue did. i was put out because she was paying attention to the object instead of watching for a motel. years later, in 1984, after we had submitted our reports to cufos, sue told me that she thought the object was unusual because it would hover and then flit to another place at an incredible speed. since i didn���t watch it closely (its unusual appearance was so obvious that i didn���t even consider that it could be anything abnormal), i noticed only its odd lighting and  meandering trajectory. traveling south on route 95, we noticed what appeared to be a basketball-sized object around 50-90 feet away from us. on or near the ground, it constantly changed colors and was in a woods on the west side of the road. as i remember, the colors varied from red to blue and changed so that they gradually blended into each other. for example, they would change from red to bright pink, dark pink and then to more of a bluish color. the object seemed to have a thin dark strip which slowly rotated around it. at that time, i didn���t  know where the airports in the area were and assumed that the light belonged to an airport. (since then i have learned that the nearest airport��� norwood���wouldn���t have been in that location.)\r\n\tas we passed the light, the inside of the car lit up for a minute or more in green, as if several green christmas  tree lights were shining inside the car. i remember looking for the source of the green light and not seeing anything; the ball of light by the road wasn���t green. i also remember discussing the green light with sue while the car was lit up. i think we decided it must have been an airport light (although now i don���t know what it was). i don���t recall that i saw green light on the outside of the car. i don���t know if the possible ufo was in sight at that time, because i wasn���t watching it. sue remembers nothing about the ball of light or the light in the car. she continued to insist that the object was unusual and this irritated me, because i thought a ufo couldn���t be that close to a city and that obvious without attracting attention. i remember shouting, ���it���s a helicopter!������ further south, sue said that it was going to pass over the road and insisted that i stop. i pulled to the west side of 95, grumbled, and pointed my hand out the window, so that i could immediately say, ������see, stupid, a helicopter,������ as soon as i saw the object.  just as l did this, i saw a distant meteor���s brief flash (subtending a small degree of arc) and remarked on it. immediately, in approximately the same place, several degrees north east, the low blinking object appeared flying over the trees. i don���t know the degree of arc that its long axis subtended, but i was able to easily see and count seven distinct, brightly-lit square areas in a horizontal row along its length. these looked like windows. the object resembled a football with seven windows along its midsection. we thought we were viewing the inside of the object. at the time this seemed so obvious that i didn���t think of figuring out why we thought the squares were windows instead of panels. i think one reason was that there was the effect of depth, that we were stereoscopically seeing inside the object. it seemed as if we stereoscopically looking through a transparent layer and into the object���s interior.\r\n\twe have seen many advertising airplanes and this object looked nothing like one of them. the squares were on the side of this object. each of the seven was square; their sides made exact right angles,  and they were in a row. the object crossed the road slowly so we had plenty of time to view it from different angles and its appearance had nothing in common with an advertising airplane���s. the lit areas were definite squares with distinct spaces between them. the corners of the windows were not rounded as are aircraft windows (to prevent fatigue cracks), and they subtended approximately 1/4 of the object���s width.\r\n\t in her cufos report sue said that when we first saw the object, ���a light seemed to shine down from it and shone in our car,������ and added in a letter (1984) to me that the inside of the car lit up in blue. i don���t remember this. perhaps only sue saw this because she had to look across the car, whereas i was looking out the window. i immediately  turned off the car, got my camera out, removed my film from the car trunk, and watched the object over my shoulder as i loaded my camera by placing it on the car trunk and feeling it. sue was standing to my west behind the car. the object traveled from cast to west.\r\n\tthe object was much lower than the airplanes. we had seen this as we approached it and thus had been able to compare its altitude with that of airplanes from several angles and distances. the object���s inside was evenly lit by a very high intensity white light which resembled mercury vapor or fluorescent light. the light wasn���t concentrated anywhere, almost as if the atmosphere inside the object were glowing. we were also surprised by the light���s brightness. we had watched the object all the way from boston and the light was as bright or brighter than airplane landing lights. we expected to see something like the inside of an airplane with furniture, or pilots, but didn���t see any features. we discussed the fact that we couldn���t see the operators and were puzzled. i hoped to take a photograph of the inside of the object with operators. since the windows took up a fair portion of the object���s area, we speculated about whether it might be empty or have operators (if human-sized) under the windows or in the front or back, where there weren���t any windows.\r\n\tsue said that its silhouette occluded stars. i didn���t notice this because i paid attention to loading my camera. i  think, however, that i also saw a silhouette. the object was fairly low and there may have been enough light diffusing from boston, the freeway, and its own lighting to have enabled us to see its dark portion. it passed very slowly over the highway giving us a lot of time to view it from different angles.\r\n\tas we watched it, we repeatedly asked each other detailed questions, such as: ���how many windows do you count?��� to determine whether we saw the same thing. the sky was clear. we would have been able to determine whether it had wings. if a wing had been above the windows, their light  would have reflected from it, and if a wing had been below the windows, it would have blocked our view of the windows.  we saw no indication of wings. we heard no sound from it, although we had been able to hear nearby airplanes that were higher than the object during the time we watched it. it had a small unblinking red light on one end and a small unblinking green light on the other end. neither of us remembers which light was on which end. we didn���t see any blimp above it; thus we didn���t believe it to be the undercarriage of a blimp. we were calm, scientific, and methodical and continually checked our observations by asking each other questions.\r\n\tthe blinking pattern was complicated. although i can���t recall the pattern exactly when the object crossed the road, i think that its three front squares would blink on and off  twice; then all seven  would blink on and off once, and the last four squares would blink on and off. its squares would then be off for a while. afterwards they would repeat the sequence.\r\n\twe thought there may have been two compartments in the interior, such that the lights in one area could he turned on separately from the others. sue does not now recall that the lights had any pattern during the rest of the observation.  she also thought that the object could have moved in any direction didn���t necessarily have to go forward as an airplane would; thus, the blinking pattern would also have depended on the object���s orientation. i would estimate that when a group of windows were lit, they stayed on for around a second. i think that possibly when the three windows were lit this blink was of the shortest duration, and there was a difference also in the duration of four versus seven squares being lit. also, during the observation, sue kept referring to the blinking pattern as signal. i didn���t understand why she kept saying this. she seemed to think that the object was signaling someone. when i finished loading my camera, i believed that the object was still close enough for the separate windows to be visually resolved. by this time, however, a tractor truck and a trailer pulled over in front of us. i assumed that the driver had stopped to watch the object and was glad that we had another observer. the driver came back and asked what we acre doing, acting as if he thought we were having car trouble. we knew that it is dangerous to take up with strange men at night and so we just pointed to the object and asked him what it was, acting as if we thought it was an unusual airplane.\r\n\ti was standing behind the driver���s rear tire of our car. sue stood behind the passenger rear tire to my west, and the truck driver was standing about two feet east of me. i pointed to the object���s position in the northwest at perhaps 40 degrees in azimuth. when i pointed to it, he rotated his whole body 180 degrees, so that he was facing  the southeast and  looked to about the same azimuth as the object, and said that he didn���t see anything. then he rotated back to face northeast. then he asked the same question a second time (in a sincere manner). i gave the same reply and he then went through the same set of motions. then after he had rotated back to face the northeast, he gave us the cuckoo sign (pointed to his forehead and shook his head) and returned to his truck. he never looked in the object���s direction and 1 didn���t press the issue because i was afraid of him. i think i recall that the ufo had been directly over his truck as the object slowly passed over the freeway.\r\n\ti don���t remember much about his appearance. he was a little taller i am. he must have been average in appearance, because i didn���t notice anything in particular about him.  sue doesn���t recall talking with him at all; however, she does remember the truck���s passing us, parking in front of us and following us later. she remembers that the driver didn���t see the object. by the time the truck driver left (i was afraid to take my eyes off him when he was there, so i didn���t take a picture), the object was farther away and probably too far away to photograph the separate squares. i didn���t consider flagging down another witness  because i was trying very hard to take a picture and i was hesitant to confront strangers at night.\r\n\tthe object was to my northeast when i started talking with the truck driver. when i was finished, it should have been further northwest.  at that point i didn���t want to take a photograph while standing by the freeway, because i was afraid of getting traffic lights or lens flares in my photograph. i had photographed stars before with this camera and knew that i needed a time exposure. there was a small tree-covered hill to the west, so i asked sue to guard the car while i ran over the hill to try to take photographs. i don���t know why i thought i could get a good photograph sue began to argue with me, insisting that she come with me. she said later that she thought the object was close and did not want me to run toward it.\r\n\tbut i was afraid that the truck driver would take over the car if we both left. we continued to argue and finally sue stayed by the car. (when i talked with her in 1987, however, she insisted that she remembers nothing about talking with the man and didn���t understand what i was talking about when i wanted her to guard the car.) i ran through a group of trees and came out on the other side of the hill. there was a freeway fence and an area with no trees. the ufo should have been to the northwest  but i���m not sure where it was. i can recall not taking photographs when cars went by on the freeway (to the northeast), so that my camera might have been aimed to the northeast. it is possible that the object changed its trajectory from traveling from the east toward the west to traveling from the west toward the north or northeast, while i was speaking with the truck driver or going through the grove of trees. i looked around this area in 1987 and there is a fence on the other side of the hill, which follows along the freeway.\r\n\t i was extremely interested in taking the photograph, because i thought that we were viewing the inside of the object and i didn���t know of any other instance of someone���s getting this opportunity. i got one photograph that showed the object.\r\n\tafter i made my cufos report and read sue���s report, there were parts of hers that i didn���t understand. so i asked for her recollections:  ���we realized that the object was going to go directly over the road in front of us or just over the trees (about 70 feet up). irena pulled the car over to stop so we could get out to see it better. we both  rapidly got out. irena climbed a small hill to get closer. i stayed near the car. i was watching to see if could see people or beings inside. i couldn���t even see a shadow. then irena decided to take a picture of it and hurried down the hill and got her camera out. the film was out in the camera and it seemed to take a long time for her to get new film in. she seemed to have a problem getting the film in. then she was ready to take the  picture, but the  object was quite a ways off then. it immediately left the  area where we were as soon as it crossed the freeway. there was no sound when it left. it just seemed to suddenly get into another place.\r\n\tsue also recalls that all the time i was over the hill she could hear me talking. (i don���t recall talking when i was there and there was no one to talk to.) also once she said that she remembered my running back over the hill twice and that i seemed excited and was shouting once. she also said once that when i was on the hill she thought the ufo was right over me. that is why she said in her cufos report, ���it could be right over you and completely disappear.��� she reported hovering. this surprised me because i didn���t recall watching it hover. she thought i was close to it when she thought that it hovered over my head.  she also said that she thought it made several passes over the car. it must have made more than one, because it was in the wrong direction when i was on the other side of the hill ready to take pictures. i do vaguely recall another pass, but the memory is discontinuous with the rest of my memory. i don���t recall any of this and found out when i asked her after i read her report in july 1987.\r\n\talthough our recall of the possible ufo���s appearance and of most of the observation is the same, our recall of certain particular events during the time we were stopped is different. several events that we remember differently are: (1) the number of times i ran over the hill and whether or not i was talking; (2) speaking with the  truck driver; (3) the  object���s blinking pattern; (4) its trajectory, distance from us (sue seems to remember that when she first saw it, it made a low close pass over us), and whether or not it was directly over me; (5) its zooming away.\r\n\ti believe that my recollections are accurate because i made notes shortly after the event and kept them; sue also made notes. (she believes that she sent them to project bluebook. i have checked and her report isn���t there - however it has been reported that a number of reports are  missing from project bluebook files. these differences may have occurred because (1) we paid attention to different things, (2) her recall over time may not be as good as mine because she lost her notes or (3) the possible ufo did something to our minds. in some instances, her memory seemed better than mine, as in her recollection of the object���s blinking pattern. the only blinking pattern that 1 recall had to do with seven, four, and  three squares blinking. sue recalls this pattern but in general she thinks the pattern was random. perhaps this is because she watched it for a longer time than i did.\r\n\talso, three of sue���s accounts say that she saw the object speed away around the time that i look my photographs. i don���t remember seeing it do this. i didn���t even think about it until 1987, when i wondered why the object wasn���t in the location (in the northwest) where i thought it should have been, when i took my photographs. (if it had been to the west i wouldn���t have needed to leave the freeway.) sue appeared to have watched it ���suddenly get into another place������ at around the time i was talking with the truck driver. moreover, although we were parked in public freeway traffic soon after we had made a drive from new york we seemed to be confused right here and not later, when we followed the object along an isolated road.\r\n\tafter i had looked at my photographs, sue and i were standing by the car. the object was now perhaps one to three miles west or northwest of us. it began to circle. the diameter of the circle was perhaps one mile and it appeared to make a perfect geometrical  counterclockwise circle each time in exactly the same place. it was too distant for us to see individual squares. its circling followed a regular pattern. when it moved in a south to north semicircle, it moved slowly and blinked its light on twice at about from (0 degrees = north to 360 degrees = north in a clockwise circle) approximately 150 to 120 degrees and 60 to 30 degrees. when it appeared to be at the northern most part of each circle, it would turn on its lights and travel in a 360- to 180-degree semicircle incomprehensibly fast. it was almost too fast to see and i vaguely remember each time afterward that it had flashed past. i was afraid each time it made this fast pass because it could have just gone anywhere in a fraction of a second. i have never seen such speed. its lights seemed more intense when it made this fast past, but it might have looked this way because the object was moving toward me and, thus, would have subtended a larger angular displacement as it  was approaching me (from 270 to 180 degrees) and also there might have been a doppler effect. the object may have been circling something. at that time we thought it was circling the airport. we stood watching it and comparing observations. during the time we watched it, we hadn���t heard sounds from it, although occasionally we heard sounds from the airplanes in the area. as it circled, several times we heard loud booming sounds like a jet engine revving, or like a sonic boom.\r\n\twe discussed this and decided that the noise might have  been from a jet preparing to leave the airport. (in 1987, however, joe nyman of massachusetts told me that there were no jet airplanes at norwood airport.) the noise frightened me. i can not recall whether or not i heard the booms each time the object  traveled fast, but the sounds occurred while it was circling. i wondered if they might have been associated with the circling, in other words, if it had been making sonic booms during the rapid part of its circular flight pattern. it was certainly going more rapidly than the speed of sound.\r\n as we had watched the object, we also watched other aircraft flying in the area. the object stayed lower than the other aircraft. it seemed that airplanes were not landing there, while the object circled. we could see several airplanes as they circled high above the, airport.\r\nwe didn���t know which direction we should take, when we returned to the car. our car was headed south. we were unfamiliar with the roads in the area and didn���t know which direction the object might take when it stopped circling. we decided to turn our car around at the next intersection. when we pulled on to the freeway the truck driver we had seen earlier pulled in right behind us. he rode our bumper (it seemed like five to 10 feet behind us) and beamed his bright lights into my rear view mirror. i was blinded.\r\n\tat first i thought he was trying to signal us and almost started to pull over to ask what he was doing, but i changed my mind. for some reason i thought of the green light that had been in the car and looked back to see if our car was lit up again. i thought the truck driver might have seen the light and decided to look more closely, or was looking for something in our car. then i got scared and floored  it. i was going about 80 mph.\r\n\twhenever i switched lanes, he switched lanes. i was afraid he might intend to run us off the road or cause an accident. i don���t know what intersection it was, but we agreed to swerve off the road at the next intersection from the left-hand lane so he wouldn���t suspect that we were leaving the freeway. this was very hazardous, because we couldn���t see if any cars were overtaking the truck in the right-hand lane. luckily, we survived and lost the truck driver. the truck trailer might have been gray or silver and about the size and shape of a large u-haul. we didn���t pay attention to the truck or take its license number and when he began following us, it was too late to do anything but get away.\r\n\twe returned to route 95 traveling north, while the object was still circling. my notes say that i thought the object circled for around 20 minutes. then the object began to travel approximately northwest. we saw the object that changed colors again in the same position. the inside of the car lit up in green, again. the light seemed to be a hazy, diffused green and, as before. stayed in the car for a while as we drove along. i didn���t see a source for the light. i believe that the flying object was in view this time, when the car lit up in green. l  didn���t see the green when we were near  the possible ufo,  only when we were near the light that changed colors. but i saw this object only when the possible ufo was near. i saw it when we first approached the possible ufo and when we were leaving the area with the object in sight. i didn���t see it the next time we passed the area. we didn���t have time to stop and look at the light; the object was low and we needed to keep right up with it to follow it.\r\n\twe continued to follow the object, which was heading northwest. it was clearly distinguishable from everything else because it was low, bright, and blinking. we traveled up route 95, then east on route 128. next, we took a highway west; i believe this was route 9, but it may have been route 20. we wanted to get a good look at the object. since it was traveling northwest, we then needed to head north. by this time it was always too distant to see the separate lighted squares.\r\n\twe turned north on the next road, a pothole-filled gravel road, with houses far apart and hidden by trees. i tried to keep us at around 30 to 40 mph with the object, but felt that i was tearing up my car trying to travel over the bumps. unable to get any closer, we quit following it. we turned around and decided to look for motels again. we drove just off the freeway two or three times but didn���t stop because there were no-vacancy signs at the motels.\r\n\ton the way back we were apprehensive and kept looking for the object. sue thought that possibly the object was visible only to us and seemed surprised that no one else noticed it. in fact, i had paid attention to it only at her insistence.\r\n\ti don���t recall stopping on the way back to madison, new jersey. there was little traffic and we breezed through new york without stopping on sunday morning. we arrived at drew university at 6:00 a.M. the speed limit in 1968 was 70 mph. a l974 atlas shows the driving  distance between boston and new york as 209 miles. we don���t know if we were missing any time.\r\n\tsue was interviewed by budd hopkins and ���kathie davis������ in indianapolis on november l, 1984. hopkins tried unsuccessfully to hypnotize me on october 27, 1985. in the future we may again try ways to enhance our recall.\r\nin looking through the literature, i have found very few examples of anything that had the appearance of our object. in this case the windows/panels on the side(s) of the object were square.  although several people have made the comment that sue and i were probably watching an advertising airplane, because the writing under the wings of an advertising airplane  when viewed from an angle can look somewhat like this, this is not what we saw. these panels were very square, very well defined, and very bright. there are numerous examples of fuzzy or roundish windows on ufos, but few examples of very definite squares.  only one object that i have seen so far has somewhat matched what we saw. this is a  drawing of an object in alien update by timothy good (1993) page 185. although i can���t find where the illustration fits in the text, it is included in a story  subtitled ���tragic incident in turkmenistan.��� turkmenistan is one of the turkic republics of the former soviet union.\r\n this event occurred may 25, 1990, during the daytime. a giant object hovered about 1,000 meters above the town of mary. the airspace there was under strict control due to the war in afghanistan.  the order was given to fire ground-to-air guided missiles at the object.  the ufo made a slight horizontal maneuver, and then three beams of light which had been coming from its port side disintegrated the missiles.  the commander then gave the order to scramble two interceptor aircraft, but at a point about 1,000 meters from the disc they appeared to be thrown to the ground, which killed the pilots and destroyed the aircraft.\r\nthere seemed to be censorship in both the foreign military and in the us when the author tried to further investigate this information.\r\n\r\n\tmassachusetts photograph (continuation of massachusetts sighting)\r\n\tthe following is from iur 9/10 1990: during the time period of the events described (iur 13(4):14-17), when my sister and i observed an unidentified object for around an hour, i took one photograph of the object. the camera  was a polaroid model 250, with a 3-element, 114 mm, f/8.8 lens and a shutter speed controlled by an electronic eye.  the film was  3000 asa black and white film. i took five photographs of the object, but only one (#2) showed it. (i don���t know why only one photograph came out, perhaps i didn���t focus the camera properly in the dark.) when i took the photograph, we were watching an object lighted with blinking squares having the appearance shown  in fig. 1. its blinking pattern was such that some or all of the squares would be lighted for a period of time and then for another period of time none of the squares would be lighted, making a blinking pattern. at the time i took the photograph, the object was at such a distance that the individual squares were beyond our visual resolution. therefore, as the object moved and blinked, it should have presented  the appearance shown in fig. 2, which shows a point source moving from right to left (east to west) and blinking twice. however, the photographic trace (which is enlarged here) appeared as in fig. 3.  (the following analysis was also presented at the aaas 154 annual meeting, absts., 1988.)\r\n\ti am quite sure this photograph was of the object, because i didn���t take pictures when traffic lights showed in my view finder. also, the blinks on the photograph were approximately where i expected them to be vertically and horizontally. i believe that i controlled the shutter time manually, rather than use the camera���s electronic eye. (i  had experience using this camera with nighttime star photography and could roughly estimate the time needed for a time exposure. since the light from the moving object was brighter than that of stars, i did not believe my shutter would respond quickly enough for me to take several photographs.)\r\n\tfig 3, the actual photograph of the two blinks, did not  look like fig. 2, the appearance that i expected the photograph to have. one reason for this is that fig. 3 shows a vertical undulating movement during the two blinks; whereas, the trace in fig. 2 is straight. this difference is easy to explain:  when i made the photograph, i didn���t have time to stabilize the camera and, thus, made hand held time exposures. the vertical oscillating motion in fig. 3 is the result of small hand movements during a time exposure. the object did not move up and down.\r\n\thowever, another difference appears between fig. 2 and fig. 3. that is  each of the blinks in fig. 3 is composed of a double trace; whereas, the blinks in fig. 2 are single lines. this difference is more difficult to understand, because we only saw one light, not two (as shown in the photograph). the vertical oscillation in each blink provides information about these double traces in that the oscillation pattern of the dimmer trace in each blink is moved a little to the right of the brighter one. for example in blink 4 a the brighter blink starts on the right and then makes a dip and a rise, followed by second dip  with a slower rise and finishing with a very rapid dip and rise, a bright spot at the end a brief period of being turned off and then a small point of light. this pattern is repeated in the dimmer blink, which (although to the right) turns on at approximately the beginning of the second rise, then  follows the sharp dip and rise,  and then extends in a very shallow dip and rise (where the first light has turned off). what this means is that although we could see only one light source blinking off and on, the camera had photographed the light from two blinking sources,  a bright one and a dimmer one.\r\n\tin order to investigate why i had photographed a light source that neither of us had seen, i questioned the polaroid company. they said that my camera system is sensitive to a 230  nanometer, nm, wavelength in the ultraviolet, uv, spectrum. the lowest light frequency that the human eye can detect, however, is around 400 nms. thus if there had been a light source on the object emitting light at a frequency between 400 nm and 230 nm, the camera would photograph it, but we would not have seen it. therefore, a light source radiating in the uv spectrum below the range of sensitivity of  the human eye, would explain why there were the two traces on the photograph:  the object apparently had a light that was not in the visible spectrum. (i obtained  the information that airplane lights are all supposed to be within the visible range, except for military aircraft with lasers. i don���t know whether military aircraft were equipped with lasers in 1968.)\r\n\tthe brighter photographic trace seemed to blink on and off suddenly each time; whereas the dimmer one appeared to come on gradually.  since the blinking pattern that we observed was one of a light blinking on and off suddenly, the brighter photographic trace  probably represents the visible light. the dimmer one was probably the emission that was out of our visual range.  in addition, the object was at a distance where we were unable to visually resolve the separate squares. however, the dimmer light appeared to be to the right (behind) what we thought was the body of the object. thus the dimmer light may have been on an extension behind the object. it may have been quite a long distance behind the object, because the width of the bright trace represents the width of  all the windows of the object together.  the dim light source is approximately nine times this width.\r\n\tother inferences can be drawn from the photograph: 1. the lights were fairly bright, because they appeared bright visually and because my camera system would take several minutes to make time exposures of  first magnitude stars.  2. the blinking pattern of the bright light during the two blinks was different, because (even after taking into account that the oscillations of fig. 4 a are deeper than those in  4 b) it appears that b is longer than a. also, at the far left of a, the light appears to have turned off than quickly flashed on and off again, because of the small spot to the left of the long trace. 3. the object continued in the same direction and probably did not rotate, because the two light sources are the same distance apart during both blinks; 4. the blinking pattern of the bright light differed from that of the dimmer light, because the dimmer light both switched on and off later than did the brighter light. it also appeared to gradually increase in intensity, in 4 a. also in 4 a, the two ends (beginning and end) of the bright trace seem to be wider than the rest of the trace, as if the light had brightened right after it came on and right before it turned off. this pattern wasn���t apparent in the dimmer light.  the left half of the bright light in 4 a appears somewhat brighter than the right half (perhaps more squares were lit here). 5. the object appears to be descending in 4 b. the dim light, however, appears to be at the same elevation as the bright. thus the object descended with both ends at the same elevation, rather than lowering its front section during the descent.\r\n\tsince the dim light appeared to be able to smoothly increase in brightness, this variation might result from 1. an increase in intensity, such as in a light controlled by a rheostat or 2. perhaps have resulted from a gradual change  into a photographable frequency, such as might happen with a laser changing a variable wavelength emission. my sister reported that when we first sighted the object  (from our parked car), a blue light shown down on us, which lit up the interior of the car. although she was uncertain, she thought that the light came from an end of the object.  perhaps her observation was of the light source that i photographed. in addition, i saw the interior of the car light up with green light twice during our observation. i don���t know if these observations were related with the object.  however, because other ufo reports sometimes include instances of a car or a room filled with light or other unusual appearances or phenomena, i might mention that visible light can be emitted after particles are excited by electrical activity, for  example during the aura borealis. light that behaves in strange ways might result from electrical forces, with visible light being only a by-product. two additional facts that might be relevant are: 1. if the object had one light that was not in the visible range it could have had others and 2. lasers can be used to make holograms.\r\n\ti  wish also to mention another incident that might be of interest in comparison with other observations of this nature.  within approximately 30 hrs after our observation several other unusual events occurred, however, as with the rest of this account, i don���t know whether the events were unusual, or just an odd combination of normal circumstances. we arrived at my sister���s dorm at 6:00 am july 14, and slept until noon. right after we got up, we called our parents and told them about the sighting. we also told my sister���s friends in the dorm. they joked and didn���t believe us.  i wanted to leave then to get an early start for the drive back to washington d.C., but waited to hear from my coworkers who were expecting a ride back. i left at around 1800 and arrived at my washington d.C. apartment around 2300.  as i unpacked, i noticed that my toothbrush was missing. i scoured the apartment searching for it (i had recently moved and had only a mattress and a chair). i retired around midnight. soon i began to hear sounds as if someone were walking in my bedroom. the sounds would start, go a few steps, and then stop.  i was used to hearing neighbors and heard the usual apartment  noises. later i checked, and nothing unusual had happened that night.\r\n\talthough i was afraid, i soon went to sleep. my alarm (which had been set at around  0600) rang. i got up and began to cook breakfast, but i noticed that it was dark. the clock said 0130. i reset it for morning. i believe that i continued to hear walking sounds, but went back to sleep. my alarm roused me again and i got up. it had been set at 0230. i checked that the windows were locked and put my chair against the door. the alarm rang again at 0330, 0430, and possibly at 0530. i couldn���t understand this, because if i  were setting the alarm, i would need to turn on a light. the light was a 100 watt bulb, by my mattress. this much light should have awakened me. also the knob used for setting the alarm was broken off. i normally set it with pliers. i was surprised that each time it had been set at exactly 30 minutes after the hour. i thought my fingers should have been sore from twisting the broken knob with sufficient pressure to set the clock precisely. although i was extremely frightened,  i  believe i went to sleep each time after the alarm.\r\n\tthat morning, i was frightened and worried about losing my job  if i had just gone crazy (i had high security clearances including, around,  and over top secret) and would lose the position immediately if i had a mental disorder. (i was unaware of possible ufo after effect phenomena.) at around 0600 (daylight), i was rehearsing ways to disguise insanity at work, when my toothbrush suddenly flew across the room (about 7 ft.) and hit the wall in front  of me about 4 ft. up. it came from behind, but only a wall was behind me.\r\n\tthe following monday, the  coworkers, who had traveled with me, were put out. they had tried to call me many times sunday for the return trip, but been unable to reach me. (whenever we left, we had asked people in my sister���s dorm to take a message if we received a phone call). the coworkers knew our names, the college, and dorm name, and telephone number. they finally took a train and cabs back, which was quite expensive.\r\n\twe did not anticipate the observation, had no ���oz-factor��� experience, and did not experience the events as dream-like. our environment seemed normal except for the object. neither of us recall  having had a hallucination. we were used to being out of doors, have excellent night vision, and i had extensive training in photo interpretation and had training in aircraft identification.\r\n\tjoe nyman said that the airport closes at 11:00. we did not see the object land; it continued traveling to the northeast. since we watched this after 11:00 p.M. we saw no evidence that the object was from that airport. walter web, said that an advertising airplanes used to use norwood airport. we were unable to confirm that one was flown on that date. however, we had both seen ad planes previously, and had watched this object closely. it had little in common with an ad airplane. for example when an ad plane is mistaken for a ufo people see the lit-up message swinging from under the wings. this gives the appearance of the rotation of indistinct lights.  in this case, the lit areas on this object were on the sides, and were  in the form of distinct squares with right angle corners the entire time we observed it. the lights showed no evidence of rotation.  in addition, it traveled toward the front of the squares. if it had been an ad plane, it would  have been going perpendicular to the message board i.E., forward if one were straight in front of the wings.\r\n\tas further confirmation, many years later my mother found a letter she had sent to her brother a few days after our sighting, describing our sighting.\r\nsince i wrote the previous description, i have read more about ufo phenomena. this has caused me to wonder if the strange man might have been a type of mib sighting. it has been reported that the mib are often interested in confiscating ufo photographs (the complete book of ufos) or other material evidence. in this case, the man prevented me from taking the picture when the object was close.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5675,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3635808,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11022006-0011","longitude":-71.0546432,"occurred":-46371600000,"potentialRelations":[64958,64776],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-46371600000,"summary":"About

was in contact via mobile with my mother whoa had a map and was directing me. on the ring road round haverhill my car broke down and i was waiting for a pick up. whilst i was waiting i noticed an aircraft flying quite slowly and close to the ground circling the fields around me, it did this for about 20 minutes and was the oddest thing i've ever seen it didn't have standard looking lights on it and made no sound that i could hear. there are both british and american airbases nearby, so i assumed it was something to do with them but i watched it as it was so weird and there was nothing else to do. it was about half a mile from me and did about three circles getting nearer all the time. it was so low to the ground i could see red light on the crops it was flying over and white lights where flashing at the ends, i didn't see what shape it was and i'm not the greatest scale guesser at a distance, it did look a bit like the spaceship in flight of the navigater when it changes from a walnut shape to a long shape, but it was pretty far away.\r\n after i got picked up i was talking about the aircraft i'd seen, we were on the same road and going round a bend and there it was right next to us hovering over a ditch at the corner of a field whilst we where at a roundabout. it was hovering 10 feet above the ground and about 10/15 feet away from the car. it hovered for about 15 seconds and i got a very good look at it. it was a triangle about 20 feet in diameter at the edges, it was of a darkish metal (blue/grey/brown). there were white lights at the corners and a big red circular light on the bottom in the centre. on the base of the craft it looked like grooves in the metal running round the light in jagged lines but not in any particular discernable pattern. after about 15 seconds it slowly began to rise and then suddenly shot straight up into the air really fast and was out of sight within three to four seconds.\r\n it flew silently and smoothly and did not

west. then i notist what i thought was a huge plane with giant white lights at the bottom heading right for\r\nthe road ,i really thought i was doing some kind of emergency landing ..So i started freaking out that a plane \"about 2 miles away and 500 off the ground \" was heading right for the road i was driving on! so i did what any one else would do and pulled over trying to get off the road ,at the same time i tried to get my camera phone out to take a picture of this plane sort of thing,but suddenly this huge plane sort of thing \"witch i instantly thought was weird because planes have a white,blue,and red light on it\" instantly turned on \"dime\" going real fast\" i really cant estimate the speed\" and shot off going what i think :the speed of light:to the nw direction. (after this i had my phone in my hand and call my dad ,witch later went looking for it ,driving around)\r\n\r\nthis ufo i saw : i could hold my fingers up and hold about 2 inches up to this craft in the distance. note> this i thing is about 2 miles away!.The lights of this were so huge and bright ,that's why i thought it was heading at me at first because the lights were shining at me. the light were in a \"perfect acute triangle\" <i saw this casue when it turn on a dime i kinda tilted up in my direction and i saw the lining of the lights >i did not see and outline >i just kinda played connect the dots with the lights witch to me made a acute triangle.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

clear and, starry with no clouds that i can recall.  i think the temperature was about 80 degrees f that night; it was a warm night.  i was outside sitting on an old i-beam that we have laying on the edge of the cement between the house and the garage.  i was having a cigarette at the time and thinking about an upcoming hunting trip to alaska that myself and a friend from work would be going on in two weeks.\r\n\r\nat that time, 18 years ago, the view to the east was fairly open with a good view of the eastern sky and, even though there are several trees that are close by, i was able to see the sky between and under them.  i happened to glance toward the northeast and saw five (5) football-shaped objects moving across the sky from the north and heading in a southern direction.  they were flying or, maybe i should say, moving in a v formation.  i watched them come from the north and continued watching as they passed over the woods about 1/4 mile to the east from where i was sitting.  they appeared to pass about 100 yards behind the eastern edge of the woods. they appeared to be fairly low, i would say no more than possibly two thousand feet up. they made no sound, which i thought was odd because we are on the flight path for planes going to chicago's o'hare airport about 60 miles away and the jets always make noise when they go over.  the objects appeared to be a very light pink in color and seemed to be translucent; they appeared to shine from within.  they continued to the south and when they disappeared behind the house next door, i got up and ran down to the south end of our driveway.  i continued to watch them as they continued to the south.  i was able to watch them for a good while until i lost sight of them over the rush creek conservation area just past mcguire road which lies about two miles south of us.  at the same time that these \"objects\" were going past, a jet was also going over heading from the west to the southeast.  it took the jet four times longer to pass through a clear spot between the houses than it did the objects.  i was somewhat surprised but, not nervous by what i had seen.  with the shape of the objects, the color and the speed at which they moved, i knew it wasn't a formation of planes that i had seen.  i was curious as to whether anyone else had seen them, especially when they reached the area of highway 14 to the south.  the only people that i have ever told about the incident until now, have been my parents.  i have always remembered the incident and have spent many nights watching and, hoping, that i might see them again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

a sphere looking craft taken in the same place as the object i had captured in my thunderstorm video.\r\nthe second is another white disk moving slowly and the camera was aimed to the east.\r\nthe craft is almost out of the view on the right and i picked up the camera and moved it to another area to shoot so i lost part of it.\r\nthis teaches me to leave the camera aimed at one area and leave it run without moving it.\r\n\r\ni cannot see these objects with the naked eye so i had no idea it was there when i moved the camera and the object almost looks like it was \r\nabout to come to a stop. shame\r\n\r\ni'm learning something here.\r\nhope you all get as excited when you view these as i do.\r\nit���s like making a new discovery every time i look at new video.\r\nthat���s it for now

was on i-280 no. heading towards i-85 cupertino exit in my car with the sky light open. i was looking up at the sky and saw a huge bright solid oval or egg shaped light arcing across the sky. it seemed to be the size of a baseball with a tail. it was very close as if a plane were taking off from an airport. it made no sound. it traveled from my left to my right as if going towards mountain view. moffet field is out that way as well. in know way was it a plane. it was beautiful. i didnt know if it might have been a comet, ufo, etc. when i saw it i immediatley called my boyfriend but the cell phone turned it self off and then on again. i finnaly got thru to him but the sighting had passed.\r\n i searched the news and variouss agencies for a few weeks and there seemed to be no reports
