up ahead and think \" thats pretty strange to see a plane that low\". don't think any more of it as i pull up to the stop light at spring and harding in red bank nj,(this was about 30 seconds later). i look to my left (towards red bank) and i see this huge craft all lit up moving very slowly about 75 feet off the ground. i go through the light and stop. i think wow! what was that? i deceide to take chase. i turn around, run two red lights and  catch it. at this point i am in downtown red bank (of course nobody is around and everything is closed) on broad street looking up at this craft. as it passed over me (it was heading west and i was crossing under it going south on broad st.), it felt like a speilberg movie. it took up the entire skyward view as it disapeared over the rooftops. it was larger than life and as i looked up all i could see was the bottom of this huge vehicle. i take a left on momnomuth st. and there it is right in front of me! i go roaring west on monmouth and easily catch it. i had amazing view of this thing. it was  black, triangular shaped and at least 200 feet wide at tbe base. it appeared to have dry ice like plumes (like you use for stage shows) coursing along the bottom.\r\nthe outer shell looked like some sort of black carbon fiber material. the rear was oval shaped  with very bright white lights around the perimiter and  red lights on the underside. it was \"floating\" about 75 feet off street (judging from the building tops) and perfectly silent, (i had rolled down my window to see if i could hear an engine). i was driving a jeep wrangler which makes a little engine noise but not much and there was no sound other than my engine. i slowed down to keep pace with it. at this point i was about 30 feet behind it, when i realized that i could not explain the physics of this thing, i.E. huge craft silently floating 75 feet off the ground in the middle of red bank! i suddenly fely very vulnerable and became significantly  concerned, (as this thing was huge and i was in full view) and  thought to myself  \"if i can see them, they certainly can see me!\". i stopped, made a very quick k-turn and got away as quickly as possible. \r\nit was by far the most fascinating thing i have ever seen.\r\n\r\nthe reason i am reporting this now is because i beleive my girlfreind saw it saturday night oct.21st in red bank @ 10:25 p.M at about the same location. we were returning from dinner in two separate vehicles when i recieve a call from her. \"tim i see a diridgible all lit up!\" i ask her where she is and i try to get there but am stopped by a long traffic light. looking in her direction i see what appeared to be the rear of that same craft from over a year ago not to far off the ground traveling west over the rooftops. i could not get to it. she later described a blimp type shape with bright lights all around the perimeter, i beleive she saw it from the rear.

ufo.  i had noticed a ball of light in the sky (not sure of the direction, but i believe it was north) that was orange/amber in color.  i jokingly said to a co-worker \"look, there's a ufo\".  he replied, \"oh, it's just a plane\".  then we looked again and i mentioned that there were no blinking lights on it like a typical plane.  the object, after about 20 seconds of observation, began to shine much brighter and looked like a bright amber/orange ball.  once we noticed this my co-worker said...\"whoa!  what is that?\".  about 2 or 3 seconds later it \"dropped\" a smaller, dimmer amber ball straight down, another 2 or 3 seconds after that, and at this point another witness was watching as well, 2 smaller orange objects were dropped.  the amber ball then continued on its path (which was always at a constant speed and straight across the night sky) and eventually faded away about 30 or 40 seconds later.  \r\n\r\nmy first instinct was a meteor or something, but there was no tail and the object was moving fairly slowly at no downward angle.  the 3 objects that were dropped also fell straight down and did not follow the objects path at all.  i also thought that it may have been a satellite or some other object in orbit burning, but the fact that the object moved completely horizontally, the objects that \"fell\" also were at a 90 degree line from the main object, and there was absolutely no \"tail\" or streaking of any kind were all strange to me.","distance":"Over One

looking like a plus-sign or a cross, the object was observed to ascend almost straight up from the horizon then traveled in a southerly direction. as it did so, it took on an appearance somewhat like a comet. at this point i saw another set of lights from a separate object but it is hard to explain. it seemed as if tiny red and orange lights were sequentially pulsing  in one spot in the sky. i could not see an object the lights belonged to but the light patterns suggested a kind of concave shape - almost as if they were attached to a big contact lens in the sky. i saw these lights pulse 3

first thought was a partially deflated beach ball type object thrown over the fence from a back yard on 8th avenue.  in time i noticed it hovery above the street moving about half the speed of traffic.  the object appeared to be about 1 meter across and about 1/2 meter from top to bottom with no change in these dimensions as it passed over head.  it appeared to move about 4 meters above the ground making no noise.  as it approached me, by this time i had stopped my car and was standing by the driver's side with the door open, at about a 45 degree angle above me it made a 90 degree turn to its left, my right and toward the east, and appeared to pass through the house on the north east corner of severn and holly.  i did not see it after that.  \r\n     in front of me facing south in the opposing lane was a '67 cream yellow cadillac with the driver also standing outside his car.  this cadillac was about 3 meters away.  to the rear of the cadillac was a black bmw with the driver also standing outside her car.  this bmw was about at the intersection of 8th and holly.  the three of us made eye contact with what i saw as an expression saying \"i won't say anything if you don't\".  we got back into our cars, which never stopped running, and went our own merry ways.\r\n     the object appeared to have no depth.  looking at it was like looking at nothing.  it seemed like a hole in reality.  the only sensation i experienced was of great curiosity.  other than that, it generated no sound and there were no temperature changes.  i experienced no injury and as i mention before my car never stopped running.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

time and was reported to mufon on october 6.\r\n\r\ni was driving home from work, heading west on route 173 east of downtown antioch, il at 6:10 p.M. central time.\r\n\r\nas i was driving i noticed a white object which was about the size of an aspirin at arms length. the object was teardrop shaped and was on the left side of my cars windshield. again (as mentioned in my prior report on 10/5/06) the object at first appeared to be a vapor trail from a commercial aircraft, yet the object never changed size or shape.\r\n\r\nas i was driving about a minute later i noticed another object the same size as the first. this object was on the right at a similar height. as i continued into downtown antioch, a third object identical in size, shape and color appeared again on my left side near the first object. as the third object appeared (out of nowhere) it began to move slowly to the south. its \"teardrop point\" was at a 1 o'clock angle, yet the object moved south very slowly never changing its angle and moved much slower than a commercial aircraft. \r\n\r\ni came to the stop light at route 59 and route 173 where 3 more objects appeared. object 4 was almost twice the size of the other 3 objects and directly in the middle of the other 3 objects. object 5 was to the right (north) of object 2 while object 6 was west and south of object 3. because object 6 was the highest object in the sky at the time, it seemed to reflect the sunlight off the horizon which gave it a pinkish orange glow.\r\n\r\nobjects 1, 2, 3, 5 & 6 began moving in different directions all at very slow speeds while object 4 remained stationary.  while waiting for the traffic light to change from red to green, i noticed object 4 as it began to move straight up at a very slow pace. i know it was moving up because it passed behind several power lines.  i was able to watch it move upwards for 2 or 3 minutes. the higher up it rose, it began to show similar characteristics as object 6. as object 4 ascended, the other 5 objects began to move to my left (south) at a very slow pace. now all 5 objects were on my left while object 4 was directly in front of me still ascending at a slow pace.\r\n\r\ni began moving west again and continued to observe object 4 ascending up near the clouds. there were only a few clouds at the time with mostly blue sky. as this larger object moved it appeared to be opaque at times yet still reflected the sunlight with a pinkish orange color.  it then went behind the clouds and was out of view.\r\n\r\ni decided to call home to see if my daughter or wife could go outside to confirm what i saw. i spoke with my 16 year old daughter who said she did not see anything unusual. i asked her to get my wife and have her observe.\r\n\r\ni did not want to influence my wifes description of what she saw. when i arrived home i asked if she saw anything unusual and she described only 2 of the objects, but they were very similar in size and shape to those i described.\r\n\r\ni continued west and the other objects began to dissappear one at a time as if a light switch had been turned off.\r\n\r\nnote: i did notice the moon which was cresent shaped. however, it was due south and appeared larger than any of the 6 objects.\r\n\r\nduration of this incident was approximately 7 minutes which corresponds to my earlier sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

checking on what the dogs were barking about, when in the eastern sky i saw this big bright white circular shaped object that appeared to be hovering or stationary.  i looked at my watch to see what time it was and noted i thought i might have been the landing lights on a local plane circling to get into the landing pattern for the small airport in texarkana, ar.   i did note seeing 3 jet type planes in the landing pattern or approach into little rock, ar; maybe and east coast pattern.  i also noted just due n-nw a smaller type plane was seen, and i thought the smaller plane had changed its flight pattern just turn back e to look at this object.  the small plane appeared farther away and higher than the object.  all four airplanes visible during this event had highly visible strobe lights on that identified them clearly as airplanes.   during the span of 8 minutes of basically moving n, ne the object disappeared 5 times; then reappeared in a different position approx. 10 seconds later.  i first thought maybe upper level clouds had blocked its visibility, but could not see a single cloud in the sky.   the wind was also less than 5 mph that night.  the night was very clear, and the stars very bright which made visibility very good.   after the object disappeared the last time, i finally realized that i couldn���t see any strobes on it nor could i hear any type of engine noise, but could hear the jets, and the small plane.  i went inside when the light never came back on and got my compass to try and mark the degree position in the sky from where i was standing, and i also have the gps reading for my home as a point of reference.   the gps reading for my address of 323 hempstead county road 10 is as follows:  lat: 33.68252, and           long: 93.73685.    i noted from the point i was standing and noticed the object for the first time of 252 degree w-sw and the point where i lost sight of the object for the last time is 278 degrees w-nw.   the object was solid in nature and did not leave a vapor trail of any type, and appeared to be about basketball sized or a little larger from my point of view.  the best i could judge was it was approximately 35 to 45 degrees above the visible tree line in the distance.   there were a few times in which the object appeared to jump from one point in the sky to another in a matter of seconds, but did not disappear anytime during these episodes.  the maneuvers the object appeared to be doing some type of zigzag movement, but not to avoid any visible object.  the object appeared to be moving well below stall speed for any plane i can think of.  i am not sure a glider could do this.  i have seen helicopters before at night, but the light was too big to be a spot light on any known object that i have seen.   i have seen many of airplanes coming into this area with their landing lights on.  the planes make a big circle out the direction of my home then back into the texarkana regional airport.  i know what landing lights look like, but this is the 5th time i have seen something strange in the same horizon over the past 7 yrs i have lived at this residence.  i did not have my camera or my video recorder with me at the time.  i didn���t want to go into the house for fear i would loose sight of the object.   i did see something like this in 2001, and it was in the same area lasting approx 15 to 20 min before it disappeared behind some trees in south of my home.   what seems strange is the previous weekend i was out looking at stars with my daughter.  she got cold and went inside since it was about 23:00 cst.  i notice a bright object coming from the south at a high rate of speed.  i first thought it might be some of the jet fighters ( a-10 wart hogs) from barksdale air force base in shreveport, la; doing some night maneuver.  these a-10s fly over my house frequently doing daytime maneuvers.  the problem is the object was blinking on and off about every on to two seconds.  i couldn���t hear the scream of the jet engines, nor could i hear any engine noises at all.  the light did not act like a strobe, but was much bigger in size than any airplane strobe system i have ever seen.  plus it was only the one light i could see and no silhouette visible in the background.  i did not call the sheriffs office in hempstead or miller county ar, because the last time i did they just laughed at me.  i couldn���t find the phone number for the airport in texarkana, ar or i would have called them.  i did have a pair of binoculars in the garage and was able to look at the current object through them, but couldn���t see anything except the light/object.  i hope this helps in your research into your study of ufos.  \r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\ntommy lowe\r\n","distance":"Over

when i focused on it more, the lights were just there but the craft itself was all of a sudden not visable. the lights proceeded to move out of my view over the tree line. not long after that a group of jets was seen moving in the direction of the lights. i'am not much of an early night sleeper, and had most of my lights on, but it was as if it was watching me none the less. i usually get a bad sinking feeling when something is not right. i was stired up, but figured it could be a military craft, but then it does not make sense why it would be interested in that area. there is a lake below the trees. nothing made me notice it i just happen to look up, and it was there.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5620,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.943261,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10242006-0005","longitude":-82.2846047,"occurred":1161666180000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1161666180000,"summary":"Ufo

turned to my east towards me all the while pulsating.\r\nits hard to judge how high these are not knowing the size of the object in the dark sky.\r\ni have seen these same objects many times before and have been reporting them to my local mufon investigator for months.\r\nthis is what i have learned about them.\r\ni usually see a bright streak across the sky as if it were a shooting star like what i saw this morning but this time i saw it stop and i could still see the object and it then moved slowly towards the south.\r\ni usually see the strobe pulsating objects right after i see the streak, so whenever i see the streak of the object i watch that area to see if a pulsating object appears from that direction and not always but many times here it comes moving in a slow pace.\r\n\r\ni think they shoot down from the atmosphere at incredible speed almost to ground level then dim down when they move at a slower speed.\r\nnow one thing i have noticed is that if one of these objects is overhead and a military high flying aircraft is approaching that is when they pulsate which i think is a communication between craft maybe as a warning of the approaching aircraft.\r\n\r\ni have seen as many as 12 at once back in may and june over this area.\r\ni'm learning about all the different events that happen here.\r\ntoday was a very busy day with military aircraft all over the place.\r\ni didn't have the camera with me but i know something was happening as i was on a roof all day and will be taking more photos this week.\r\n\r\ni just got back from my vacation to maine and have caught some new objects in some of my fishing photos in the cove at the ft williams lighthouse.\r\ni will edit the pictures and post the objects in the next couple of days. glad to be back. stay tuned.\r\njc","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5619,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.4681025,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10242006-0004","longitude":-80.0668601,"occurred":1161611700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other,

were heading west on cliff rd in eagan. the night was cool (50s) and clear with a brilliant blue sky. the only exception being some clouds that looked like they had been painted in the sky. the clouds looked like they had been created by the strokes of a paint brush using violet colored paint. they formed the shape of a flame. the source of the flame appeared to be yellow glow of the sun that was now hidden by the earth. this caused a few clouds toward the horizon to appear to be bright orange. the shape of these clouds looked awesome in the bright blue sky. the sight was so impressive that we pulled over to get a better view of this beautiful sunset (at the park and ride at cliff rd, blackhawk rd and 35e). then something caught my eye, just above where the clouds ended. it looked like a black dot or disk off to the south-west of us. at first i thought it might be a helicopter, but then i thought that it was too high in the sky to be a helicopter. i kept looking over at it as we drove home, which was probably just about a half a mile in distance. as i kept looking over at the object, it did not seem to move at all. when we got home, i went to a clearing on a near by hill and found the object still in the same spot in the sky. i sat and observed the object and it seemed to be stationary for the most part, only moving slightly from time to time. a few times i saw an energy surrounding the object like an aura. it almost looked like there was a tiny black hole in the bright blue sky. besides the energy that i saw around the object, i never saw any other lights come from it. at the same time planes were passing through the area, heading north toward the minneapolis/st paul airport for a landing. using them as a reference i would say the black object was at least 30-40,000 feet above the earth. after observing this object for about 5 minutes, it stated to move west and slightly north in a somewhat straight line. the object did not move that fast. many planes flew past me in the same time it took the object to be position just south and almost directly over head of me. then as the object continued to travel in a westerly direction, it started to gain altitude and began going in and out of sight until it was no long visible in the now dimming sky.\r\n\r\n9/20/2006 around midnight to 12:30 am\r\nthen around midnight, i was about to go outside to enjoy the clear night sky when i sense beings roaming around inside our house. the energy they created in the house startled jessica and woke her up. prompting her to come out and ask what i was doing. telling me to come back inside and shut the door. she told me that i was freaking her out, though it was really the energy of the beings that was making her uneasy. i could feel from time to time, me and a being���s energy pass through one another or my body being touched by these beings.  this lasted for about a half hour and then i could sense the energy leave the house. then jessica went back to bed and i went out to enjoy the clear night sky.\r\n\r\nps. i have attached a photo that i found out on the net that looks similar to what i saw in the sky that day, so it is not a photo of what i actually saw.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line
