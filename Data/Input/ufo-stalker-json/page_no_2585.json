at the sky wishing that i could see a ufo. i kept telling myself that i could do it, i could actually manifest it.  with all i have heard and read, i figured they were there and just cloaked so nobody could see them. i have to admit i just finished reading whitley's book, the grays.\r\n\r\ni was also listening to art bell's show. it was just before the top of the 11:00pm hour here in la, so he was at the end of open lines. \r\ni was expecting to see a saucer. or should i say \"hoping\"\". but then in the distance in the northeast i saw a faint triangle that i thought was just some light or faint stars in a triangular config like taurus. but it was much much smaller.\r\n\r\nbut then i realized the whole damn triangle was moving toward me. i got so excited and jumped up to see better or to see if i was hallucinating. i stood in my back yard and watched it whispering \"oh my god, oh my god\" over and over.\r\nnope it continued on a path out of the north and moving sorth but it was well east of me. i followed it across 2 thirds of the sky until it disappeared over my neighbor's house. \r\n\r\ni ran through the house and out the front door to see if i could see it on the other side, but couldn't because of the street lights.\r\noh my gosh,  i finally saw a real ufo. it wasn't a saucer, but it was definitely not a plane or helicpoter either.\r\n\r\ni know it wasn't an airplane because it was two lines of lights, one on either side of the isosceles triangle. it was one light at the forward-most point with either 3 or 4 lights along either side and the rest of it looked the same color as the sky. like maybe it was meant to camouflage with the sky. so it looked like a flying boomerang but with a narrower angle than a boomerang would have.\r\ni know. hold your fingers up loike a peace sign and that would be the angle of the configuration.\r\nand using the peace sign analogy, everything between my fingers as well as the 3rd imaginary line between my two finger tips looked like the same hazy color as the sky.\r\n\r\ni see airplanes all the time, some very high up, but you can still tell when it's  plane because there is a red light on one side, a green one on the other and sometimes white in the middle that goes in a circle.. this was only faint white lights, like the least visible stars in the sky.\r\n\r\ni know you want to know how big, but that's hard because i don't know how far away it was. but if i held my arm up and pointed to it, the whole thing would be about the size of a small fingernail. and it moved quickly, much fater than an airplane at high altitude would have taken to travel across that much sky. like i kept saying, \"oh my god, oh my god, \" over and over, maybe ten  times and then it was over the neighbor's house. they are in a 2 story house and so that would have been about ...Ok i am going to pretend that the bowl of the sky is a half of a clock. the zenith is 12 o'clock.. so when i first saw the triangle it was like 10:00 o'clock and it disappeard above my neighbor's house at 2:00 o'clock. i don't know of a better way to try to describe how far i tracked it. but mind you it was defiitely not directly overhead, but rather far off to the east of me. i live right near the beverly center, and i'd say it was way over past downtown la. but of course if it was really really high, and i'm sure it must have been,it could have been over like big bear or mabe even the dessert or something like that.\r\n\r\nit just seemd to track so unexpectedly fast across the sky. oh and it made no noise. but i guess if it was really far away, i wouldn't expect to hear anything. but i think part of my mind was saying, it should make some noise.\r\n\r\nwhen i calmed down i wanted to tell somebody. my son wasn't home yet, so i called my daughter and told her. they both hate that i am into ufos and art bell, etc, so she just placated me with words like \"i'm so happy for you\", and i know she wasn't. but i just had to tell somebody.\r\n\r\ni know, \"welcome to the club\"\r\ntamar brooks in los angeles\r\n\r\nnote my new email address tamarbrx@ca.Rr.Com\r\nby the way, everyone on comcast in southern california has been changed over to road runner, so if you get other people's email bouncing back and they are on comcast.Net, then change their domain name to ca.Rr.Com and it should go through. they are giving us a year to change over but i did it right away.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

that we judged to be at least a mile in width. we reported this to the ufo reporting centers peter davenport and i include the report below.........We also called a couple of news channels in phoenix and told them that if this object continued its present course it would be over phoenix within perhaps a half hour. we are still looking for additional informations and additional reports. spoke to peter davenport (ufo reporting center) last night by phone and am waiting to hear back from him\r\n\r\nwitness #1 daniel baker 55 yr old male. retired police officer. 4 years usaf as security police (also fielded calls from civilians who called the base, in regards to ufo sightings). currently run security company\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwitness #2 kathy baker 47 yr old female. currently runs security company\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwitness #3 kim baker 19 year old female. attends u of a\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nat 2230 hrs this date, i (daniel baker) went to the front of my yard to walk towards a neighbor with the intent of checking on their dog since they were away on vacation. our house lies in the foothills (north central) area of tucson adjacent the catalina mountains. i heard one of my dogs bark and i turned to look back at the house. directly above the house i observed the object. the object was flying south to north. i would estimate that it was directly above i-10 (i-10 runs north and south) i-10 is approx. 7 miles due west of my house. it was approx. 25 degrees above the horizon.I would estimate, and its only an estimate that from light to light would make the object at least one mile long. my first thought was that the object(s) were in fact 3 objects strung out together and flying in formation. i assumed they were helicopters flying north. there is a marine aviation base due north of us. holding my hand at arms length in front of me, i would estimate object would have been (from running light to running light) 4-5 fingers in length. the object at its southern point had one non flashing light, in its approx center was another non flashing red light, at its northern point were two lights, one which was white and non blinking and another light very close to the white light and it was red in color and blinking. my wife exited the front door and i yelled at her to grab the binoculars and run out with them. this she complied with, retireved the binoculars and she and kim came out to join me. i brought the binoculars into focus and could see the object, which appeared to be moving fairly slow and continuing north. i could also ascertain that there was a darkened area between the 4 lights and that in fact these were not 3 seperate objects. this horizontal area or structure did not appear to be very high but was flattened and \"line\" like. i handed off the binoculars to both kathy and kim. we continued to watch the object as it continued north. approx 3 minutes into the observation the object appeared to make a flight adjustment and it began turning into a north-west flight angle. at this point and through the binoculars i could now see the rear end of the object. you could now see that it possessed 2 white lights in the rear of the structure. it looked as though you were watching the rear end of a car that had two white running lights. the distance between the two rear light would be approx 1 finger held up at arms length. the 3 other lights(red in the center, white and blinking red up fron) were also still visible but at more of an angle. the front flashing red light was still visible. at all times the lights remained at a fixed distance from each other, the distance never varied as it would if you were watching a string of conventional aircraft stuggling to maintain position relative to each other. i was able to observe the object from its new flight path for approx another minute to two minutes until it was lost over the horizon. the object appears to have corrected its flight path from when first viewed to the point that it turned northwest as i believe i-10 makes the same course adjustments. i believe the object was certainly following and flying directly above i-10, turning as i-10 turned, but im not completely sure of this. i could not estimate its speed, but it was not flying very quickly, but i would guess that if these were in fact helicopters, it would appear to be about the same speed as a helicopter at that distance. there was no sound. we contacted a nearby neighbor (too late for him to see it), but as we talked in the driveway he related to me that during a ball game this evening, the crowds were witnessing many strange lights in the night skies.......He didnt elaborate. i have made a rough sketch of the object.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ndan\r\n\r\n-- \r\ndaniel baker\r\ngeneral

taking fall foliage photos with my digital camera.\r\n\r\ni live in central va and happened to be in crozet va taking my first photos when i decided to take a few shots from my car seat.\r\n\r\ni had pulled off the side of the road, rolled down my window, held the camera out the window at arms lenghth and began to take several shots of a mountain side. i was not looking at the horizon, but rather was looking the \"display\" on my canon powershot a80 in order to aim it. the first two photos were taken 7 seconds apart.\r\n\r\nnow, at first i had no idea what i had just taken a photo of. i did not suspect anything unusual had occurred. and in truth, i cannot be certain that anything unusual happened at all. but, the a80 is a digital camera that i use sporadically, the temperature outside was app. 60 degrees and i was aiming away from the sun as it was behind me at this point. the time of day was around 134 pm.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home, i began to transfer all my images from my camera to iphoto. i then created a slide show of the pics and uploaded all of them to my web site. i did not edit any of the images, as that takes me too much time. i just used a program called jalbum to make some thumbnails and uploaded the entire album folder to my directory. it was not until i began to look at my own photos that i noticed something strange in the first few pics.\r\n\r\nas you can see, something appears to be afoot with the photo in question. look at the center of the photo. what does that look like to you?\r\n\r\ni went back to my original photos and checked them. the originals showed the same thing.\r\n\r\nok reader, what i would like to know is this: is this simply a digital anomaly? do you have any friends who are photographers who could evaluate this?\r\n\r\nfor the record, i took a total of 29 photos today. you can view them all at http://www.Cfcure.Com/mt/images/album102106/index.Html\r\n\r\nis this a photo of a ufo phase shifting?\r\n\r\nnow, i have no

facing north and looked west and saw an object at about 45 degrees that looked like 5 round white balls in a row, east to west, one on top of the other, with a bright white light below them but not attached to them. the lower ball in line would dart in and out of line, from left to right (south to north), then would get back in line. at first i thought that it must be balloons, skydivers or small aircraft flying in formation but they didn't move in altitude. after about 10 minutes of watching, the bright white light below the balls started moving away from them going to the west and was getting smaller. at this time i went inside to get my camera but i am very slow moving because i am mending a broken left leg. by the time i hobbled back with the camera, the round white objects had moved higher up to about 90 degrees and had moved south and the bright white light below them was gone. the balls moved higher and further south slowly. i tried to take some photos with my kodak easy share c340. the objects stayed in straight east to west line and got higher in the morning sky and moved further south until they looked like a single small bright white dot in the blue sky until i could no longer see them. i hope you can make out the photos but they had gone higher in the sky by the time i took the photos. i have seen many strange lights here in vegas sky's, mostly at night, but nellis afb is only about 5 miles to the north east of here and the nellis test range (where area 51 is) is due north, so you have to think a lot i see in the sky is military in origin.  but this sighting was due west, the opposite side of the valley from nellis and no way near the test range. maybe someone else saw this too and got a better look or better photos and can tell me what it was.

i don't know. it could be a coincidence but i feel that i need to report it. i have two other sightings that i would like to share with you from 1984. my friend and i had a sighting just a few miles away back in the summer of 1984. we were playing in an open field close to sundown and a triangle flew right over us & went north-east. it was flying just above the tree-tops very slowly. it had what looked like flourecent tube lights going down each side. each one was a different color. one was blue, one green, and the other was red. we couldn't tell what the color of the craft was but the size was about 30 feet across! what really sets in my mind is that it was totally silent. i will never forget it. later that same year in the winter, my mom was coming back from the mall in beckely, w.V. after a day of shopping. as she came across meadow river bridge, at the fayette/nicholas county line into mt. lookout, she noticed a moon-sized bright white light about 800 feet away hovering over the river at around the same height as the bridge.(about 100 feet high) she said that she slowed down and while she was looking she saw a white sphere come out of the bottom of it and go down into the forest below. she said that she could see the sphere flying around the trees at amazing speeds and that she could also see the light from it reflecting off of the trees. according to her the sphere shot back into the bottom of the hovering craft and then the craft flew straight up and disappeared into the night sky at a tremedous speed. she has had a couple of strokes earlier this year but her story has never changed.\r\n\r\nlarry\r\nmt. nebo, w.V.

15th 2006. we had just passed through groveland fl. this was a very dark portion of the road with no buildings and no artificial light (except for our headlights)  at approximately 9:05pm my wife while looking out of the passenger window of our vehicle observed four glowing  green lights, (orbs)  in the ne sky.I estimate that the lights were at appoximately 65 degrees above horizion in the ne sky.  the shape of the lights, orbs, was oval. they were moving very rapidly in a synchronized almost choreographed pattern in the shape of a figure eight that was turned on its side. the lights never appeared to touch or converge into one in the center of the  pattern. when it looked like they would collide they would suddenly veer away from each other and continue the pattern.    i pulled over and exited the vehicle to get a better look. there was absolutely no sound. my wife , daughter and myself watched these lights from the side of the road until 9:15pm, (10 minutes).  we then got back into our car and continued on west on fl sr 50 into hernando county fl.My wife and daughter continued to observe these lights almost continually until 9:36 pm (trees would intermittently block their view as i drove) at approximately 9:25 pm as we drove, we   observed two bright white lights that we attributed to helicopters heading toward the  above mentioned green ovals. one was coming from the north and the other from the south.  the weather conditions were partly cloudy and according to weather.Com visibility was 10 miles.  we were returning from a three day stay at walt disney world in lake buena vista, fl\r\n\r\n i first thought these might be advertising lights or something along that vein but there were no beams trailing behind the glowing ovals. i am a retired police officer. i try to look at things objectively without preconcieved notions; that said, this was a weird experience. my wife said that it had a \"calming\" effect on her. my daughter however was anxious and somewhat scared. that is why we did not stay parked longer at the road side observing the lights. i thank you for listening to my report and if you determine that any followup is needed do not hesitate to contact me. \r\n please note that my wife suddenly became very tired and actually fell asleep right after we could no longer see the glowing objects. i was still driving and it was 9:41 pm

when it hovered and went straight up into the air, not like a fighter jet with the nose pointed up, this was like a helecopter taking off from the ground. it just kept going up and up and then once it went through the clouds, i couldnt see it anymore. im not going to suggest that it was extraterrestrial, but i will say that it wasnt normal at all. to low to be a test aircraft, i could see it, and it didnt move fast at all like modern technology. it acted just like a blimp, but im 100% sure it wasnt.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

southbound. very clear sunny day; the same day that flights were grounded because of the terrorist interception at heathrow airport. i saw the object and stared at it hovering in the sky. it was so strange because it was a very peculiar shape; not at all the type of thing that you would expect to fly, let alone hover in place. also the craft/object had a white ball-shaped object that was suspended about 20 yards directly in front of the rectangle. it appeared as if it were part of the object (due to the way it stayed exactly the same distance in front of the rectangle, no matter how fast it moved or changed direction, yet there was no visible physical connection between the 2 objects).\r\n\r\ni asked my fiancee to look at the ufo with me while we drove. i opened my passenger side window and got my torso out of the car and pointed, trying to get others to look at it as well. we neglected to pull over so we could get closer to it and figure out what the hell it was. it was so out of the ordinary. it moved similar to the way a helicopter would move, yet there were no blades or vaportrails, or visible propulsion on the ufo. in terms of distance it was approximately 1/2 mile away from us, up in the air (hard to tell how high, but definitely low, the way a recreational single engine plane would cruise the coast). it hovered for a minute or two, then took off towards san jose (east). it was traveling at a deceptively high speed, to the point where we could not keep it in sight as we attempted to follow it from the ground. the object looked like the same size as a b-52 bomber-type, but again had no wings of any type, and really just looked like a huge flying cardboard box, with shelves all over it and the strange white ball in front of it. \r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like that in my life. both my fiancee and i have near-perfect vision, and were of perfect state of mind before seeing the object. what makes this whole event so strange was that as we were speeding through capitola trying to keep the object in sight (we lost it very quick after it took off), i looked up to my right and saw the weirdest thing: a low-flying pitch black helicopter that neither of us could even hear, flying fast towards where the ufo was hovering above the coast. the helicopter was close enough to see that it had absolutely no markings or lights, or anything identifiable. it was definitely military looking, almost like an attack helicopter, but it hardly made any noise. \r\n\r\nthis event made me very upset, because it was almost as if everybody were oblivious to what was going on in the sky. if i hadn't have looked where i looked when i did, i wouldn't even have seen the helicopter, but i caught it perfectly. it was clearly moving very fast towards where the ufo had been, but almost as if it didn't know that the ufo had taken off less than a minute before. i got pretty worked up, and again upset, because clearly nobody around us, pedestrian or otherwise, even looked up or noticed what was going on. i honestly don't know why anyone who had seen it didn't drop everything and stare at the sky.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived at our office, which was in the same direction as the object, i ran in and called the watsonville airport. i talked to somebody at the airport who told me they had seen nothing strange and knew nothing of what i was speaking about. i called the newspaper, i called the news, and they all said i was the only person to call it in!\r\n\r\ni have always believed that there is intelligent life in the universe, but this is the only time i have ever seen anything. i even tried to call moffet field, the faa, etc., but i had no luck getting any answers.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

8/9/06.  the time was 5:40 a.M. i looked out my bedroom window, and saw what appeared to be a very large, bright yellow light, hanging in the eastern sky.  as i watched it for a few seconds, i noticed it didn't appear to be moving.  i grabbed my camera which is a kodak easyshare c643 c603 digital camera, and took acouple of pictures.  as the light started to move, it turned into a bright white light.  i then started to video it, as it seemed to move south.  i said to myself, please come this way, and to my amazement it did.  at the time, the distance was quit a few miles away, and was very hard to determine just how far away it was.  as i continued to video, i was curious to see just how far away this object was from me,as it was hard to tell, by looking into the view finder. as i took my eye away from the view finder, i was shocked to see, it was almost to my house, but in the viewfinder it didn't look at all that close. nor could i make out it's shape at that time.  when i saw the shape, and size of it, i was just in awe, i ran to my bathroom, that is just next to my bedroom, and waited for it to fly over the large trees, that's behind by house.  i put my face up against the screen, and looked to the east waiting for it to pass over.  all of a sudden there it was, huge! i could see the shape , colour, and the large circular lights in four rows, that ran across the bottom  horizontally.  this fantastic craft, was at least 100 feet in lenght, by 150 feet wide across  the back.   it could have been even larger, but that is my estimate, because of the lights on it. there also appeared, a small green light, which was off to it's right side, that blinked, but for some reason, i thought it was seprate from the craft, because it appeared there was a black void between them. as it flew over my head i tried to take pictures, but my camera flashed, and all i got was the bright flash, and the screen. the altitude was no more then 150 feet, the speed was approximatly 25 to 30 miles per hour, and the only sound it made, was a very low rumbling, or roaring sound.  as it continued over me to the west, it banked without speeding up, or slowing down.  this was an amazing sight  because, it seemed to pivot on it's left tip, while it brought it's nose around to face south. it then followed the top of the hill, and proceeded to travel south until it was out of my sight.\r\n\r\n  the second sighting of this same craft came 2 weeks to the day from the first sighting, and at the same time.  this time i caught a great picture, with what appears to be bright white objects attached on it's tips.  there is also some structure on the bottom.   the third sighting came on 8/28/06, i also took pictures of this craft on that day.  i will send you the pictures and the videos that go with them.  i have to send them seperate, to keep them in order by date for you to view.\r\n\r\n\r\n   sincerely,\r\n\r\n   francine\r\n\r\n\r\n   sincerely,\r\n\r\n   francine

through sunday.\r\nat approximately 10:30p as we were falling asleep in our tent, i heard a thunderous noise coming towards us from the south side of the lake. the noise was definetly a helicopter and almost certainly a hewey, its roaring engines sounded like it was going at full throttle, it was deafening. i stuck my head out of the tent in time to see the chopper approaching, fast and barely 70ft above the lake. it was as i stared at the helicopter that i saw it. ahead of the chopper (perhaps 50 yards ahead of it and 100 yards to the chopper's left) was a boomerang-shaped object flying silently over the tree tops. what stunned me was that the object was not only a ghostlike pale white/blue glow but the craft was so incredibly thin, that i couldn't even see any bulge or area in the fusalage that would be capable of fitting one or more pilots. the object looked like 2 giant, glowing toothpicks, joined in a v with basketball-like glowing orbs at the wing-tips and one in the center joint. it then came clear to me that the chopper was tracking the object in some way, either racing it, chasing it or observing it. the sighting lasted 10 seconds, however given the halfmoon starlit night, visibility was amazing.\r\n     just for the record, i'm a 31 year old journalist, spent the past 6 years working for cnn, i've also spent 10 years studying our night skies with a number of

when sunlight reflects of metal) caught my eye. just slightly above the treetops (at a distance) was a silvery shape.  at first i thought this was just an airplane, but it couldn't be, since it was motionless(and silent). i squinted to get a better look, since the object was reflecting the late-afternoon sun, and i saw that it was a disc, no wings, no tail. at that moment, a chill ran through me and i suddenly became very afraid, and that someone or something was watching me, but i held my ground. such thoughts as, \"oh my god!\" and \"oh crap!\" ran through my head as i observed this object. the thing made a few slow manuevers and stopped again, just hanging in the sky. then, seemingly out of nowhere, another object showed up. this one was a black triangle with an outline similar to the stealth fighter. at first i thought it was just that, a stealth fighter, but it made no noise. the triangle headed quickly towards the disc and it looked like it was going to crash into it, but the disc took evasive action. the triangle proceeded to chase the disc about the sky, as if it was trying to chase the disc off and then the two objects shot across quickly to the west and vanished from view.\r\ni stood there for a few moments, dumbfounded, before shakily picking up my book, and heading inside. i felt like a great weight had been put upon my shoulders and i was scared, really scared
