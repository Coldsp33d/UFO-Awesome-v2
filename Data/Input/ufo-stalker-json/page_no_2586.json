appeared to be two planes flying extremley low to the ground. upon further inspection, we noticed that the \"planes\" were connected to eachother by a beam of light, and that what we had thought to be the triad pattern of lights often seen on planes at night was acutally a part of this strange object. the best possible description of its appearence is that it was one larger triangular shape lined with red and blue lights connected to a similar but smaller triangular shape. it moved very fast and sparatically making no noise at all. it was able to turn very sharply. the larger and smaller triangular components of the object always moved relative to eachother, maintaining a perfect connection.  after aproximatley two minutes of what appeared to be random motion, the object suddenly flew away into the distance until it was no longer visible. at this point, my friends and i were positive that what we saw was not a plane/helicopter/weather ballon due to the apparent high velocity the object was able to reach in such a short amount of time, and the complexity of its movement. my emotions at this time were shock, excitement, and amazement of what i had just seen. after the object had been gone for about 6 minutes, it suddenly reappeared very close to us, approximatly 50 yards above our car. after flying around the area for for about a minute, the object came to an abrupt stop above a residential area, about four blocks away from our car. at this point, we stopped the car and i was able to get a better look at the object. the \"light beam\" connection was actually a very well lit solid connection and dark window shapes could be made out on the smaller of the two triangles. i glanced down the street and noticed that several other cars had stopped to observe the object as well. after it hovered for a few seconds, it began to descend and landed on the ground. we immediatley tried to drive to where it had landed, but could not find anything. the object had apparently dissapeared or become invisible upon landing. we searced the area where it appeared to have landed intensly for about a half and hour but could find nothing. three helicopters arrived and appeared to be activley searching during the this time, and for the remainder of the night we could see/hear helicopters near the area of the sighting. throughout the entire sighting i never felt afraid, i just felt amazed beyond belief and lucky to have seen this object.

aircraft tend to, when flying over olympia.  it takes them across the vantage of the sky i have in front of my house. this one came from the west, and flew in front of my house.  i paid it a little attention, as it was loud.  it seemed to be flying low.  i watched it as it came through the trees and into the view i have of the northern sky. that's when i noticed the red ball of light in front of the helicopter. it was as if the chopper was chasing the light.  the distance between the two objects was slight, and remained constant.  they flew across the break in the trees, where i could clearly see the objects, quite quickly, and by the time i realized what i was seeing, and retrieved my camera, the objects were obscured by trees.  they arced northward and i didn't see them again. the sky was clear.  the light was smaller than the helicopter. there was no searchlight beam shining from the helicopter.  it really looked like the helicopter was chasing the light. i'm enclosing the video i took, but it's terrible quality.  maybe it can be cleaned up by someone with the right equipment, but i'm not sure it will show anything of value anyway.  probably a lot of the helicopter's lights and

9:20. it was dark due to the lack of street lights in the rural area in which we reside. my friend suddenly asked if we had just seen that. we hadn't the slightest clue what she was talking about, so we asked if she could please elaborate on 'that'. she said that as we walked past my other neighbors house, she noticed a bright light that appeared to be a star descending slowly from the sky. \r\n\r\n    she described it as star like with a slighly bluish tint, and told us that it appeared to be right behind the trees behind my neighbors house and had slowly descended until it disappeared. i had made sure to ask how it had disappeared, and she said that she had thought that it had slowly dimmed until it was no longer visable. i had also made sure to inquire whether or not she had been simply seeing things. she said she had looked away and blinked a few times before looking back. we had immediately walked behind my friend's house with a mini-maglite (which i had just happened to have been carrying at the time) and examined the area around the trees. my original theory was that a piece of aluminum foil, carried into the trees by the previous days wind, had finally been loosed and reflected moonlight as it fell (the moon was full that night,i believe).\r\nfinding nothing we returned to my neighbors house and discussed possible explainations. this account is taken from my memory of her desciption from the date of the sighting, so it may have slight deviations from her exact testimony.\r\n\r\n    after we had all headed home, approximately 10 pm, i researched other cases describing a bright light that appeared to be descending from the sky on nuforc.Com and have formed a more plausible theory that my friend had actually seen the light of a celestial body reflected off of a passing sattelite. i have a limited knowledge of sattelites, but using this knowledge, i have formed this hypothesis. a sattelite had angled itself such that the light hitting it had been reflect to our position on earth. the sattelite continued to angle itself towards what would be the ground to earthly veiwers. the light appeared to be descending and as the sattelite continued to angle, less light was hitting it directly and was being reflected towards us until no light was being reflected at all. if this theory were correct and my assumptions are unflawed, i believe this would account for the apparent dimming of the light.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5561,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.3356483,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10122006-0003","longitude":-75.9268747,"occurred":1160281200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1160281200000,"summary":"Strange

an object traveling fairly slowly across the western sky from southwest torrance toward lax, or from the se toward the nw, heading toward lax. i was stargazing in my front driveway in southwest torrance,ca, and was admiring the totally clear sky.  many regular aircraft were going about their business, and were unremarkable.  a bit earlier i had seen two different satellites..One going from sw to nw, the other , a bit later, going from nw to se. i had even witnessed a brief \"shooting star\" from west to east. by 7:47pm i was wrapping up my binocs, and making my regular evening preparations, when i saw the blinking red lights. i was facing west. this time i had my binocs, and tried to get a glimpse of the lights...I could vaguely make out sort of a triangular-ish or boomerang shape, with the lights blinking in an erratic pattern all about.  there seemed to be 5 lights. they all moved together, as if connected to a giant platform or object that was very very large and quiet. there were at least two commercial aircraft in the same vicinity, but they looked very tiny compared to the spanse of this object.  it kind of just floated or sailed across the sky.  i was not as frightened this time, as i have read other reports these past few days, and am inclined to think that this is some kind of really huge experimental flying platform. i watched it as it slowly drifted away(towards lax), and could no longer be seen because of my neighbor's house. if our airforce is the organization flying these giant craft, then, since the secret is out, they should let the public know what they are flying. otherwise, seeing such can be a bit unnerving, even for skywatchers like myself. and, in case it isn't 'ours', are they another country's spy planes? or something from 'elsewhere'? does anyone at mufon try to check out such sky objects when we report

an eye on the object to see if it tracked through the sky like a star, peeking back up every 3 or 4 minutes. after about 25-30 minutes the light was still in the same spot above the trees. at this

binoculars. i saw a fast moving object tht i thought was a plane. i began watching it through the binoculars. it caught my attention because it was moving very fast across the sky. it appeared as a flashing white light. it was quite far off in the distance, beyond the pier which is approx 2 - 2.5 miles from my building. as i watched, i thought my hands were moving because the object appeared to jump around. i tracked the object and i steadied my hands against the rail and as i looked for the object, it had disappeared, however, there were many small red sparks or flashes of light above, around, under, and over where the object would have been. the red lights sparkled one at a time, and then disappeared also.I thought maybe the object had gone into the clouds and i just couldn't see it, however, it never reappeared. i felt like it disappeared because someone on it knew it had been seen.","distance":"Over One

lights on one wing and red lights on the other. it also had a fairly bright light beaming from what seemed like the cockpit area. at the end of each wing there were flaps perpendicular to the wings. i don't know if this is accurate, but it appeared to have lights that extended from the front, though as i said i don't know if i actually saw the antennae like lights or perhaps a cloud or something played tricks on my eyes. i was outside my yard smoking a cigarette in glendora when i first saw the craft flying very low heading northwest. i took notice only because the red and blue lights on the plane looked like a police siren. as it got closer and flew overhead i saw the unusual shape and took note of the slow speed. then nearly an hour later i saw it again flying back toward the area where i first encountered the ufo. that is when i saw the headlight contraptions and became frustrated i was the only one awake. i've been trying to look up possible explanations on the web but i really don't know where to start. did anyone else see it?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5553,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1406587,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10112006-0001","longitude":-117.862929,"occurred":1160476200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1160476200000,"summary":"An

and i saw what i thought was a low flying plane so i pointed it out to my friends. but then it looked like a helicopter but it was flying way to low. then all at the same time we realized that there were more lights that were not shaped like a helicopter. it was directly across the intersection above the street light about 30 yards up. it was coming diagonal and then it stopped. we all yelled at the same time, \"my god thats not a helicopter!\" it then just stopped and began to turn over, this is when we saw that it was huge and a rectangular shape. it then did a bit of a dip turning verticle. this is when we saw lots of bright lights that were very large. it then flipped over and started going in the other direction. we were able to follow it for a few blocks. as we were following it, it was moving very low to the ground and going very very slow. then the lights went from being just gold to having more lights around it to white. then at the front a whole sheet of white across the front started flashing, thats when we lost it. it looked as if a car was driving through the air at one point. we had to pull over because we couldn't believe what we just saw. the car was silent and my friend took over driving for me. so we started back for the road home and i called my friend, when one of my friends in the car yelled, \"there it is again!\" we were on a main road and had green lights all the way down but had to stop to look at it. it was still in the same position just stopped, there were about 15 other cars at this time also with green lights that had stopped to look at it too. then it went into a residential neighborhood slowly, it was above the houses, but we were still able to see it, then it started lowering. i was describing this to my friend on the phone as it was happening. it started getting lower and lower and as it was the lights were turning red and flashing, then we stopped by where we thought we saw it then it flashed and we lost lost it. the whole sky went dark after it disappeared. we went down about 20 blocks and then there suddenly were a lot of helicopters in the sky with bright lights, we figured that they were on a hunt for what we had seen. later about 5 minutes when i got home there was a huge plane with really bright search lights in the skyflying low, and my dog was freaking out running and scratching just acting unusual than she normally does. we weren't scared when we saw it. we didn't really now how to react we were all yelling at each other stuff like, \"are you seeing this\", \"is this really happening\" and while we were following it we were bitting our nails in silence. after we were all silent just taking in what we had seen. while most people do not believe what we saw when we tell them, thats fine because we all know what we saw, it was huge and one of the most exciting experiences of my life. it was a real rush and i am happy that i could experience what i saw, cuz i have definately never seen anything like it at all!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then

store. i looked up and noticed a white cylinder shaped object. my first thougts, it was an high flying airplane. since the object was in the direction of dfw airport. i continued to observe and noticed that it wasn't moving like a plane or a ballon. it appeared to just sit there and float. i watched the object for 10 or so minutes and went into the store. when i left the store the object was still there and it did appeared to move a little. i rushed home and took out my binoculars and a spotters scope. i had a little better detail of the object. it sort of looked cylinder in shape with bright goldish lights in front. the object wasn't rotating but it did appear to moving. the goldish lights where very bright and steady. according to my gps , the object was in a nnw direction.At times it would disappear and reappear, i continued to watch the object for about an hour and a half. i would go out and check on it every thrity minutes or so. around 20:00 the object was still there but not as bright. around 21:00 the object was gone but there was contrails. 4-5 of them, crossing in the same path where the object was. i don't believe it was a weather ballon being that close to the dfw airport. i know it wasn't a planet or a star. i normally figure out what something is by the flight pattern or shape. i was stumped with this one, the size was about, using my fingers, was about 1 degree in size, the shape - cylider and spherical, and the light it was emitting.","distance":"Over One
