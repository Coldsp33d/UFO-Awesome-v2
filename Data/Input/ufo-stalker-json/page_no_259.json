west-southwest (from a neighborhood in west-nw side of atlanta). the neighborhood is right near bolton rd & i-285, and his house is actually on the highest point in the area looking down over a bp oil refinery and past the chattahootchee river. i was in the back doorway of my friend's house, which led to his upstairs deck. we were just talking, and i looked out through the trees and saw the first morphing orange light. when it moved up from the tree tops i called my friend over and asked if he knew what that light was. he didn't recognize it, and he knows the night skyline in his area really well. \r\n\r\noriginally we only saw the first orange light (top right of the triangle in video perspective). it ascended from tree line to where it is in the video. with my eyes i saw it morphing -- elongating down and back to a tighter ball of light seemingly in random fashion. then the other lights sorta just appeared around that one. the only movement perceived was the left arm of the \"v\" seemed to push on further into the distance. the other lights were stationary. there were 5 orange lights in a spread out \"v\" formation with one blue light underneath the closest (and brightest) orange light on the right. there were a few other orange lights that flanked the main formation and possibly one in the distance beyond the rest. it's hard to see clearly because we were filming through the wood line. \r\n\r\n once the lights moved into that final  formation, we heard helicopters coming from the north and moving south -- but we couldn't see them. they sounded like they were flying in big circles possibly doing formations, and they did that for hours (until i had to leave around 5am). the lights moved very slightly up and down every so often but always stayed in formation. what i saw with my eyes was very different than on the footage. like i said, with my eyes the lights seemed to morph a bunch. the lights would get longer (vertically). that made it look like a strip of fire was in the sky. very weird.  \r\n\r\nthere was no info online talking about why the helicopters were circling all night. that is also weird. atlanta pd and all the news outlets are very good about letting us know that kind of stuff. one other observation we made was there were absolutely no airplanes flying overhead once these lights (and helicopters) appeared. keep in mind that the atlanta hartsfield-jackson international airport is one of the busiest in the nation. planes usually fly overhead 24 hours a day nonstop.

north/south paths are uncommon. i've observed satellites passing by in the past and thought it might be one as its rate of motion across the sky seemed about right for one. however it looked too large for a satellite. in terms of size i'd rank it in the bottom quartile of stars visible with the naked eye. my view was clear and there were other stars nearby that i used to gauge its motion. over the course of the next 30 seconds or so it traversed a distance of about the width of my hand at arm's length. then it reversed its direction and began traveling south at the same rate. it covered a distance of about the width of my finger at arm's length. then it turned 90 degrees and began traveling west. it continued west at it's previous speed for about 20 seconds, then slowed and finally stopped. i observed it for the next 10 minutes or so and could not detect any further motion. dawn was beginning to lighten up the sky now, so it was difficult to tell if the brightness of the object was diminishing or it was simply fading with the other stars. at no previous time did the object's brightness vary or change color. it was past 6 am then and i left for work. this is the first time

and had my binoculars that day , as i had seen an object the previous fall from the same location. i noticed what appeared to be a star in broad daylight and looked around to see if other stars were visible. none were , so i took out the binoculars and looked around the sky for other \"stars\". when i realized there were none , i concentrated on the object. it was reflecting sunlight , and i was able to see that it was teardrop shaped. it appeared to be in a light brown haze , as if the atmosphere was reacting to it. it was not moving at all. suddenly , what appeared to be two parallel lines of smoke shot out of the craft , and between the lines shot out roughly 10 orbs that disappeared seconds after being released. then it happened several more times , but the orbs were shot out in different directions with each release. after about ten minutes of this , another craft the exact same size and configuration appeared from nowhere and rendezvoused with the first craft. at this time , i tried to get in a better position for viewing , as my neck and shoulders were getting stiff . when i looked again , they were gone. three days later , i went back with a camera and binoculars. while searching with binoculars , i saw a white sphere that was miles away , moving faster than any aircraft we have. it moved as if tumbling through the air. it appeared to be a sphere with a thin slice of a cube attached to it , and as i said it tumbled . it didn't seem possible that it could move that fast in such a manner. i set up a camera and i believe i have it on film. my problem is that i am a dumbass regarding electronics and don't know how to down load and examine it. \r\n the following year , i made many trips to the same location. it just so happened that on one occasion without binoculars , i was able to identify the same type of haze in roughly the same direction , and inside it was a light that i knew was a ship. there were numerous flashes of light near it and they appeared to be streaking away from the main object at high speed. it was at this time i realized that the orbs from the sighting the year before were not disappearing after being released. they were moving so fast that their image was still on my retina and merely appeared to disappear.\r\n my impression of this is that they are scientists , or students , or colonists , or tourists. whatever they are , they look at us as if we are ants they stumble across on a path in the woods.","distance":"Over One

out the garbage at around 8:30pm. i live in rural clackamas county, oregon. i was admiring the constellation of triangulum when i noticed a giant white ball of light hoovering right above me silently (my zenith). as soon as i noticed the light i pulled out my cell phone and began filming it. it started to move east as soon as i noticed it. i am unable to upload the video as the file size is too large but i did also take one photo before i started filming. at first i thought the photo was just the black night sky but you can see a white object when you zoom in. while observing the silent, large white light proceed across the night sky, a plane starting to approach from the south. the object was as large, if not larger, than the plane. as i was filming you can see the plane is blinking and has red & white lights, the object on the other hand did not have any blinking lights or sound, and was much brighter than the plane. i go from the object, to the plane, and back. finally the plane flew right in front of the object, blocking out it's light for a second. the object continued it's path e, ne, until i could no longer see it. it was eerie that the object was directly above me just sitting there until i noticed it. the video is about 2 1/2-3 mins long. this is not my first sighting, but it is the first one that i have ever been able to catch on video. i do have pictures of another craft i photographed in the daytime during 2010. it was two white balls that then turned into 3 balls, 2 white one red, and they appeared to be flipping over one another, in a triangular shape. the reason i photographed this craft was because the 3 yr. old i was watching pointed at the sky saying plane, and i realized very quickly it was not a plane and started photographing the phenomena. i can only call it phenomena as i have never seen something change shape, color & quantity right before my eyes, in real time. i got 4 photos of this sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

observed a steady glowing orange/red light in the northeast moving toward the southwest.  the cloud ceiling was probably 2500 feet or so and if i had to guess on distance from me it was a mile or two and at 1000-1500 feet.  the glow was steady and fairly bright with very little atmospheric flickering.  temp was about 50 degrees with no precipitation.  the light seemed like it was descending as it approached and it gained in size slightly as it moved closer to my viewing position.  it then slowed or stopped and appeared to vertically descend on the horizon about 5-10 degrees where it hung motionless for about 10 seconds.  i heard no sound of engines or propellers.  i wasn't even hearing traffic on the freeway which is about 2 miles to the north so it was a very quiet evening.  the light then started to accelerate (slightly faster than it had when it approached) away from me toward the northwest and ascend to where it disappeared into the clouds and the light dimmed to not visible to the eye.  i remained outside for another 5 minutes but it did no reappear anywhere in my viewing area.  i'm mainly reporting this hopefully corroborate any other report of this same event.  i've tried to rule out this being a chinese lantern (too solid and large of a light) and a drone (too high and too large of a light, illegally illuminated with orange).  the light was about half the size of a fingernail at arm's length.  no structure or wings/appendages visible from my distance if it had any, just a solid spherical ball of light.  i couldn't tell if the entire object was solid as this color or if it was a light, but as it moved away and became smaller, the light shape didn't change.  i see all sorts of commercial/private craft, military tankers and medical helicopters.  there aren't any military helo stationed around this area but they do operate around here now and then but you can hear them from several miles away.","distance":"Over One

our apt building during fireworks on 7/3/16.\r\n\r\n  i was 1st a victim of sleep paralysis over a year or so, last incident of that happened while i was inpatient at a butler hospital psych ward seeking help for the ongoing problem, when i finally saw a humanoid with an insectoid looking head, something like a man/praying mantis i suppose. it climbed on top of my chest and crouched there face to face for a minute or so i suppose before it faded away. then, when i was finally able to move, i reported what i'd seen to the nurses station immediately. i was totally freaked out at that point and it was thankfully my last aware incident of sleep paralysis. this was in 2006 - 2007.\r\n\r\n  at this point, although i have psoriasis, i now had many \"scoop marks\" on my legs that can't be explained medically.\r\n\r\n    i have a recent picture of an entity that manifested in my apt.... it was like a plasma ball that changed into and seemed to be struggling to keep the shape of a demon looking shape of plasma.\r\ni was able to photograph that and have it to submit.\r\n\r\n  not long after, my wife called 911 because i was feeling very ill.  when i got to the er, i was possesed by something.  it was speaking thru me, controlling me, as i ranted about imminent global disaster and humans were like a cancer on the planet and had little time left, i don't recall everything i said, but it wasn't my words! .Something maniacal had hi-jacked me, however  i felt the emotions like there was a hostile takeover happening soon. i don't know how long this went on before i slowly regained my control of myself.  nothing like this has ever happened to me before or since but i felt violated. raped from inside my head or something.  i'd love to see the security video from roger williams hospital's er.\r\n\r\n\r\n   now, while undergoing medical tests for anal and nasal bleeding on 3/25/17, and after years of what i thought were isolated problems, i fear i'm an abductee victim...  now that i've been looking for answers, it all seems to fit other's experiences of abduction and contact.  my head catscan was unremarkable, but bloodwork shows lowered hemoglobin and lower red blood cell count.  i'm awaiting a gi appointment now.\r\n\r\n  so in summary, after all these things that i swear to be true, i've concluded using achums razor theory that i must be a victim of alien abduction syndrome and don't know where else to turn for help.  my wife is just recently starting to report some funky stuff too and i now fear for thr both of us, and all mankind for that matter. these aren't friendly encounters i describe.  thanks for your time and look forward to any advice.\r\n\r\nregards, frederic pockar\r\n              rhode island, usa","distance":"20 Feet or
