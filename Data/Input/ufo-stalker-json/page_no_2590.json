west to east over approximately 30 degrees of arc at an elevation of approximately 85 degrees to the south.\r\n\r\nobjects were first noticed when looking up at a jet aircraft, which likely had taken off from orlando international, as it was executing a 180 degree change of direction from due north at an estimated altitude of 15k to 20k feet.  objects were much, much higher and seemed to be moving at a greater velocity than the aircraft.\r\n\r\nupon noticing the first (trailing) object, we thought it could be the space station or other low earth orbit satellite but then we noticed the second object leading the first and moving away from it.  \r\n\r\nboth objects pulsated with an extremely bright light at intervals of 3-5 seconds.  lead object was some 3-5 degrees of arc leading the trailing object and pulling away slightly  (lower orbit?).\r\n\r\nthe shape of both objects were indiscriminate, although we (my spouse and i) thought we could discern a cylinrical shape slightly longer than wide but we cannot be certain as the objectly were very, very high and slightly to the west of the sun.  even then, the pulsating lights were as bright or brighter than the sun to the

south of me caught my attention. it was much brighter and larger than any airplane light i've ever seen. i didn't know what it was and didn't take my eyes off of it.\r\nit was like a fireball / a glowing orange sphere / a bright orange light / similar to an orange street light. it moved steadily in a northern direction about 20 degrees above horizon, slowed down to a stop almost overhead at around 70 to 80 degrees up and still at a far distance, then moved south until i could no longer see it. as it went south the light began flickering between bright, dim, and dark, although i'm not entirely sure that there wasn't some obstructions blocking my view at that time, thereby causing the flickering effect.\r\nwhile observing this object, i walked about 38 yards towards the east and about 30 yards to the south, changing my point of view, and it seemed to be above 5,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude and it's possible that it was beyond earth's atmosphere.\r\nit's size can only be approximated because i only saw 'light', no 'object'. so the 'light' was about the size of one/fifth of the moon, easily the third biggest object i've seen in the sky - 1)sun 2)moon 3)this thing.

ground, then a huge ball of electricity then scattered particles of electric. it was split second so i can���t be sure if the ball was first then the big bolt then the scattering. there was no noise. i was kind of freaked out and did not know what to think. i had seen a few bright lights going acroos the sky that night, kinda thinking these were strange. i did not go out into the field for approx two weeks until after learning of the meteor showers we had on approx. the first week in december. my wife and i witnessed a flaming meteorite on halloween 2005,there were also lots of falling stars that night so i know the difference between the two and what i saw was not this. this was very strange. \r\n \r\n the flash was only approx 50 yards away from me and approx 50 ���100 feet in the sky. i went out in the field probably the second week in dec. and found some strange looking rocks. all of them attract a magnet\r\n\r\ni did bring one of them to the geology dept at univ. of de. the geologist seemed to think it was slag. . i went out in the field in october 2005. we had just cut the corn down and the soil had been turned. i went to the spot where the flash was and found a black shiny rock, approx 6 inches by 3 inches, weighs approx. 2 pds, very strong attraction to magnet. \r\n\r\ni am baffled at what i saw that night. i have been researching meteorites. i have looked at meteor wrongs. i did bring this rock to the geology dept at univ. of penn. they said that they believed it was a piece of glass not fully melted down, but they said it has garnet in it.They weren���t sure how garnet  would have gotten in there. they also said that meteors don���t have garnet in them. \r\n\r\ni sent the rock off to get it analyzed and sent it to a man at nasa. he stated he did not believe it to be a meteorite, according to the analysis. he did not identify it with any hematite or magnetite either. i am at a stopping point and do not know where to go. i was wondering if you would know where i can find out what this rock or whatever  is. i sent you the analysis if that would help and some pictures.\r\n\r\nthank you for any assistance you can be for me.\r\n\r\nps having problem sending all pictures. if you would like to see them i will send them\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

for him to go the bathroom in the yard, remained on my deck and looked up into the sky at the stars.  stars were easily seen although it wasn't pitch black yet.  i always look up at the stars when i am outside at night and look for planets, constellations, satellites, etc.  \r\ni looked up and saw the easily identifiable lights of a commercial airliner as it headed west to east across the night sky.  it was easy to see this was an airliner as it had 2 white lights and then a quick red and green strobe and i see these all the time going across my house at night.  it was a perfecty calm night, no wind, no other sound going on and the airliner was high enough so i heard no sound at all.  as i tracked this airliner along its course i noticed an orange object about the size of a very bright star you would see on a very clear night.  it was traveling in a northeast direction and was about my hands distance from behind the plane with my arm fully extended to cover both the plane and the orange object.  the plane and the object were on two different paths.  \r\nthe first thing that got my attention was the orange color.  it was solid orange, did not pulse on and off nor did it change any other color. i see satellites all the time and all the ones i have ever seen look just like a faint white star and are traveling at a great speed and are across the sky in 30 seconds or less.  the object i saw was definitely orange as i could compare it to the typical bright white stars as it went by them.  the size of the object could be covered in its entirety by i would say the size of about a kernel of corn if it were held on my outstreched fingers.  i did not actually use anything other than my little finger to cover the object, but the kernel of corn size i feel would be accurate.  with the orange oject in view, i could still see the plane and could track the orange obects speed relative  to the planes speed and i would say that the object was the same speed to a bit slower than the planes.  i see satellites all the time and they are really moving across the sky fast and this was moving much slower than a satellite.  again since i look into the sky all the time during the day and night i know what satellites, planes, shooting stars, all look like and there relative speed.  my very first reaction was it was a satellite, but within a few seconds of observing this excluded it based on the orange color, the size, and the speed of it.\r\nthe object did not stop, nor change direction of any kind and continued to head in a northeastern direction.  what did seem strange is that the object seemed to always be the same size from when i first saw it to when it went out of sight.  planes, satellites, etc. that i always observe typically appear smaller the further they are away until just a dot, then gone.  this object seemed to remain the same size i would best guess about 5 times the size of a typical satellite that i usually see.  even when continued along its course i did not appreciate it getting smaller.  i basically just lost track of it after about 2 minutes.  i'm not sure exactly what the object was that i saw, but i know it was not a commercial plane, a satellite, a star, a planet. i went right inside my house and told my wife that i just saw somethng weird and described it to her.  i felt like i saw something that i have never seen before and could not put it into any category of anything i have seen before.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

il/wi border) at approx. 6:30 p.M. central time. i saw what at first appeared to be the vapor trail of a high flying jet. the object was aspirin size at arms length. at first i didn't pay that much attention because i thought it was the beginning of a vapor trail. the object was in clear view for several minutes. it seemed odd that it never \"grew longer\" as a normal vapor trail does. it also was a brighter white, appeared to be solid and teardrop shaped.\r\n\r\n as i was driving (the road begins to wind southwest/northwest and is tree lined) i noticed a second object that was exactly the same distance away as the first and again appeared as a teardrop shaped/vapor trail like object. i thought this was odd because this one was pointing northeast while the first object was pointing southwest. the second object was to the right of the other object and appeared out of nowhere. they appeared to be flying at the same altitude.\r\n\r\n as i continued westbound a few minutes later,(now 3 visible what appeared to be yet another identical shaped/sized object also pointing southwest) i noticed yet a third object, again the same size as the first two which appeared to be further west than the first object but not as far south. the third object put the 3 objects in an offset triangle formation.\r\n\r\n i was trying to go faster to get home to get my digital camera/camcorder, but the drivers in front of me were moving slowly in a no passing zone. i have no idea if anyone else saw these objects, but there were a few cars in front of me and a few behind me. \r\n\r\n the sky was clear with no clouds and the sun was setting in the west, yet there was still plenty of daylight. then as if the objects knew i was trying to hurry home to photograph them they dissappeared at approximately 6:37 p.M.\r\n\r\n i know that a vapor trail from a jet doesn't just disappear within a few seconds, they dissipate over time. as i finally started to move faster and at a very far distance away, i saw one of the objects again near the horizon to the west and then lost it as i turned southbound onto wilmot road from route 173.\r\n\r\nnote: i did immediately draw a

around and up and saw a round shape come into view over the trees - if you hold your hands out straight and make a circle thumb to thumb and index finger to index finger, that was the size of the 'thing'. at first i thought it was a helicopter because of it's very clear round shape which i thought may have been the shape created by rotor blades, but it was clearly silent and apparently close so it couldn't have been a helicopter.It had five lights around the front edge with the middle light being noticebly brighter than the two otheres either side of it. i studied it to try to figure out what it was, it took around 10 seconds to slowly and steadily travel from my right to my left where it then dissappeared over the trees. i decided that i had absolutely no idea what it was and nor do

there is a large decline in the road as it ramps down into the forrest preserve. as i came up to milwaukee road i saw this hugh cigar shapped ufo. i only saw the front and then the back as  it zipped by super fast heading north. as i got to the intersection of milwaukee avenue i looked north to see if i could see it again and it was gone. it was probibly in wisconsin by then concidering how fast it was going. i saw it plain as day. it was like looking at a hubcap on a car as it drives by. i filed a report with the libertyville police soon after. i recreated an image of what i saw that day. remember i first saw the front and then i saw the rear, just like a hubcap on a fast moving car. i felt like i saw something very strange. i think that the location on top of the hill where i saw this thing would be a great place to set up some high speed camera equipment.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5518,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.2830786,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10042006-0001","longitude":-87.9531303,"occurred":697017600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":697017600000,"summary":"Cigar
