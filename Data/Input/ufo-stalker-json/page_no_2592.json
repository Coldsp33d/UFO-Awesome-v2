(\"hey, mike, come look at this jerk, frozen solid, staring into the sky...\")\r\n\r\ni initially assumed that it was an inflatable object, probably carrying a camera for the purposes of anti-terrorist surveillance during the olympic games, which were in session. as the object moved slowly away from me, i was able to better see its structure. imagine taking a cylinder (use the dimensions above) and fixing a silvered hoop to the top and bottom edges of the cylinder, and joining them by three equidistant silvered upright shafts (all silvered items [hoops/uprights] being some 10-15cm in diameter), and then removing the central cylinder. (you should have  an object that resembles a very well-constructed, rigid-looking pool toy, dumb as that might sound.) i assumed that the central, empty\r\ncylindrical area within the object probably enclosed a transparent cell containing helium or some other lighter-than-air gas, until i noticed no specular reflections that would be produced by the plastic skin of such a central, lifting cell. the more i watched, the more i became convinced that there was no central, sealed cell of this kind. and since the silvered hoops and upright shafts of the object seemed too slim to contain the volume of gas that would presumably be needed to provide sufficient lift for this object (even assuming extremely light materials for the silvered structure) i became more uneasy. \r\n\r\nas i watched, and as the object continued to move at a steady (human walking) pace away from me, i began to wonder if it might be being kept aloft by some ground-based system, perhaps involving electromagnetics (and some triangulation of ground-based emitters, to prevent canting?). i also noted that there was no oscillation or brownian-type deviations to the object, as would presumably be the case with an free-floating inflatable: it moved very steadily ('rock steady' actually) which also seemed odd. the object always remained perfectly upright, also, unlike (presumably) an inflatable, which would tumble or at least tilt here and there. i began to wonder if there may have been some kind of vectored props working inside the twin hoop structure (perhaps moving too fast for the eye to see) but since there were no obvious gimbals, or hubs or even axles for this kind of item, it seemed even more unsettling. adding to this impression, i then noticed that the silvered hoops seemed to have small rectangular black slits around the edges (perhaps a 1cm high by 4cm wide) of the twin hoops, which i will unwillingly call windows (which would presume very small occupants, obviously). i also could see no overhead balloon, above the object, which might conceivably be providing the lift to what might be some kind of payload (the object was enclosed and alone, as far as i could see). \r\n\r\nthe small 'windows' circled the outside-facing edges of the two torii. (also, this thing was close to the ground, and not some giant, high-flying object: as it moved off, i saw grounded objects - buildings, trees - through/beyond it.) lastly, the upright shafts ended within the torii, and did not stick messily out of them as in my diagram (see below). my diagram is the object seen from my perspective, from below, moving steadily away from me, veering towards the left.\r\n\r\ni noted that the object was able to slowly and smoothly rotate - not very much as far as i saw, perhaps 15-degrees or so - back and forth around its vertical axis, as it proceeded away, and did so (a 'scanning' pattern, perhaps?). this is not too interesting, except that it seems inconsistent with (say) some electromagnetic ground-based lift system that would presumably 'lock' onto the vertical shafts as 'attachment points'. to see what i mean, visualise one of those stadium-specific overhead camera robots, that uses three computer-controlled wire-spools attached at three points around the central stadium area, that allows a rigid, non-rotational movement within a three dimensional area (including declination if all three wires are simultaneously unspooled) upon which you mount a 3d gimbal and then a camera. this provides those very good runner-following points of view used in some televised sports.\r\n\r\nthe object i saw rotated, which would seem to suggest self-motivation and lift, rather than invisible 'attachment' to three ground-based stations, if you follow my reasoning.\r\n\r\nfor the sake of argument, i imagine that with the cash and the brains it would be possible to create an analogous device to the one i saw, using electromagnetic ground-based systems, but since horizontal movement would presumably be controlled by simultaneous, synchronised 'unspooling' and 'respooling' by the three ground-stations, our analogous device would tend to remain in a specific orientation when seen from above, in spite of movement or declination. one would probably use a thin, ferrous target, and perhaps fill it with some lifting gas if possible, and ideally provide it with some kind of long-life battery and camera to allow long-term aerial surveillance of a demarcated zone. (i wonder though about the bioelectric effects, and whether animals would react to the three converging maglev beams...)\r\n\r\ni also recall muttering to myself as it moved away from me: \"hm. well... i guess that's a u.F.O. yep... uh huh.. i guess\r\nso...\"\r\n\r\nmy final impression as i watched the object was that i began to wonder if i was seeing the intrusion into three-dimensional (actually 4d, inc. time) space by a multidimensional object. but since i saw no warping, bending, glimmering, illumination, luminescence or other light-affecting characteristics (aside from the basic reflectivity of the silvered, joined hoops) i began to think again that it might simply be some kind of secret, high-tech device that was using transmitted electrical energy to create a lifting effect. \r\n\r\nmore recently, i have been wondering about the possibility of a time-shift being involved, such that the device was a probe sent (presumably from the future) by unborn, high-tech, human generations to 'visit' and document a past event, in this case, the well-regarded and uneventful 2000 sydney olympics. (no, i didn't see any logos or writing on the object, and certainly no 'cnn' or such...) \r\n\r\nas the object drifted off, i belatedly remembered that i had a film-loaded compact 35mm camera in the boot of my car, which i (eventually) located and used to take a photo, at which time the object was essentially a light-coloured speck. annoyed i had forgotten about the camera, i went back to watching. the object continued to float, very much against the prevailing wind, beyond a fenced off-area, and since i couldn't see myself trespassing into neighbouring car parks to chase this thing, i put the camera away, signed off on the situation, and went back to work, reasonably convinced it was some new uav, probably being run by some no-doubt amused operator, (perhaps on secondment from the us military in a nearby building or such). \r\n\r\nshortly after the encounter, i described it in detail to a relatively open-minded electrical-engineer, who seemed more certain than i that the object seemed to be breaking various power-weight rules regarding powered inflatables, or metallic objects using some kind of ground-based, targeted, medium-range maglev lifting effect, especially considering its ability to move against the prevailing wind.\r\n\r\nfinally, i'm only reporting this because i've been looking into current and upcoming uav tech, and this thing doesn't seem to fit into any design (or even operating principle) i've been able to find. (everything out there looks like da vinci machines made by m.I.T., while my ufo looked more like a miniature space station from the 1950's...)\r\n\r\ni wonder now if i shouldn't have just leapt onto the boot of my car and tried to grab onto that werner von braun pooltoy, or try to down it with a tyre iron...\r\n\r\nmy (belated) report's use or significance is not really something i can control (or really want to). if it is recorded and is available to future researchers seeking to establish patterns; that will be fine, and quite enough, for me.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5477,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-33.866251,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-09282006-0004","longitude":151.2102896,"occurred":967705200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

property. a glowing, green, foggy mist, they were closer than usual, but not out of the ordinary. they had been in the exact same spot just a month earlier. as i walked across the driveway to the kennel, i looked up at them to see them go up higher, and move even closer, almost over the yard. i set the dogs free and turned around to go back inside.\r\n\r\nfig 2\r\nturning back toward the house, i looked up to notice that the glowing, green mist had struck out across the sky into two vibrant, green streaks, which is common, they extended all the way over the top of our property, and a little beyond.\r\n\r\nthey shimmered and moved up and down in a characteristic and familiar pattern for a few seconds and they were brighter than usual. they had a striking effect, making them appear very close. while i watched, the streak nearest to me, began to descend to the top of the driveway and condense into a luminous, shimmering, holographic \"nebula\".\r\n\r\nfig 3\r\nthe nebula began to look smokey. quickly it changed into a gaseous cloud and as it advanced, i began to see vertical, neon- green tubes coming out from underneath, which seemed to be moving up and down. it proceeded down the path of the driveway from the right to the left. as it approached, it seemed to be a three-dimensional volume with a height and depth of approximately 20 x 20 ft. i did not have to look up to see it. eye-level to the lower portion of it, i was able to observe it in perspective as it slowly floated by.\r\n\r\nit appeared to be a lively, swirling gaseous substance, illuminated by a cluster of several hundred long, neon- green, vertical, tubular rods, which projected out from underneath. they seemed to be floating in continuous parallel rows and were marching forward. i could see the tubular shaped rods repeated continuously throughout the underneath of the entire floating thing. though they appeared to be parallel, as they approached, i noticed a very slight angle of parallax. more of the rods became visible when it was directly in front of me. i looked straight into the depths of it where the individual, evenly spaced rods visually disappeared into a sea of luminous neon-green. the brilliant and intense color made the swirling, gaseous top glow with an ominous and eerie effect.  \r\n\r\nlike a gigantic amoeba, it \"walked\" across the sky using the tubular rods for legs. each tubular rod shape followed the one before it, in its own row, all at the same speed, as they floated up like pogo-sticks a few feet high, then back down to a constant level which was about eye-level to me. as floating, parallel, neon tubes, they bounced like golf-ball sized bouncy-balls moving above the written words to a song on a television screen. each tube seemed to be the resulting visual effect of one brilliant, green light that shone straight up like a laser beam, perpendicular to the ground, forming the optical illusion of a green rod or a fluorescent light bulb. the anomaly was like an amoebic creature or, according to what i now understand, a membrane \"brain\" of string theory. it was unlike anything i had ever seen before.   \r\n\r\nafter i finished the illustrations, i realized that i never really saw the entire thing from end to end, all at once. what i saw was the beginning of it as it approached, the middle as it was passing, and the end of it as it went up to the sky in a procession that took about one minute. the front and middle of it were trailing up to the sky on my left like green smoke, i noticed, when i turned my head to watch the last of it go past.\r\n\r\nfig 4\r\nafter the entire floating mass had passed by, it returned to the sky in a trail of greenish smoke and formed into a streak overhead on my left. i was standing right between the two streaks, when the one i termed the \"brain\" spread out into a formation, similar to the wing span of a huge swan, with the former rods as individual feathers. the other of the two original streaks, was still in its original position, as if waiting. the \"brain\" moved in a little closer to it, as if to get it's attention, and it responded to the \"brain\" by moving in a little closer on my right. i was standing between them when a very beautiful thing happened. the \"brain\", using its wings as a human would use arms, beckoned the former to come forward, and then backed up, as if to gain momentum. like two huge swans in a heavenly, mythological ballet, they flew together in mirror image of each other.\r\n\r\nfig 5\r\non contact of their \"wing tips\", a circle of lights was instantaneously created, composed of prismatic-colors that began to spin clockwise underneath a mass of swirling, white \"smoke\" or gas. as the whole ring spun around at a high speed, it descended to a height, which appeared to be only 30 ft. above me.\r\n\r\nfig 6\r\nwhen the circle of lights stopped spinning, the \"smoke\" began to settle into white beams of light, that shown upward, into the sky. the circle began to float up as well.\r\n\r\nfig 7\r\nthe circle of lights ascended, and as it rose up, i could see individual lights \"lifting off\", aligning themselves with those of the same color.\r\n\r\nfig 8\r\nthe lights rose straight up, high above me, so that i had to tilt my headway back to look up at it. it was vibrating and moving in a ���wiggly\" way; not spinning. once it got to a certain height, of about 500 ft., it stopped and hovered, but it was never totally motionle.\r\n\r\nshimmering vibrantly in prismatic colors, it hovered straight overhead in the shape of an ancient, symmetrical, arabesque design;  the same shape it might have held when the wing tips of the two \"swans\" first met in formation, if they had not started spinning. i could see the different colors of the lights aligned in repetitive rows, concentric to each other. the outside row contained violet lights. the next row in, was of violet- red. the third row in was red-orange and the fourth, innermost row was orange-yellow. i could see white beams of light pointing to the center, indicating that it was indeed an image with a focal point, and it was very high up and directly over my head.\r\n\r\nfig 9\r\ni stood in the middle of the driveway, where the enigma had existed as an amoebic cloud just minutes earlier, and i watched it for a while. i noticed that when it wiggled more vibrantly, the lights of like-color blended together into a \"ribbon\" effect that continued all the way around. sometimes there were sections of the individual lights and sections of the ribbons, causing a combined visual effect of the two. the rays of light all pointed to the center, indicating that it was directly over me.\r\n\r\nfig 10\r\nwhen i looked back up, it was spinning and descending once again to a level about 30-50 ft. above me. it seemed to me that the circle shape was a result of centrifugal force, of the downward propulsion.\r\n\r\nfig11\r\nwithout hesitation, the breaking point took the lead of the newly formed comet, and began to spiral inward, still clockwise, until it reached the center. the mist above it turned from a greenish color to an encompassing, rainbow haze. the comet condensed into an oval, white center. as it spiraled inward, the center seemed to become a little larger and rise up slightly.\r\n\r\nfig12\r\ni anticipated that the end of the comet's tail would reach the center, which it did, after what seemed to be about 15 seconds. once all the lights were condensed into the oval center, a hook shape projected out from the top of it which faced counterclockwise and held it's shape.\r\n\r\nfig13\r\nthe hook shape bent back in counterclockwise direction and held its shape for about 5 seconds before the whole concentration exploded in the sky like a silent roman candle. exhibiting an array of colors in the same order as those observed within the arabesque ring, that had hovered over my head only minutes before, the explosion expanded across the sky immediately above me and spread out over our entire yard, with the familiar color sequence of violet on the outside; violet-red next, then red-orange, and finally orange-yellow, as the nearest to the center.\r\n\r\nfig 14\r\nas the lights fizzled to the ground, i could see that they had smokey, spiraling trails behind them, like an ordinary roman candle. the colorful lights began to diminish in order; beginning with the orange-yellow, and ending with the violet.\r\n\r\nfig 15\r\nwhen all the lights extinguished, smokey clouds hovered motionless, gradually fading to nothing.\r\n\r\n-susan rodgers\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet,

10 miles from home on a 25 mile trip.  i always look to the sky occasionally to see if i see anything.  i have never seen anything in the sky.  i am ussually skeptical that i would ever see anything but, why not look.  i was driving pretty much north from kalamazoo.  i looked up at this clearing about 10 miles from home and i thought i saw something strange.  it looked like, what i would call, a black rainbow.  now, it hasn���t rained here in 2 days so, there should be no rainbow.  so, i thought it must be something on the windshield of my 1988 chevy 4wd.  i moved my head to the left and to the right.  nope, it was definitely in the sky somehow.  then i noticed, it was perfectly straight.  a perfectly straight black rainbow pointing exactly down to the ground where i was heading to.  that���s right, it was pointing at my house, 10 miles away.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nnow to describe this black rainbow.  it was following what appeared to be a jet stream.  but,  it was larger in width than the jet stream.  it was probably 8 times as wide as the jet stream, and it continued on farther than the jet stream, in fact it looked as if it went right to the ground, at my house.  but, again i was 10 miles away from my house so, who knows.  the thing was 8 times as wide as a jet stream, see through, and perfectly straight.  a jet stream would be the path of an airplane.  this was perfectly straight and wide.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nunfortunately, i forgot to look at it when i got home, because my brakes needed repair, they were sticking, and i had the parts to fix it and went imediately to work.  i forgot to check for the thing when i got home.  bummer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nlater that night my wifes daughter said she saw a ufo.  well, she has never said that.  so, i asked her to show me this ufo.  she took me outside and pointed out the end of our driveway at five or six stars.  these stars were low in the sky, and i have always said that a star low in the sky is messed up by the atmosphere at that level and stars can appear strange.  however, she has never said anything like that ever.  so, i observed these stars, the bottom one was bright and flickering.  not flashing like a plane but, flickering in a random pattern that probably was not atmospheric interference.  the other four or five stars she pointed to seemed to be moving, the bright one too, moving, around and around ever so slightly.  i will probably write them off as atmospheric disterbance but, then again this whole day did cause me to write you so, who knows.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\none last thing i must report to you, is that, about 1 month ago, in barry county michigan, somewhere near m-37 there was a report on channel-8 news of crop damage.  ok, i thought here we go.  but, now i am not so sure.  the report was that some sorgum (spelling?) was knocked down in an unusual pattern.  swirling.  some ufo investigators were saying that it did not look like wind or hoax, it looked like radiation damage.  but, the ag department of michigan guy said it was caused by the farmer not harvesting his sorgum soon enough.  nobody seems to know.  and now the black rainbow.  and my wifes daughters sighting of moving stars.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:30:55","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

mosquero and logan i spotted what i thought was a weird looking small cloud through the front window.  then i realized there were no other clouds in the sky and it seemed to stand out so clearly. from that distance it looked almost like a vertical chevron.  my second reaction was that it was probably a weather balloon.  my husband didn't want to stop so i tried to view it through binoculars. very bumpy in the car so i couldn't really tell much about movement. it was not metallic looking, but looked as if it has pearlized surface. it did reflect the sun on the east side.  as we got closer to i 40 ( the vantage point where it looked the largest) the shape looked like a thin balloon or upside down teardrop. it never seemed to move.  when we reached i 40 and headed east to amarillo it appeared to be still south of us.  i kept looking back all the way to amarillo and could still see it in the southwest. it must have been very high.  i didn't think they still used the weather balloons very much any more due to environmental hazards and aviation traffic. when i first spotted it looked about 1/4\" long and less than that in width. after logan, we were on hwy 469 to st. jon. amarillo is about 45 miles from st. jon (i think).  i would be interested to know if anyone else reported this or if there were weather balloons in the area.  it is probably something very explainable but it was

i thought i should submit this with you.  see the event on your site dated aug. 2006.   also in ohio..\r\n\r\non a recent trip to southern ohio from cleveland, my daughter trinity, (26) and myself (50) were three quarters the way through a normally 4.5 hour trip. we turned off interstate 71 about 15 miles south of columbus on state rt. 62 at the harrisburg/ orient exit. we were seven miles south of i-71. the terrain is flat for the most part. upon approaching a rise in the road, (much like an overpass), the road curves to the left. \r\nas we were approaching the rise there was a bank of four white lights came on above the rise. they were straight ahead and beyond the rise/ curve maybe 500-1000 feet past. they were 300 ��� 400 feet high. they were street light sized and intensity and spaced 4-5, or more, feet apart in a stationary horizontal line. i know the height because i routinely climb a 200 foot tower for work. at first i thought they were maybe a cell phone tower. i did not see a strobe or beacon. my daughter was awake and saw the same thing. we didn���t say anything about it at the time. \r\n\r\nthe time was approx. 2100 on friday the 28th of october. we were chatting normally for the next few miles maybe 5- 7 and the we saw exactly the same thing on the opposite side of the road. this time we both looked at each other in amazement. she asked what the heck was that and she indicated she had seen it back at the curve. i replied that it was probably an aircraft or cell phone tower. we kept talking about it and then we wondered if maybe we had seen a ufo. \r\n\r\nthe lights did exactly the same thing each time. all four came on for about five seconds and then went out one at a time from left to right at one to two second intervals. each time it looked like we were passing the object because the viewed angle changed as we moved forward. speed was approx. 60 mph. the object stayed motionless. no sound. no shadows. no illumination of the surrounding structure. \r\n\r\nthe night was very clear. moon was maybe a crescent. air was cool, about 35 deg f. we were well into the country. not much ambient light. \r\n\r\nwe continued talking about it the rest of the trip. we arrived at out destination at the expected time, about an hour later. we had not been on this route since may but had been this way many times before. we decided not to worry about it but to look closely on the return trip, which was two days later. it would be daylight on the return trip. thirty-six hours later we were on our way back home. we had decided to watch closely once we were north of washington courthouse. we would then know if there were indeed cell phone towers in the area. there were no cell phone towers anywhere in the vicinity of rt. 62 north of washington courthouse and all the way past the overpass where we first noticed the lights.\r\n\r\nwould be interested if anything like this has ever been reported.  would like the chance to discuss this as i now have some theories about the possibilities. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the steps off my deck, with two of my dogs so they could potty. i don't remember a visible moon, and only my back porch light was on, as well as a street light in front of my house.\r\n\r\nit was cool out (my breath was visible), so i looked up expecting a clear sky, which was the case. i live in a remote area, which makes for good stargazing. also, while it was still dark out, it was beginning to get light in the east.\r\n\r\nat this time, i saw what i thought was a bright star or planet, in the western sky near celestial north. after a couple of seconds, i realized it was moving.\r\n\r\ni maintained my gaze on the object, with the naked eye, as it moved slowly north or northeast (it's hard to tell precisely, as my road does not run true north-south), and lost it in the treeline 1-2 minutes later.\r\n\r\n(i should note we get very little air traffic over my house, except for small, low-flying private planes and the occasional life flight helicopter. we do live about 25 miles north of grissom reserve air base.)\r\n\r\nat first, i dismissed it as a plane. then i realized there were no flashing or colored lights as on a plane or helicopter. also, i saw nothing resembling a comet tail or contrail. it was impossible to judge mass or distance of the object.\r\n\r\nthe path of motion seemed to be ballistic, and i saw no accel/decel, stopping, or turning of the object. the was no perceptible helicopter or plane/jet sound, though i do have a small dam on my property which provides background noise.\r\n\r\ni've seen shooting stars before, and this was not one of them. i doubted i'd be able to see a satellite or the iss under these conditions, with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes, i returned inside and resumed my morning routine, mentioning the sighting to

west. the first object was cigar shaped and was moving as an aircraft would.  it looked like the sun was reflecting off it, but the sun was setting in the west (behind the object) and through the binoculars the entire object was glowing.  we thought it was a plane, but then it started moving north across the sky and then turned and started going west again.  we then noticed a second object that appeared to be coming from the west towards us.  we knew the object was coming towards us because it got bigger.  the second object turned north and continued to move north.  as it moved, it appeared to take on a cloud like appearance.  the first object was almost out or site as it had moved further west and then it disappeared below the hills that are directly west of our house.  while the second object continued to move north, a third object appeared about the same place as the first two.  this object was shaped in the classic bell curve.  it appeared to rise above the skyline from below, but it could have been flying low and just come over the hill while it was ascending.  at any rate, it ascended vertically and then appeared to bank with the bottom of the bell angled towards our position about 45 degrees off vertical and horizontal with the top of the bell still visible.  the second cigar shaped object was still moving north.  the bell shaped object then turned over about 180 degrees so that the top of the bell was pointed downward the same as the bottom of the bell had been.  that is why i said it appeared to flip over 180 degrees.  then, while my wife was watching it through the binoculars, it just ���blinked��� out of existence and was gone from view.  there was no moving in any direction so that it could be assumed that it just went out of site; it just disappeared from view.  the second cigar shaped object was still moving north and as i watched it through the binoculars, it slowly faded from view and just disappeared also.  again, it was not moving in any changed direction or at any increased speed, so that it could be assumed to have disappeared over the horizon, (the first object did that); it just disappeared as the bell object had.  \r\n\r\nthere was no way to estimate how big the objects were, how far away they were or at what speed they were traveling.  because i have seen jets moving in all directions, in this location and others (as the phoenix airport is in that direction), the objects were not traveling at any high rate of speed, not faster than jets and much slower, especially the bell shaped object.  i would estimate by an educated guess that the objects were somewhere over the phoenix area.  even through the binoculars, the objects were glowing brightly such as a cloud might with the sun below and behind it.  they did not behave like any cloud i have ever seen and were not clouds.

first but i noticed the red pulsing and started watching them closer. i was hard to reference them against the dark sky but after months of watching i began to see small rapid movements as if they were adjusting their position. when the third one appeared several months ago it took a position close enough to the side of the house that i had an immovable reference to watch it from.  i can't tell you how high it is but it is higher than the cirro cumulus clouds that pass under it.  i live under several southbound victor airways (from philadelphia)and i've never seen a passenger jet come close.  i have estimated it's motion as mostly straight lines, mostly jostling around as if it is unable to keep a smooth station keeping.  the longest straight line motion was equal to the width of half a moon when it's at zenith.  i have seen it accelerate to remarkable speeds almost insantaneously; about 2 to 3 times that of a passenger jet 50 miles out from the airport. i am refering to relative motion as i observed from the ground.The passenger jets are at least 15,000 feet and if this object is above 60,000 feet as i have observed in the past, then it is clearly traveling in excess of 1000 mph, over sudden short distances and making abrupt right angle turns and 180 degree turns to sudden stops. if there were people in that object, they would be the consistancy of peanut butter by now.  i don't have any evidence that this object is extra terrestrial.  i did nor see it leave for space.  on the contrary it rises over the horizon as if it were a star, so i would have to say it is terrestrial in that sense.  i have had a long life interest in aviation. i soloed in 1968 and have had the odd occasion to fly many times since then but am not licensed.  i do have a strong interest in and can identify many airplanes, even rare ones on sight.  i qualified to operate nuclear power plants in the navy and had a top secret security clearance.  i was never exposed to anything that can perform like this object.  i can promise you anything, but if you show up you might see it too.  i am somewhat sceptical and was willing to listen to \"reason\" until 2 nights ago i was watching the one to the north east when to my surprice a meteor fell very close to it and the dam thing moved out of the way.  i watched it very close for the remainder of the evening and decided to report it. i don't know what it is and if anyone comes out here and tells me that they do know what it is, they will need to do some serious explaining because without a telescopic camera we just won't be able to get a grip on this.  as i am writing this, the south western object is in view and descending slowly as is the western object. it is descending in increments as if to stay in link with the rest of the sky. the northeast and most active object has not appeared yet.  it is 8:22pm est.  i have an unobstructed view of 180 degrees of the compass from ssw to nne and straight up. the view towards newark, de is washed by the lights but my house blocks the light.  i have seen at least 2 other very interesting objects of a different nature but can't give anything but an interesting story about them.  this case is different because my wife has seen the object move.  she is a paramedic and was also a 911 operator.  i have many years of experience as a machinist and understand many of the illusions that can can obstruct visual observations.  by experience i correct for many but i can understand why visual observations are suspect.  that is why i waited until i was sure in my own mind that this object should be investigated. it is 8:49pm est and the southwest object just went below the horizon.  the western object is one third as high as the north star.  the northeast object has not appeared yet and i don't expect it until after 9pm est.  it's 9:07pm est and i have spotted the ne object through the trees.  i am standing on an 8ft deck so from ground level it may have come over the true horizon within the last 15 minutes or so.  the erratic motion is quite apparent now with the trees for reference and there is no wind. i now have two more witnesses.  it is 9:30pm. on other nights it gets higher in the sky until i give up and go to bed.  the western object is setting on the horizon and is showing some erratic movement and the neastern object is clearing the tree line at 9:49pm.  i don't have a clue what they are but we all agree they are not stars. it sparkles like a diamond. it's 10:00pm and the northeastern object is above the trees and exhibiting behavior absolutely unlike any aircraft i know of.  i'm going to bed and ill see these guys again tomorrow night. so stop by around 9:30 or 10:00 and see the show. goodnight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

the sky captured my attention: a shine. when i looked at the sky there was that big \"cigar\" flying very very fast and the sundown light was causing the shine in one of its \"tips\". it had no wings or other visible details. it appeared to be in metal, plumb color but \"polished\". totally soundless. \r\nbased on my experience with planes, i can estimate it was about 3,000 meters high (1,800 feet)and the speed was 4/5 times more than a jet plane (3,000 to 4,000 km/hour) or more. it came from east crossing the sky and disappeared going to the west. at the distance i saw it, i can say it's size was very similar to a boing 707. \r\nit was such a surprise to see that and it was so fast, i don't remember thinking something special. only when it desappeared i went in the house and told to the family what i saw. i was 17 years old and of course the fact had impact on me, but positive. since that time i use to read about.

of some footage i shot on sept 23rd 2006.\r\ni had just setup the camera and three minutes into the video a white oval disk showed up and flew north from my location.\r\nas you can see the sky was hazy but i think it's good enough to post.\r\ni also photographed when this disk was high up in the clouds.\r\n\r\nthis is the same area i have filmed all those objects and have seen many objects in this same area for the past six months.\r\nit's just a matter of time before i get a really good close-up.\r\nthe two pictures included are\r\nthe first is of the white disk and the second are two black objects.\r\n\r\nlooks like the activity is also picking up here at night again.\r\ni saw the flashing strobe lights again and an object streak straight down from above at 9:20pm towards the boca raton area or maybe even south of that towards ft lauderdale. it was not bright this time rather a fireball color and the way to describe it as if you threw a lit match stick.\r\nthat���s it from

the exit and my mom said whatis that in the distance. i looked up it look like it was somewhere between valero and utsa. it was silver metallic object and at first we thought it was a big balloon like a small good year blinp but really shiny in the sky but then all at once it looked like it was morphing or turning. it also looked like it had a roundish body and tail. my mom at first thought it was a helicopter but when it started to change and morph (this is the only way i can think to explain how it looked) she said she thought it looked like it was in 3-d and then started to look kind of flat and not in 3-d. it was very strange and not an airplane. so we pulled out onto the access road and looked at it for another minute. we decide to take the turn around and get a better look to see what it really was but after we went on the turn around  1604 south it was gone. so went back up the lp 1604 north back home we looked up in the sky and saw a black dot way up high and it could have been a bird except it was moving pretty darn fast. we turned in at hills and dales to look again and it was gone too and it had been heading toward the where the silver object was. my mon and i have never seen anything like those objects and i have never reported anything like this before. i really have to say we did not know what either of those objects were.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

weekend there.  we were on highway 158 about 35 miles north of kill devil hills.  there were a lot of large thunder clouds in the area but it did not rain until later in the day.  i was looking up the road at some of the clouds and saw an oval shaped glowing object, slightly larger than a commercial jet, traveling from east to west at about 5,000 feet.  i would estimate it was about four to five miles ahead of us straight up the road.  i had sight of it for about three seconds as it went past the front of the cloud ahead of us and disappeared into another.  i saw it long enough to realize it was moving at a high rate of speed based upon the distance it covered before it disappeared and it was not any type of conventional craft i was familiar with.  this was the first ufo i had seen in about six years and i was kind of excited.  i would guess this was a disk and the the glow around it made it look more of an oval shape from the distance i was from it.  it did not have sharp defined edges, almost hazy looking. i kept looking at the cloud it had gone into hoping to see it come out the other side, but there were a lot of trees along the road and a lot of traffic around me as people were going home from the beach after the holiday.  by the time i saw someplace to pull over the thing would have been long gone so i kept on my way home.  i am a member of nc mufon.
