visibility distance. some of low pressure clouds present. mostly, in west coast (coastal beach) having a lot of huge low pressure clouds with possible thunderstorms. on my way to attend the workshop meeting to a specific place. i parked my vehicle. i saw a motorist and lady passenager stopping their vehicle on middle of street road. they looked up and tried to take a few pictures of their cellphones. puzzled. i looked up. my gasp, the yellow sphere-like object about 20 yards away from i stand holding a large drink of iced unsweetened tea at my vehicle parking on a parking space. it was hovering about 10 mph from the west coast to east coast from 14th street. i called several friends to witness it before it went disappeared. no one had a camera. the motorist with lady passenager tried to follow it but could not do to go due into congested heavily traffic on northbound. it went disappeared in northern-eastern area after 5 minutes. i saw with my own eyes. no ordinary thing as a remotely drone or spy object or weather balloon. it came from west coast (beach) to east coast (inland) i assumed within 20 - 30 miles distance radius. i drew an art drawing picture of yellow object that might have an electromagnetic supposed to hover with approx 10 mph speed. it may have a hidden windowshield. it moved slowly clockwise and counterclockwise without sounds like a navigating system to see me standing to look up at flying unknown object in the air about 20 yards away from the ground. the spherical object was similiar as almost size as ordinary car-suv vehicle . i know no one manufactures a flying strange object but a possible futuristic with advanced technological system from the future? \r\n\r\nanyone from manatee who did witnessed taking same pictures of any cellphone's built-in camera on sept. 6, 2006 wednesday evening 18:15pm? \r\n\r\nif no one reports this, keep this classified confidentiality, please. thank you.   \r\n\r\nupdate: shuttle rocket took off from northearn-eastern that was witnessing by several people. i asked them what was that?  they did not know about unknown object but saw that shuttle rocket blasted away on 9/9/06. \r\n\r\n9/10/2006 there was a major earthquake 6.0 magnitude in the gulf of mexico. i believe that yellow spherical object came from there - west coast of gulf.  no wonder.  keep this confidentiality. \r\n\r\n180

missles at the object. now i say \"appeared\" because i've never seen a missle launched, but there was a bright red light from the wing of the aircraft and then a contrail led by that red light for some distance. there was a red light that appeared from each side of the airplane. there was no noise that i could discern above the noise of the planes. the interesting thing about this was that the contrails of the missles (if that's what they were) seemed to be very short, so i figured that they had to be launched in an upward direction.","distance":"Over One

there are ufos around us more often than not, though probably \"cloaked\".  to test this theory, i've been bringing my sony dscp100 digital camera with me to work (i'm a courier) and shooting a few minutes of video here and there, when i have time to stop.  i have a route that i do every day, and pass thru a small town called silver lake, just out side hutchinson, mn.  i have parked by the lake a couple times and shot random video of the sky over the lake, with the camera focused as wide as it will go.  i then bring the footage home and inspect it at half-speed, to see if i can find anything.  it seems that every time i've shot there, i come away with something unusual.  this footage is the clearest so far, but it's hardly what i would call \"conclusive\".  i try to note the times i see insects/birds pass in front of the camera, so that i can disregard them, and i didn't see anything of the sort at this point in the video.  also, judging by the speed and smoothness of the object's flight, as well as its flight path, it seems unlikely that it is a bird/insect.  but i'll leave it up to you to evaluate, since you're the experts.  watch the upper left hand corner and you'll see the object enter the frame and make a semi-circular turn and exit the frame.  also, there is what appears to be a second object that chases it, which comes from the bottom, mid-left portion of the screen.  i am also including another clip from the same location, taken about a week prior to this sighting,  which shows a ufo (quite possibly a bug) descend rapidly from the top mid-left of the frame, followed by a very odd  black parallelogram that appears in the sky (mid-right of frame)for just a fraction of a second.  i'd very much appreciate your expert opinion on this footage.

1981.  i was commuting to central michigan university, (mt. pleasant, michigan) to finish up my b.A.A. degree in library science.  i was taking a late night course, which ran on mondays, wensdays, and fridays from 10:00 pm to 12:00 am.  one friday evening i was driving home on a stretch of road which consisted of 2 lanes only, which my mother had informed me would be a short-cut home.  no one else was on the road that late in the evening.  i was headed for cadillac, michigan (my home town).  i was living with my parents temporarily, until i got my degree, and a course-related job.  i looked up through the visor and saw what i thought was venus. it loomed  straight-ahead of the car, and very bright.  i bent down for an instant to fumble with my purse, or turn on the radio ( i don't remember exactly what).  when i looked up again to see venus, it was no longer there.  startled, i pulled the car off of the road adjacent to a bridge-like gard rail.  i got out and looked around.  all was still, quiet, and dark.  no cars anywhere.  there were trees about a quarter of a mile in the distance off to my left hand side.  as i scanned the sky for the light, i noticed to this left, over the expanse of trees, a strange egg-shaped luminous white object floating over the tops of these trees.  there was no noise, nothing.  it bobbed up and down very slightly like a yo-yo.  i watched for a few minutes, then i decided that it was probably a balloon. i got back in the car and drove home.  the next night, i saw it again over my neightbor's back-yard trees.  a balloon does not follow cars home.  my neighbor, mrs. sapatka saw it, and thought it might be a saucer.  i went into the house to phone the police.  the dispatcher sounded incredulous, but assured me that a military officer would contact me soon about the event.  no officer ever came.  the following sunday evening after church, i was driving grandmother the 2 miles home, when out of the blackness, straight for our car, headed a helicopter.  it had no markings and was dark green or black.  it was coming so fast at us, it scared grandma and i half to death. it must have been only 15 feet off the ground. as it came towards us, there was a flash of white sparks, like a small explosian directly ahead of the copter. it then roared over the car and kept going.  grandma stuck her head out the passenger window and said, \"what on earth was that?\"  i told her it looked like a copter was chasing something.  my grandmother and mrs. sapatka have both since passed away.  so much for my witnesses.  i never mentioned it again to anyone.  my parents didn't seem interested to begin with.  i had another ufo expereince in the summer of the early 1990's.  i was living with my sister, and working at sears in columbus, ohio.  i decided to go into town early one morning to garden shop.  the neighborhood was a quiet culdesac, and everyone was still asleep.  the sun had cast a pinkish-orange hue over everything.  birds were starting to sing.  as i jostled with my car keys to open the door, (my car was parked across from the house on the street), i looked up and saw 3 flaming objects in a triangular formation stopped dead in the sky and very close.  again, there was no noise at all.  the flames looked stangely animated, like  those fakey halloween torches you might buy for decoration.  the flames were a white-yellow color and were flickering downward. i did not notice anything else.  i thought of flares later on, but there was no smoke emitted from these flames.  i had heard no planes or jets fly over earlier.  i went back into the house to grab my clipper camera, and when i came back out, the objects were gone.  again, i was too scared to contact anyone.  thanks for reading this.  michelle

disappeared and the sky was becoming darker. we were driving more or less continuously in a straight line except for some parts of the journey where the road occasionally turns. \r\n\r\nsitting in the front seat of the passenger side looking directly ahead i noticed an object just above eye level. i would describe it as looking like a curved mark/blemish/blob of bright orange light. it looked about an inch long in the sky and appeared to be stationary. i looked at this light for what seemed like a good 10 minutes, then as we veered towards the right side of the road i lost site of the object due to tall trees. \r\n\r\nabout 8 minutes later the road straightened out and the object could be seen again, however this time the object shrunk into a small ball of orange light. once again i viewed the object (this time for a longer time, around 15 minutes) before the road curved round and we lost sight of the object. \r\n\r\nas we came out of the next bend the object could be seen once more, but this time we were closer and the object now looked bigger. it was also a different shape, this time looking like a long orange spear about 3-inches long to my naked eye. \r\n\r\nafter viewing the object for quite some time, perhaps another 10/15 minutes we then drove past it and the object was not seen again.  \r\n\r\ni've no idea what the object was but later discovered that there was a lunar eclipse that night, so perhaps this had something to do with it. i enjoyed the sighting as it turned a boring car journey into an interesting spectacle. i should also point out that my friend who was driving at the time also saw it but we did not discuss it until the next day. at the time i didn't want to draw attention to it as i felt it may be dangerous to distract him from his driving.

perspective). both lights were on for about 5 seconds then faded out. a few seconds later, 2 more lights appeared, vertically this time, same distance apart and on for the same duration. i said something to my co-worker and he looked up to see the 3rd event--4 lights in a vertical zig-zag pattern. again, after about 5 seconds, they just faded out.\r\n  the lights were circular, off-white

coded visual signals? the lights would have been visible from both the airport and the nearby air force base. we see aircraft flying all night long, but neither of us had seen anything like this. it was very strange. also, the \"headlights\" of the jets are a harsher, blue-white, while these had a more yellow tinge to them. be curious to know if anybody else saw them or has a comment.

and immediately saw a flashing light that was similar to a star but far to low and close to my home. i am colorblind so i asked my fiance to come and see what i was talking about.  she informed me that the light was flashing red, white, & blue.  i watched the light for about 5 minutes and the object never moved but maybe 3-4 inches from my perspectinve in the sky.  there was no sound of any sort.  i just chalked it up as another something in the sky my fiance thinks is nothing.  what is about an hour later i was just looking out the window to see if it was still there but it had dissappeared.  the weird thing is before i went to bed i was standing at the end of my house smoking before i went to bed and looked out the large window at the end of my house. the time was about 12:45 and i noticed the same  light much closer but on the east side instead of the north. i was shocked on how close the object was but i couldn't make out the shape of it.  i went to wake up my brother to show him so i didn't feel crazy it took me about 1 min by the time we got back the object was gone. i watched this object for about 10 min and it never moved. it made me a bit weirded out

leaving a friend's house.  due to limited parking in the area (near the intersection of university dr. & texas ave. in college station, tx) we had to walk about 50 yards down the street to reach the truck.  near the vehicle there was no street light, which may have been the only reason that we saw anything at all.\r\n     as we approached the back of the truck i remember looking up into the sky, and seeing a dark triangle crossing the sky in a north-by-northwesterly direction.  it seemed to be more at the altitude of a helicopter than a plane, though i admit it is dificult to judge the size and speed of even a common commerical aircraft in daylight, much less at night.  that aside it certainly appeared to be moving slower than any aircraft i had ever seen.  of course the appearance of it was the most intriguing.  it was a triangle with lighted points, each seeming to be of a slightly different shade(light blue, yellow, light green).  the color aspect was very faint but the points of light were quite clear.  the body of the object, the triangle, was black against the night sky.  when it moved in front of a star it covered it up, signaling its shape.  in the center was a glowing mass, also of a faint color.  it seemed grayish, and was more perceptible when not looked at directly, much in the same way one might observe a comet, taking advantage of the placement of rods & cones in the eye.  i remember being able to percieve some sort of pattern, a curving set of lines, similar to that of a volleyball, in the surface of this shperical glowing mass.\r\n    after taking a good look at this object, i looked down and across the bed of the truck at eric who was standing on the other side.  he was also looking up.  i asked, \"are you looking at what i'm looking at?\"  after a few seconds of disbelief i asked him to describe what he was seeing to make sure i wasn't just imagining it.  we were both seeing the same thing.  i came around to his side of the truck and we continued watching the craft moving nxnw.  we went into great detail describing what we saw to each other, and at one point we both asked each other, \"should we be seeing this?\", perhaps just a little frightened but thrilled as well.  after a few minutes of intense examination, the craft which had been moving to a point parrallel to our position came directly east of us, although several miles out. it then changed direction and began to hea due east, gaining in both altitude and speed in a smooth but very drastic rate.  within just a few seconds of its change of course and speed it was out of sight.\r\n     we lingered fr a few moments hoping to see something more, but that was the end of our sighting.  we spent the rest of that evening and several more days discussing it with our friends.  i remember feeling such a bizzare sense of excitement through the whole thing.  i do not offer any explanation of what we saw only the observations of that night.\r\n","distance":"Over

do, i looked up to check out the sky.  it was cloudy directly above me but was only 50% cloudy (cumulus) with big breaks in between clouds. in the breaks between the clouds the sky was clear and i could see the stars very well. when i looked up i saw a round dim-lighted area in the clouds resembling a searchlight hitting the clouds.  then i noticed it was flashing, at the time it was a consistant flash (one second on, one second off)but was inconsistent at times, too.  i was still wondering why a searchlight would be on so late and then it got to the edge of the cloud and was in the clear.  i was surprised though that it still appeared to be a round flashing cloud (pea-sized at arms length).  it was now in the middle of a clear sky with no clouds coming.  that's when i decided to get a better look at it.  i stepped inside and grabbed my binoculars that i keep in a cupboard right inside the door.  this took less then 5 seconds and when i stepped back out there were swirls of clouds covering it.  these clouds had a cirrus look but had a defined outer edge (multi-curved)and washed out like a smear toward the flashing cloud.  at this point i had to show someone so i went and woke two family members.  they came out and at this point it had moved to the next cloud blowing by.  the cloud it made was just dissapating but still visible.  my family saw what i had been seeing confirming that i'm not seeing thing's.  we watched it for another half hour.  it never moved more than six to eight inches (at arms length)never making a sound but continuing to flash.  after the half hour it went behind a cloud and we lost track of it.  twenty or so seconds passed and i heard a low whooshing sound that lasted about ten seconds.  after a couple of minutes of no sign of it my family went back to bed.  i stayed outside and about 20 minutes later i saw it again.  this time it was not flashing and was hiding on the edges of the clouds until the cloud moved a distance and then it would meander to the next cloud coming.  i saw this with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  it was still visible because a circle sticks out againt a backdrop of blurry shapes.  anyway i watched it jump clouds for about five more minutes until it disappeared again.  i continued looking for it and about a minute later i heard the whooshing sound to my left (west).  looking up i saw what appeared to be typical faa lights of a plane/jet at about the same altitude as what i was watching but a few miles away.  i looked through my binoculars at the lights and could only see lights, no craft.  then it either turned off it's lights or took off because i took down the binoculars and it was nowhere to be seen.\r\n     i don't know what i saw but it was definately some sort of craft.  i live about ten-fifteen miles away from selfridge angb and witnessed what i believe to be four black manta tr3a's (another bizarre occurance)back in '94 so i do leave the possibility open to it being a black project.\r\n\r\nps:  it just so happens i contacted mufon the previous night before for the first time ever.  it was in regard to information on a nationally broadcast sighting from the nineties.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

whoosh (no engine noise) approx. 100ft above me and 100ft to the north traveling about 40 miles an hour from east to west, a satin black rectangular craft with rounded sides,not angular.  i decided not to try to run for the camera as i could not return in time. a little scared i looked in the windows to see if something was looking at me.  there was not.  i have not really thought about it since,though it is as clear as yesterday.  i watched a ufo tv show and decided to share my account.  i remember that planes in 1962 all made noise, and were not black!  at the time i thought it might be a gov. spy craft from fort riley near juction city ks. the craft was incredibly close, looked like a cigar box shape but all smoothly rounded no sharp corners anywhere and approx.12-15ft high (top to bottom of craft).  so quiet!","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line
