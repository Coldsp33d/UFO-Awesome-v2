was a few years ago, but i can remember pretty clearly that night. we were on camp fire on a field just outside the city. i was lying on my back checking out the stars, looking for satellites and meteors, when i saw -coming from north-west - a group of three bright dots moving with a constant speed and direction towards south-east. the dots were arranged in the shape of an isosceles triangle (group 1, as pictured in my sketch). i pretty quickly ruled out the aircraft theory - i happen to be an amateur astronomer and an aviation fan and i know an aircraft when i see it, no matter if it's night or day. i watched as the starry triangle passed above us and eventually dissapeared near the horizon. the other guys weren't impressed by the sighting, but i considered it at least nice, if not thought provoking. the pass took, from the moment i discovered the dots, about one or two minutes, but i might be wrong since i was quite hyped. soon after that i spotted another two bright dots (group 2), this time coming from north and heading south. they appeared to have the same altitude and speed as the previous ones. i thought they were satellites. the speed and size was similar to the orbital satellites i spotted over the years, but i've never saw such groups. then i thought they maybe were debris, or some shuttle mission docking to the international space station, adding modules or whatever. at that time i ran out of scientific explanations and, altough being a skeptic, i made room for some other possibility.\r\n\r\nadditional notes: \r\n* at the time of the sighting i could not have checked on internet if there was a scheduled shuttle mission or some other space activity that might have appeared to ground viewers as stated above.\r\n* the triangle wasn't filled/solid since i could see the background stars between its bright dots.\r\n* the dots in the sketch and the distances between them are bigger than the originals.\r\n\r\nrequest: i'd like to know your opinion about this event. thank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

fun day, everyone had a good time. we finally made it home around 7:30pm so my kids could pack up their sleeping bags as they were invited to stay the night. i had a quick bowl of noodles, the kids had eaten mcdonalds earlier, and later arrived at my friend���s house around 8:15pm. \r\nas i stood in the driveway talking with my friend my kids took their things into the house. soon, her two kids and my two kids came out of the house and were now on their skate boards in the driveway. i had my camera with me as earlier i had taken pictures of the kids at the skate park. as i stood their talking with my friend i began to take more pictures of the kids doing tricks on their skateboards in her driveway and also of the sunset. \r\nlater, after the kids had gone in the house, at about 8:46pm my batteries had died. (the reason i know this time is because of the last picture i had taken before the camera shut itself off. all my pictures have the time and date on them.) anyway, i had extra batteries in my car which was parked a couple feet away. i sat in the drivers seat behind the steering wheel as i replaced my batteries. i told my friend something strange had happened, then showed her when i replaced the batteries the camera said \"set date and time?\", the date read 01/01/2005 and the time read, 0:00. i thought it odd, and so did she, so i reset everything and talked with her as i took a few more pictures to see if my camera was ok���and it was. \r\nit was now around 9:20pm and i was sitting in my car with the engine running getting ready to head home. my friend was standing at the driver���s window and we were talking when she said���\"what is that?���what is that?\" and i said what? she was now pointing to the southwest and said��� \"get out of your car and look!\" i knew from her tone she was seeing something. i quickly grabbed my camera off the front seat, open the door, stepped out and looked to where she was pointing. sure enough, in the southwest part of the sky, not only was there sirius and a plane, but there was a glowing ball of gold light moving east. i was standing in her driveway facing south watching this thing. between me and this ball of gold light were many tall elm trees, and beyond those were a row of very tall pine trees which lined her neighbor���s driveway along with a barn, a horse trailer, and a house. this gold light went behind the pine trees still heading east while i ran to the front of my car to get a better view because i knew there were large gaps between the trees over that way. when i got to the front of my car, now standing next to her shed, i turned my camera on and watched as that ball of light appeared to have stopped, and was now heading straight towards us getting bigger, and bigger. as it was getting closer i yelled \"it���s coming straight at us!\" i tried to get pictures and watch this thing at the same time. as it got closer it was now an oblong shape of gold light through the gap in the trees, and as it got closer yet it was brighter than ever and changing shape, and then when it lifted, and veered west i could see the underneath! it was a triangle! there were so many circular lights underneath it! i couldn't believe it! i said��� \"it���s a triangle! oh my god it���s huge! look how big it is! that thing is huge!\" and it was! this thing was massive! it could have easily covered her entire house. by the time this thing had hit the second gap in the trees i could see all the lights underneath it! it was so close to us! there were so many circular lights all along the underneath! there were long tube lights in the center of the round lights and towards the end of those was a circular red, haze! the sound coming from this thing���the only thing i can think of is my husband���s welding torch after he lights it. the gas sound along with the flame when he turns it up. \r\nlike i said, i���m trying to watch this and take pictures at the same time. at this point my camera was in the red, it was almost exhausted of all battery power. i couldn���t believe it! i had just put in newly charged batteries. this thing now went behind the trees again heading west. i wanted to see more of it! i took off running towards the end of her driveway (west) as her neighbors were pulling into their driveway. i was now standing at the end of her driveway but i couldn���t see it. i yelled back to her because she was still standing in the same place��� \"where is it!? where did it go!?\" she yelled��� \"get down here! it���s over here!\" i ran back down the driveway and that���s when she informed me that as i was running up the driveway this thing had turned its course again, and was now heading east, then disappeared over the tree line behind her neighbor���s house. \r\ni stood out there for a long time looking for it, hoping it would come back. i wanted see more, i wanted to know more. my friend was now on the phone with her neighbors who had also seen it as they were driving down the road towards their house, and as they were pulling into their driveway. \r\nafter a while, when i realized it wasn���t coming back, i went home. i went to bed with a headache starting, and woke up with a terrible migraine. i have had the migraine all day now. i went over to her house again this afternoon to pick up my kids and stayed a while as she told me of how she called the sheriffs office and reported it, and how she spoke with her neighbors again. just before i left her house i began to feel sick to my stomach. i came home and threw up around 5:00pm it is now 8:43pm saturday evening and i still feel sick to my stomach and i still have the migraine. the extra strength excedrin i took today didn���t work. \r\ni took 4 pictures all together. the one i was hoping turned out was when it was lifted upwards and veered to the west, but that picture only showed black. i don't understand why that one didn't turn out. this photo did turn out, but not as good as it should have.

were over desert and it was just before we got into california(according to my mom).So im starring out my window and all the sudden i see this light above the clouds barely moveing.At first i thought it was a helicpoter or a firework.Then i realized it was far to high for either,even higher than the clouds.So i pointed it out to my mom and right as i turned back it was moving.With red and blue lights going round and round.It wasnt going that fast,but then what convinced us that it was out of the norm was when it just took off.Like nothing me or mother had ever seen.And we had seen a fighter jet earlier that flight.But this was soo much faster and just took off.\r\nwe later on thought that it could have been a reflection,but even the clouds below had a faint red and blue light on them as it dissapered.\r\nso we our sure that what we have seen isnt of this world,or possibly not of our knoledge.\r\nryan n.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sheriff assigned to the yucca valley station and had finished work about 2am.  i lived in the san bernardino area and it took me about an hour or so to drive the distance home.  i was south bound on hwy 247 that extends from the 10 freeway to yucca valley/morongo valley area just prior to the palm springs offramp.\r\nthe night was dark with no moon, i remember saying to myself how dark the desert road was and just stared out into my headlights as i drove along.\r\ni was about half way between the small hills below morongo valley and the 10 freeway on hwy 247, when all of a sudden everything turned into daylight, i was able to see the surrounding desert terrain for about 100 yards in all directions, its was like the sun came up suddenly.  as quick as the lights came on they went out again and everything seemed darker than before.\r\n\r\ni was traveling about 60 mph, but had slowed down when the place lite up.  i glanced to my right and observed a huge object i will call a craft for no better words to describe it.  the craft was traveling parallel to my vehicle, i slowed down almost to a stop, the craft almost appeared sort of cigar shaped with bluish-green lighting along the side i was observing.  i completely stopped my vehicle and stepped out into the darkness and noted the craft was huge, about 100 plus meters long and was hovering above the ground.  i didn't note any landing type gear or hear engine noise.  the object was about 50 meters away from my location at that time.\r\nas i was watching the craft i noticed it was actually moving directly away from me across the desert toward some small hills.  when the craft got approx. a quarter to half mile away it turned in an upward motion and i discovered it wasen't long like a cigar, but oval like a disc, i could see the bluish-green lights around the exterior of the craft.\r\nthe craft seemed to move effortlessly, i never noticed any exhust system.\r\nas i stood and watched the craft from the bottom view, all of a sudden it turned toward the southwestern sky and left so quickly the only way i can describe its departure is that if i blinked my eyes it flew off that fast leaving a light type trail for only a second something like when you wave a flashlight through the night and you see that quick flash of trailing light.\r\ni remember just standing in the dark along that highway sort of dumbfounded.  i was never scared or threatened by the craft, but i would sure like to take another close up look at it.\r\ni served in special forces, i was in intelligence, i had a top secret crypto security clearance, i observed up close the american spy plane flying out of south vietnam in 1968, iam a retired police officer, but never in my life did i ever experience something like what i observed in november 1979 along a darkened desert road, i only wish someone could have been with me.  i never really told people about what happened because i felt they would laugh at me or something.  i did check with local law enforcement and watched the local papers to see if anything had been reported the following few days, but to my knowledge nothing was reported.  thank you","distance":"21-100

which looks out onto a small cove  of lake norman. it was almost dark and we noticed a bright light shining into the den as we were talking, like a strong beam of light. we looked out the half closed blinds & saw a large, oval spaceship type of object that had a series of lights on the exterior, some of them were colored i think. we all went outside in the yard. it was hovering over the mariner villas condominiums right across the cove. it was crystal clear from the moment we saw it that it was not of this earth. this \"spaceship\" was close enough, & low enough that we could see a lot of detail. it was enormous. it appeared to be glowing from the inside, & had a misty appearance; it didn't look really heavy but was solid. i was extremely excited as i have had a huge fear of ufo's since childhood. i basically ran around like a chicken w/ its head cut off. i did not know what to do. i called the local news network to see if there had been any reportings of a ufo on lake norman. they said no, which was surprising b/c they were so close to residences. i told them i was looking at something unexplainable, but they didn't really seem interested. it moved very slowly & from a distance there appeared in succession two or three more of these spaceships. my mom's friend was in awe & seemed to want to communicate with them. my sister was frightened & my mom was pretty calm. after about 15 minutes of watching my dad came home from work & we showed him. he was pretty impressed. by this time they were on their way, but had been moving at a snail's pace. they finally faded into the distance easily since it was getting dark. unfortunately we had no cameras w/ film to capture it, which i sorely regret to this day. i forgot about it for a few years (perhaps repressed) but it resurfaced in a conversation with my sister recently & i was able to recall what i saw. i have been haunted by it ever since & have no doubt in my mind that we are being visited.

sight.\r\n\r\nnext, around 10pm i saw 2 lights(spheres) come from the outer atmosphere(northeastern sky) looking like a star, then it slowed down, and turned west/southwest at a constant speed over the tree lines.  seconds later, the second one did the same exact thing.  lights where amber.\r\n\r\nlastly,  i saw a ufo just miss colliding with a jet airliner.  both were flying in a northernly direction , while both were flying closer and closer to each other. when i believe the jet finally saw the ufo, they were 10 to 15 seconds from hitting, when the jet banked to the northeast.\r\n\r\nthis ufo was a square shape, with 4 lights in each corner. red, amber, green, and rose.  2 of the lights flashed like strobes.  in the center of the bottom of the square was a light
