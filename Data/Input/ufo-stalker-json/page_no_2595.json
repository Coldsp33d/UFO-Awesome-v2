stretching out to the horizon.  with little pollution \r\nhere, the view is often splendid.  tonight there is almost a clear sky, with \r\nonly a bank of low lying thick cloud on the south west horizon.\r\ni don't smoke in the house, so i go to the balcony for a smoke and every \r\ntime i do, i have a good look around for unusual lights in the sky, or \r\nwhatever and until tonight i had not spotted anything unusual.  at about \r\n23.30 hours i went again for a smoke and a peek and as i opened the door i \r\nsaw some bright lights in the distance that caught my eye.  there were many \r\nwhite lights and one red blinking light in the centre, so naturally i \r\nassumed it was an airplane.  i then started thinking that was an odd route \r\nfor a big plane to take, there is no international airport in reykjavik, but \r\n50 km away in keflavik and even if the flightpath is over the city, they \r\nhave reached such an altitude by then, they go unnoticed below.  the next \r\nthing i notice, is that the lights are over the sea, far from the city and \r\nmoving in what seemed a slow flight, either towards me, or away.  then it \r\nstruck me, that the distance between the lights would mean that this thing \r\nwas huge, so i ran back inside to get my binoculars and rushing back to the \r\nbalcony, was just able to see with my bare eyes how the lights lowered and \r\ndisappeared into, or behind the cloudbank in the southwest.\r\ni spent many years as a sailor and learned to judge distances of weather \r\nfronts, as neccessity demands.  this cloudbank is at least 50 km away, \r\nprobably more like 75 km and as i stated lowlying.  so standing there with \r\nmy mouth agape in astonishment i quickly calculated that the object had to \r\nbe almost as big as the city.\r\nmy sceptical mind tried to come up with other explanations, but the distance \r\nof the cloud bank cannot be disputed by many km and therefor i write you \r\nthis short report.  yes the red light in the centre blinked pretty much as \r\nyou would expect a commercial airliner to do, but the distance simply does \r\nnot compute to that explanation.  end of report.","distance":"Over One

what he was looking at outside, and he said he wasn't sure.  this drew me outside, so we both sat on the bench and watched this object, about the size of a small plane at a short distance away.  at first i thought it was indeed a small plane which was traveling straight away from us, since i didn't see any movement, but after my eyes adjusted to the darkness, i could see that it was hovering almost like a pendulum, going slowly side to side and occasionally up and down.  it had twinkling/pulsating reddish lights.\r\n\r\ni'm familiar with what stars, planets, and satellites look like, but this thing did not appear to be like any of them, nor was it any kind of tower.  i made sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me (i was completely sober, too). the object made no noise, and it appeared almost like someone was dangling it from the sky, suspended over the land or the nearby lake and twinkling brightly.  that first night, it stayed twinkling for about 15 minutes (we don't know  how long it had been there before my son spied it), and gradually the lights faded out, one by one.  he claims he saw the exact type of object when fishing last summer over another lake (we now live near a different lake, 20 miles to the east of that one).  \r\n\r\nlast night, on a whim, i went out back and saw the same object again, doing the same thing, twinkling/moving/hovering slowly, and it was still there when i went to bed. i even walked to a different spot among the trees where lights wouldn't impede my viewing, and it was as bright as the brightest twinkling star, only with a reddish cast.  my son said he had seen it the previous night while he was fishing.\r\n\r\nso these are several sightings, over the course of a year or so by my son, and just this month for me.  we've only noticed it around 11:00 or so, and my son sees it around 2 am when he's out fishing.  i'd like to know what the heck it is so i can get a decent night's sleep.\r\n\r\nit doesn't make sense to take a

number provided around 8:40 pm mdt. i stated who i was and why i was calling and sylvia began to recount what she and her roommate, rebecca, had observed the night before. i found both women to still be excited over what they had seen and eager to tell me about their shared experience. here is a summary of what i learned from the pair. hereafter the case has been assigned to fi cheryl gantz for a more thorough onsite investigation, to which both witnesses have agreed.\r\n\r\nthe women were returning home to fort collins after spending some time in estes park, colorado, when sylvia, the passenger in the vehicle, noticed a bright object in the western night sky that she characterized as brighter than a commercial aircraft's lights and changing color from red to blue/green. shortly into her description of the object she began to eliminate a number of natural and man-made possibilities including a bright star and planets as well as a plane/jet/helicopter as likely explanation for what she was viewing. she described the object's motions from two perspectives 1) while riding in an automobile and 2) having stopped and stepped outside the vehicle to observe the object from a fixed position. at various times she and her roommate both indicated that the object had moved in vertical as well as horizontal movements over a roughly 45 minute period. the location from which they attained their best viewing was from horsetooth reservoir, just west of fort collins, colorado. the speed of its motions were described as being variable, sometimes rapid, sometimes more leisurely. both noted that when commercial aircraft flew into the area that the object under observation would descend. of note, sylvia only mentioned that she had observed a smaller \"ball-shaped\" object in the vicinity of the larger object but provided few details. this may be due to the fact that she was unhindered by driving provided that my memory remains accurate on that point. each witness expressed excitement and feeling overwhelmed at what they had observed the night before and it was still present in their voices over the phone. i found each to be starightforward in their recounting of the previous night's events and at this point have no reason to doubt their sincerity. both witnesses reported that they lost sight of the object as it appeared to fade and drop below a mountain that was their horizon.\r\n\r\nduring the course of her account sylvia also volunteered that on at least one occasion she was able to observe the reflection of a commercial aircraft in the reservoir as it passed overhead. however, she expressed feeling some confusion as to why, then, she was unable to view the reflection of the unidentified light above as well.\r\n\r\nboth witnesses claimed other people at the reservoir were observing the object from various points. including themselves, in all they tallied 9 witnesses; 2 people traveling by motorbike, 2 cars containing 2 adults each and 1 child. both sylvia and rebecca noted that the child showed excitement during the event.\r\n\r\nsylvia characterized the shape of the object as pyramid-shaped or a-shaped with concise edges. rebecca offered no information about the object's appearance other than the same red/green/blue. \r\n\r\nrebecca reported leaving estes park around 10:30 pm mdt on august 16, 2006, and both generally agreed that the beginning of their observations began around 11:30 pm mdt until roughly 12:15 am mdt on august 17.\r\n\r\nethan rich\r\nfi, ssd\r\ncolorado mufon director, investigations\r\naugust 17, 2006

i would say it was about 50-200 feet in the air. it did not make any erratic manuvers nor did it have any lights and seemed to not be powered by any engines. there was no smoke or exhaust of any kind

haven't seen one. that is till saturday.A perfect night, no haze, no clouds and the humidity was down.Stars were a plenty.This disc shaped thing was like a bulls eye target. center was pinkish, next ring faded to a yellow, and the outer ring was orange.Guessing the height at about 10,000 ft i would say it was \r\ntraveling very fast;maybe as much as 10,000mph. not as fast as a meteor but a lot faster then a satalite(which is higher) \r\nit was traveling straight south by southwest and in a hurry. it was not bright at all. just seemed as though the inside lights were shining through the outer skin.Only lasted about 3-4 seconds and went behind my house, out of sight. it clearly was not a spotlight. it was not an airplane. it had no outer lights and left no trail or sound. nothing.I sent this report before, but got no response. after all these years of watching, and i finally saw something. i'm 67 years old and i am not looking for publicity or anything. no one came and took me aboard, and i've never seen an alien. i was wondering if there were any other reports from indy folks about this? the whole thing looked as though it was behind a shower curtain or something. sort of blury yet i could make out what i discribed.If you extend your arm out and look at your thumbnail, it was about that size.A few minutes later we did see some meteorites fly over fast as a zip. this was not traveling that fast.If it was 10,000 feet up we're talking about an object the size of a 747.\r\nplease respond and let me know if anyone else saw this thing. thanks ron","distance":"Over One

hall interviewed in '05 ,that i made the connection of this event. as a matter of fact ,i had thought my mind was playing tricks on me (i do have a good memory) so i lately had to delve back into my memory to recall all detials of this event. i was able to recall all details prior ,durring and after this (occured on a new moon in may '90) . so, after emailing charles and finding out that one might be able to contact the talls by camping on blm land around indian springs, i went out and bought a 4wheel drive and headed to indian springs. i found what i felt was a good place to camp and on only 2 occasion did i see tall activity. late one night thier scout craft approached me ,i signaled my light at it and called out hello tall whites ,please land ,i want to be your friend etc , the ship stopped and then went into reverse and hid in these low level clouds (in the direction of french pk). another night ,i saw 2 leviating talls towards the back area of cactus springs ,which is next to indian springs,on blm land.It was early in the evening around 930-10. the one landed and changed the brightness of its light ---to real bright, the other had it on low ,yet it decended down from the ridge top. they hung out there for about 15 minutes. i signaled and stayed put. the one danced around back there, it seemed to be enjoying itself,i felt. anyhow, the lights turned off,i couldnt see them, i started to hike thier way but it was too far to hike plus nothing going on anymore ,so i turned around. i had to learn the dirt road better anyhow ,since thier was a gulley that made it hard to hike all the way. there turned out to be a longer road to get there, i later camped there,but no more sightings occured. i gave up and became very frustrated trying to contact them,i might try another day. i definately believe that the talls are real and that they are around indian springs, but they must be alot more private then they were in the 60's. for one the afb has grown in size and population and thier are mp's 24-7 covering alot of ground. my guess is that the talls might be exiting out the back ,between warm springs and rachel??? or threw the town of mercury. \r\n\r\ni've

went out with her,sure that all it was were\r\nsome car lights or planes. what i saw i could'nt explain at all. \r\n  the next night we went back, this time i had my 15x70 binoculars. at a\r\nridgeline about one mile south of red rock canyon,(approx nine miles from\r\nmy location.)several lights were moving about the mountains. a bright one\r\nwould rise up then split into a number of dimmer lights,in daisey chain\r\nformations. the wind was blowing good and the 15x70s were hard to keep trained on this strange event.\r\n  being an amateur astronomer/tinkerer i rigged a tripod mount for my\r\nbino's,and a couple of nights ago, we went back. this time the show was\r\ndownright erie. clearly i could make out sauceresque forms, several bright\r\nships!? were moving behind the ridge casting a glowing pall, that back\r\nlit the foreground ridge. ocasionally one would rise up and over the crest\r\nand fragment into many, up to fifteen smaller components,always slightly\r\nangled always a dead straight line. this occurs due north of us, adding to this scene some would aproach the main body, from the west, or east, or\r\nappear out of nowhere glowing brightly then split into a new daisey chain\r\n  a good number seemed to scan and comb the desert floor a good deal closer to us. appearing out of the dark darting and weaveing then going \r\ndark again. the play of lights between these and the main body seemed to me like semiphore. at certain points those in the hills dashed a span of\r\nthree or four degrees in one or two seconds, i don't know how fast that is\r\nbut at a distance of nine miles, seems a good clip.\r\n  we watched this for a good two hours with no sign of a let up. the crazy\r\npart is i bet they will be there again tonight, and again tomarrow.

walking up the stairs. this person had a hat and sunglasses on, yet something wasn't right with the way he was walking or climbing the stairs. it looked like he was stuck in mud,his knees sorta came out to the side as he tried raising his feet to take the next step. i noticed also that there were about 3 more that looked just like him at the top of the stairs,yet some taller. they all were skinny,tall,and i recall noticing thier whitish like hair that seemed to shimmer as if light was bouncing off it ,i had never seen hair like this before . my reaction at the time was what a freak ,i

on the mullinstream road.  i stopped at a spot that i knew had lots of moose and was sitting there before the sun came up. it was an overcast day with high clouds. there was a slight northwesterly breeze as there was a tall tree (still with leaves) just behind where i was parked.  just about the time when i could actually see within the treeline i noticed an object rise above the treeline at about a few kilometers (estimated). my first thought that it was a helicopter.  i observed the object as it ascended into the air and i could distictly make out that it was moving away from me at about a thirty degree angle.  it proceeded on it's trajectory for about a minute, or so it seemed, and then it stopped and turned towards me.  at this point it was about a forty five degree angle from the horizon. i watched this thing approach and remember telling myself that it had no sound.  it was close enough that if it were the helicopter that i thought that it was that i would have heard it by now.  as it got yet closer to my postion i got the idea to put my rifle scope on it so as to get a better look at it.  it passed directly overhead and i made no sound what-so-ever. i watched the object pass over me through my scope and could clearly see that is was triangular in shape and that it had five lights on it.  the point of the object had a blue light and the four remaining lights were orange with no markings on the rear end of it.  i can also remember thinking that i should take a shot at it but decided against such action...Out of fear of what might happen....Lol.  i watched the object go pass me until i could not see it any longer with the naked eye, which was about a twenty minute duration.  by the way it seemed to me that it was dark grey in color (almost like charcoal) and the thing made absolutely no sound what-so-ever.  this is an honest account of what i saw that morning and i didn't tell anyone for quite some time...For fear of ridicule.  this is my story of what i witnessed on my hunting trip.\r\n\r\njames denny jr.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
