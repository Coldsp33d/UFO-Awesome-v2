Hatteras","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Four red lights\r\n\r\nwhile in the us navy in the summer of 1986, i was standing lookout aboard the uss edenton ats 1 (currently decommissioned).  the lookout watch, stood outside on top the bridge of the ship, and was responsible for reporting all contacts seen both in the water and sky.  it was around eleven p.M. one clear night at sea, located about fifty miles off the coast of cape hatteras, nc.  during one of my scans of the night sky, out of know where, four red circular lights appeared.  the lights where hundreds of yards apart from each other and formed a square.  at first, i thought it was four separate air craft, such as, military helicopters because the lights were stationary; however, due to the distance from the ship, the lights where too large to be aircraft running lights.  there were also no other normal running lights like green and white, which make-up the normal outline of an aircraft seen at night.  the lights where located about twenty degrees above the horizon and about a mile away from the ship.  again, these four red lights were each about the size of a small plane, which were very bright and visible in the night sky.  the night sky was also clear, moon lit, and a moderate amount of stars were visible, which also aided in calculating the distance and size of these lights.  as stated, when i first saw these lights they were all stationary in the sky and appeared out of know where.  once i noticed that these were not normal lights, grouped in a square and not moving, i called down to the bridge over a salt and pepper line informing the conning officer of a possible ufo sighting.  this brought laughter across the wire at first, but i relayed the contact again in a stern but excited voice, which succeeded in getting the bridge officers attention.  after relaying the contact information a second time, the four lights, in a flash, darted towards the horizon amazingly fast.  the lower two lights in the square went first, with the top two lights following directly behind them in a curved swooshing motion and there was no sound. then all four shot straight up into outer-space and out of sight, all within a split second.  at this point, i felt very excited and shocked, and was personally praying someone on the bridge had seen what i just saw.  having been an avid watcher of the night sky, seen shooting stars and a believer in that life has to exist somewhere out there, i become even more excited because i knew, i just saw my first unidentified flying object(s).  to my amazement, when i returned to the bridge after my watch, i was very pleased to learn that the conning officer and everyone else on the bridge had seen this sighting and logged it into the ship���s log as a ufo sighting.  next, after a half hour had passed since the sighting, the radiation detection system (gamma roentgen meter) on the bridge started making a loud clicking sound. at first, no one seemed to know what was making this sound then a very loud bell went off notifying us as to what was going on, we were being radiated.  when the instrument stopped clicking, it indicated we had taken a hit of 385 roentgens in the period of about one minute.  at this point, the captain of the ship was awoken and called to the bridge, as well as the chief in charge of the radiation metering equipment onboard ship.  the captain was not impressed with an entry of a ufo sighting being placed in the ship���s log, and at first, took the roentgen meter as being defective.  however, the chief informed the captain that the meter had been serviced and calibrated the day before and that other like meters throughout the ship had just gone off indicating the same amount of roentgens received as the bridge.  the captain stated not to log the instance concerning the radiation exposure and left the bridge.  during the rest of my watch duty that night, no officer or enlisted person spoke of what happened, and also acted liked nothing happened.  this experience, however, was etched into my memory as if it happened yesterday and i have told this story to only a few people, people who i thought would believe me.  this is also the first time i have documented the events of this night.\r\n  \r\nin conclusion, as an indication of the strength of gamma radiation, i and others received that night; all the personnel during the project trinity experiments conducted in 1945 at ground zero, only received between 1 and 6 total roentgens of gamma radiation.  this leads me to believe, we traveled through the wake of radiation produced by the ufos seen thirty minutes earlier. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ufo's(the subject always seems to come up when we're outdoors & the night sky is clear)& we started scanning the sky. we only saw the usual airplanes & helicopters that we're so used to because we lived so close to the airport so i told my brother i was going to bed because i had to work the next day. he said he was going to stay out a bit longer & that he would come tell me if he saw something. about ten minutes later he comes in & tells me to go out & see some lights that were acting kind of funny, but i told him to make sure it was something good, so he comes back in about ten minutes later & says that i should really take a look. i put some shoes & a shirt on & went out to see what it was. we were out there looking around for a couple minutes when we see these two lights that resembled those of an airplane, but as we continued to watch(i keep saying \"we\" because after everything happened i drilled my bro about what he saw & it matched what i had seen)they seemed alittle odd. as they got closer we noticed they were'nt blinking or anything, so we kept watching. when the lights got close enough to where they were about an inch & a half apart, which is where an airplane would be visible to us being in that area so close to the airport, they instantly turned into one light directly in the middle. my brother & i were like \" what the *%$@, did you see that?\". well, the light just kept on coming & when it was about the size of a dime & almost directly over us it went out like someone hit a light switch. but we kept looking, then we saw what it really was. it was a silent, transparent ship flying over us! there was this weird sensation & this sort of hum, kinda of like power lines make but it was more like a feeling than sound. scared the crap out of us because it was so low that i felt i could have hit it if i would have chucked a rock at it, & it was flying at about the speed of a blimp, not to mention that we had never seen anything like it except in the movies. while it was flying over us we could see an outline of the ship but we could also see the stars right through it! man, if there was only a machine that could playback memories! it was the shape of a bullet but flat on the bottom & tall, no wings. it had two fins on the top rear section & like this jet booster type thing in the back, which like i said, made no noise & didn't emit any light. it was weird man, i could see the outline of one of the fins through the other & the stars through it all! as it flew over us we both kind of shrinked back as if it would see us if we did't. it continued over us going from north to south & as it started to pass my moms house it turned back to one light, then alittle further it turned back into two lights like it had began. after that it dipped down towards the horizon so we couldn't see over my moms house anymore & we were already across the street. so as we start walking back across the street, we see it zooming towards the airport which is east of us, then instantly it starts zooming west faster than i have ever seen anything fly before. after that we didn't see it anymore, but we stood up for about two hours talking & looking. like i said before, afterwards i drilled my brother & we both saw the same thing. my heart was pounding through the whole experience. i've had other sightings as well, but that was one of the longest & closest ever. hope this info helps in any way possible. i am also after the truth.

visit relatives in california, it was my dad,brother,step mom,& two step sister's. i stayed up the whole way because we made it a plan to stop in marfa tx to see the mysterious lights.  well it was 4:00 am and we were at the viewing point right before u get into marfa tx. we all got off our suburban and there were very few so called,(mysterious lights out). i had been passed there about 4 years before. well it got boring so i suggested that we just hit the road, i was sitting in the middle row of the suburban looking out the left door window when we pulled out i stayed looking out towards the mountains looking at the (mysterious lights) still. and as i was gazing the whole range out of no where i noticed  two lights blinking at just 1 pulse both lights at the same time just like a plane parallel the lights were,low it looked like it was floating very slowly. and i then said out loud \"look, check that out is that a plane\". but i had a feeling it wasnt because i'v never seen an airplane move that slow. then my dad and i were both looking out driving when i noticed it had raised way higher in the sky and thats when the third light came on and all three lights started flashing (like strobing) these light were in the shape of a triangle. when it started to flash eratically i told my dad  to stop so we could record it on video camera and i was the one who was recording. as i was recording one car did pass by looking out too, driving, by really slow. these triangular lights stayed flashing for about 20 mins, i recorded my first time about 10 to 12 mins and then my father said lets just go so we left i was still trying to record while we were driving , but we told my dad that this was rare to see something like this we had to stop to see what else it would do. so we stopped again and i started recording again and i noticed that it had rotated while we were driving the first recording i remembered seeing 2 lights at the bottom and one at the top, the second time i got down to record i noticed it was the other way around. during this whole expearience i was thinking of how nobody was going to believe me, during the whole recording i was saying its a f****** ufo this is crazy, and then we had enough seen enough to know so we got back in the suburban and hit the road again and about half 3/4ths a mile it decended back to the way i had seen it the first time very low and the 3rd light was like it was never there. the object drifted or floated the opposite way for a long ways we drove a couple of miles and when i looked back i could still see the two lights smaller of course   but they were still flying our skies. when we got to california we showed our family my older cousins the video there was one good frame where u paused the video and u could see 3 white lights like a triangle. well my dad took the girls to disney land and the girls recorded over the 20 mins of footage. i would of put the video on this website i am very upset.

here's one for your books...\r\n\r\ni was about 13.5 years old and had snuck out of the house late at night armed with eggs and chinese stars and wearing dark sweats.  my goal was to sneak across the empty lot at the corner of overview and curtis to valley view cove to egg the house of my foe.\r\n\r\ni made my way across the yard and hid behind the stone mailbox of the house next door to our house (3708 curtis).  there is streetlight there and i wanted to check to make sure no cars were coming from any direction.  \r\n\r\nwith the coast clear, i then stepped forward towards the edge of the street.  that���s when this ball of light zipped up the hill (curtis) and stopped in front of me. \r\n\r\nthe ball: it was a spherical soft white, swirling sort of mist with no definite outer enclosure. it had a translucent tail that chased up the hill and caught up to it after it stopped.  it was brighter towards the center of the ball.\r\n\r\ni had about 1 second to view the object, about enough time to feel the most fear i have ever felt.  it then zoomed off to the right leaving a tail that soon chased it all the way down the street and then taking a hard left on carmel and out of sight.  the whole time it maintained a level distance above the street. its speed was about 200mph.\r\n\r\ni ran back inside my house and soon became interested in weather phenomena.  what is even more stunning is that i saw it one more time in the middle of the day that following weekend while hanging my head out of the upstairs bathroom window.  it stopped in front of our mailbox too (after stopping at the neighbors again) and it looked the same only not as bright in the day.  it was scary to see it from a distance and know that i had been right next to it in that exact spot.\r\n\r\ni finally brought the story up at dinner and my father made fun of me. my brother spoke up saying that he had seen it while looking out of the front window by the front door. it had stopped in front of the mailbox.  he said he hid a closet for a long time, but never saw it again and neither did i.\r\n\r\nperhaps other folks in the neighborhood have seen it over the years, or perhaps people who lived there back then saw it. it seems likely. perhaps it was an unidentified form of life and feeding or maybe it was an electrical phenomenon following an underground electrical line.\r\n\r\nit could have been a ufo probe mapping out the subdivision development.  what sucks is that i do not know what it was, but i do know that i saw it and that it was real.  it is the sort of thing that makes a person feel really, really small.\r\n\r\nin summary, i���d suggest focusing your efforts on why as opposed to what.  if there is alien life around us, they are lurking about for a reason.  maybe they are deep in the ocean mining out resources we don���t even know we need for our own development.  but we should be glad that we are still alive as a race if alien life is among us.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":5241,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.5120051,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08152006-0002","longitude":-97.677646,"occurred":433753200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":433753200000,"summary":"A ball of light came up the hill and stopped in front of my face at arms length and then zoomed off!","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Round Rock, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:512938"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Spencer","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First was at family gathering 8-10 years old ant had binoculas so was looking around at clouds when i noticed a silver oval from west going east in and out of cloud over and over at least 4 times coundn't even get adult's to look.   years lster around 13i and a freind were out side at night (alway's were) we noticed lites from western skies seem yo apear and move 20 30 sec. to eastern side then disapeer over 21 times . a little freeky we thought so we grab our beebe guns we stated to walk to his aunts house a few blocks away through empty lot walking west when a very intence hair standing up on the back of my neck feeling as i turned my head back a brite lite seemed fairly low hard to tell alt. so fast i just followed it out of western hem.     what i saw when i was 8-10 i saw on tv a mexican news crew filmed exactly what i saw","distance":"501 Feet -

observation corps volunteer (skywatch). i do not drink nor take drugs which would interfere with my vision. i hesitated for several weeks to report this anamolous phenomenon because sky conditions have not been ideal -- thunderstorms and clouds, not to mention the urban light scatter that makes observations in atlanta difficult. however this sighting has repeated itself a dozen times in the last few weeks and i felt compelled to report it. in each occurance several hovering lights have been observed out of my bedroom window which faces almost due east. this view looks out on a main air traffic corridor in and out of atl (hartsfield-jackson international) and pdk (peachtree dekalb). on these evenings i would observe the normal comings and goings of the aircraft, with their landing lights, wing lights, strobes, etc. and what i observed was obviously not an aircraft. at first i thought they were stars but then i remembered there was a high overcast which covered the stars.  i would see one perhaps two lights hovering in position from just above the horizon, perhaps ten degrees, up to almost directly above. on one or two occasions the light would appear just after a flash like a strobe,   the lights, which varied from a reddish white to a bluish white, would remain stationary for thirty seconds to five minutes, then would fade and in their place a line of lights would appear, usually canted from the horizontal, like a wing making a turn, or sometimes three tiny red lights would appear in the same spot in the shape of a triangle, equilateral or isocoles, not sure, but sure it was regular.  then would morph back into a light and move quickly, probably too quickly for an aircraft, to the northwest or southwest and out of view directly across the flight patterns of two airports. it is extremely difficult to estimate altitude but would not be surprised if they were manuvering over fifty thousand feet. as i mentioned the cloud cover made it difficult to track them completely across the sky but the consistency of the pattern is remarkable. it did not seem to exhibit the flight characteristics of an airplane (unless a harrier jumpjet which is highly inprobable) or a helicopter or a satellite.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

right, then stopping and then accelarating in different directions, moving slightly again and stopping.  i then realized that i was witnessing something unusual.  i ran into the house and grabbed my camera and video taped the object for about :10 seconds.  the object was white, not metallic or silver.  bright white.  it also had a very peculiar appendage that jetted out from the bottom.  this appendage was clearly hooked and the appendage rotated intermittenly, as if propelling the object. no other way to explain it.  a friend commented that it looked like a white cat being hung by it's tail the way the appendage wiggled about (see photo). weird, i know, but that is what it looked like.  the object made no noise, but then again, it was very far off.  i would judge that this object were about 15,000 feet up and several miles away.  it was not windy at all outside.  i have attached 3 photos for your review.  in the video i shot, this object moves left to right in a south to north

might be a balloon, but it was very, very high and made very deliberate moves, stopping and starting again, with no wobble.  also, the hook like appendage that was moving!!!!  did anyone else see

hill. the porch faced east and south. it was near midnight. we were talking , when somebody said, \"look at that!\" i looked where they were pointing, which was toward the ski hill. there was a large blimp shaped object flying west to east, over the ridge, at about 200 feet above the ridge. i was approximately 200 feet long and 70-80 feet in diameter. it had a row of lights, or lighted windows, running along the horizontal axis. it was completely silent. as it passed, you could see a glowing tube in the back, going into the rear of the ship, glowing orange. it was apparently part of a propulsion system which may have been cooling off, not in use, or in use operating at a low thrust setting. i am not completely sure, but the windows may have been lights; my initial perception was that i could just barely make out rectangular windows and that there was an inside barely visible through the windows, but the sighting was less that 20 seconds, and then it was receding out of sight to the east. i said, \"let's follow it!\" and 4 of us raced up stairs to my car.(my apartment was down a set of stairs to a lower level above a creek). by the time we got to the car the craft was almost out of sight to the east and we were not able to keep up with it, and lost sight of it after driving only a half mile or so. i am glad we were unable to follow it, in retrospect. after returning to the house, we drew pictures of what we saw, and then showed them to each other. it was pretty enlightening to see the pictures were very similar. there was some discussion of windows or lights, but all saw lights and some saw them as lighted windows. we definately ruled out terrestrial blimps, and agreed we had seen a ufo.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

awoke about 12:50 a.M. i was 17 or 18 years old at the time of the event. i was lying in bed and at first i thought that the strobing lights were an indication that there was a storm on the way. so, i just went back to sleep. an hour later, i woke back up, feeling a little uneasy and queezy. i triied awaking my parents, but they eventually got very upset and scalded me for triing to get them out of bed. i then went throughout our house looking out toward each window, only to find just clouds in the sky, appearing to be over my house. the front living room windows was no lights what-so-ever. but turning my head toward the patio, (even with the shade down) was this strobing light. i was apprehensive to go toward the kitchen and so on. but i kept walking anyway. our house became colder, the deeper that i walked toward our back den door. i then became chilled, i lifted up the shade to the back door. and the lights were still going. i reached and touched the door knob,and felt chills up my spine. i ran back through my house (scared half to death) opened my bible, that had not been opened in months. the new book opened right up to psalm 91. i began reading my bible for the fist time (other than revelations) every night. i stayed awake for the rest of the night. the next week in my typing class, where my teacher always kept the daily paper. on the front page read: \"lights

hour. my kids were upstairs in their rooms and my husband was in his lazy boy next to me watching espn. my dog came into the living room straight to me and stared, wagging her tail. i set my laptop on the sofa cushion next to me and grabbed her leash by the door, taking her outside to go to the bathroom. as i shut the door behind me and got about half way to her tie out the full moon in the east grabbed my attention right away. it was beautiful!  i hooked her up, came inside, grabbed my camera and tripod, completely forgetting my laptop was on, went back out and set up in the drive way. i have a digital konica minolta dimage z6, 6.0 megapixels with a 12 x anti shake optical zoom. i live in the country so i have a pretty good view of the stars with no interference from city lights. i stood out there and managed to get 44 still shots of the moon and clouds altogether. at 10:19pm, as i was in the midst of taking the moon shots a light blast of cold air hit me from above. it wasn���t a normal breeze, this was a light blast of cold that hit the very top of my head traveling down to my feet. yes there was a slight breeze last night as i stood there and took the pictures of the moon, but this was different. it was cold and only lasted for a second. right away i looked straight up above me into the night sky. the only thing i could see were stars. there was nothing above me. i then noticed a small engine plane off in the distance coming from the east, heading towards my direction on the left side of the moon with a spotlight shinning at first to the north, then down onto the woods below it. i quickly reached down and grabbed my camera, tripod and all, and took a picture directly overhead of me where i felt the blast of cold air, where there were nothing but stars. then i looked to the east again and watched as the small plane made it���s way closer to me heading west, still spotlighting certain areas, including the sky. i took a couple of pictures of the plane, and watched it go out of view before going back to taking pictures of the full moon. later, when i came inside and downloaded my pictures i was stunned to see this image on the photo i had taken above my head where the cold air came from. where there was absolutely nothing in the sky but stars. as far as my dogs behavior, she was barking and pacing and breathing very fast a couple of different times during the entire time i was out. i remember this because it was so quiet out last night that when she did bark it startled me and i jerked the tripod, messing up on a couple of different shots of the moon. \r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nmichelle s.\r\n\r\n\r\n

my name is andrew maxwell and i am making this report to mufon on behalf of my mother, carla linton, 44, who described the details of her ufo encounter to me in person and over the phone. the encounter occurred at some date in late may 2006 (possibly the 31st), at approximately 10:30 p.M. atlantic canadian time, as descibed in the above form.\r\n\r\nmy mother lives in st. andrews, nb, about an hour and a half from where the ecounter occured. my brother rory linton, 14 years of age at the time of the encounter, is a hockey player on the aaa team the saint john seadogs (saint john is about an hour away from st. andrews). the seadogs play games and in tournaments all over the eastern seaboard of canada, and occasionally as far south as boston. to say that my mother and brother travel a lot is an understatement. on the night of their encounter, their travels had taken them to my home city of fredericton. they were leaving the city at the time of the encounter and first saw the ufo while driving back to st. andrews on the hanwell road just outside fredericton. the hanwell has little lighting and the skys are very clear at night, especially on nights where the moon is in the early stages of its cycle.\r\n\r\nmy mother noted the object and my brother saw it as well. according to her description, the object first appeared \"like a star,\" \"a defined circle\" and \"glowing\"; it quickly became apparent, however, that it was not a normal heavenly body. my mother still insists upon a distinctly circular shape, even when i asked her if she meant instead that it was eliptical. it was glowing very brightly; when she told me this, she put emphasis on the words. it was quite clear that the glow was an abnormal sort of glow. it \"moved eratically,\" in a manor dissimilar to that of an aircraft of normal origin. when asked how long the ufo was witnessed, she says for a very long time, at least 20 minutes, during which it could be viewed at all times. \"we saw [the ufo] for 20 minutes or more--a long time!--and it stayed with us, in front of us,\" she says. there are few cars on the hanwell at night so it's quite possible that my mother was alone on the road for miles. eventually their trip just took them away from the ufo's location and it wasn't seen again once out of sight.\r\n\r\nboth my mother and i are aware that nb has very busy skys, perhaps amongst the busiest in north america, but it was clearly not a commercial plane of any sort. it was raised by my girlfriend that sattelites can move erratically in the fashion that is associated with ufos, but this was distinctly too close to the earth to be such an object. it is also of interest that fredericton is near the cfb gagetown military base, a notable canadian military base. however, my mother's account can still be taken quite at face value--she was an army brat, the daughter of an artillery commander, and growing up on numerous bases around north america. not only is she familar with standard military aircraft, but she has actually seen firsthand a secret military aircraft that she thought was a ufo but then learned of its true identity when it was revealed to her by her father after the project associated with it was declassified. she knows that what she saw was not of any known earthly origin.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading this. if you have any questions, contact me, and i can contact my mother for you and return your call.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

attention to the jets.\r\n\r\napprox. 7:26pm = both f-18s climbed altitude and continued heading west.\r\n\r\napprox. 7:30pm = both f-18s ended up in the general area of the light/object's last

light/object appeared to be further out...Possibly 15 miles give or take a mile. i've been working on & around aircraft for around 16 years, and been flying in them for double that time, so if there's one thing i know it's aircraft. that sounds like a cliche doesn't it? the light/object was not any type of aircraft, nor could it have been a star. besides, why would 2 f-18s appear to \"scramble\" toward it if it was indeed nothing? i'm sorry i don't have a photo or video of the event. the military tends to frown upon cameras and video equipment on the flightline, so i did the next best thing and made as detailed a report as possible and i drew a sketch, but i no longer have a working scanner. i'll try to submit the sketch at a later date.\r\n\r\nmufon field investigator
