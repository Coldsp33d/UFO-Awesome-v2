woodbridge in the u.K., and one of our primary missions was to provide launch abort recovery for apollo missions.  we had c-130 aircraft that had sophisicated (for the time) tracker systems that could locate the space craft both in space and on the water if they had to land downrange from the cape.\r\n\r\nwe would deploy from england to the ascension island which is about 500 miles below the equator in the middle of the atlantic.  we would go through extensive preparations, which included having a nasa engineer with us at woodbridge prior to our deployment.  he would monitor all the equipment calibrations and certify to nasa that all was ready.  when we landed at the acension, he would watch once again as we got the aircraft calibrated, before they took off to orbit during the launch period.\r\n\r\ni was a radio maintenance guy, and was the one who worked on the tracking system, so the nasa guy and i spent long hours on the flight line as we waited for various things to be accomplished.  he had a mission plan in a black three ring binder, (which he gave to me and i still have) which described the various experiments to be done by the crew of the apollo 14 mission.  one was called gegenschein photography.  it had a very short and not helpful narrative, unlike the rest, which were described in great detail.  i asked the nasa guy what that one was about.  he said basically that the gegenschein line is a theoretical line of zero gravity that exists in space between two bodies, where their gravitational pull is equal.  he said that there were several around the earth, which were created by the various planets, moon, sun, etc., which created these areas which he called \"stable points\".  these areas accumulate space debris which generally doesn't move.  rocks and other debris would find their way there and lacking some force to cause them to leave, generally stayed there.  he also said that radar and telescopic examination of these stable points had indicated that in some, things seem to come and go.  he said the reason for the gegenschein photography was to take detailed photos of a stable point as the apollo mission went by it.\r\n\r\ni asked him, if the ability to come and go from such a stable point didn't imply that the object was a powered craft.  he said that nasa believed that indeed there were powered craft using these stable points as \"parking\" places.  this allowed them to stay in a spot near the earth, without having to expend energy.\r\n\r\ni eventually became an air force officer in space command, working in various sensor systems.  i had other experiences which tended to confirm my belief that the u.S. has much more information than has been admitted.\r\n\r\nrecently, i saw a show with buzz aldrin admitting that while on the apollo 11 mission, they had seen things they couldn't identify.  i really believe that on apollo 14, they were trying to get more evidence of these objects.\r\n\r\nthe official nasa website has got detailed summaries of the apollo missions.  you can go to the one for apollo 14, and the description of the gegenschein experiment is so brief as to be useless.  kind of odd to me, when compared to the descriptions of the others.\r\n\r\nwell, it has been a long time, but i wanted to let someone know.\r\n\r\nthanks.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5212,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5566607,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08072006-0009","longitude":-105.7804474,"occurred":31478400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":31478400000,"summary":"Nasa

was 16 and already in bed when i spotted this bright light, i ran down the hallway yelling for her to get up and see this strange light, however by the time we got back to the window the object had dissipeared.  one other time we were sitting on the couch again across from the window, my niece, her boyfriend and we witnessed the same light in the same spot. the first time i saw  this light i think i called my father who lived across the road from me (so this object would have been directly behind his home) but by the time he got to his window it was gone) he told me that it could have

we are up until 2:00 or later watching for shooting stars and we did so again this weekend. \r\n\r\nsunday morning 8/6/2006 at 2:30 am my wife jeannie and i were in ken's yard looking up at the milky way and facing east. the weather conditions were perfectly clear and great for watching shooting stars. out of the south appeared a triangle pattern of stars from behind the trees at the edge of the yard. this formation about was about eighty degrees up from the horizon and slowly began to cross our wide open view of the sky from south to north in the direction of mount adams.\r\n\r\nwe first thought this was our eyes playing tricks on us because the lights were the same intensity as most of the stars except they were all three moving north in a formation that moved without deviation of speed or shape. this was not a solid object but rather three points of light as we could see the other stars in the middle of the triangle as it moved. \r\n\r\nthis was a large triangle, lead across the sky by two stars and the third one following at spacing slightly larger than the other two, but exactly equally spaced in relationship to the first points of light, then forming a

there were six individual smaller shadows flying in unison making a triangular formation.  at first i thought i was seeing things.  i was confused at first, because once the shadows left the clouds there was nothing there.  nothing there except blue sky.  the objects were moving in a very straight line in the sky so it was not difficult to track its direction.  every time the objects flew into the clouds i could clearly make the shapes out.  the formation was perfect! the other amazing point is the rate of a speed.  the objects were able to fly from one point in the sky (from south to the

it might be some sort of plane, i asked him what kind of plane could stay in one spot for such a lenght of time.  we then observed a plane fly near and had an opportunity to compare light

one behind the other towards the constellation sagittarius. i think its sagittarius, but i know it better as the teapot. this siting was unique because we followed them for almost two minutes before they got out of sight, and right at the end, a bright \"star\" that i was using a reference point as to where i might lose sight of them at, suddenly flashed bright and disappeared. the appearant

planes in the sky to judge altitude by. i am a former pilot myself and a former member of aavaso. what ever these were, they would have to be unimaginably huge, as they were high enough that we mistook them for stars for several second. they had the same coloration as stars.  the flash  occured in the sky as the pair passed a rather bright star, orange in color,as they neared my horizon

shade.\r\n\r\nsomeone was looking at me from outside through the shade (shade is opaque), and then suddenly moved silently sideways, as if on wheels, away from the window. i saw this shadow for maybe 5 seconds. a few seconds later i heard the top of a metal trash can in the backyard open and then slam shut.\r\n\r\nthe image was of a very angular, skinny being.  it did not look quite human, and the shadow of the top of the head had to be at least 8 feet high from the ground.  i don't know if it was standing or floating.  i'm not sure what this thing was, but it had mass and cast a shadow.\r\n\r\nand last week, when i was departing from my house, i caught something out of the corner of my eye for maybe a fraction of a second.  i thought i saw some sort of large ship or craft

under a heavily trafficked air route.  the commercial airliners i see are almost always going east to west or west to east.  from my orientation on the deck, they���re always going left to right or right to left.\r\n\r\nwhile stargazing, i picked up a single point of light moving across the sky from south to north. it���s size and luminosity was about the same as a bright star in the night sky. the big dipper rises up over my house every night and this was about the same as one of the stars in that\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nit was traveling at about the same altitude and moving across the sky at about the same rate as a commercial airliner.  it traveled in a perfectly straight trajectory. since there was nothing else moving across the sky at that moment, my eyes were drawn to watching this point of light move across the sky.\r\n\r\nafter it had traversed about 30 degrees of sky, it winked out. just disappeared.  then, it reappeared about 10-15 degrees later, still on the same course.  winking out and reappearing got my attention but what really got my attention was that when it reappeared, it was momentarily much brighter than it had been before and then quickly resumed its former luminosity. while visible again, it traveled about the same distance as before then winked out again.  the same pattern repeated. it disappeared for 10-15 degrees worth of sky then reappeared, very bright at first and then back to its original luminosity.  it repeated this behavior about 3-4 times before it finally disappeared for good from my view.\r\n\r\nthe night sky was mostly clear with some thin scattered clouds here and there. i am also a private pilot and i am familiar with standard aircraft marking lights and anti collision strobe lights.  i did not see any of these, just a single point of light like a star.\r\n\r\ni thought about:\r\n1)  an airplane, whose crew for some reason turned all their lights on and off at regular intervals. i don���t know why they would do that.\r\n\r\n2)  an airplane whose visibility to me on the ground was broken here and there by thin clouds. that seems to fit except it doesn���t explain why each time the light reappeared it was momentarily very bright.\r\n\r\n3)  a fireball meteor. i���ve seen videos of them where then flare up, die down, flare up, die down, etc.  one of the reasons i like to stargaze is that i do get to see some shooting stars almost every night. i���ve even seen fiery meteors streak across the sky.  this didn���t look like it was on fire or burning up. it looked more like a light somebody was turning on and off.  also, it didn���t appear to ���fall���, but instead travel overhead and keep going.\r\n\r\n4)  space junk? maybe, but doubtful for the same reasons as #3.\r\n\r\nthe flight path was straight and true. nothing odd about it���s movements. the only odd thing was that it would appear and disappear.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5199,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2124216,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08062006-0002","longitude":-77.1850447,"occurred":1154674800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1154674800000,"summary":"Star

interest are frames 2, 3 and 4 (attachments).\r\n\r\ni started the day in grand junction, colorado.  while in the vicinity of red mountain pass, on highway us550 i believe about half way between ouray and silverton, at (according the a map) about 11,000 feet in elevation or so, i got out of the vehicle to take some pictures of the beautiful mountain scenery.  i liked the green of the trees and the red of the mountain, and i just wanted to capture that.  i took the pictures generally in an easterly direction, looking at the west side of the mountain.  at this location, i took 3 pictures, frames 2, 3 and 4, seconds apart.  sky conditions were cloudy, with intermittent rain in the area.  i didn't \"see anything\" unusual at the time with the naked eye.  i took my pictures, it was all routine, and then continued on the way towards durango and ultimately to phoenix.  \r\n\r\nlater in august 2005, i noticed these abberations shortly after getting the pictures back from the developer.  i thought they were strange at the time, and told my family so.  my family (parents and sisters) also thought they were strange.  now i just think it's time to say something to someone.  i don't know why i waited.  so here goes.\r\n\r\nin the first picture, frame 2, there is situated above the mountain a dark shape in the sky, sort of like a bent cigar or a hot dog.  there is no way it is an airplane.  or, it might be the leading edge of a circular object or disk, with something above the dark form, like a rounded cover or hump or something - but it is just too unclear to be sure.  it's hard to say what the size of the \"object\" is.\r\n\r\nin the second picture, frame 3, taken moments later in the same vicinity toward the same mountain but to the right (south) of the original picture frame, there is a small bright light, fireball, orb, or egg of light.\r\n\r\nin the third picture, frame 4, all is normal.  there is just a cloudy sky, nothing unusual.\r\n\r\ni use a film camera, an old minolta srt101.  when i get film processed (wal-mart), i have a cd made as well so the images can be digitized and placed on my computer desktop.  in frames 2 and 3, i used a standard 58 mm lens that came with the camera.  for frame 4, i used a 130 mm telephoto lens.  it took maybe a minute to switch out lenses.  total time to take all three pictures was in the vicinity of 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nwhat are these things?  are they just abberations in the image, mistakes made in the processing of the film or computer disk?  i don't know, but i think it's possible.  is it possible

extraordinary set of events in motion.  those images are not something you forget.  i know it was tax season because we were returning from my uncles (he did taxes pretty well) and my father got his taxes done that evening.  we were on our way home, which takes us down county line road, then turn right, then half mile and turn right on to cr173.  we lived about a mile from the turn onto 173.  well as we were turning, my mother who was also a witness, noticed a bright white oval/almost cylindrical shaped object above what we called (for sake of this report we will call them the x woods) \"x woods\" (the x's owned the entire chunk of real estate).  within a matter of seconds, of us all looking to see what my mother had seen, i was thrown backwards with the great acceleration of the car.  when i got back to see what the speed was i remember clearly it was bouncing off the little bar at the end of the speedometer. the speedometer registered 120mph max.  it took us mere seconds, even with a 90 degree left turn into our driveway (driveway is about .5miles in length) this with 3 young kids, and an infant in the front.  we were rushed into the house, rushed into our bed cloths, and carted off to bed.  i remember hearing the shotgun being prepped and loaded, and remember for 3 days we didn���t go to school, nor were we permitted to play outdoors, and my father set with a loaded double barrel shotgun on the front porch for 3 nights. beings i was a kid i had no worries, i just did was i was told, and complained about not being able to go outside.  this object appeared 9 other times in my life.  i have seen this object up close; i bare scars, burns, illnesses, and other strange markings from events which to this day still occur with frightening regularity. i have been witness to other events outside my purview (happening as i just came in on it or happened to have been present during it).  the object i saw was brilliant, but not so that you couldn���t look at it.  it shined what looked like today���s laser pens at several locations, however the beam was much larger, and more intense. the beams did not shine directly at us however, but there were several noticeable points of contact.  a tree near our home had been singed, a barn roof had its roofing tar burned to a crisp, and our neighbors lost 2 of their horses due to breaking of a fence, which was also burned (horses later recovered 2 miles from their origin location), the x���s recall nothing of the event whatsoever. however their tree���s were also singed or burned and their driveway showed evidence of burning.  this was all quickly forgotten by the x���s and the like in the area as this was real rural farm country. from my bedroom window we could see the object thru the tree in the front yard for an additional 15-20 minutes.  this object appeared twice more over the next days.  each time progressively shorter in stay, the final night was its shortest stay, this time however it was in the field to the south of the woods, and appeared much lower to the ground, 20-30 feet above the empty field.  later descriptions by my father confirmed this.  he said it just sat there silent.  this time no lights came from the object like it had done the previous 2 nights.  he said it seemingly sat there, which was confirmed by my brother and i who were up way past our bedtime sneaking peaks out the front window.  the last night after hovering for only a few moments it shot straight up, it changed colors from white to orange, then to blue, and was gone. my father went to the site in the early morning of the 4th day, and found absolutely nothing.  no burn marks, singing, or anything out of the ordinary.  however he did notice the air seemed electrically charged and had the smell of ozone. this incident wouldn���t be so memorable had it not happened right in front of me.  to this date no other member of my family will discuss this matter.  my father and mother have now passed on, and the remaining witnesses to the event refuse to speak of it. if there were other witnesses to the event none to date have come forward.  i stand alone in this matter.  basically because it���s not something you talk about except around campfires and the like. i have asked my brother and sister who were in the backseat with me if they would care to comment.  their answers were outright no comment, so i will leave it at that. my postulations on what this object might have been go from a helicopter, military aircraft, to swamp gas, to ufo, to god knows what. i wouldn���t even bring it to your attention had these events not continued in my life.  i have contacted other ufo organizations, uforc and author bud hopkins in regards to the many events in my life.  to date only one, arc (alternate realities conference) in johnson city tennessee has any interest in this information. i wrote to them of my happenings over the entirety of my life. no one else has shown interest other then those i tell around the proverbial campfire, and even then those stories are soon forgotten.   i can only postulate that the reason my father hit the gas was that he had seen this object sometime before, and was afraid of it.  the shotgun and the porch sitting was another indicator that he was afraid of it.  my mother���s response was extremely similar.  they were afraid of whatever it was. i myself at that time had no opinion of it, not till it affected me later in life.\r\n\r\nof note, the encounter was over a 3 day time frame.  night 1 it lasted 3 hrs, night 2 about 45 minutes and night 3 about 12 minutes. none of the neighbors remembers anything.  1 old fellow from a house a mile away was very sick after the incident, but had no known correlations to the event. other strange events surrounding this incident, was animal upset.  our dogs and farm animals seemed to be agitated for days after the incident.  the horses that had broken free of the fence exhibited signs on dehydration, even though green creek was less then ��� mile from their find point. they were also in a highly agitated state, and were not easily returned to their pasture. the object never appeared to move, just sat there silently with the exception of a location change on the 3rd night. i described above i was about 7 years old i really didn���t have any feelings other then the begrudging of my parents for not letting us go outside. i was more curious then anything. above i talk about how the object went from white to orange and then blue, it went straight up, and was gone faster then we could look up. other observations by my father are as follows to the best of my recollection.  he went to the scene of the day 3 hover, and found nothing except the sensation of electrical charge and the smell of something like ozone. he was at the area for over an hour, and saw no landing prints, evidence of burning, nor any evidence that anything had occurred.  no other witnesses besides my family saw this object, their accountings of it would be similar, and however they have chosen to remain anonymous about the encounter, only telling it as an internal family story. my mothers accounting of it takes on a new meaning of overprotection.  she later told me she had an overwhelming need to protect us, almost an instinctual need.  she described it in such a manner as to make me wonder if she thought this object was going to do us harm. my father���s reaction with the shotgun also leaned towards this conclusion. they were very nervous about the entire matter.  later incidents of the same type give me full conviction that they were right in their fear and precaution. this object has been seen in my life a total of 9 other times over my lifetime, each time doing pretty much the same thing it did the first time. i have also been witness to other events with different types of objects however i was not directly involved in any incidents with those. when asked my brother and sister remember the light above the woods but recall none of the rest.  however they too recall this same lighted object appearing at other intervals in their own lives. i have a somewhat photographic memory.  i tend to remember things more readily then other members of my family. i am the only one to have gone to college, served in the military, and done all the other things i���ve done.  my brother is a loner, and was often called the black sheep of the family. he is now living out west here, and started a family.  my sister still lives in ohio, and has started her own family. my brother (the infant in the front seat) lives also in ohio and is a family man himself.  my younger brother is the only one of us that does not recall the original event, nor has he ever had subsequent sightings of the event in his life. in 1998 i had a one on one with my mother about all the events in my life when i lived at home.  the horror stories she told me were absolutely beyond belief.  i remember them happening though, so know they are fact. in the 1985-89 years my father also told us of some stories about his childhood, and this object.  confirmed all my thoughts.  i hope this was helpful.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"12:59:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

lights in the sky. we initially thought they were two pair of balloons from their odd way of moving. the two lights in each pair kept a slight distance from each other but were moving in near circles, rotating on a common axis, then reversing direction when they completed a half circle and swinging back, then changing direction and repeating the movement again and again. picture a see-saw moving up and down with lights at each end. \r\n\r\ni live in hollywood and there's a lot of light pollution. these objects seemed very bright and relatively low to the ground when we first saw them.  i don't see the entire sky, my balcony is on an alley that might be 15 to twenty feet across and the building next door is slightly taller than mine.  we saw the objects very low over the roof and in the distance, we could see them clearly enough that we guessed they weren't more than a few blocks away.  at first we figured they were baloons that had been let off on highland ave., a nearby major street.  we thought maybe they were mylar and were reflecting illumination from nearby streetlights.\r\n\r\nthe two (four?) objects slowly moved north while ascending/getting smaller in our view and maintaining the short distance between them. after maybe two minutes we began to wonder how we could see balloons so well at night, and why two pairs of balloons were staying so close to each other as they went so high. there were police helicopters in the sky, and by about halfway through the sighting the objects were clearly higher than the copters.  \r\n\r\nwe kept wtaching and the objects began to fade from view.  neither of us owned a camera, we wished we'd taken pictures.  probably four or five minutes in, the pair of objects got too high and small for us to see.  my friend and i argued a little over who would write this.  he was reluctant, honestly concerned that he might want to run for office or have his family google his name and see this someday.  i decided to write this, sit on it for a few days, then edit it.  i completely forgot to send this to mufon, though this was my original intention.  i had posted a shorter version of this sighting on my blog, which was pretty much mocked by my friends.  the url is http://alexsfink.Livejournal.Com/?Skip=20 and the entry is just below the halfway point of the page.","distance":"Over One

house.  we were sitting outside for a couple of hours, just watching the stars.  i live in pittsburgh, and take any chance i can to get away from the city lights and look at the stars.  on this night, right around 2:15 am i noticed a very bright orange light to the south.  i watched at it approached (heading due north).  as it was approaching, it appeared to be a single orange, very bright light.  it was flashing on and off.  when it was off, nothing was visable.  no other marker lights, no outline of a craft, etc.  i got up out of my chair and walked out into the yard for a more clear view.  as the object got to be close to perpendicular to me, i noticed the single orange flash, was actually a series of approximately 5-6 very quick flashes.  at this point, the object was fairly close to me.  held at an arms length, a nickle would probably just cover the object up.  i noticed no noise coming from the vehicle.  and, even at this close range, the short time in the cycle where the orange lights were off on the craft, i still could not make out a shape, nor were there any marker lights.  just black.  as the craft continued on, i could see much more clearly the light set up and flashing pattern from the rear.  there were 5-6 round orange lights all lined up in a row.  three larger lights, on what i could only call the 'bottom' of the craft, as well as 2-3 more which swept up to the rear at appx. a 30* angle.  the rear up-swept lights appeared to get progressively smaller from the 'bottom' 3.  the flashing was a chasing motion, clockwise, from front to back.  after the last flash, there was about a 1/2 second pause where you could see nothing.  and then the first 'bottom' light would again fire.  \r\n\r\ni watched this craft with amazement from virtually horizon to horizon.  i have no idea what it was.  my friend, witnessed the same thing, and had actually called me the week previous to tell me he had seen orange lights in the sky.  i was half asleep at the time.  his only reaction to the sighting was, \"see, i told you.  you didn't believe me, did you?\".\r\n\r\nvery strange indeed.  it sounds very much like the ohio report.  the only difference is what
