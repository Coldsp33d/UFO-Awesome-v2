(at least 15 feet in diameter, but i'm guessing much more than that.) we live out in the hocking hills not far from old man's cave off h. 664, and have few neighbors, it would not be a very good place for a hoax.\r\n\r\ni've tried to think of what it could have been besides a high tech vehicle of some sort. it was not a conventional vehicle. not a plane, it hovered perfectly still. not a helicopter, as that close it would have made noise and what we saw was completely silent. \r\n\r\nother related sighting: the same red light that appears, flashes, spins, then dims out that i saw in between the yellow rim lights showed up again at about 10:01 pm the following evening, on august 3rd, in almost the same position, but a little further south in the sky. this time, there were no yellow rim lights however. we plan to go out tonight before 10 to see if there is any further activity.\r\n\r\nother note: we've seen some dark drab olive green military helicopters in the region in the last month, which is something neither of us have seen in this area ever in the years we've lived in this area of ohio. so there is a chance that maybe what we saw was part of some test i suppose.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5184,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5400672,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08032006-0005","longitude":-82.4070986,"occurred":1154580060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1154580060000,"summary":"A bright red light that dimmed, followed by a row of yellow round lights lighting up one at a time in a clockwise pattern, revealing a disk shape.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Logan, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:513055"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Arlington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My 16 year old daughter and her friend were sitting outside on the patio. the weather was hot and the sky was clear.  they noticed a flash that lit up the sky like lightning.  when they looked up they saw a large deep blue sphere dropping from high in the sky down behind the house. it had a blue, green, white glow or halo around it. they could'nt tell if it was 1/2 a mile or 100 miles away. it was the size of a marble from where they sat. it was moving very fast. it did not make a sound.  i asked if it had been an exploding transformer or a light falling from the nearby football stadium and they said it started high in the air . they thought it was an airplane but it was too large and it was a deep blue sphere.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":5183,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.735687,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08032006-0004","longitude":-97.1080656,"occurred":1154500200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1154500200000,"summary":"Bright flash. object desended east to west to the horizon in the southern sky.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Arlington, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:513056"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Sheridan","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Last night i got up and went outside and looked to the west,toward the big horn mt.S,i saw what i thought was a large star at first but was flashing diffrent colors,i got my binoculars and it was flashing red and blue randomly, it shrunk down to a white ball than kind of dissapeared for a split second than shot out of sight at a 10:00 angle. i have never seen a ufo before,and dont really know what this was,but it was really fast. this only lasted for about two or three minutes. i hope someone else saw it too.\r\nwhat could it have been?????????

exit, just after 4 am on 7/28/06 to watch the aquarid meteor shower. the night was clear and cloudless with just the barest hint of approaching dawn on the eastern horizon, and an occasional airliner or 2 from denver international airport was visible far to the se. \r\n\r\nafter spotting 1 or 2 unremarkable meteor trails in the southern sky within half an hour, i was about to go back inside when i noticed a formation of 3 faint unblinking starlike objects in a triangle formation in the mid southern sky moving n/ne just slower than airliner speed. it was positioned \"backwards\" as it were, with the point of the triangle in the rear of the direction it was travelling. it also was a longer distance from the front two objects to the rear, giving the appearance of a long thin triangle. as soon as i saw all 3 distinct points of light i knew it was not a conventional aircraft. size was unknown but my extended thumbnail at arms length would just fit in each point of the group. the faintness of the objects implied to me great distance and great size.\r\n\r\nother stars could be seen behind the objects as they travelled so it didn't appear to be a single object. when the formation was almost directly overhead i noticed another starlike object, somewhat brighter, that was travelling to the south and which crossed the formation's path, although i don't know if the objects had any relation to each other and i kept my attention on the formation as the other object passed by. \r\n\r\nno noise was heard nor any other effects from the objects. after watching for approx. 1 minute the objects began to fade and i lost sight of them about midway into the northern sky. it almost seems like they stopped in the sky but due to their faintness that's only speculation. further scanning of the sky revealed no more objects or meteors and the sky was beginning to brighten towards dawn.\r\n","distance":"Over One

legion highway, just down the street from bell circle (a traffic rotary) in revere, massachusetts.\r\n\r\nthe day was bright and sunny, with a blue sky and fluffy clouds. the temperature was approximately 70 degrees. it was a breezy day.\r\n\r\nupon exiting the store, i glanced across the 4-lane divided american legion highway toward the small getty gas station directly across the highway from the donut shop.\r\n\r\nmy attention was immediately drawn to a solid black sphere, approximately the size of a large beach ball (about 5 feet in diameter) traveling no more than 30 feet in the air, coming from the direction of the bell circle traffic rotary. it was traveling in a straight line, at approximately 20 miles per hour, and its path was located behind the getty station, heading in the direction of the 11-story comfort inn hotel which is located just past the getty station, if one is facing in a northerly direction in front of the station.\r\n\r\nat first glance, i thought it was a child's large balloon, but the day was very breezy, and this object was traveling in a straight line, never once fluttering or wavering in its flight toward the gas station. the object was a dull, solid black in color, with absolutely no protrusions, or any other type of irregularities on it's surface... it was just a solid, dull black sphere.\r\n\r\nas i watched the object, it continued its straight-line path toward the comfort inn hotel. the traffic was light on the highway, and with the absence of vehicular traffic noise, i noted that i could hear no sound at all coming fron the object.\r\n\r\nas it approached the comfort inn hotel, its altitude was at about the 3rd story level, and as it got closer, it began to climb at approximately a 50-degree angle until it cleared the roof of the hotel, at which time it leveled off for a few seconds, then began climbing again at the same angle.\r\n\r\nto get a better viewing angle, i crossed the highway and positioned myself directly behind the object, and i could see that it was still traveling in an absolute straight-line attitude, with a total absence of flutter or wavering, even though the tree branches and foliage were swaying with the breezes.\r\n\r\nthe object once again interrupted its climb, and began to descend at an approximately 40-degree angle, heading for the roof the new england confectionary company (necco candy) building, located in the next lot north of the comfort inn, again if one is facing in a northerly direction next to the getty station.\r\n\r\nwhen the object came within 15-20 feet of the roof of the necco building, it again leveled off and traveled along the length of the roof, until it cleared the building.\r\n\r\nat this point, the object once again began to climb on its 50-degree angle, in its straight-line attitude, heading for a large cloud. it's speed never wavered from the approximate 20 miles per hour it was traveling when i first spotted it.\r\n\r\nstill behind the object, i watched it climb toward the cloud until it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\nthe time-frame from when i first spotted the object, until it disappeared from view was approximately 1 1/2 minutes, as best i can recall.\r\n\r\nthere were no people on foot in the immediate vicinity, and no people in the few vehicles going by seemed to notice it, even though i was quite conspicuous in my observation of it, even pointing toward it to try and get the attention of someone in one of the vehicles. as far as i could determine, i was the only one on the highway who saw the object, but i'm positive that someone must have seen it as it flew over the always-busy bell circle traffic rotary. i passed the rotary on my way home, but could see nobody on foot who may have seen the object.\r\n\r\nto say that what i saw that day was strange and very highly unusual would be a monumental understatement! it was a very exciting thing to see, and i can say without a doubt that this was no beach ball, child's balloon, or any balloon for that matter. this object, or craft, ot whatever it was, seemed to be intelligently controlled, in my personal opinion.\r\n\r\nan exciting day in my life, and one that i'll never forget.\r\n\r\ni assure all of you that this story is absolutely true.\r\n","distance":"101-500

looking so i deceided to shine a q beam flashlight on the kite to prove to my wife that the object was a kite. while shining the flashlight in the sky, i noticed 3 lights, in a row, horizontal, over the ocean, maybe 20 degrees above the horizon and about the size of a small marble. the left one faded, then the center faded, then the right one faded. they were illuminated long enough for me to say, \"what the #*%! is that\" and drop the flashlight. we then returned to the beach and less that five minutes later witnessed the same type of  event with greater number of lights, growing off of a beginning one and forming a string of maybe 10 lights. this time much farther away, smaller that a pea at arms length. it happened twice, 30 seconds apart, second one having greater number of lights.

was the late seventies and my father and i were wearing matching blue nylon vests that were popular back then.  it had to be fall or winter then.  as we drove home i noticed that the streets were empty of people and most of all activity.  it wasnt that late maybe 8pm or 9pm so i thought it was odd.  i mentioned this to my father, but he was oblivious.  i noticed all the lights were on at the stores and homes but absolutely no people were around. no cars nobody walking.  as we turned down our street, i noticed a huge orange object hovering about 500 feet or so off the ground and it was so large that i cant say how far away it was maybe 3-10 miles away.  it was silent and just a bright orange glowing oval/disc shaped object.  it was probably as big as a couple of football fields.  i told my father, but he said it was just the moon.  i then looked out the passenger window upwards and saw the moon overhead.  i told him that the moon was up there and he looked up through the windshield of the car and saw it and then looked at the object again.  he stopped the car and put it in park.  he opened the door and stepped out to get a better look.  i heard him make a sound of amazement as he stood staring at the object for a few minutes.  this object made no noise, had no visible engines no real detail except for the orange glow it emmitted against the night sky.  i looked like it was hovering over lax from where we were at.  the next thing i remember was waking up in bed about 5 or 6 hours later fully clothed and my shoes on.  i was still wearing the blue vest and all.  i quickly rushed into my  parents room only to find my father lying in bed fully clothed and in a deep sleep.  i mentioned it to him the next morning and he didnt remember a thing.  the car was parked in the front of the garage too.  i asked my frieds in the neighborhood and at school, but nobody i talked to remembers seeing it.  i figured it was a dream and in time i also had forgotten about the incident for many years.  it wasnt until about 10 years ago that i remembered what had happend in better detail.  i cant remember what year it was exactly, but around that time i remember suffering from chronic nose bleeds.  i never had that problem when i was younger and it only lasted for a few years or so.  \r\n\r\ni dont know if i was abducted, but i do remeber a dream i had as a child.  in my dream at the time my father was looking at the object i noticed some movement to my right and looked out the window.  i noticed about 10 people/humanoids peering behind trees and behind houses and they all just looked at us at the same time. they quickly started to approach the car.  my father said something to them and thats the last thing i remember from my dream. \r\n\r\ni dont know if this mufon thing is on the up and up, but i havent had any other incidents since then nor do i remember anything else.  i dont think i have any implants in me but then again i have never checked for any.  i dont want some secret agency spying on me or taking me into some secret hangar to inspect me so i would like to stay anonymous as possible.  i do believe in alien life and ufos visiting this planet or dimension.  i hope that someone else who possibly remembers this incident will read this and write his/her experience on this site for others to read and come forward.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

maryland, where my family has a property on turkey neck road.  turkey neck road is in the mountains of western maryland, and is dominated by farmland, and in by the lake, vacation cottages.  when i got to turkey neck, it was about 11:35 p.M., and i noticed a bright flashing light emanating from over the hills to the left.  it lit the sky with considerable power.  rather than turn right to head in to the cottage, i turned left to see if i could find the source of the strange light. it seemed to be close by.\r\n   as i drove up the hill, i thought i saw the light through some trees, but that vantage quickly became obscured again.  approximately 1 mile later, i got to the intersection of turkey neck and the highway (whose number escapes me for the moment).  and there, right across the two-laned highway was the light.  it was very bright (though not blinding) and flicked on and off in a strobing manner.  it was at treetop level, but was just behind the treeline a little bit.  i stopped for a moment, and an 18 wheeled truck passed by.  the truck slowed--presumably to look at the light as well, and drove off.  i would describe the light as kind of cigar shaped, and it had sectional lines of some kind in it, rather than just a single, unitary bulb.  it might have been several feet long in length.  i watched for a few moments longer, turned around and went to the cottage.  at about 2 a.M., i walked down by the lake to see if i could see any trace of the light, and its beam could still be seen in the distance lighting up the sky.  \r\n   the next day i compared notes with some relatives who had also come up the night before.  they had seen the light too, and found it as strange as i had.  a few of us drove out to the spot in daylight, and walked across the road to see if we could see anything, but there was nothing there.  just trees, and behind them, farm fields.  we did not venture onto the property.  that night, the light did not come back.\r\n   the farm on which this occurred usually sells beans, peppers, and other produce in mid to late august.  i will watch for the sale, and take that opportunity to query them about this event.  if mufon is interested, i will keep you posted as to the results.  it doesn't sound like much in the telling, i'm afraid.  the experience was far more intriguing than words can convey.  i am mostly writing in case others have written of this event.  in the absence of an earthly explanation, i will spend the rest of my life regretting that i didn't get out of my jeep, walk across the road, and take a closer look at the light when it was right there in front of me!\r\n\r\nbilly walsh\r\nsunday, july 30,

just sitting right above us,very close to the ground, they where in the v formation, the lead ship was just sitting right above us, they where right above the telephone pole, i could have hit them

minutes to see if i could see more.  then, directly overhead, i noticed three star-like objects in triangle formation moving south to north.  \r\n\r\ni had originally been unsure whether i was seeing one large triangular object or three separate objects.   then i noticed that i could see stars between the moving objects and decided that they must be separate objects.  also, after that determination was made, at least one of the objects made very quick movements out of the formation, then back in, although the triangle was not the same shape afterwards.\r\n\r\nthe triangle kind of bent and warped as it moved, so i surmise that all of the objects were probably moving in varying patterns.  \r\n\r\ni looked for any signs of strobes or running lights, but found none.  \r\n\r\nthis was a very strange feeling to see this.  the fluid motion of the triangle gave the feel that these things could just move any way they wanted to.  \r\n\r\nas for the size, the objects were about as large and the same brilliance as a star.  the triangle they formed itself approximately as wide as my fist when i held up my outstretched arm.\r\n\r\nwhatever they were, they were way way up there.   no sound.  no lights. \r\n\r\ni would have thought they were maybe satellites or something.  but moving around like that, i really don't think so.  \r\n\r\nnow, i know a lot of people are going to probably say these were planes or jets, since i do live in the flight path of a major airport about 40 miles away (dfw).  but i am telling you this were not planes.  they just did not move like that, the snakelike movement of them individually, making that triangle fluid.\r\n\r\nfrom the time i saw them directly overhead till i lost them in the city lights to the north, was about 4 or 5 minutes.

pa.\r\napprox. 15 mi. wnw from harrisburg, pa.\r\napprox. 25 mi. wnw from harrisburg international airport.\r\n\r\nweather: partially overcast from an afternoon t-storm\r\n\r\nobserved: object traveling abnormally fast, altitude of normal\r\nflight path to harrisburg international airport, direction\r\nintersecting normal flight path, movement erratic and luminosity\r\nwith low rapid emission.  nothing spectacular but abnormal.\r\n\r\ni was in the driveway of my home getting air and looking at stars,\r\nairplanes and lightning bugs flying about before going to bed.\r\n\r\nthe location is in a normal landing approach from the wnw to\r\nharrisburg international airport.  planes normally come from\r\nnw to se then turn e to the airport runway after clearing a\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nwhat caught my attention was this object (coming from wnw),\r\nappearing at approach altitude harrisburg international, but\r\nat excessive speed and off nw approach.  normally approaching\r\nplanes have their marker light flashing methodically and when\r\noff reappear in the direction of their trajectory.\r\n\r\nas this object traveled the light appeared to intermittently\r\ndisplace itself from its normal trajectory.\r\n\r\nat first, at distance, i thought the object was a plane slightly\r\noff path, and lights perhaps obscured by overcast clouds.\r\n\r\nthe object (only lights visible) was coming in my direction from\r\nthe wnw to pass south of me.  it appeared to cross the approach path\r\nto harrisburg international at near the approach altitude.  the \r\nspeed was faster than normal approaches and as the object began to\r\ndisappear behind a large tree, i walked quickly some 100 feet down\r\nthe road to keep it in sight.\r\n\r\nwhat could be described as the white marker light was blinking \r\nabnormally fast with low emission.  the light intermittently appeared\r\nbehind then above normal trajectory.  in the final moments observed\r\nthe light appeared as 2 objects, with 1 substantially higher than the\r\nother, (an impossibility at the apparent distance and altitude).\r\nthe total observed duration was approx. 20-30 seconds, terminating in\r\nthe object suddenly disappearing either behind cloud cover or otherwise.\r\nafter it disappeared, i called my son (whose eye are better) to come out\r\nfor a chance reappearance (no reappearance).\r\ni stayed out (watchful) for about 90 minutes more and saw only planes\r\nand a few shooting stars.  lots of lightning bugs.\r\n\r\nfeelings: i wished for a closer and longer observation.  it instilled no\r\nfear or emotion (guessing distance at a mile or so), other than the\r\nliking something more conclusive.\r\n\r\npictures/videos:   sorry, none.  i was on my way to bed.\r\n\r\nafter the appearance of 2 simultaneous objects then disappearance i\r\nknew planes can't do that.  i've been on 2 aircraft carriers, watched\r\nlots of take-offs, landings and maneuvers.  this didn't fit.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
