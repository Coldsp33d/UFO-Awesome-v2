and trees were in the way. i thought it was odd that it wasnt moving. so it wasn't a plane or helicopter. this was at 5:40-6:10pm  it was right before the sun went down but was still light in the sky.

was venus until i realized i was looking south and it started moving. the light was red-orange, which is why at first i thought it was light reflecting off the planet and through the atmosphere. it's not the first time i've seen that. then it began moving across the sky towards the north, stopped and turned east for a bit, then turned back to the north again. when it turned back to the north, the light changed from red-orange to white. i sat in my parents driveway for a good 10-15 minutes before. i called my husband while watching and asked him to step out on the back porch to get a bit of triangulation. we live about a mile down the road from my parents so it's narrowed down to a small area. he said it was a little north of our home, but i still saw it as being south of my parents home. i wasn't scared or intimidated, just curious. my husband said that from his perspective it looked like it was just one blinking light. as it traveled further north, passing over me till i was south of it, i did not see any flashing or blinking. i saw no other objects in the sky at the time. i thought that maybe it was an airplane coming in to land at the local airport, but it was much too high for a lansing landing. i also thought for a moment that it may have been the iss, but when i got home i looked up the iss's location online for the last hour or two and it was well below the equator. it is entirely possible that it was a puddle jumper going to land somewhere further north of lansing, but it had no wing lights that either my husband or i saw. i lost sight of the object

the tree line.  i stood and watched it move up/down and side to side.  then it ducked behind a cloud.  \r\nseveral days later i was taking out my garbage at night but as soon as i opened the door i was overwhelmed by a bright purplish pink light.  i closed the door fast and stayed inside because i didn’t know what it was.  a couple nights later i saw on youtube that ufos flash bright pink lights.  i didn’t think anything of it as i am a believer anyway and not particularly squeamish.  also, at 70 i’m not afraid of their wanting to do weird experiments on me.  \r\n\r\nseveral days after that i looked out my kitchen door and there i saw a skinny white being with huge almond shaped eyes about my height (5,4”). we were looking into each other’s eyes but my instinct was to turn away from it.  i wasn’t afraid because it began to look like a hologram.  his arm started to fade and i realized i could see right through it.  i just calmly walked away from it.  \r\ni wish i thought  to record the dates and times but it never occurred to me to notify mufon. the last incident occurred at dusk.\r\ni also remember working at sears during the late 60s.  it was a summer job when i was in college at a brand new store during dinner time when the store was pretty empty.  i was bored and i remember seeing two men walk down the aisles with short haircuts, white shirts and slacks.  they looked like jehova witnesses because no one my age dressed like that at that time and they appeared young.  i noticed that they were looking around like they had never been in a store before.  across the aisle was the lingerie department and they had a surprised look at that when they got closer.  honestly, they looked like they belonged in the 50s.  i turned away so as not to be rude.  it felt like a couple of seconds but i was totally unnerved because when i turned back they were right beside me holding a card.  i stammered the price and they said it was cheap and handed me the money.  then they said what i was thinking.  they were from another planet!  i didn’t know anything about ufos and lost time then but i found that incident unnerving and obviously never forgot it as these people didn’t look like they were joking!  \r\ni also remember going by a military installation with family in 70s and seeing cigar

fuel pump was affected, i removed it and ran a direct current to it and it started to work again. the object was due south and traveled 3 miles north in the ti e it took for me to turn and pick up my phone and turn back. i had hoped to use the camera to get an idea of what i was seeing. there is no way it was anything g in the sky, stars or planets due to the unbroken thick cloud cover. it had started to rain about 5:30 pm and did not stop. it was still raining when we left around 10am on monday morning. \r\ni tried to wake my seven year old son to see the object but he was fast asleep and would not wake up. there were no vehicles moving anywhere, no boats on the lake, no obvious lights of any kind that i could see. it is not possible that it was an aircraft, either fixed wing or helicopter due to the distance traveled in such a short amount of time. there was no sound and the object appeared to be south over the far bank of the lake and a little below the cloud cover. it wen from very bright to a mid brightness to almost dark. it continued this cycle for approximately 25-30 mi utes before going completely dark at which time my phone began to function normally again. i have 3 photos taken one after the other in less than one minute. i will attach them in order along with zoomed copies in order taken.

between 1994 and 1996 while working as a waiter at kelsey's bar and grill in scarborough, on (restaurant was located at markham rd. and ellesmere ave. and is now closed), i believe that an et came into the restaurant with another humanoid.\r\n\r\nit was mid-afternoon and the lunch rush was finished.  customers in the retaurant were few at the time.  staff in the front of the restaurant consisted of myself, the bartender, and periodically the manager on-duty.\r\n\r\ntwo caucasian looking male customers entered the business and i greeted them just inside the entrance where the 'wait to be seated' sign was posted.  i was immediately struck by one of the men as the appearance of his skin was odd.  his skin appeared almost translucent-like, as if he were 'wearing a skin suit'.  he was also quite tall - i estimate 6'4''.  mostly bald.  large build.  there was nothing remarkable about the other individual with the 'strange person'\r\n\r\ni seated the men and was their waiter during the time they spent at kelsey's.\r\n\r\ntheir demeanour when ordering food and beverage, and in communicating with me was also strange.\r\nthe unremarkable person ordered a meal and beverage normally if you will.  this person also spoke to me only when placing his order.\r\nthe person in question, the man in the skin suit if you will ordered in a strange manner.  i still remember him ordering a hamburger, but it was as if he had never ordered a hamburger before.  he was very concerned there would be no mayonaise on the hamburger.\r\ngenerally he came off as a weirdo per se.\r\n\r\nafter having had several opportunities to stand within 1ft. of this skin suit wearing entity, i am convinced he was wearing a disguise to look human.\r\n\r\nat the time i was so convinced about my observations i mentioned it to the bartenter, and quite literally stated i thought the customer was an et wearing a skin suit.\r\n\r\nthe customers were in the place about 45 minutes, paid cash, and left the premesis.\r\n\r\ni thought nothing of it for a time, and then the movie men in black was released in 1997.  in the film an insectoid et kills a human, and then uses his skin as a disguise.  the appearance of the character in the film.....Pale, sweaty, odd looking, strange mannerisms...........It reminded me very much of this encounter with the guy a couple of years prior.\r\n\r\nthen in about 2005-2006 i was doing research on et's.\r\nat the time i was looking at a list of elleged species of et's, or a list of reported descriptions of et's.\r\nthe list consisted of a artists sketch and a brief summary of the known knowledge on the species.\r\nand then there it was, a sketch of the man i encountered at the restaurant.  a bald caucasion male with translucent like skin, odd looking.  the description beside it spoke about little being known regarding the entity, and made a reference to a possible men in black connection (ironically enough).\r\n\r\nall i can say is the event/encounter has stuck with me my entire life.  to this day i have never encountered another human that struck me like this entity did.  i can tell you that is saying something, as i work as a paramedic in toronto.  i have seen in my 16 year career all manner of illness and people looking 'not well', or freshly dead.  not once did i think i wasin the presence of an et wearing a skin suit.\r\n\r\nplease feel free to contact me if required.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\njason hartle","distance":"20 Feet or
