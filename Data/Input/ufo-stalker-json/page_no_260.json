entrance on the far west side of st. cloud. i passed an accident in the median of the road shortly after entering i-94.\r\ni should add, the purpose of this trip was to attend a sunday event with a friend. i decided to drive down early so as not have to drive so much on sunday. and i needed to return sunday pm so i could fill my volunteer position on monday. \r\nafter passing the accident and driving a while i noticed a bright flash of light to the south/south west of i-94. it appeared high up as bright orange/yellow flash, then dropped to tree top level and the light shrunk in size to that of a very bright star. i mentally noted the time on my vehicle as being 9:48pm. \r\nthe light seemed to fade out and i figured it was nothing. a few miles later it reappeared at tree top level and continued. it appeared to be several miles away, 10 at least. though i am not good at judging night distance in the sky.\r\ni then noticed that i missed my exit: 139 and kept driving and watching the light. i began to watch for a place to pull off and view the light and finally gave up and called my friend to see if he could use his phone to verify if there as a star or a flight in that direction. he was also driving on i-94 headed north to go home and was unable to check for me at the time.\r\ni described to him what i saw and he dismissed it as a plane. \r\ni told him what time i saw the bright light and he commented to me that it was now 10:45pm. nearly 11:00pm. and that i had been watching the light for over an hour if i saw it at 9:48pm.\r\ni found an exit and pulled off in an office building parking lot and watched the object move from left to right at tree top level. \r\ni quickly tried to relay to my friend where i was at and then hung up and kept driving, trying to keep a visual on the light. \r\ni finally stopped south of ???? and turned around. i pulled in a taco bell parking lot near the freeway and waited for my friend to arrive. \r\nhe arrived within minutes of me stopping at the taco bell parking lot and i repeated all the information to him. he didn't seem to believe me, still calling it a plane. but the time seemed to not add up.\r\nhe did check a few star positions out with his phone and i pointed out a star with the same brightness as what i had seen.\r\nlater that night my friend asked me to leave in the morning, the relationship was over.\r\ni am still not sure what happened that night as i was driving, but something did. the time still doesn't add up in my mind. it should have been closer to midnight, or perhaps i was tired and misjudged the time.   i don't have any further memory at this time of the incident.

background stars, traveled in a straight line making no noise or leaving no contrail, as normally seen when commercial airliners fly over. the object was visible for about 3 minutes before i lost sight of it as it went over the sandia mountains. the object caught my attention as i was looking in that general direction when i noticed it moving against the background stars. i thought to myself this is almost like the other objects i have seen over the last 3 years and wonder if i am the only person seeing these lights or objects. as far as i know i am the only witness at this time and no other people were with me a the time of this sighting and i did not tell anyone about this besides my girlfriend later that night.","distance":"Over One

roommate pointed out the ship to me. it was the only time i've been able to see it perfectly. from our stoop i looked above the tree line and hovering south and to the west was anything unlike i had ever seen in my life. it was a perfect equilateral triangle; the base of it was black and at each point of the triangle was a large orb (which appeared pretty bright). i wasnt sure where they were coming from but i also noticed it emitted red/orange and blue lights. it made absolutely no noise and this first encounter lasted maybe 30-45 seconds tops. as i re-positioned myself to keep watching the ship, it had disappeared.\r\n\r\never since that night i have witnessed the same ship (or maybe there are others) several times. \r\n\r\nas of late, every time i notice it it is positioned in the sky overhead to look like a star to the uninformed. at first i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but sure enough this thing comes back every night and hovers very high up in the sky looking like a bright star and just pulsating red and blue lights. i dont know any star that can do that. it will sit up there observing for hours at a time sometimes way shorter than that. i have tried to get a video recording of it just sitting there, but its so far away that on camera it is just a twinkling orb.\r\n\r\nmost recently i was on my way to the movie theatre it was just around 2100 when i routinely spotted the orb in the night sky as it usually was when i looked up. but this time as i was watching it another orb appeared out of thin air but this one was not as bright. it hovered a few hundred feet away from the other and they sort of revolved together if that makes sense. what i mean is like the orb that appeared was changing direction in a clockwise formation to where it blocked the other orb from view and appeared on the opposite side of it. then the orb appeared to be getting closer and the single orb became the three lights i had known all too well and it flew about 500 feet away from me from over the highway to the south to the east/southeast. \r\n\r\nthree nights later as i was waiting for an uber it was back again sure enough. 20 minutes later as i was pulling up to my girlfriends apartment i looked out the window and noticed the orb was much closer and much brighter but was not pulsating just a solid white/yellow color and then it reshaped itself somehow into the triangle ship and i was able to get the best footage of it to date.","distance":"101-500

like every morning as my children went to school from their grandparents. i looked over to the east into the sky for no reason, i seen two cigar shaped objects glowing fluorescent green hovering which appeared to be hovering over the kennedy space center they were very large i slowed down to show my children i was really excited and a little scared thinking these could be ufo's as i never seen anything like this i don't know how long they were there as i had to get my children to school soon. my son remembers this day and event my daughter was to young to remember. i kept this to myself for many yrs thinking some would think i was seeing things and laugh and say i was making this up. i remember this as if it were yesterday. i learned about mufon and asked my son if he remembered this event and decided i would tell my story.Thank you, susan olive","distance":"Over One

though that intersection. blowing on my coffee and taking a sip i noticed a light moving toward me from the west. when the light became too bright for a car my heart beat began to race but before i could even think a white glowing cylinder with dome on top rounded the corner. it was hovering 3 or 4 feet above the road and the top was leaning in the direction it was moving. this amazing thing stopped at the intersection in front of my house, still hovering, and a beam of light shown down block at the houses on the west side of the street. then the beam went out the dome moved and a beam shown toward the houses on east side of the street. next the beam goes out and the dome moves then the cylinder leans west and moves down the block to the intersection where it turns a complete 360 degrees and then leans north and moves out of sight.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path then
