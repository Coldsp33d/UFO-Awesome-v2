again.\r\n     i downloaded the photos into my computer that evening however i had no reason to enlarge and inspect them at that time so they sat in their folder until july 16, 2004. when i enlarged

object in all directions at different intervals. all of the other objects were similar in shape and light features to the first object, just smaller. then the show began. the objects in total were too

were sitting there talking -when we suddenly heard a loud humming sound and heard dogs barking in the distance.\r\nwe had no idea what was going on.\r\nout of no where there was a big beautiful bright light in the sky.\r\nwe were not scared as we watched it do a light show for us.\r\nwe would say--go up and it did\r\ngo down and it did.\r\ngo to the right or left and it did as we asked.\r\nthe humming had stopped and the dogs too.\r\nwe watched this object for about 15 min.And then it vanished!\r\nwe went into town and told the sheriff and he siad we were all drunk.\r\nnot true--none of us had been drinking or doing any drugs.\r\nwe all had good eyesight and were all somewhat normal.\r\n3 nights later -at 1:00am--i started to go out my front door as my friend was leaving and that same object was above my house!\r\nit was shaped like a cigar -it was silver and it had windows and lights all around it .\r\nwe froze--thinking we were crazy.\r\nthe object just hoovered there and --poof it was gone!\r\nwe ran back into the house -somewhat scared this time.\r\nwe kept looking out the window--but it never came back.\r\nthe next morning we went to the local newspaper and told them our story.\r\nthey told us they had received over 35 calls about the same object!\r\nok --we were all 16 & 17 at the time but we know what we saw.\r\n10 days after this incident 3 men from wright patterson air base paid me a visit!\r\nthey wanted the names of everyone who was with me that night and then asked what we saw.\r\ni told them and they wrote everything down.\r\nthe older and bigger man-turned as they were leaving and stared at me and said--your mind can play some pretty weird tricks on you.\r\nthey insisted it was a weather balloon-but we knew different.\r\nweeks after the sighting i had a terrible headache and earache for 3 days.\r\ni later found out that 3 of the other people there that night --had the same thing.\r\nnow here is the spooky part.\r\nwe went out to the

was 42 years ago and in that time there are only 2 of us alive from the group that night.\r\nthe other girl --who is still alive--is the one who was at my house the night it was over my house!\r\nin

has seen 1 strange object-and it caused her to have a major car accident in 1993!\r\nthe 3 other people who were with me that night in ohio--never really believed we saw a ufo-but they never talked about it either.\r\none committed suicide--one was killed in a boating accident and the other died from cancer.\r\nin the 42 years after the sighting--i have been in 5 car accidents--2 boating

(parallel to each other) running longitudinally in direction of travel. object appeared solid when viewed through a pair of 10x50 binoculars during lapses between light pulsations. shape could not be recognized. because the theme of the event was sky-watching, i happened to have ready a pair of binoculars.\r\n\r\na single object with pulsating green lights (as described above) was visible traveling approximately 025 degrees true, (compared against the position of polaris with the chair of cassiopeia in the north-east sky), followed in less than a minute by two more identical objects in rough trailing formation. the last two objects were visible for three minutes through binoculars over a hill with an estimated topographic crest of 200 feet above base terrain. estimated speed of 24,000 feet per minute when the course was measured against a satellite image of the area.\r\n\r\nin the next hour and a half solid green intense single points of lights were visible, having the color and intensity of an emerald laser or targeting laser of russian design moving in an approximate arc from southeast to northeast, but these did not appear attached to a solid object as the first three objects and on occasion emitted an aura or laser-like luminescence that rotated or changed relative position to the point of light intensity. the speed of these lights appeared slower than the first three objects, but altitude, distance and speed were difficult to estimate. all appeared height above the high terrain by approximately 5-6 inches when measured at arms length. all solid lights appeared to fly remarkably through the same airspace (course and altitude) over the duration of their individual observations.\r\n\r\nnone of the objects or lights produced audible sound, were devoid of conventional aircraft running lights, and were radically different in appearance from aircraft, satellites, meteors and other normal night sky occurrences visible that evening.\r\n\r\nair

initially sitting on my front deck having a cigarette (my girlfriend forbids me to smoke inside) and i was trying to count the number of stars i could see - for the record, i counted less than a dozen, as here in montreal the city lights prevent us from seeing many stars at all.\r\n\r\nabove a large building directly across the street from our condo, i noticed a larger and significantly brighter light to the left of where i was looking (about a 10 o'clock from my perch and above the large building).\r\n\r\ni assumed for about 10 minutes that it was a plane as there are several planes seen flying in that direction daily.  \r\n\r\nit ttkes about 7 minutes for me to smoke one cigarette and in that time the light remained in that general area in the sky though it had moved left and right and visibly so.  i thought perhaps it were a star \"flickering\" as stars are known to do but this particular light seemed to \"dance\" - up, down and around,  then left and right again.\r\n\r\ni honestly can't tell you even an estimate of altitude,  sorry, i'm not a good judge of distance.  i finished my cigarette and stepped back into the house to ask my girlfriend to come look at the \"funky light\".\r\n\r\nher immediate assumption was \"it's a star\".  i told her to look at it - watch it closely and she then noticed as well that it appeared to be dancing about.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend ran into the house to grab a camera (kodak z740, digital) and began clicking photos.  i have all of those photos if you'd like to see them.\r\n\r\ni attempted to video the light but my camera did not function.\r\n\r\ni really can't describe any \"feelings\".  i see lights in the sky often but nothing ever looked like this.  as i write this now however,  i'm wondering only if anyone else has or will report similar sighting(s) from this area.\r\n\r\n\r\ni'm no photo expert,  nor am i a camera expert.  the 3 images i've included here are what my girlfriend took with her camera.  from what she's told me,  she's lightended or enhanced them somewhat.  we still have the originals,  and full sizes and there are many others if you need them.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\ntodd

i were coming home in his 1967 camaro convertible on a clear summer night. coming from high springs fl to our homes in nearby branford we decided to stop at a river clear as spring water (ichnetucnee ?), this was in 1976 when you could drive on either side of bridge down to waters edge to pee out of sight next to road. he drove down and turned car around so when we were done we could take right off (had to be home by 12:00). the car was 100 feet from river and each of us stood by car and when i finished i left the passenger side of car and ran down to river to get a drink, while i cupped up the water in my hands i noticed the red reflection of brake lights on the water, then realized he was still busy, that's when i turned thinking maybe another car stopped and bam my life forever changed. hwy 27 is a small two lane road and right in the middle of it was a red or more so of an orange craft encased in a perfect sphere of what i can only describe as energy, no sound, none just drifting over the road heading the way we were at maybe 10 miles an hour. this thing was about the size of a dumptruck 25 feet above the road. i remember this as if it just happened, i walked to the car never taking my eyes off of this craft until my friend yelled for me to get in (he was scared and in shock, i just wanted to meet who was in it). we sat there and i say hey, lets go i want to see what this really is and he slowly pulled up the incline back to the road and now we are right behind it. the top of the car was down and i'm standing in the floorboard hanging over the windshield trying to see details through this glow, i can see structure but can make out no details (other than something is in the orange sphere),i notice the wind making tears so i duck under the windshield, then decide to see how fast we are going, trust me when i say this poor inline 6 cyl on its best day could not go 110 but thats what the speedo said and it was pegged. he's asking what is it whats inside and i say i'm not sure but it's fixing to wipe out a caution light hanging across the road and we better back off in case the cable's fly through this car, and just before it hits them it turns up and to the left so fast missing the caution light, left from where we were to making an arc folling the planet curve into nothing in 3 to 5 seconds. i'm 45 now but that night i was 16 and right then i knew this was not from here, and while i wanted to believe in ufo's, i always said if i ever see one, then maybe i would. the maybe was always because in my mind, if i ever did see anything, it would be too far away for me to be sure if it were from earth or not. that would not be the case as i learned, we followed this craft for three miles at low speed, kept the same distance from that to over 100 mph for maybe 3 mins. i said to my friend because we were both going ape over this that maybe we should not say anything more until we can write down what we each saw, and draw it also when we got home, our notes matched and then we began to talk more of it. i have only heard of a few people who descibe what i saw that night, and i believe them- now.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

light low in the sky.  i showed my friend and we watched it as it travelled east, and then turned south.  i could not make out a shape.  but, living this close to pittsburgh international, i can tell you that if it were an airplane, how low and close it was to us.  we should have been able to hear something.  but, it was silent.  it only appeared to be an orangish colored light.  and, it would brighten up and dim out at times.  this sighting went on for about a minute.  until we lost it behind some houses.  i would also like to point out that it was headed north.  if it had been going to the airport on a normal flight pattern, it would have been heading west.  if it had been a jet just taking off, it would have been gaining altitude.  it was headed in the general direction towards downtown.\r\n\r\nafter seeing this.  my friend and i walked out to the road to see if this object was visable again.  it was not.  we were both scanning the skies, seeing if there was anything going on.  i turned around, and saw my friend looking at something.  i looked up and saw a white flashing strobe.  it was pretty high up, travelling north.  nothing appeared out of the ordinary.  it was completely consistant with what a jet would be doing.  just as i was thinking that, the strobes stopped.  my friend turned around, and was freaked out a little.  i told him i had seen it.  and kept looking.  about 5 seconds later, they reappeared.  still travelling along the same path, same apparent speed, etc.  another 5 seconds went by, and they stopped again.  they did not start back up.  i am sure this could have been an airplane of some sort.  but, i have never seen, or heard of one flying blacked out like that.  the strobes were the only lights on it.  i never saw any marker lights.\r\n\r\nafter a few more minutes, we decided to go back up to the porch, as our necks were hurting from standing out in the road staring straight up at the sky.  we were laying out on some lawn chairs just discussing what we had seen.  trying to come up with reasonable explainations.  at this time, i saw what appeared to be a satellite travelling north.  i pointed it out to my friend and we watched it traverse the sky.  after about 30 seconds of watching it, i told him the one i had seen the night before (in another state) was a lot brighter.  just after i said that, this object got much brighter.  it stayed that way for a second, and then dimmed back out.  my friend was a little freaked out.  but, i didn't find it alarming.  i know they have satellites (iridium) which can appear to flare up, and dim out like that.  i continued to watch it though.  then about 10 seconds later, it flared up big time.  like nothing i have ever seen.  it was just a bright flash, a very bright flash.  it made me jump a little.  after the flash, the object was no longer visable.  i've seen satellites plenty of times.  it was clear last night.  i should have been able to see a satellite for quite a bit more time.  it was just simply gone.\r\n\r\ni am a fairly experienced observer.  i keep up on what we have up there, and how it's supposed to behave.  i can't explain what the orangish colored light was.  i do no know why that \"plane\" blacked out like that.  and if that was a satellite, it flared up much brighter than i have ever seen an iridium satellite flare.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501

saw a object streak to the east so i moved the camera to the east about 3 mins later i heard a very strange low humming noise like an electrical noise or the hum of a generator coming from the sky above me and you can hear it in the video but at first i didn't see anything then from behind a cloud something was moving to the west. i aimed the camcorder up and tried to zoom in on it and i got to tell you it���s very difficult to clearly film something when it���s moving and you are zoomed in on it.\r\n\r\ni just viewed the film and most of it is blurry due to the constant moving to keep the

strange looking and i have no idea what it is.\r\ni do know it���s not a plane. planes at night you cannot see them in the dark sky except the blinking lights.\r\nthis object was lit up. its kind of long like a cigar shape and it was moving to the right in the pictures. i thought it was a triangle at first but after reviewing the object on digital video i think it was cigar shape.\r\nno blinking

cigarette.  a fluttering light in the sky caused me to look up, and i watched the object until it was too far away to see anymore. at first i thought it might be the police helicopter that flies around the skies in our neighbourhood often, but it was too high up, and moved in strange motions at times.  it fluttered in a white flash, and was alot faster then the usual commercial jets that fly over our house everyday.  the object at times \"swerved\" at incredible speeds, unlike anything i've ever seen in the sky before.  i'd estimate that it traveled about 10 times faster than the normal aircraft we usually see. i did not hear any noise as i watched the object.  it almost seemed to fly in strange flight paths at times, almost like a drunk driver might do..Ie all over the road.  it seemed pretty high up, and i could not decipher a shape.  after seeing it, i was amazed, i wouldn't say it's a life changing experience, but i don't get excited too easily lol. i've always wondered if people just make up the stories about ufo's, but know i now...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5097,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.553384,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07172006-0002","longitude":-113.485032,"occurred":1153165500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1153165500000,"summary":"Fluttering

much to my surprise, one of them had an object in the upper right corner that looks like the classic flying disc/saucer that has become the symbol of ufology. i didn't see any flying objects while taking the picture, so i can't describe its movements and actions. i'm sure i would have remembered if a helicopter had flown by when i took the picture. unfortunately, it's not the best quality, and the bright sunlight made the details somewhat fuzzy. i'm still intriqued by the shape of the object in this photo and wanted to share it. the meta data (date taken, camera used, etc.) of the photo has

my duties was to put our training aircraft and our charter twin in the hanger at the end of the day.Twilight would best describe the visual conditions.After putting the single engine trainers in the hanger i was preparing to put the twin engine airplane in.(cessna 310)i happened to notice movement in the lower horizon off to the east,(the hanger doors have a southern exposure)i observed four or five opaque disc,s in a single north/south line traveling westward,they disappeared from sight as they reached the western horizon.This took approximately less than a minute.I could not make out any identifying characteristics but i believe they were fairly high,and about three inches in diameter.It is difficult to judge size as one dosn,t know the altitude they are at, there were no contrails nor lights of any kind or any sound.I had lived at the airport all of my life and was familiar with many aircraft,whether this was one object with multiple lights or four or five separate ones is difficult to say with any certaincy.But due to the spacing i,m inclined to say the disc,s were seperate objects.The sighting of these opaque disc,s got my attention because there wasn,t any type of navigation lights,nor rotating beacon lights,then as i listened for the sound of engine noise,thinking i should be able to hear something,but nothing was heard.From what i can remember they crossed the horizon a lot faster than any aircraft i had seen.At the time i thought it might be a ufo but was reluctant to say anything for fear of ridicule,i have 7000 hrs ,most in charter or corporate aircraft ,the largest i have flown is a lear and i have 1000hrs in those.(24,25,35).I am currently working as a aircraft mechanic for a major airline.I have never seen anything since that approximates what i saw and have never spoken to anyone who saw anything similar.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

back and forth, something caught my left corner eye and i thought it was an airplane so i starred at it a little bit, but then suddenly it was moving very very weirdly, it was moving like scribbling on paper, the object looked like a starry, sphere, bright, circle light in the sky, and like i said it was moving like scribbling on paper and then when it was moving to the right very slowly, and then it started to dim very softly,and then it just disappeared, also the object had no sound at all, just completely silent like it had no engine in it. my reactions was excited, thats all just excited, then i ran to the door inside my house then i told my dad \"hey dad i saw a ufo a little bit ago\" and he didnt believe me that much, he thought i was lying to him but it was real. also the way i lost sight of the object was when it started to dim to the right it just disappeared.
