unusual earlier in the evening.\r\naround 11:30pm i was just about to call it a night when i saw a bright streak come from the east move to the southwest. so i aimed the camcorder towards where i saw the object go.\r\n5 mins later i saw it.\r\nit was i'd say a mile from me just above the clouds and it pulsated 3 times than blinked out to nothing.\r\nabout 10 mins later another object streaked by moving in the same direction maybe the same object moving back to the original area.\r\ni viewed it on video but it���s too hard to see.\r\nthese are the same objects i have been seeing now for over 8 weeks in this area.\r\nthese objects move so fast they look like shooting stars. they are moving at very high rate of speed to from one spot to another location in the blink of an eye almost like a sci-fi movie.\r\nnothing could catch these objects we have on this planet.\r\nso this is 4 nights in a row that i have seen these objects.\r\ni wonder if anyone reading this in the boca, delray, palm beach areas are seeing these objects as well.\r\ni don't think they show up on radar because i have not seen any military aircraft chasing them. the funny thing is it seems they can make themselves invisible by just turning off their light, without the light you would never know they were there.\r\ni was tempted to try and signal them with a flashlight but i decided i didn't want to take a chance on inviting something that i may not like to see or experience so i'll just keep trying to catch them on film.\r\n\r\nthese craft are coming to this area for a reason and i don't know why.\r\ni know others are seeing these objects here they are just not reporting them.\r\ni'll just keep reporting what i see.\r\nthanks

post on the ufo network symposium.  the article mentions ken storch, who while working for offutt afb new of 5 ufo's flying in formation.\r\n\r\ni was a senior in high school in 1974 and did a lot of star gazing with a friend.  he had a 8 inch reflector telescope and we spent many hours at night looking at the stars.  we saw the five objects pass across the view in the telescope.\r\n\r\nwe were both amazed at how fast they were moving.  no plane could have moved that fast. i am a sky watcher and even the satelites were not moving that fast.   in fact we could not even follow the objects with

in the house was already watching there own shows so i decided to head out side,so i grabbed up my radio and headed out side to the garage were we had a tv that was hooked to cable and a v.C.R..It was night out side and the stars were out which i noticed when i stepped outside,,but something caught my eye's and totally ignored going into the garage and kep walking until i was almost in the street but just kep looking up,,,all i saw was the incredable formation of red lights slightly to the right of are house about 200 yards away,,,i new yards well because i used to go to the shooting range with my dad,,,anyway's it was just sitting there in the night sky!!,just those red lights!!!,no noise  no nothing just sitting there!,,the formation almost looked like two circles slightly over lapping each other from the middle.I wanted to tell someone about this so i looked over to my friends house and seen him doing homework threw his huge front window,,,so i ran over and banged on his window and told him to come out for a look!! so he too came running out and ran right past me over to my house before i could and instantly started yelling at me that those red lights were going out one by one!!!! so i ran over and seen only two lights left,out of 24 lights! two were only left in the sky....Thay looked alot like head lights on a car except more spread apart,,,then all of a sudden thay came together and \"hooked up\" so now only one light was left!!!!...Then the light started blinking and it started slowly flying away from us until it was gone from are sights over the hill going towards the ocean,only to leave us wandering what it was!!!,people in san diego are used to seeing jets and blimps flying around making tons of noise!!! but what me and my friend saw that night was not that of a normal aircraft,but just after that i heard about what happened over the sky's over phoenix arizona!!!!,,,people say that it only happened there!! that's just totally not true,,it

before we went to bed.  we were standing in our driveway, looking north towards springfield, and  i noticed a very large bright light in the sky.  i have no idea how far away it was, because it seemed so large that it was hard to judge how far away it was.  it was lower than you would expect an aircraft, but the cell phone tower in the distance was at least three inches below it, relatively speaking.  i pointed it out to my husband and he said, \"that has to be a tower or something, it's too bright for a plane.\"  however, the object slowly moved straight drown, and then seemed to 'float' back up again.  it did this for about three or four mintues, and we started to really get weirded out.  it had no defining shape because it was so bright, that the only thing we could see was the light it was emitting.  if i was holding and object in my hand, and trying to cover the entire thing up, it would have had to be pretty large...At least the size of a softball.\r\n\r\nwe stood there watching this thing, and my eyes actually started to hurt looking at it.  i would liken this to standing beneath a street light and staring straight into it.  my husband suddenly pointed to the west, and we saw a helicopter start circling this thing.  it completed two very wide circles around it, and then swung around again and started heading straight for it.  as it got closer, the bright object ascended slowly, and we suddenly heard  a very deep loud rumble, similiar to the sound of a large plane.  as the helicopter approached, the object began heading west, seemingly straight for the helicopter.  my husband said, \"oh my god, they are going to hit eachother.\" because that's how close they were.  however, the helicopter passed underneath it, and when they were right next to eachother, the helicopter looked dwarfed.  the helicopter's light looked like a tiny pinpoint of light next to this object...So either, the helicopter was abnormally small, or this onject was huge and much farther away than we had orginally thought.  when the object passed the helicopter it sped up and just raced away to the northwest.  it was weird because before it had looked like a giant ball of light hovering, and suddenly all we could see were lights flashing in a very fast strobe like matter all along the bottom of it, which appeared to be completely flat and straight. this was no steady delayed light flashing, it was continously flashing one after another in the line so that it looked like the bottom of the obejct was actually rotating.\r\n\r\nthe helicopter swung back around and followed after it, and then we lost track of both of them.\r\n\r\ni do not pretend to know what this thing was, but it was not something i have ever seen before.  i have never seen two aircraft pass by eachother in such a haphazard way, and i have never seen something so bright and large hover in such a manner.  i would like to call the radio station and ask if anyone else has reported seeing this, but i am a little afraid to do so.  i don't mind talking to an investigator, but i don't want my name to be used as a 'witnesss' in any public forum.  i just don't want people to think i'm crazy.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nemily weaver\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

ocean looking southwest. i have always loved to stargaze and search for shooting stars and admire the night sky. i noticed a large, redish colored star and pointed to it about to ask everyone else what star they thought it was(it looked like mars but a bit bigger) but by the time the question left my mouth, it somewhat slowly disappeared. confused, i said \"what the fuck was that?\" convinced that is was not just a shimmering star or some sort of aircraft, i continued to look in that direction, thinking that it might re-appear. about 30 minutes later, in the same area of the sky above the ocean, a small light started to shine and slowly disappear again. \"look, look, look, there it is again!\" i said. melina and kristy turned around and missed it but my brother, sam, caught the light disappearing. i saw it happen about three more times that night with kristy and melina finally witnessing one of them. they all went to bed and on the last one of the evening i saw 2 lights. they never reappeared in the same spot but did stay in the general area. i came inside to get my other brother, michael, but by the time he and his friend came out to see it...It never showed up again. during this time, kristy and i also noticed some small \"blinking\" lights that flew around the sky as well. they did not seem like planes, since their patterns were not normal. their were 2 lights that traveled together and looked connected somehow. when the last ones we noticed flew away, i never saw the redish-orange light that appeared and reappear again that night.\r\nthe next night, around the same time, i decided to see if it showed up again and had them all come out and join me(so i would not think i was crazy). we saw it again. the first one was 2 lights. they were further apart than the night before and one turned on before the other one and faded before the other one faded too. my brother, michael, saw it this time. it happened a couple of more times that night and stopped before midnight. just like the night before. our first reactions were to *rule out\" possibilities like, flares, satellites, etc., but could not make sense of any of our guesses.\r\nthe next night was the most active, again around the same time and always in the general area over the ocean. i first saw one light appear and reappear, then we saw 2 lights again, this time very clear. the night before they were a little faint. after about 10 minutes, i saw the clearest most interesting one(chills). one light appeared, then another, then another then another. all slowly turing on and off, making part of a shape(sort of a line). note that all of these lights, when gone, left no trace. they totally disappeared. beforer this most graphic one, i counted around 15 \"little\" lights like i mentioned before. the sky seemed filled with these tiny white blinking lights traveling in odd patterns...Then they all were gone. after a longer period of nothing, we noticed a couple of tiny ones return to the same area, gather and venture off in another direction. as they returned, my brother and i saw the bigger, darker light reappear in another part of the sky, near the area where we saw the majority of them. this time, we saw more than 2 lights again and then it reappeared a fair distance away, making it seem like it moved a long distance in a short amount of time. during these sightings, we never heard a noise. the lights were always a redish color. the last night we saw them, it seemed to go on a little later. the first couple of nights it ended around 11:30 or so. this night, it was almost midnight before we gave up.\r\n\r\ni have seen a lot of things in my life but nothing like this. one of my brothers went to duke engineering school and my other brother lives in mcminnville, or and always plays the role of \"devil's advocate\". neither one of them could explain it. i don't know if there was a connection between the big light and the little traveling ones but their seemed to be...Each time our eyes noticed the little guys, the bigger one would show up...Almost like it was a *mother* ship to these little ones. regardless, i would be more skeptical if the light was always in the same spot or always remained *one* light but we saw one, two three and even four at different times and at different spots above the ocean. it made a pattern...Or so it seemed. i got chills after seeing the object, especially the 2 times it showed mutliple lights.\r\n\r\nmy account is described much better while discussing it. typing it out seems to lose some of the content i observed. i guess this whole experience could be explained as being *military operations* but for some reason, it feels different. there was not a consistency with them, like i mentioned. most of the lights seen were just *one* light appearing and disappearing...But to also see them multiply was odd. sometimes 2 lights and obviously the ones that had 3 to 4. flares? nope. weather balloon? i don't think so. helicopters? no. these lights looked and felt different. \r\n\r\nwe went outside the last night to see them again(hopefully for the 4th night in a row) but it was very cloudy and nothing showed up. it was our last night at sunset beach. we, as a family, have been coming here since we were kids and watched the sky a lot, never seeing anything like this. if it were *military*, then i would think that we would have experienced these lights before but the nearest base is cherry point and it is in the opposite direction we were looking in. this was over the ocean. \r\n

hill to where i could see the marin county civic center i felt that the hwy next to it looked oddly wrong.  as i continued to drive in heavy traffic the hwy was replace by a prussian blue light which then changed to silver as i approached it.  this was wider than the whole hwy and about 10 ft above it  a huge traffic jam was piled up under the light as traffic slowed to a crawl.  as i got close i saw that it was a huge silver colored ufo directly over the hwy.  in front of the ufo was a screen on arms that probably came out from unde rhte ufo as the bottem  was rough on it not smooth.  the screen reflected the scene behind the ufo hiding it. but as i approached it the screen failed to hide it.  i drove under it expecting to get zapped to mars or something and was greatly occupied avoiding other cars whose drivers were in shock.  the thing was a vivid impression of contemptuous power  it was silent. only the screen showed any light.  i didnot notice and ring of vents on it.  thousands of people saw the thing going to work nothing at all was in the media about it.  about ten yearw later my sister and her children saw a similar object in the same spot  while driving on 101 a huge ufo came over the hill from san rafael and hovered over the hwy at the civic center  my sister pull off on a side road to watch it and she aher children were so close that as she said she could bounce a ball off it it made a low hummin noise.  no onw on the hwy seemed to see the ufo and she felt atht the people were dammend idiots as they buzzed under it  four military helicopeter come over the ill and chased the ufo around the area at low altitude while my sister watched.  finally the ufo took off towards the north with the helicopters after it.  my sister felt that she was the only one who noticed the event. later my nephew had a girl friend who lived in that area and she said that at night goblins used to come and take her out of the window and that she had to dance with them in the driveway.  she insisted that she was telling the truth and that the goblins were very scarey  i had nodoubts that the thing i saw was a ufo and my sister had no doubts about waht she saw.  i felt that is was clear indication of alin power but i was used to seeing thing slike that as a kid.  i lost sight of it driving over the hill trying to avoid other drivers in a panic state.  now a question was the ufo i saw there to pick up or deliver some one since it was at the civic center?  the screen was an attempt to hide the ufo from iew.  how many silver colored ufos were screens viewed at a wrong angle to hide thing.  the original scene went trhough a color change as i approached it which would seem to indicate that the screen is limited in its ability to hide things depending on the

the vents would rotate counter clock wise  looking into the vents i saw a hollow tube with a wieght on the end in the back of the vent.  the inside of the vent was dark like soot but it did nto rub off on my hand. the band of vents was about 30 inches in width.  a tail on the top of the thing ran from the top out to the edge then stopped  it was on the half blocked off by the wall  the hole thing was very strongly build and lookedvery heavy.  as we exsamined the thing we got worried that the owners would come back for it and then the war would be on.  it was a classical shaped ufo with a tail.  i had tiemto examine it and to touch and feel the stars literally.  we finally silently slipped back into the trees like indians leaving the craft to its owners  we noticed the thing immediately on entering the clearing and it was very obvious that it was a ufo   i was excited about it and i tried to learn as much as i could about it but none of us wanted to stick our head into the hatch where it was dark inc contrast to the bright sun out side.  it was shut off and did nothing as we examined it.  we last saw it as we left through the trees.  i touched the stars  we accepted it as normal in that we always saw wierd stuff and wierder critters.  it was part of life as a kid living next to an air base that you saw ufos and strange stuff.  that was because the bugs as i called them lived in an underground base in the hill which is a whole another thing to talk about.  why was the un founded in san francisco?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5064,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.1074198,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07122006-0006","longitude":-122.5697032,"occurred":-412963200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Saturn-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-412963200000,"summary":"While

appeared  between the jetliner���s contrail and looked to be following it. it remained behind the jetliner for approx. 30 seconds and then disappeared. i had my kodak z740 camera which has a pretty
