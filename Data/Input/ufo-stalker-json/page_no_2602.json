me at about 2:30 this morning, i took him out. his run  opens out from the back of the garage, so all i had to do was open the door, and out he went. he does not run  loose. i stood waiting on him when i noticed a quick flash of light up on  the hill south of my house near my storage shed up there. the yard lights do not reach up that far, and it was pitch black where the light occurred. at first i thought of fireflies, but it was too large. i kept watching, and in a few seconds  it appeared again, only down the hill a bit toward the house. it appeared to be a solid light about a foot high, and perhaps an inch across. it flashed on about a second or two, then off, as before. it was moving down the hill about an estimated 10 feet at a time, and about 5 or 6 feet off the ground. this same thing happened 6 or 7 times until it was about 15 feet from the house, when it turned to the right of me, and took off into the woods. it flashed once as it turned, then i didn���t see it again,

that connects i-95 and i-81. we returning from south carolina after seeing my sister in the hospital, she died nov, 24,1981 shortly after our return to ny.I know it was the last part of oct or 1st part of nov because my wife and i were riding in the back seat and looking at the full moon and the date of my sisters death. my brother was driving and sister was napping in the front passanger seat, my wife and i were in the back. it was very early in the morning as the moon was high and very bright as it was a crystal clear night, i beleive the moon was to our left and up as you look up & out the rear window. as i was observing the moon and how it ilumminated a very round mountain down in the valley to our right, you could make out terrain features in the light, i noticed a firey comet like object approaching from behind us and up the small valley. i told my wife to look quick and she observed it pass behind the round mountain and up the valley. it was a classic war of the worlds type firey commet, long white tail, etc. it was bright enough that it illuninated the round mountain it went behind and the one on the otherside of the small valley, you could see the color of the trees as it passed into the valley. we expected to see an impact flash or fire or something as it passed just behind the round mountain but it just dissipeared as if a door had opened and swallowed it up. it came in at about a 15 to 20 angle to the earth and staight up the little valley, no waver or adjustment to its path. at that angle it seemed almost parrell to the valley floor and looked like it was sure to hit that little round mountain & explode. but it was just like it was swallowed up and the like was shut off like a switch. my brother did not see it as he had been driving for along time and it happend so fast, 2 or 3 seconds and the occurance started to our immedieate right rear and ended to our immedieate right. it was a full moon there was no other traffic on the road,seemed like uninhabted country side, observing the full moon i observed no aircract and the little mountain was only 1 mile +/_ 1/2 mile away. the firey object was so big i thought it was the end of the world, a very very large house sized object. my sister slept through the whole thing. we did not stop and my brother just thought my wife and i were a little nuts or tired from the trip, we know what we saw. its been alot of years but my wife and i have always wanted to seek out the location once again & walk back into that little valley to see whats there or whats up back there that could hide something the size of that fire ball, old war of the worlds type fire ball not the tom cruise one. i watched the news for any reports after that but saw nothing and did not know who to report it to, but have always wondered.

did not feel so well so we went to the bedroom to lay down. around 6:45 - 7pm a storm was coming in and my bedroom window was open. i get up to close the window, and i look out the window and see what appears to be a blimp floating about 300 - 400 feet above the buildings 1-2 blocks away. about the size of a cue ball in my view. my 1st reaction was \" what are these guys crazy?, flying this low in brooklyn?, i hope they are ok\" about 5 seconds later, it was slowly heading in my direction and thats when i got a real good look at it and said to myself i can't be seeing this! i saw what appeared to be a stingray fish looking blimp! it was porclin white with a bright orange boarder, like a decal or some kind of sticker boarder. a light glowing reddish orange mist? around the ship and a metallic looking ball (orb)in the center. it was floating so gracefully, like it didnt have a care in the world. it truly was a beautiful craft. as it got a little closer i noticed it was moving back and forth, in lets say feet to where it was. and out from my right a dark small storm cloud about the size of the craft, came towards the craft fast and within approx 50 feet, a thick bluish orange bolt came out and hit the metal orb and it made a bright flash and just dissapeared! at that point i jumped back thinking that the craft has just expolded, expecting parts to be all over the streets below. after i kept looking and seen no trace of it, thats when i realized it just vanished from my point of view. right before the cloud came in, it acted like it was waiting for the bolt or like fine tuning a radio station. or like harpooning a fish. when the bolt hit, it made a hollow bursting sound. at that point i started to freak out knowing that what i just saw was real and i was not just seeing lights in the sky. i mean it was daylight out and right in front of my eyes! my girlfriend jumps out of bed from her relaxed state, sees me shaking and repeating myself over and over again \"oh my god!\" she says i am scaring her and what was that sound? i thought she was asleep and when she said that, i felt somewhat relieved knowing that atleast she heard that! i told her that i just seen a ufo and it just vanished and the sound she heard was it getting hit by a bolt of lightning! she calmed me down and she looked worried knowing me for 12 years never seen me so dumbfounded. i was in complete shock. always imagined it would be an experience at night, all the way up in the sky, with blinking colored lights like everyone always describes. never would i have thought it would be like this!!! i figured someone else had to have seen it. so around 10 pm after i somewhat calmed down, i am on my way to the pizzaria and i see in the sky above my head, in front of my building about 800 - 1000 ft 1 white orb flying by fast but smooth. following it was 1 black orb and 2 more white orbs in a triangle formation. at this point i am really starting to hit a point where i felt like i was dreaming or in a twilight zone and this was not happening. i mean 2 encounters in 1 evening? i felt like if next they were gonna land and it would be all over the news! seemed like there must have been up there all night. so i walk fast to the pizzaria to see a friend who works there and quietly asked him, if he hears of any stories of a craft above the buildings to let me know. he freaked out and told me to tell his co workers. when i did they looked at him with eyes wide! he told me that a week prior in bensonhurst, he seen the same exact craft i seen and described it exactly. says he got abused by his co workers telling him if et comes tell him we give him a free pie on the house! ridiculed all week long. now we were like little kids telling our story back and forth with relief and excietment. he also mentioned a close encounter when he lived in italy both he and his brother had. where they both seen a triangle craft. but he heard a noise and his brother didnot. this seemed to bother him. says it so confused. but we both felt a huge relief that we actually seen the same craft and no longer will he be made fun of! says no one believed him. i told him that i wouldnt have either! until that 25 second time of my life i was a skeptic. i did research on google to find that brooklyn is a hotbed for ufo activity. never would i have thought that such a populated area would be so happening with ufo activity. i cant stop looking out my window thinking i will see another ufo again. everywhere i go, i look up. hopeing i will see another to show people, and maybe someone in her neighborhood will see me and figure out why i am looking up. i don't want to ask anyone, thinking everyone will think i am crazy or on drugs. i also called 9-11 asking if anything was reported? nothing, so i asked them to report this. her tone of voice was like, go to bed. it has been about a week now and my girlfriend says i am obsessing over this. i can't help but be totally wanting answers that i know i wont get. strange how basically a 25 sec exp could change your life in a strange way! also note that the sunday it happened, most people in that neighborhood went away for 4th of july weekend, which cut the number of witnesses probably in half. but i still feel someone had to have seen it as well. there are still alot of people around where it was floating. i don't know what to make of this. but i do know what i saw, and will never forget that day. and the moment plays in my mind like a broken record. from that day on, i will always be a skywatcher!

something new from grissom air force base, but were told if it was flying less than 1000 feet, someone was in big trouble.  i know it wasn't the stealth bomber because i had seen this and it wasn't

difficulty focusing on the craft as i tried to determine what was so peculiar about what i was seeing. i kept an eye on the craft for about 10 seconds. i was so momentarily distracted, because of the traffic, that when i looked back within seconds the craft disappeared. it didn't appear to be traveling at a speed that would have hidden it in a cloud bank at the moment that i was distracted. it was as if it blinked out of view! another oddity was that its relationship to the local airport was not consistent with normal arriving and departing flights. it was too large to be an overflight. it was

it stopped.  i thought i may have lost sight of it, but no, it was still there.  then it started to move to the left, right, back, stayed in place, but never moved far from where it stopped.  the movements were jerky arcs with sudden stops.  after watching it for a while, wondering what the heck it was, i knocked off back to bed.\r\n\r\ni've spend a good deal of time checking out satellite, iss, space shuttle, etc., locations and have found nothing that was scheduled to be in the sky this morning.  i'm waiting for the local weather station (noaa) to accept calls this afternoon to ask for weather balloon launches.\r\n\r\ni did wake up my fiance and she did see it - but she wasn't too interested.\r\n\r\nmy actions/reactions are nothing really to speak of... i doubt i will ever find out what it was, but i'm going to keep my eyes open.\r\n\r\ni did call the local police dept. for a report of the incident.  they said an officer saw something so they investigated and found nothing.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:48:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":5027,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.9044444,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062006-0001","longitude":-93.7438889,"occurred":1152174300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1152174300000,"summary":"Tracked like a satellite then stopped, then moved irregularly in a small area","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"St Bonifacius, Minnesota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:513322"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"El Cajon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I looked out the window at approx. 9:00pm, as i heard fireworks.  i saw a samll red dot high in the sw sky.  it became increasingly larger and brighter, as if it were descending.  my wife thought it was a meteorite falling;
