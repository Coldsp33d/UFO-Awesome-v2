have witnessed many celestial anomalies. i know that atmospheric conditions can create some pretty unusual illusions, as can meteors entering our atmosphere. i've never had any interest in ufos and thought most people reporting sightings were pretty much crackpots. (sorry if that offends anyone.)the event i witnessed on saturday june 24th, 2006 has me completely baffled.\r\ni was standing in the parking lot of my business chatting with an employee when i noticed something unusual float by overhead. at first, i thought it was a balloon that had escaped a child's grasp. i would have completely dismissed the object had i not realized it floated and traveled in the sky in a direction perpendicular to the wind direction.\r\nwhen i brought my employee's attention to the object, he noticed something unusual in the sky to the north. hundreds of small cloud-like objects seemed to be materializing in the sky. these objects were traveling down from the heavens in an arc toward our position. three larger cloud-like objects appeared simultanously and traveled at a level altitude to a point directly overhead where they became stationary.\r\nthe smaller objects continued downward. as they came lower, the mist that shrouded them began to evaporate, revealing a shimmering egg-shaped object. they appeared a bit translucant and at this point seemed like a school of jellyfish approaching. when they reached a point over our heads, the outer \"skin\" had become clear and looked like a flexible membrane. the objects floated noiselessly passed us at two to three times treetop level at a rate of speed faster than the cars passing on the street--speed limit on the street is 45 mph.\r\nas each object passed, we were able to notice more and more details. the first of which was a series of bright silver flashing lights inside the membrane at its bottom. in the interior of each membrane was a segmented globe-like object, much like a soccer ball. the sections of the globes seemed reflective, not of the sun but the sky around it. under the globe, wires or struts came out to a pointed horseshoe-shaped object, on which flashed the bright silver lights mentioned before. all the objects traveled at matching speed and flight patterns, much like a flock of birds. they reached their lowest point just overhead then curved skyward to a point where they seemlingly disappeared.\r\nthe event last from 10 to 15 minutes, and literally hundreds of objects passed by.\r\nit is my opinion that these objects were mechanical in nature and constructed in such a way as to be unnoticed. in pondering the event, i've concluded that these objects desended from the colder upper atmoshere. when they reached a lower altitude, thay passed through a hot, moisture rich thermal layer, which created the mist around them--very similar to taking an ice cube out of the freezer on a hot, humid day. it was during this period of time during which the objects temperatures equalized with the air that they were visible.\r\nmy employee managed to take a snapshot of the event with his camera phone. in viewing the photo on the tiny phone screen, some of the objects are visible but very little detail can be seen on such a small screen. apparently, my employee does not have email capacity with his phone service, as he has been unable to email a copy to me. he states he can, however, send the photo to another picture phone. i am very interested in finding some one who can recieve this photo via phone message and return a copy to me via email so i may study the objects further. since this event happen, it has been driving me nuts as to what in creation these objects are. if you can offer any help in this regard, i would greatly appreciate hearing from you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":5012,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7612778,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07032006-0003","longitude":-84.1897469,"occurred":1151170200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1151170200000,"summary":"Strange

of the pond everything became still the pond became like glass the object sank then they saw a whilpool in the pond about 8 to 10 feet across it went very fast across the pond towards them and when it hit the water there was steam that went up from the object then the object disappeared to reappear in another area , one of the children got on a boat that was at the bank and she could see lights around the sides and the object looked like metal two other children said they saw the lights but two of them said it looked yellow under the water , three of the children ran into the house but were unable to discuss what they had seen then the other two were still watching it when they saw the water next to them start to move and the grass around the pond near where they were standing started moving violently so they got scared and ran to the  house.It took them about three hours before they would tell us what had happened and what they saw they were very disturbed but each one said the same story and they range from 7 years old to 13 years old. the next day we drove around the pond to see where they had seen the splash, not knowing what we would find and we were amazed to find tracks  like truck tracks that led to the pond but before it got to the  pond the tracks stop and there was a circle where the grass had been  laid down then it must have been air borne but the grass at the edge of the pond  had been bent down where it must have passed as it splashed in the  pond. the strange thing about the tracks was that the grass laid down the wrong way from the way grass normally falls down  we followed the tracks until we came to where they ended and there was grass laid down in an arc shape. this happened in our hay field that hadn't been hayed yet. the children had no idea what they had seen but they were very upset. also they said there was a cloud over them that was swirling the older children thought it might be a tornado also they said that the cloud had a sound like a muffled lawn mower they thought at first it was thunder but then they forgot about everything when they saw this object go into the pond.When i became concerned that the water in the pond might be contaminated i called the osu extension agency and took a sample of the pond water to the man in charge and when he asked me  what i was concerned about i related the story and he said he knew exactly what i was talking about , there had been two other families that had seen the same thing our children had seen and it had scared them so bad they wouldn't talk about it . please let me know if you are familiar with this sort of ufo because i want to know if they are dangerous and if the water is contaminated because of some kind of fumes it might let

brighter and was glowing an orange and appeared quite close to us in the sky, as i kept watching, it all of a sudden burst out what looked like a cloud of rain, sort of like fireworks made of cloud.

one group, but remaining as two distinct flying objects one following the other. this distance between each during the break up formation was just bigger than a hairline from the distance observed, about half the size of each individual shape.\r\n\r\n5) continued observing the objects as we drove and then parked at huron plaza on 84th. i noticed that the objects seemed to have a halo around them, where the sky nearest to the object was brigher, and the halo was a darker color of sky with normal sky outside that area. it was faint and perhaps a trick of the setting sun, but i mentioned it as soon as i observed it.  a good way to illustrate the halo would be to touch a finger to an lcd flat screen monitor set on a sky image, the distortion of color is somewhat the same.\r\nmy family

finish a cigarette, and they did not move at all. i attempted to photograph the objects but they  were so small at this point i had enough trouble just finding them with my eye, therefore was only aim

but more a point of light that elongated in both directions in a split second and was gone. there were no other vehicles in the sky as i scanned to relocate the previous objects and cross the parking lot to the buffet.\r\n\r\ni've attached a \"sketch\" of my best recollection of the activities i observed, the upper portion of the image is a very general impression of the motion, and the black diamond is my best guess as to the actual shape of the objects when they were not grouped. it was the ungrouping that really stood out and shocked me, if they had remained in formation i would have assumed birds or  jets, but they clumped back together into a single object (each of two) . i should also note that there were no lights on these objects, nor color reflections from the sun, they remained black at all times.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

happened.  while racoon hunting one night in november a few years or so after i got married,in the 80's, my hunting dogs came back to me which was very unusal as they just don't do that.  i noticed a low object about 1,000 feet above the trees or so, coming towards me over the field.  it made no noise and it had  3 large white lights in a triangle shape.  i could tell how big it was because it blocked out the stars.  i thot it might have been a b-2 bomber but it made no noise, none! i squated down with my dogs, who were freaked out, and sat quietly and observed it. it continued flying very slow over this field then it left the area. later while sharing my experience, i talked to another person who had been traveling that night on hwy. 71 in our area, who informed me that there were several cars stopped and pulled over who also viewed this same object that i viewed.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
