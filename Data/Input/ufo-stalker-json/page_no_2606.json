was a plane, but as i watched it move, it moved under the clouds, and i thought for as small as it was, it should have moved above or into the clouds.  no vapor trail, and it was silent.  as it moved to the south, it didn't seemed to move forward as deliberately and steadily as a plane would.  at times i thought the speed of the object varied, and at times i thought it changed directions slightly....Perhaps it actully did veer to the west at some point.  i first noticed it at a position in the sky of two o'clock, with twelve being straight above me.  within a time of a little over thirty seconds, it traveled south until it disappeared, the distance of travel being, with my arm outstretched, the length of my hand from wrist to the tip of the middle finger.  my fiance did not see the object, because by the time i began describing what i was watching, it had gotten very small and disappeared.  skies were partly cloudy, with some billowy white clouds and some whispy transparent

better expression) that lasted for approximately 10 hrs. it all started on a clear cool afternoon as i was hitchhiking east from rock springs wyo. to denver, co. on interstate 80. \r\n\r\na couple of hours after i got a ride i noticed a point of light blinking due east at about 30 degrees, but i didn't really give it much thought and soon put it out of my mind. i figured it was the reflection of the sun on an aircraft or something. \r\n\r\nthings started to get strange when we turned south to go to denver. the light turned as we turned and remained in front of us.At this the driver blinked his headlights on and off as if he was trying to signal whatever it was that we were looking at. suddenly, it appeared to get much closer (about the size of a quarter at arms reach). it seemed to have a cylindrical body with a cone on top, but i couldn't be sure as it was dark. it had five luminous points \r\n\r\non its perimeter. each shot out what seemed to be rods of white light. i remember rolling down my window and thought that i could faintly hear a high-pitched whirring sound. this seemed to happen very fast. then i am not sure what happened to the entity/object.\r\n\r\nit shot back into the eastern sky and hovered from where it had begun before we turned south. this time it seemed to occupy the space in the night sky where the star sirius should have appeared. it glimmered and sparkled intensely. we watched it several minutes and just couldn't believe what we were witnessing. as we talked about it i glanced to my right at the moonlit mountain landscape. i noticed three to five purple spheres in the distance. i couldn't tell how far, maybe a half a mile or more, but they were about the size of a nickel at arms reach. they seemed to be floating slowly, effortlessly, almost bouncing, like honeybees from flower to flower. they were translucent and i recall that i could partly see the landscape behind them. they each had a smaller amber satellite that seemed to rotate, somewhat quickly and irregularly, around them. we watched these for sometime until we got to the denver city limits a couple of hours later. \r\n\r\ni have had no such experience since.

fast. i considered maybe helicopters, but the light color (orange) was wrong and also too fast. i snapped the pictures one after another, probably one second interval, and steadied the camera on a deck post, so you can see a 5-second run of snaps. i just felt they weren't airplanes or helos. but, since i saw them just below cheyenne mountain (norad) or possibly fort carson, i just didn't know. they just kind of winked out at the end. i did call local tv stations and no one else has reported: fort carson and norad refused comment. i've lived here for nearly 10 years and i've never seen anything like that before!

to me by the three individuals who experienced this incident. the incident took place on sept.22, 2005.  the persons are david bloomquist, luke anfinson, and mike kueppers.  they were all high school juniors at the time out on a video assignment from their video production class in near-by new london-spicer high school. i was a former ind. tech teacher at that school and received this report while sub teaching one day.  \r\nincident:\r\n    the lads were out in a farm yard with their digital video recorder filming a scene from a movie they were making. several scenes were recorded that day.  surprising to them after reviewing their footage the next day back in class was their discovery in one scene of a mysterious streak racing across the screen background at such speed that it appeared just to be a blurr.  they asked me one day if i would like to see the blurr.  they had not taken the time to freeze-frame the blurr until our discussion.  i asked them to freeze it so we could see what it was.  it turned out to be a very saucer looking craft racing above a cornfield in there background.  they made a short movie of the incident and provided me with a copy of the actual speed sequence supplemented with some stop-action clips and graphics explaining the whole event.  the incident took place 3 miles northeast of green lake which finds the community of spicer mn on the western shore of the lake.  the incident would have been 8 miles east of spicer.  after reviewing the footage and doing some further investigation of the site, i have determined that the craft was on a west to due east heading which would have taken it very close to the city of spicer before it reached the farm site of the boys photo shoot. assuming the craft would have maintained its due east heading, it would have been on a direct line to minneapolis lying 100 miles to the east. an estimate of the speed of the passing blurr in the footage put its speed at somewhere between 8000mph to 10,000mph. this will need to be verified by some physics experts who can use the frame visual and appearance time to calculate an estimated speed in the view. i am including a short and long version of the video capture for this report.  the short version is attached and lasts less than one second.  the long version has been mailed to mufon dir. of investigations: chuck reever.  it is recorded in quick time player mode for attachment to this posting by the experts at mufon  \r\n     follow-up note:\r\nthe lads reported to me that they heard no unusual noises\r\nor oders during this incident.  they were totally unaware of the craft flying near them during the incident.  it was only by video review that they were made aware of this mysterious presence.  the lads told me they did not mind

witnesses to these events wish amenity. anyone wishing further information please contact the submitter of this report.\r\n\r\nthe events are separated by approximately 43 years. both occurred on a fishing lake in southwestern michigan just north of indiana state line. the investigator states \"when i heard of the events it got my curiosity up. this is the type of occurrence which doesn't get reported very often except these occurrences were on the same lake and the witnesses knew each other. my investigation indicated no other similar event is known about in the time period between these two events\". \r\n\r\nthe events\r\n\r\nin the earliest event which occurred in the summer of 1957 or 1958, two young men were out fishing in a small boat on the wooded east side of the modest size lake. it was mid evening and any breezes had settled down. they were on their way back to shore on the west side of the lake, facing each other as they hand-rowed the boat. as they crossed the center of the lake the generally still water began to ruffle or wave up around them. upon commenting about the strangeness of the water with no stiff breeze, the young man in the back of the boat spotted what he said appeared to be a small, quickly descending dark object. the object descended very quickly about 30 feet in front of the boat and entered the water. it made no sound on descending or upon entering the water. no physical splash occurred. the object simply entered the water and was lost from sight. after the object entered the water the ruffling ceased and the water returned to normal. the young man rowing the boat had his back to the object and did not see it but did notice the water ruffling. after that they made haste for the shore. after telling of their experience no one else around the lake ever mentioned having such an experience. no report was made at the time.\r\n\r\napproximately 43 years later in either 2000 or 2001 another strange event happened on this same lake. an elderly couple and a third younger man went out fishing one evening in two aluminum boats. it was approximately 7:00 pm and the evening was overcast and warm. the elderly couple was in one boat and the man was in the second boat. after reaching a favorite spot on the north end of the lake about a quarter mile from shore they anchored their boats about a hundred feet apart with bows facing west. the wife in the first boat was facing west over the bow and the husband was facing east from the rear of the boat. all were fishing with spinning rods with nylon fishing line and cast their lines with open bail as is normally done. the man in the second boat was facing east from the rear of the boat and was using two fishing rods. he had just cast both lines out about 70 feet from the boat and the bobbers were in the water when the first line rose up above the water about ten feet at its midpoint. then the second line did the same thing and both lines were now raised in a ten foot arch above the water. \r\n\r\n\r\nmean while in the first boat the husband had cast out when had the same thing happen to his line, raising about ten feet above the water. the wife had cast her line to the west and did not see what was going on behind her. at this point the husband decided they were going back to shore. his wife in the front of the boat was just pulling her line in after the first cast when her husband pulled the anchor and started heading the boat toward shore. at this point the man in the second boat made the same decision and they all headed for shore. \r\n\r\non shore they discussed this event which is something they had never heard of ever happening to any one before. they returned to this spot later and many others fish this same area of the lake with no other reports. the three persons involved in this event believed it had something to do with the nylon fishing line and some type of static electrical charge. this investigator believes this could be possible but is highly unlikely. lake water conducts electricity and no electrical charges should build up at a point ten feet above the water surface and the water itself. at least that is how it is suppose to work. in all my years of living in this part of the country i have never heard of such an event nor has any one else that i've asked about it.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

looking up at the sky now and then hoping to see another. i have not seen anything like this since then. i did report it anonymously back then, i cant remember what site it was, but i felt compelled

this sighting, as nothing was ever published in the media....Made me wonder why, as in a dense population others had to have seen this, and we had just exited a movie theatre, so there were others
