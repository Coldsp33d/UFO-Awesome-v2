{"content":[{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Spring Hill","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  i was in my kitchen, looking out the window facing the w/nw. (this was shortly after sunset, & the sky was just getting dark) i saw a red \"fireball\" that got my attention, which was similar to a flare being fired.    \r\n\r\n  i went outside a few minutes later to look in the sky & see if any of my neighbors might be shooting fireworks or flares... there were no other \"fireballs\" that followed.\r\n\r\n  i kept watching the sky, and was looking at the \"big dipper\". (which is almost perpendicular to the land horizon this time of year)\r\n  at 8:45pm i saw a thick, white, \"flash/streak\" of light \"shoot\" through the center of the \"cup\" of the dipper.  it came in from behind the \"handle\" & traveled between the 4 stars that make up the \"cup\"..... (megrez, phecda, merak, & dubhe.)\r\n\r\n  it was a perfectly centered path through the cup, & was 1/2 the width, or thickness of it. \r\n (if you were to scale the cup of the big dipper at let's say, 4 inches deep, the \"flash/streak\" would be 2 inches thick, by 4-6 inches long, & split the center perfectly, leaving an inch on both sides.)\r\n\r\n  the \"object\"/flash/ was not a bright streak like a meteor, but was more of a \"beam\", or \"pulse\".\r\nit was faint but clearly visible.  i'd say the brightness could be compared to the glow of the milky way on a good clear night.\r\n\r\n  it was a quick pulse, lasting about a second or just under, & then was gone.   \r\n\r\n  it reminded me of the \"flash\" & \"beam/contrails\" of the 1991 space shuttle discovery video \"sts 48\" .....\r\n  ...Where an \"object\" is seen coming over earth's horizon moving in a straight direction..... & then in the lower left corner of the screen a noticeable \"flash\" occurs, which causes the \"object\" (along with a couple others) to suddenly change directions at a 90 degree angle & accelerate outward away from earth.  immediately following the mysterious flash, there are 2 \"beams/pulses/contrails\" that are visible speeding toward the direction of the main object that rose up over the earth horizon.\r\n\r\n  the \"flash/pulse\" i saw go through the big dipper, was very similar to the ones that appear to be \"fired\" at the mystery object in the sts 48 video.\r\n\r\n  this was unlike any other \"ufo\" sightings i've seen, & don't feel that it was a craft of any sort.... but then again, i just don't know.\r\n\r\n-mark","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

they were doing and were getting their camera's and cell phone's out to take pictures.  it first looked like someone had taken a peice of a rainbow and just pasted it in that section of sky, but there was no reason for a rainbow at the time.  i know most people would look at a rainbow and say wow that's nice! this was completely different, no one knew what this was and there was no mistaking that. \r\nit had the colors of the light spectrum but unlike a rainbow that arks from one point on the ground to another point on the ground, this was a straight line in the sky with a few broken area's in the middle of a 2 mile band of red, green, yellow.  if i had to guess as to how high i would have to say between 5000 and 8000ft higher than the clouds but not by much ( whatever that might be ).\r\nif i had to guess.....I might say it looked like a passenger jet had dumped its fuel.....Now, i have never seen a passenger jet dump its fuel......But it did look like fuel that had been spilled in water.....Kinda.  there is a lot of air traffic that comes over from sea tac but keep in mind they fly at somewhere around 30,000' and above, i would have to guess if one dumped or lost there fuel at that hight it would be finely disspersed? after a fall of 25,000 or so feet. i did finilly lost sight of it, but it didn't fall to the ground or move i just lost sight of it, it was just gone.\r\n\r\nall i really want to know is if this is something that has been seen before?, i've lived around airports and air base's all my life..(malmstrom afb in great falls mt. whos seen it's share
