at least the length of a commerical passenger jet. the object was silent, absolutely no noise was heard. i opened my window to confirm and it was silent. because i have read numerous books on ufo's in the past and seen documentry films, i immedialy know this was an extraterrestrial object. i was not scared. i lost sight of the ufo within two minutes as it passed behind the mountain range. it was traveling east to northwest. i do need to mention that my friend michael has a book and newspaper articles on ufo sightings and abductions in topange canyon, which is adjacent to pacific palisades. the ufo that i witnessed the night of may 29th was headed in the exact direction of topange. i did not photograph the object, i am reporting only on the basis of an eyewitness. a camera would not have seen the contrasting silouette against the twilight that i saw with binoculars.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":4857,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0356331,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05302006-0002","longitude":-118.5155901,"occurred":1148965320000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1148965320000,"summary":"Slow moving flying saucer at low altitude with band of white light","tags":["light","saucer"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:520989"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Houston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A friend (jessie- about my age) and i were going to have a sleep over and we were waiting for his mother to finish dinner so we could go in and eat.  we had been playing in the cul-de-sac out in which our houses were located for quite a while (since dusk).  we decided to take a break and laid down on the sidewalk (head to head)to check out the stars that had come out.  i was looking over the (dead end) portion of the cul-de-sac and he was looking down the street.  we spent a while (i guess about 20 min) trying to point different stars out to each other and looking for shooting stars and such when we called out my name (kind of starteled).  he asked me if i saw something that he was looking at and i started looking around by tilting my head back (but saw nothing).  he was very excited and told me to look now!  i got up and turned his direction to see (with out a doubt in my mind) a large circular disc heading straight toward (as if to land on our street eventually) us very slowly.  it was flying very low and appeared over the houses at the entrance to our cul-de-sac.  it made no noise and except for very few lights that were more of a glow (on top) it was very dark.  more gray than black but dark.  it continued to head for us and we just stared for a little while in amazement.  i remember jessie saying, \"is this what i think it is\"?  i was like, \"uh, yeah, it's a ufo, holy crap!\"  after a few moments seemed like a long time but i remember the experience happening very quickly.  we decided to tell someone older since we knew we would never be believed.  first stop was my mother's house.  (she still remember's) i ran to the front door and asked her to come outside right now!  she asked why (because she was doing something in the oven) and i told her that there is a flying saucer outside and she has to come righ now!!  she told me that she would be, \"right out\" but that she had to take or put something into the oven (can't remember).  i was like, no, you are going to miss it!  i shouted back to jessie who had stayed back to watch the ship and he confirmed that it was still here.  i ran back outside to the grassy center of the cul-de-sac and looked directly up to see the ship was as large as our whole cul-de-sac.  wow... i can still remember it.  anyway, my mother still wasn't coming outside and i told jessie that she was busy and we decided to tell norman (he was like an older neighbor that was nice to us).  this time we both ran to norman's house (directly next door to mine), and knocked like crazy to get him out.  he was initially reluctant and then finally ran outside to see nothing.  it was gone.  we scrambled to the center to peer over the houses (the grassy center was slightly higher than street level) and we didn't see anything at all.  of coarse, my mother comes outside to see us standing there looking around and norman tells my mother that they missed the ufo and that was about it.  i was so depressed that nobody saw the ship and jessie moved away shortly after that so i haven't been able to ask him about it several years later. i would sketch it but it was just a large dark circlular ship. i know i saw what i saw and have told my closest friends and family and thats about it.  i still look into the sky and hope to see it again. we aren't alone.","distance":"101-500

hills east of las vegas, turn and land at mccarran airport. at the point where the planes were turning i noticed a small object, that i initially thought was a balloon, coming towards the strip. in less than 5 minutes from when i spotted it, the object slowed down above the wynn golf course area. it stayed in this area for about 5 minutes. it was not stationary at this point, but moving slowly westward. it then started picking up speed and moving in a north westerly direction and was out of my site in less than 5 minutes. it was barley visible as it left my field of view from the hotel window. \r\n\r\nfrom the point that it slowed down, i had a decent view of the object as it was directly in front of me. it was fairly high up, but well under the cloud cover. the object appeared mostly white with a patch of darker, gray on it. it seem as though it was probably the size of a car or van. the shape was not perfectly round; it seemed as though it was more pyramid shaped but very rounded. it also looked to be rotating. \r\n\r\ni am not sure what it was, but i could tell that it was not a balloon. it was not bobbing with the wind and the size was much too large for the height that it was at. it was not a plane as it would have dropped out of the sky as it moved slowly over the vegas strip area. there were helicopters flying well north of the object and were clearly visible as helicopters.\r\n\r\nit was not an object i could identify and i did have a fairly close and clear view of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

right in front of me and stayed put.\r\ni ran down the hill outside my girlfriends house to my car to get my binoculars. i got them (nikon large lens= good pair), and ran back up the hill to the opposite (dark side) of the house near the hammock.  it had moved again behind the trees to the right, but was still apparent through the trees.  i got a good look at it through the binoculars.  it was not moving again, but still over the highway going north toward middletown.  distance was two miles- i knew because i drove down to the highway entrance where it was 100 times.\r\n\r\ni followed the object in my car past kingston and into the catskills.  i was not the only car doing this.  there are other people who i do not know who shared this experience.\r\n\r\ni was told a month later

satisfied with this for some time, but lately i think something more sinister that happened in prattsville on route 23a.  i remember i thought there was a car that had crashed off the road down the

what i remember does not make sense.  i cannot fill in all the blanks.  i was running through a hayfield in the pitch dark and there were three objects moving through the hayfield behind me.  i

the crusher had not yet been fired up so there was no noise from the machinery and the only noise was coming from the highway and even that was just the sound of distant passing cars. i looked up as i heard the sound of a low flying jet and saw a jet liner that must have been coming out of casper. it was only a thousand feet or so up as i could make out the piping on the plane ( red - must have been a western flight) and i could even make out the individual windows. i have seen a few flights come out of casper at around that altitude. as the airliner continued to move ( it was going on a se course - i assumed toward denver) another object appeared below and to the rear of the airliner. at first i thought that it must be some sort of towed blimp. my logic for that was that it was a seamless craft and obviously made of metal ...It was glinting in the sunlight as did some of the parts of the airliner. this object made no noise ( the airliner did) this object had no identifiable doors or windows and it appeared to be about 3/4 of the length of the airliner it was following. it was only slightly thinner than the airliner. after the first minute or so of watching the event before me i discarded the idea that the object was a blimp..Or even another aircraft. it was following the airliner maybe 500 feet below.. and 500 feet behind.. it moved in perfect unison with the jet as though it was tethered by a iron bar. where as i could clearly make out the details of the airliner ( wings- piping-windows- noise) the object had none of these. it appeared to be a metal cigar shaped craft with (no windows - no doors or seams - no paint or logo - no wings or engines- and no noise).  the airliner and the object continued past my position and flew directly across two roadways..Ther first a minor two lane highway and then another mile and a half further it crossed the i-25 interstate and kept going till it was beyond the horizon and my ability to observe it further.The entire sighting lasted perhaps 4 minutes. i have since then had a few sightings of things i could not identify flying through our skies but nothing that compares in detail to this

hunting on the roanoke river(in a power boat) at night that fall. they observed, for quite some time, three metallic objects, glowing orange. larry states that he could see them \"change\" into the saucer shape right before his eyes. they hovered for some time 25 yards away. larry and my father were hiding underneath a weeping willow tree, and actually observed them through the scopes of their 7mm magnums for, what larry said to be, forever. it's hard to tell how long because the sheer strangness of what they were witnessing could have made their time estimates horribly innaccurate. larry said they released 10 or 12 glowing red balls that descended and lit up the forest. he said he could here them whisling as they originally approached, and \"winding up\" with a crescendous wail before flying off and meeting high in the sky. he said the red balls stuck around longer, but eventually sped off into sky and were absorbed by one of the crafts. he then said, they disappeared into space in the blink of an eye, and were gone. larry's story also reeks of missing time. they said they couldn't believe that it was so late(early in the morning) when they made it back to camp. a game warden was waiting for them when they arrived and was \"absolutely berzerk\" after witnessing them himself. i have a wonderful recording of larry shearin telling the story. it is absolutely fantastic. i seriously doubt that they would ever make something like this up. i have taken this as fact every since i first heard the story when i was a little boy. this is actually the only reason i believe so deeply in the alien phenomenon. i am currently writing a novel with the sighting as the basis. if anyone can help me find out more about this type of sighting, i would be greatly relieved. can anyone shed any light on what the \"red balls\" may have been, and what their function might have been? i would gladly send in the recorded version of this story. i have no doubt that this is a primary document concerning a very real ufo encounter. the missing time possibility especially disturbs me, because i was my fathers first child 5 years later. i know that people report genetic manipulation, and the aliens are always portrayed to find the reproductive organs especially important. just a paranoid thought, but i think you get the picture. any info would again be greatly appreiciated. feel

(i wonder what the local weather station had for cloud cover that evening at 8 or 8:10 pm?) the bolt travelled horizontally westward quite a distance before it finally arced 90 degrees and struck earth.\r\nat first, i thought the single light to be that of an airplane, odd flight pattern, but perhaps a helicopter. then, i thought, \"pretty risky business taking off in a lightning storm.\"  john dismissed it with, \"they take off in all kinds of weather.\"  he seemed to be more interested in the view to the west.  i didn't give it much more attention other than i was waiting to see what kind of flight it was once it got closer to our area. when i didn't hear what i was expecting to hear i again turned my attention to the foothills to the south and up from the first ridge from us and into the sky where i first saw the light. there it still was.  it hadn't moved east nor west.  it seemed to go faint at that time.  i surmised that it was traveling southwestward.  but, something didn't make sense about that, \"or, am i just hoping it is more?\" (i filed a report of a craft i spotted in mid-september of 2003.)\r\n\r\nthen, it happened just like the first sighting i saw in new mexico of 2003.  the \"star\" magnified immensely.  i cannot give it a measure because i haven't a gauge to compare with.  as it illuminated, a second bolt of lightning was discharged traveling westward horizontally through the cloud cover and arcing 90 degrees hitting earth in seemingly the same location. with the flash of lightning the \"star\" disappeared.\r\n\r\njohn didn't witness a thing other than the \"star\"light being visible, just as in the first sighting back in 2003.  during this current observation i only saw two lightning strikes, and, both of them involved the \"star\".\r\n\r\ni wondered afterward how could lightning strike twice and be identical in nature, i.E., form and location?  why would the stikes be so far away from its source - the \"star\"? \r\n \r\ni have not heard of any televsion, radio, nor newpaper reporting on this sighting, just like in 2003.\r\n\r\ni am beginning to feel like a freak. this is my third sighting. the first was in kalamazoo, michigan about 15 years ago.  was mufon even existing then?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":4837,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0864909,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05232006-0002","longitude":-106.6491267,"occurred":1148022000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

it was dark and john was messing around with the radios which were new at that time.  an electric flash lighted the sky and the radio was cramed by airline pilots wondering what had happened.  being a student pilot, i stayed silent as real pilots were talking.  in the cessna 195 the windshield extends over the head of the pilot and co-pilot so i could look strait up at the event.  a silver streak shaped like a needle starting at the beginning of the event from the east was about a half a degree long.  it started as a point and expanded to look like a needle then blew up.  by the time i looked up the oblong shaped mass was white.  it then truned bright yellow, then went to red and the deep blood red then black.  the black cloud roiled and would open to reveal a red interior.  the elongated cloud covered about two degrees with another \"needle\" shape coming from the opposite end of the cloud.  it looked to me as if something that had fuel on board exploded.  the ignition point being the beginning which was carried along until the main structure exploded and the remains of the structure emerging from the cloud after the fuel was exhausted.  john gordy said he hadn't seen anything but was wearing his glasses which were like coke bottle bottoms.  the event seemed to be among the stars.  the event gradually disappeared in the night sky.  the event was reported in the tulsa newspapers
