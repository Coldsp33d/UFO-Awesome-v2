States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i were walking home from our neighbors house along a long isolated driveway to our home in a rural area about 10 p.M.  \r\n1) i first noticed what i thought to be a falling star but before i could bring it to my husband's attention it disappeared behing the tree line of a grove of trees immediately behind our house(they were approx. 150'away)-there are only open pastures and no other neighbors for more than a mile in that area.  then, as i said, \"there it is again\" he said he saw it as it appeared between an opening in the trees and literally, \"bounced\" two times toward the left (nw)disappearing behind the last tree in the grove; suddenly it reappeared as a larger, extremely intense round light that started or appeared to be moving straight toward us \"through\" the trees and i shouted that \"it's coming towards us!\" very frightened.  we both stopped walking just staring at it. my husband's thoughts were what is it and what is it doing here (in this isolated area). it disappeared.  a second later, it appeared directly below the same spot we had last seen it, only this time it was just a bright round sphere of light; it seemed to \"go out\" and reappeared with a \"wispy\" contrail/tail of broken light behind it moving suddenly and horizontially to the right; went \"out\" again then, reappeared and moved suddenly and horizontially to the left, still at what seemed to us to be ground level and in front of the trees and undergrowth.  it all happened so fast and with such unusual movements we were puzzled, apprehensive and started to question what it was, why it would be where it was and how did it move like that.  we continued to walk into our backyard still looking back at the trees, and went into the house.  the time was 10:10 p.M.  i called our neighbors where we had just had dinner and told jeremy what we had seen behind our house in his pasture.  he laughed and said that he would look for a crater tomorrow and i said he'll know what happened to us if we're not around tomorrow (abducted-ha ha...).  still talking about how weird it was, my husband and i decided to go back outside to the same spot where we had first seen what we thought was the falling star.  we were trying to get our bearings to find a reasonable explanation as to what we saw; blinking lights from a tower, neighbors lights, etc. nothing made any sense as we stood again at approximately the same spot as the first \"sighting\" and discussed what we had both seen and in what position or area we had seen the lights in for about 10 minutes.\r\n2)  i was looking to the left of the area of where we had last seen the first series of \"lights\" at a shadowed area in the pasture that i knew was a very large slash pile (of dead brush and cedar trees).  i noticed flickers of light, but really too faint to be called \"lights\"-my first thoughts were fireflies but i knew that it in no way resembled a firefly and there weren't any around anyway.  then, another group of \"flickers\" appeared next to the first group.  i called attention to them to my husband who said he could see them too and again began questioning ourselves as to what \"they\" could be.  a few seconds passed and the group of \"wispy, airy-like flickers\" moved suddenly and horizontially just above ground level to the right (about 50') toward a white horse trailer parked in our yard.  the trailer was very visable as our eyes were adjusted to the darkness by then.  the flickers paused,  moved again toward the trailer another 10', paused just before the trailer, then shot straight up at an angle away from it, appearing to disapper into the center of a large oak tree (about 50' away)between a workshop shed and a horse barn.  we were in awe and amazement again at how \"it\" moved and seemed to not want to \"run into\" the horse trailer.  now we were both shaken and even more puzzled.  we discussed what we had just seen yet again and how it acted. weird, weird, weird. i was talking about not wanting to go to sleep in case it was something, locking the doors, etc.  my husband kept asking \"what do you think it is?\"  he had no idea and neither did i-we did talk about what it was not-someone with a flashlight, airplanes, neighbors lights, car lights, etc.  we hurried into the house.  he grabbed a flashlight and suggested that we go back out and watch for it in case \"it came back\".  i suggested we just sit on the back porch and watch, not wanting to back into the open.  it's about 10:45 p.M.\r\n3) we sat on back porch quietly with our 2 dogs with a puzzled comment every now and again, but just staring into the darkness of the backyard.  the workshop shed is approx. 55' behind the porch; the thicket of trees is approx. 25' beyond the shed.  after about 15 minutes, my husband says, \"there it is! see it?\"  i said i couldn't; he said, \"right there!\"  i moved around in my chair because there was a utility pole that i thought was blocking my line of vision.  i still couldn't see anything, then there it was-a distinct, bright,round light moving just above the ground to my left, then disappeared; appeared to the far left again about 25' away, then disappeared; reappeared about 10' back to the right again, then disappeared.  now we were in total shock and couldn't believe what was happening to us, no one will believe us, people will say were crazy but we know what we saw!  i just wanted to go into the house and lock the doors. it was 11:15 p.M. we sat in the living room trying to watch tv until midnight, looking out the back windows into the backyard and toward the trees \"just checking\" if there was anything there.  we went to bed and layed awake for some time still going over and over what we saw and trying to find a reasonable explanation.\r\n\r\nmy husband went out into the pasture first thing this morning, sunday the 21st, to see if could see or find anything. nothing.  i was gone for the day but when i got home we both went out to look all around the area again. nothing-i commented that lights don't leave any physical evidence behind.  ???\r\n\r\ni made rough sketches of the 3 events immediately after they happened, but have not attached them, as i am not that familiar with the computer in that respect.\r\n\r\nit's 9:50 p.M. sunday, 5-21-06  my husband is outside again on the porch \"watching\".\r\n\r\nany reasonable explanation, please?\r\n","distance":"21-100

coming towards us at an incredible speed. from the farthest point of sight of the western horizon in front of us, the blinking light flew towards us a few feet above the power lines on the left side of the road - in 3 to 4 seconds. as it passed over us, i looked up. i saw nothing resembling a craft, just a large blinking orb. i turned my head back and watched the object continue its course above the power lines as it headed eastward toward the eastern horizon. within 3 to 4 seconds, it disappeared over the horizon. the entire incident lasted under 10 seconds and the object blinked brightly about 10 times. when the flying object was not blinking, nothing could be seen - just darkness. the object made no sound. the car did not rock and the power lines did not sway. it was just a bright, blinking light that traveled at least 16 miles within 10 seconds. i did not panic. i simply asked my mom, who was driving, and my brother, if they had witnessed the same thing that i had just witnessed. neither one of them claimed to have noticed it. i would have liked to have shrugged it off as an aircraft, but it made no sound and i do not believe any object can fly that fast without some sort of booming noise. i never spoke of the matter until i heard other people mention ufo sightings on the same highway.

the bus stop in front of the department of commerce on broadway, in south boulder. i was looking west toward the flatirons and saw this dark object that looked like a boomerang floating above and behind the buildings and in front of the foothills. \r\n2. i noticed the object because it was fairly large and dark in a sky with grey clouds above the object holding just enough light from the setting sun to create distinct contrast.\r\n3. at first i thought of a flock of geese because of the wedge formation they often take, but this made no sense rather quickly because of the mass of the structure.\r\n4. the object was a lot like a boomerang. it was very dark in appearance and displayed no lights. the two \"wings,\" which were equal in length and converging at close to a right angle, formed a pointed end or you could say they radiated from a pointed front. the ratio of the width of the \"wings,\" relative to their overall length was approximately 1:6. the object seemed to be floating, and this sense was enhanced by a rotation of the object as it moved south, curiously almost as if a boomerang whirling in slow motion. yet before our bus arrived, it lingered in one spot for several minutes, although there was a breeze at ground level, so it appeared to have its own power, displaying hovering and rotation and variable speeds. i would estimate its size as rather large, perhaps having \"wings\" of 100 feet in length. i say this because i got some sense of how high it was - around 1,000 feet - as it moved in front of and near the flatirons. also, a small plane flew over it from the southeast going northwest into the mountains just before our bus arrived while the object was hovering in one place. \r\n5. when i realized i was looking at a solid object and not a flock of geese, i said to my son, \"what do you think that is, ander,\" and pointed it out to him. then it began rotating and we just watched in amazement as it floated south. ander (alexander) noted right away that it had no lights. i attempted to take photographs of it, but it was too dark for it to appear in the digital images. nonetheless, the camera did reveal some closer objects in the night sky, light up by the flash. and i took one mpeg clip, but i don't know if i captured the object. also, i believe it is possible that the object began hovering in one place as a response to my camera flashes. i was excited about the event because i experienced a ufo sighting with my son.\r\n6. the sky kept getting darker and our bus arrived, so it was very hard to see as we left, but still hovering.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

worth of air in only one side of my nose. as we drove past the volcano mt. hood in oregon, the base was covered with clouds and i saw the tip of it in the sky and knew that was where they lived. i thougt no more than that about it until years later after going to a shrink and reading whitneys book.I went into hypnosis and the spider had a alien head. i ran away from the shrink who hypnotised me.  i then went to the place where i was held by the spider web and there was a sign on a stake on the ground,\r\n\"a glance into the forest, is a window into the universe.\" i have a little bump in the back of my neck i have always wondered what it is. the doctors have always told me to leave it alone. i would like to have it removed by you. i was born in la grande oregon st. josephs hospital, july 28 1944 at 5:25 pm 100 years, 1 month 1 day and the same hour and most likely a few minute and seconds after joseph smith was shot on june 27 1844. a bullet stopped the poctet watch on john taylor at 5:16 pm and joseph died a few minutes after that. richard willard was also in jail with the two of them. my ex husband who tried to kill me was richard, and  john willard was his lawyer, not taylor. too far out for coincidence. please contact me. i have many miracles.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4802,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.8536688,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05192006-0006","longitude":-121.7587924,"occurred":-676529340000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-676529340000,"summary":"I

ago.\r\n\r\naround 2001 i was 16, by buddy was spending the night and we snuck out onto my roof to sneak a cigerette. after about 10 minutes we see a light far off, as it gradually gets closer we relize that the light is pointed at us. not only that, but it is actually some sort of spotlight, we literally looked behind us, and could see our shadows on the woods behind my house.\r\n\r\nas it gets closer, we can tell that its a triangle shape, unlike anything ive ever seen, with blue lights outlining the shape, and the spotlight coming from the center. the closer this thing got, the house seemed to shake with the noise that it made, yet no ones lights seemed to go on inside their house. \r\n\r\nby the time it got around 500 or so feet away it stopped, it was still tremendously loud, but it stopped moving, and just hovered. i was extremely scared as i didnt know what the hell it was, so i looked at my friend, as he stands up and literally pulls his pants down and moons the object. i swear to god, he puuled down his pants to it and slapped his ass yelling \"come on mother fucker\". \r\n\r\nas i watched this, i looked behind me again, just to make sure this thing was looking at us, and one again, our shadows were on trees, there was no mistaking that it was looking at us. as it started to move again, it was going directly above us, and just as soon as it did, the light went off, and it all noise stopped, literally, their was no noise, not crickets, not me, just dead silence.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, it took off behind the woods at a speed that i could only make out the lights of it, and not the shape, ive never seen anything go so fast. as soon as i could collect myself i asked him what the hell he did that for, and he told me that if he was going to be abducted (as he told me he thought he was) he was at least going to make a point while doing it.\r\n\r\nnow im not saying this was an alien object, as we do live several miles from wright patt airforce base, but what ever it was, it was nothing i had seen before or since (and no it was not a stealth bomber). \r\n\r\nmy friend and i have fell out of touch since i moved to california, i have not spoke to hime in more than a year.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:28","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then
