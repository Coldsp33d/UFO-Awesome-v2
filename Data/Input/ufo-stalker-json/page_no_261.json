 era fevereirodo ano de 1970 e tinhamos ido acampar em itanhaem na praia dos pescadores litoral de são paulo. acho que eramos em 4 pessoas ao todo.\r\n  chegamos tarde ao local, mais ou menos la pelas 16h, pois fomos de trem e onibus. improvisamos a barraca, tinhamos apenas uma lona grande e comemos alguma coisa. estavamos descansando quando vimos uma agitação de algumas pessoas que também estavam acampando. era mais ou menos 21h e este pessoal tinha posicionado o carro junto à margem do mar com os faróis acesos apontados para uma pequena ilha próxima da praia que dava para ir a pé até ela quando a maré esta baixa.\r\n no primeiro momento pensamos que alguém tivesse ficado preso na ilha. era comum as pessoas irem até a ilha quando a maré estava baixa, porém algumas pessoas descuidada acabavam ficando presa poi a maré subia e ficava muito alta.\r\n  fomos até junto as pessoas que lá estavam e perguntamos o que estava acontecendo e perguntamos também se alguém ficou preso na ilha.Eles disseram que perceberam uma coisa estranha na ilha e resolveram posicionar o carro com os farois acesos apontando para a llha para ver mrlhor. \r\n  o que havia era uma forma estranha que daquela distancia que estavamos paracia ser bem grande. sua forma era irregular e luminosa, mas somente quando o farol do carro incilembrava um cone disforme, e o impressionate era que ele alterava seu tamanho continuamente, diminuia até ficar bem pequeno e depois aumentava o tamanho até ficar enorme. esta alteração não parava, ficava o tempo todo diminindo e aumentando.\r\n  como ninguém sabia o que era aquilo e se era perigoso ou não pessoas resolveram ir embora e passar aquela noite em um hotel na ciadade. nós com estavamos com pouco dinheiro resolvemos passar a moite na praia mesmo que preocupados. resolvemos então ficar vigiando. enquanto dois dormian, dois ficavam vigiando. e assim fizemos, porém ao amnhecer acordamos e percebemos que todos adormecemos instantaneamente e que nenhum de nós viu o que aconteceu com aquela entidade, já que já não haviua mais nada na ilha.","distance":"101-500

with flashing green and white lights maneuvering very erratically and changing directions quickly. this is heard on around 26 minutes 30 seconds into the first attached audio recording of the atc archive provided by liveatc dot net. i was advised of this by atc since i, flying n224tw (goodspeed 224 on the attached audio recordings), was going to cross the huo (huguenot) vor (a ground-based radio navigation source) soon there after. atc then advises they saw a primary target (just a return no transponder or altitude information) just east of the vor. this is about 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the second attached atc audio file. then about a minute later i report a flying object with flashing red and white lights that was paralleling us perfectly. this one was not observed by atc on radar at all. the air traffic i saw appeared to move in, follow us for several minutes from about a mile (approximate guess) off my right wing, and pull away. it was similar to the way a military aircraft would move in to identify an aircraft (maybe looking for the ufo harassing n333hf but i'm speculating there). the green light object continues to follow the navajo into northern nj (starts at about 7 minutes 50 seconds into the 3rd attached audio recording). to summarize there was at least 1 possibly up to 3 (the green lighted one reported by n333hf, the primary target reported by atc, and the red and white lighted one reported by me) flying object(s) that were flying in close proximity to civilian aircraft and following them for miles. typically military aircraft would be talking to atc on a separate frequency but according to atc nobody else was talking to them. the conditions were ifr so any aircraft flying should have been talking to atc and squawking a discrete code on their transponders but this (or these) unidentified flying object(s) while having lighting similar to aircraft were not talking or squawking to anybody. this means they were flying illegally and had no or a very low radar profile. i estimate the altitudes of the object(s) to have been between 4000 and 12000ft based on my own account and that of n333hf. the four (at least) witnesses are myself, my first officer, the pilot(s) of n333hf, and the air traffic controller. it is possible n333hf and/or their or my passengers may have witnessed things as well as other aircraft in the area and/or people on the ground i'm not sure. the audio recordings were provided by liveatc, a third party of hobbyist radio operators that record live air traffic control and archive the files as well.

az. i was on my phone looking at the live sedona webcam. i live in connecticut and i've vacationed in sedona in the past, if i have a free moment in my day i'll look at the live webcam. i've been looking at the webcam for over a year now at different times throughout the day and never saw anything out of the ordinary except for when objects started to appear in the sky on 3/21/17.\r\n\r\non 3/21/17 at 9:43am edt (6:43am mst) the first object appeared. i noticed the object was out of place for the morning sunrise and at first glance i thought it was a passing satelitte or a drone, however; the object didn't move it was stationary. i took a screenshot and after a few seconds the webcam moved direction. once enlarging the object on my phone the shape and the light emanating from the object was unusual. after 5 minutes the webcam went back to the location where i saw the object and the object wasn't in the sky anymore.  \r\n\r\ndue to this peculiarity i kept looking at the webcam throughout the day and saw a second object in the sky that differed from the first one i had witnessed.\r\n\r\nlater that afternoon, at 3:10pm est (12:10pm mst) i saw the second object in the sky at a different location. this object differed to the first object, this one was dark in color, circular and didn't have a glow or light emanating from it like the first object. i took a screenshot of this object and it stayed in the sky at the same location for several hours without moving. at first glance i thought it was a weird cloud but as the webcam stayed fixed at the location for several minutes the object didn't move. i also thought there might be a smudge on the lens of the webcam, this wasn't the case because whenever the webcam moved to a different location there wasn't any circular dark spot visible at other locales. this second object appeared over the course of 3 days and always in the same location. interestingly, each when i looked at the webcam the object slightly changed it's shape, as if it was fluid in nature. i have several photos of this object over the 3 day period it was visible. \r\n\r\non 3/23/17 at 8:16pm edt (5:16pm mst) the second object was visible again albeit it was a cloudy day. i have several screenshots over the course of thirteen minutes of the object. because it was  cloudy one can see the cloud movements from one photo to the next, but the dark circular object remained stationary. \r\n\r\non 3/23/17 in the evening at 10:01pm edt (7:01pm mst) over the course of 3 minutes i saw a third object. this object was a large light orb up against the mountainside that's within a valley area. the light orb went dim and then went to a full brightness. upon seeing this my reaction was disbelief because this valley/mountain area doesn't have any residential homes, roads, nor are there any aircraft warning lights for pilots to look out for. the light orb was too big to be a hiker's flashlight and the light certainly wasn't from a camper's fire. \r\n\r\non 3/24/17 at 5:10pm edt (3:10pm mst) the second object was in the sky again for a third day, this time the dark circular object really changed it's shape and appeared to be slightly triangular. i have several photos over the course of an hour on 3/24/17 showing this object. in addition, i have a photo after the object left, to show that its not something fixed in the sky. \r\n\r\nthe photos attached are a few of what i took, i also have screenshot photos showing the day/time for each photo when it was taken, should you require this.

noticed it also and i told him to pull over.  he did and we sat there observing it.\r\n\r\ni could tell that he was speechless.  the object hovered over a scrub-brush area, with no dwellings in that area.  i thought to myself that finally i have another reliable witness to verify what we are seeing.\r\n\r\ni asked him, \"do you see any tethers fastening it to the ground?  do you see any movement?\"  he answered \"no\" to both.  after watching it for a few minutes and nothing changed, i wanted to pick up my own truck so i could come back and hopefully get a better/closer look at it.  however, in only the 2-3 minutes it took me to get back it was gone.\r\n\r\ni was still elated that someone else had seen it with me and was anxious to discuss it with him once i got back to the shop.
