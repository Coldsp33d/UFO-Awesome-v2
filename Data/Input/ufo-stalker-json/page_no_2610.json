(i have no way to judge actual distance, speed or size)                                        5. the 1st time i saw it i thought it was a helecopter, but it's light was to big and never changed in its luminescences. i watched it for awial (maybe 5 min.) till it got to bout the east south-east portion of the sky. the 2nd time about a month later i saw the same object on the same flight path. this time i woke my little brother and mother to witness and confirm what i was seeing. both where seeing what i was, neither knew what it was. (in all honesty i dont thik they where more than mildy amussed. they showed no real intrest.)i did at this time go outside to try and hear something, but to no avail. (really didnt think i would hear anything because i judged the object to be to far away. but i did try anyway) i had almost predictable sightings of the same object from about 1979 to 1981. maybe a dozen sightings in all.                                                                6. always lost sight of the object in the same portion of sky. east south-east. just disapeared.                                  personal history. i have spent alot of time on air force bases, and am very familiar with all types of aircraft. i have never been able explain what i saw.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on my way to the foggy bottom metro station in downtown washington dc (george washington university campus area).  it was very crowded and slow moving toward the station's escalators, as this was after the \"2000\" celebration on the national mall.  one friend was with me, but did not see the ufos.  at first i was not really watching the sky, but saw out of the corner of my eye what i \"thought\" was a shooting star (but it would have to have been a really big shooting star!).  i even said something to my friend, who wasn't really paying attention.  so now i was watching the skies while very slowly moving from the street to the top of the escalators.  that's when i started to see these very strange looking objects fly over downtown.  i estimate i saw a total of about 8 objects; i saw 2 groups of 2 objects each flying very close together, but the others were \"by themselves\", although all 8 or so objects were flying in a straight line, one after another.  several seconds would elapse between one object and another (or pair of objects).  i assume they were cylindrical shaped based on the peculiar lighting i saw.  they all appeared the same.  after \"seeing\" the \"shooting star\" (which most likely was one of these objects), the first i truly saw must have been two of these objects very close to each other (which looked even stranger); after seeing a few not flying so close, i determined that they were all this cylindrical shape, rather than 2 shapes.  they flew from a wnw direction to a ese direction, almost directly above where i was at the time (slightly south of my position), and i estimate that their trajectory, if unchanged, would have had them pass over the white house and the us capitol.  no turns, no curves, no change in altitude...Just a straight flyover, horizon to horizon.  i had much more of a western horizon than an eastern horizon, as there was some park-like space beyond the escalators to the west, but 12-story buildings elsewhere, including to my east; therefore i saw them approach more than i saw them depart.  i noticed no typical aircraft noise at all; however, it was a very noisy crowd i was in at the time...But the altitude of these seemed low enough that if they were conventional aircraft, some noise should have been noticed in spite of the crowd.\r\n\r\ni was quite stunned throughout the event.  it is the most unusual thing(s) i have ever seen in the sky (unless i saw some in my early childhood, which is possible).  i only said, and not loudly, at one point during the flyover, \"am i seeing ufos?\"  my friend was not paying attention at all, but a bystander, a young man, just glanced at me and smiled politely.  i did not notice anyone else observing these, but i wasn't really paying attention to the people around me at this time...In fact, i found myself suddenly at the top of the escalator.  i wish i would have turned around and stayed longer to see if i could see more of these, but i was surrounded (the crowd was like sardines) and the only way seemed to be \"down\" at that point, so i and my friend entered the station like everyone else.  \r\n\r\nit occurred to me that i had seen something very unusual and significant.  i had a \"semi-belief\" in extraterrestrial life and ufos prior to this, but this was just entertaining speculation.  this event changed all of that.  now i was \"one of them\"....One of \"those people\" who have seen such things.  so, in a way, it seemed like an \"initiation\".  certainly a \"paradigm shift\", and made a believer out of me for certain.  i told my friend after we got seated on a metro train about what i saw, asked her if she saw them.  she said she did not, and she gave me a \"funny\" smiling look, like she was trying not to laugh.\r\n\r\ni will attach a powerpoint presentation that made, which i presented last december at the colorado mufon meeting and holiday potluck.  john schuessler of int'l mufon was present as well.  i will also attach a shorter one about a sighting i heard about around 1997, from a friend who worked at the cia (langley).\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

when i happened to look up towards the full moon.  i was stunned to see a large glowing lime green oval moving slowly,  silently, across the sky.  it was already halfway across the sky when i first saw it. the object appeared to be moving at a constant speed angling in a downward direction.  the entire object glowed the same color and its edges were indistinct with a green glow.  it gave off no other light than this.  there was no \"tail\".  it appeared to be close, no more than 200-300 hundreds yard away and maybe 500 feet in the air.  i stood and watched it move across the open sky and behind a few pine branches.  i watched the object for about 15 seconds before it went out of sight behind a pecan tree, still on a downward direction never having varied its speed.  the object stayed the same color and size for the entire sighting.  when i lost view of it behind the tree i thought it might be headed down into the pasture behind the shed.  i wanted to go see, but first i ran back into the house and grabbed my m1 carbine and put in the 30 round clip.  i shook my sleeping wife and excitedly told her what i had seen and that i was going out to see where it was. of course, she didn't even wake up.  so  i went out the back door and headed out towards the pasture.  i saw nothing, found nothing.  after awhile i calmed down although i stayed outside for about an hour looking up into the sky.  i don't really know what i would have done had this object been hanging around in the pasture.  might not have had the guts to fire on it.  and i remain struck by the fact that had i not been outside and looking up in those few seconds, this thing would passed silently by.  \r\n\r\n     now the object was so large and bright and easy to see that i have always been able to remember just what it looked like and how it moved.   so that anyone can see what i saw that night i have drawn the object onto a digital photograph that i recently took of the sky, complete with the full moon and some pine trees just about like they were the night of the sighting.   this photo is a pretty good representation of what i saw in the sky that night.   the red dashes indicate the object's

Plaine","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"     driving home from a movie sw of belleplaine with my girlfriend, now my wife. talking about where her friends and realitives and frinds lived, as i didn't know anyone around there\r\n     the strange thing was that it seemed to contact us as we had to be ahead of it over a 1/3 of a mile and it was close to 2,000 ft. up. i wasn't driving very fast on a rock road. i suddenly slowed down, rolled the window down and had to look back and high in the sky. why did this happen as we were engrossed in our own conversations. i feel as if got my attention without realizing it. it gave off a very intesive band of light, the color of a highite marker in a narrow band. i stopped, watched and listened. it was a clear fall starlite nite, it caught up to us and that was when i knew that it was not a plane or helicopter as it made no soud or had any blinking lights around it.\r\n     suddenly without warning in the snap of a finger it was alongside us verticaly down to just above tree height as it could not have fallen that fast by gravity but seemed to be powered down. we watched it pass over the dry tree leaves by a mere 3 or 4 ft. never seemed to disturb them at all.\r\n      we were in a vally with hills in the back ground so i tried to obseve everything i could about this craft as it was so close to us. that's when i told my wife, she was only 16 at the time, this is a chance of a lifetime a real ufo.\r\n      it was only about 60yds. out from us hanging motionles   and about tree top high. it just hung there like it was observeing us just like i was it. \r\n       my wife started screeming and digging her nails into me as she was petrified and missed out on most of the excitement, buiring her head under my arm. the best was yet to come. there did seemed to be alot of electricity in the air as her hair was standing out all over and when i looked down on my arms my hair was standing straight up to as aroud my head.\r\n       i was not scared of it maybe because i was so busy studing it. it hung there for quite a few minutes it seemed to be about 40 ft. in dia. what was differet was that the intensive light i talked about was only comming from inside the craft. because it was your typical saucer shape and at night i took everything into consideration. it had be they called portholes or windows, they were triangler in shape but with the top squared off. the bright light emitting from these lit up the silver sloped deck and that is what i had always seen. the underneath of course was dark but planly seen even at night. there was a roundish canopy on top.\r\n     what totally sshocked me was that something partially blocking one porthole moved from where it had been and it or something else blocked most of another one. i kid you not was i actually seeing a ufonaught while watching and thinking was sonething watching me.\r\n     yes, it finally started moving very slowly toward the end of the field as we sat there astounded. at the end of the field and across the road on a hilltop was a farm place in order to clear the farm stead the ufo and because it was a lot lower had to clear it rose straight up maybe 50 ft. and just cleared the top of the house and slowly drifted away out of sight. those people in that house had no idea how close they were passed over.\r\n      the craft only seemed to move at right angles such as straight up or down to correct for elevation but whatwe seen was never any movement at angles . i forgot to say that it seemed to be about 12ft. from bottom to top.\r\n       we went on our way home that night, never said a word about to anyone even to our folks as who would believe us. we never said a word to each other all the way home as to the exception , \" why us \" !!!!!\r\n       i have my own written account or book i have kept all these years for us. we have never told or given this information out publicly like this and as i get older it's time to do so. i have some footage of programs i have taped over the years and lookig back i foud what i think is as close to the one we seen.
