already asleep. the cats were in the bathroom so they couldn't eat mother's plants. i was about to doze off when a blaze of light flashed through my window. shocked, i went to the window and looked up at the tree line. i practically shut down when i saw a large object was circling the house just brushing the tree tops. it was a thick disk shaped craft with a blinding glare. i put on my sun glasses. on top was a large rotating dome with some sort of writings or glyphs engraved into it emitting a blue glow. underneath were 4 smaller domes that were equally spaced. they too were rotating and had glyphs of their own but in purple, red, yellow, and green. focusing even closer showed complex paneling all over. it continued to circle the house as though it was observing the small wooded clearing that was my home. suddenly it stopped and slowly hovered directly over the house. intrigued, i went outside to see what it was doing. on the way out past the bedroom the cats, chuckus buddy and bean bean were going ballistic. meowing, growling, hissing, and blazing about. i went out onto the grass and looked up as the ufo was hovering over the house. as i watched the domes began to rotate faster and faster to the point were the glyphs were practically a line. then the most unbelievable thing happened. a blaze of light engulfed me. i was scared ****less. then came the most unbelivable (and painful) thing. all of the sudden an enourmus shreiking exploded in my head. it forced me to the ground as i even started to bleed out of my ears. then it stoped. i looked up as the ufo began to rise into the sky. as it went up, four orbs each about the size of a car rose out of the forest orbiting in bizzar patterns around the craft. it rose higher and higher and roared off at an incredible speed. battered and realling i draged myself inside and collasped as blood drained out of my ears and pain continued to strike my brain.\r\n\r\nalthough i was fine later on, it was two nights ago on
