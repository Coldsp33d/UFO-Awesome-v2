uk - guirivaud@millionsofstars.Com\r\nps- i will send another report with more pictures...","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":4737,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.5195423,"location":null,"logNumber":"IL-05022006-0001","longitude":35.4562795,"occurred":1144306800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,  Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1144306800000,"summary":"Ufo sighting over negev mountains in israel part 1","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"Asia/Jerusalem","timeZoneName":"Asia/Jerusalem","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4737_submitter_file1__Picture1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4737_submitter_file2__ufo7.bmp","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4737_submitter_file3__ufo8.bmp"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Dead Sea -","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:525428"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Yucca Valley","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was out star gazing when a bright red object caught my attention. as i was looking at it, it appeared to get brighter then it would dim until completely dark. it would appear in what looked like the same exact place, no higher or lower. i started taking pictures over the next half hour. it was there for 45 minutes when i came back inside. i was using a 2 mp digital camera without flash on the following pictures. when they were uploaded the boomerang shaped object was clearly there. when i zoomed in on the photo it is obvious to me that i don't know what kind of craft that could be.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":4735,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1141743,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05012006-0005","longitude":-116.432235,"occurred":1144233000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,  Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1144233000000,"summary":"Dark red boomerang always stationary fading in and out brightest to blackout","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4735_submitter_file1__ufosaturationoforiginal.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4735_submitter_file2__8xzoomUFO.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Yucca Valley, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:525429"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Sidney","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was laying face up on the backyard deck of my mother���s house. the object appeared from behind the neighbor���s house situated to the south. it traveled very fast and made no noise at all. the vehicle travel south to north. it was about the size of a b-52 at 1000 ft. altitude. if it were a jet or an airplane it would have made some sound. and if it was so high that i could hear it then it would have traveled much slower through my field of view. the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. the craft disappeared from my view when it went behind the neighbor���s house that was situated to the north. i stood up and ran around to the front house but was unable to see anything. the sighting lasted less than 10 seconds. the craft was v shaped with 5 orange lights on the bottom of the wings. 1 light was on the tip of the v and 1 light on each wing tip. there was another light midway between the two lights on each wing. there are videos recorded in arizona that show craft very similar to what i saw that night in montana.","distance":"501 Feet -

texas, looking out the south facing windows.  i was working on a report with another office colleague.  it was the afternoon, afterworking hours, probably about 6:30pm, as most other people were already gone from the office.\r\n\r\n2.  i first noticed the object, it seemed to be moving slowly, or drifting, and because it seemed to have some winglike projections that made me think it might have been a biplane, but moving like a helicopter, being somewhat unusual, i started watching it.\r\n\r\n3.  a biplane.\r\n\r\n4.  the object appeared to be dark, or black, roughly or irregularly blocklike in shape with some short appendages like wings which enlarged or disappeared, which seemed to indicate some rotation. you could not tell any surface detail, though in evening sun.  it was my impression that it was sized similar to a light plane, and maybe a mile away when first seen, but those are guesses.  when first seen, it was only at about a 20-30 degree elevation of view from our seventh floor level, so it seemed that maybe it might have only been up at an altitude of 500 or a thousand feet.  it also seemed to cycle irregularly at times slightly larger then slightly smaller in size, which seemed to indicate that it might have been moving in a spiralling pattern as it drifted further away.  it was not round, like a balloon would have been, or upside down teardrop shaped, like a weather balloon.\r\n\r\n5.  two of us watched the object drift away.  we both agreed that we could not identify it as either a plane or helicopter, as it was moving too slow to be a winged aircraft and had no profiles or shapes on the topside where the rotor of a copter would have been.  we agreed that we could not twll what it was.  we made no report to anyone, nor noticed any in the local papers the next day.  \r\n\r\n6.  the object seemed to stay at a constant altitude, and drift slowly southward.  it stayed visible quite awhile as a dark, diminishing dot, before it disappeared in the distance, still to the south.  i did afterward notice that a frontal system had blown in, and there was a very strong north wind blowing, in the direction the object was drifting.  there might be a possiblility of it being some odd inflatable shape being blown in the wind, however, it seemed to be moving slower than the wind was blowing and that would not explain the apparent motions.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1). sighting occured at approximately 5:40pm on april 24, 2006 & lasted approximately 5-6 minutes. at the time of my observation of the ufo, i was sitting out in front of the loading area of my place of employment during my lunch break (i work for the home depot). \r\n\r\n2). sometimes during my lunch break, i will sit in this area, look southwards and watch the airplanes fly by. the las vegas airport (mccarran international) is located about 3 miles south-east of where i work. as i was watching the passenger planes fly by one after another from the airport heading westward, i happened to notice on one of the planes, what i thought at first was a piece of something - perhaps a piece of wing, fly up and begin to descend downward slowly under the plane. however, the plane kept flying onward so i immediately realized that nothing was wrong with the plane. whatever this was, i would have to say that it must have been a safe distance from the plane as i would assume the pilot would have taken measures to steer away from it if it was too close. but for a split second i thought it was a part of the plane and that something fell off.\r\n\r\n3). after i realized that the plane was fine and wasn't going to crash, i then concentrated on observing this strange behaving object. i don't consider myself an expert on judging what the object could have been, but i can certainly tell you what is was not. i was deffinately not a plane, helicopter, bird, blimp, balloon, a kite or a piece of debri just randomly floating around in the sky. some other type of aircraft that i'm not familiar with? possibly. but i never seen anything behave in the manner in which this thing behaved.\r\n\r\n4). where i was sitting - the roar of the planes gaining altitude can be clearly heard. however, this object was completely silent - at least i couldn't hear anything from where i was sitting. it is difficult to describe what the object looked like or its' size as it was too far away. my best guess was that it was round, flat and deffinately dark on one side and very highly reflective on the other. the best way i can describe its' movements was like that of a top rolling around on the floor as it loses momentum and falls down and moves about really fast. the wobble of this object was very fast and the flash of the reflective side was quite quick. oddly, as the plane moved forward heading west, the object very slowly descended downward - i'm guessing 1,000 feet - i could be way off on that guess??? then, it began to move toward the southeast in a everso slight downward manner until it leveled off and disappeared behind the horizon and buildings in the distance. all this time it is wobbling rapidly and continuing to reflect the suns light. i'd like to mention that it was partially cloudy that day. the planes flying by were at a too low of altitude to be as high as the clouds as they just recently departed from the airport. my guess is that the object was obviously much higher than the planes and much further away then the path of the planes. though at first the object appeared to be just a small piece of the plane, i would have to say that it would have had to be a much larger object than what would to first appear.\r\n\r\n5). i kept my eyes fixed on this object and watched it like a hawk. i briefly looked about to notice customers going in and out of the store carrying on their business and shopping duties. i just looked around briefly to see if anybody else was looking up in the sky but i didn't notice anybody looking. i didn't want to leave and i intended to watch this thing for as long as i could. the only emotion i experienced was extreme curiousity. i just kept saying to myself, \"this is wierd\". \r\n\r\n6). the horizon of the buildings off in the distance is where the object disappeared from my viewpoint.\r\n\r\nbefore reporting this to mufon, last night i turned on the local newscast to see if anybody else reported this - i heard nothing. so here i am reporting this and hoping that i'm not making a fool out of myself doing so. i told only my roommate about it. incidentally, i have an extreme interest in ufo's and i am quite familiar with dr. steven greer's disclousre project. whether this is something with a more down-to-earth explanation or something of non-earth-based orgins is of extreme interest to me. somebody else in las vegas - a major city must have seen this. i'm guessing that if it's something that is easily explainable, then that's why nobody else mentioned anything.\r\n\r\nif mufon chooses to contact me, please do so on my cell phone number. i will return your call a.S.A.P. if i'm not immediately available. if mufon does decide to investigate this sighting, i would be extremely interested in finding out what your discover if anything. i do not have any photos of this object whatsoever. hopefully, somebody out there does and maybe come forward.

reservation, spotted 4 (or 5) large, stationary equidistant amber orbs in a zigzag pattern.  they were almost directly over the road (or, if further out than they appeared, over the sonoran desert natl. monument), though how far in the distance and at what altitude i don���t know.  twilight had almost completely faded.  they were not there more than 10-15 seconds before all the orbs disappeared at the exact same time as though someone had quickly turned down a dimmer switch to ���off���.  \r\nless than ten minutes later another set of lights - same color but elongated in shape and more tightly grouped/farther off - appeared in succession, this time to the southwest of 347, then quickly disappeared in the same order they appeared.  each would come on and soon fade out as its neighbor within the cluster followed suite.  we followed 347 and then 84 west to the i8 and headed south then east, seeing them further away to the sw yet again on two more occasions for no more than 6 seconds at a time, probably over the barry m. goldwater range at this point.  we turned south down stanfield rd., eventually heading into tohono indian reservation (and seeing another quick, stationary-yet fade-in/fade-out series of amber lights directly in front of us, to the south) before turning around.  as we headed back north, the series appeared again (around 8:30pm), this time to our south west, perhaps back over the goldwater range.  these were even further out, and as they faded, they seemed to become flickering white lights, far in the distance, apparently unmoving, coming and going from sight.  we had stopped the car, and could hear no jet noises at all, close or in the distance, and the air was calm.  when nothing more happened we headed back north to the 8 and east to the i10 for phoenix.\r\n while the last sets of flicking white lights may or may not have been flares, i cannot be certain either way, as they were so far off.  however the first set of equidistant orbs were like nothing i have ever seen in the sky before, and the succeeding groups were almost equally large and strange, instantly striking my wife and i each time as odd.\r\ntwice, 20 minutes apart, we saw what appeared to be shootings stars cross through the general vicinity of where the lights had just been.  in any case, the events were fascinating, strange, and unmistakably ���different.���\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":4706,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2996468,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04212006-0002","longitude":-112.4281464,"occurred":1145587380000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

which i had left open in this morning for the plants to get sun. as i was closing the blinds in one window i notice a bright orange light just above the east, north east horizon. i was unable to tell how far away it was though. atleast a couple miles. it's brightness captured my attention. as i know there is an airline path in that direction i waited and watched to see if it would turn, as usual, exposing it's navigation lights. the object did not seem to move. after about 30-45 seconds it moved slightly and the intensity of the light brightened to about a magnitude -3; quite large for what is usually in the sky. it was varying in color from red, orange, dark yellow, and white, similar to a bright flickering, scintillating star on a cold windy night but several times brighter and more orange. after a minute or so and moving a very short distance to the north east, approximately six tiny moving objects came around it over the top and some at the bottom. these were a golden-orange in color, steadly lighted but moved so freely in any direction. they were about a magnatude 2 or 3. it hit me like a ton of bricks! i knew exactly what i was seeing! i had a feeling of another reality as if i was seeing a ghost or some rare or forbidden sight. because i've seen this before about ten years ago, i dropped everything and ran for my video camera. as i got outside the scintillation had stopped and the satallite crafts had disappeared. i did capture video of this eire bright orange object, down to a -1 to a 0 magnatude object, start moving south, behind and then out again from the trees. it's movement was steady but somehow it had an odd charactar about itself. it just didn't seem usual. it than was hard south when it went behind a building. i went down to the end of my street to capture more video but it was gone.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, at the moment i do not have the technology to upload a video from a camcorder but i will forward it accordingly when i am able.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional
