resort on west oahu, from about 9:30-11:30am, april 5, 2006.  the weather was typically windy, sunny, with some clouds.  at around 10:30-10:45 a pair of f-15s in formation made 2-3 passes over the beach.  a third f-15 also made a couple of passes.  they appeared to be on landing approach to hickam afb and may have touched down a couple times.\r\n\r\naround 11am my wife noticed a formation of white objects in the sky over the ocean to the west about 15 degrees over the horizon and drew our attention to them.  i would estimate that they were initially arrayed vertically between 2,000 and 10,000 feet.  the objects were drifting, my first thought was that they were large birds--albatross or somesuch.  after further observation it became clear that the objects were too far away for us to see them if they were birds, and their altitude was well beyond the range that such birds inhabit.  they were giving off their own light, which appeared now to be greenish-white, like stars but appearing in daylight on a sunny day.  more objects appeared over the next few minutes.  at their peak activity i counted exactly twelve of them at different altitudes.  some of the objects interacted or merged with each other, then separated again.  their darting movements are what initially made them register as birds.\r\n\r\nby this time other people in the water and at the beach had noticed the strange objects and were observing them with us.  the objects gradually drifted south and from our vantage point gained altitude until they were at about 70 degrees relative to our position.  the objects individually \"blinked out\" until there were no more than three.  these last three grew fainter (presumably they were gaining altitude and putting distance between us) until they all had blinked out.  this entire encounter lasted about 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nthe f-15 patrol earlier did not appear to be making any sort of combat maneuvers when we saw them, but i speculate that they may have been at sea patrolling the area where the objects later appeared.\r\n\r\none theory could be decoy flares released by an aircraft.  however:\r\n\r\n1. these objects interacted with each other, and changed direction, which is why we initially mistook them for birds\r\n2. the objects gained quite a bit of altitude during our observation, which is inconsistent with a flare hypothesis.\r\n3. the objects were not bunched or lined up as much as a volley of flares is.  they were \"randomly\" distributed over a fairly wide area.\r\n\r\ni do not believe that these were seabirds for reasons already described and the fact that they were above any reasonable altitude for such birds.\r\n\r\ni am certain that these were not conventional aircraft.\r\n\r\nwhich makes them unidentified flying objects, that i am reporting to mufon.  i would be curious if you received other similar reports.","distance":"Over One

and got used to looking ahead of the noise when there were sonic booms, because whatever was there would be traveling faster than the sound. there was no sound at all when i saw this apparent shadow

i went to bed. i gazed up at the night sky to see how many planes and satellites i could see and count before i retired to bed. i just happened to look at an area of the southwestern night sky that was almost devoid of stars when a star-like light suddenly appeared from out of the blackness, grew with the intensity of an automobile's headlamps on high-beam at about a quarter mile away,then faded back out to nothingness without moving. it was as if the \"light\" was being operated by a \"dimmer-switch\", and lasted only 5 seconds or so from dim \"on\" to dim \"off\", bright white-white in color. the light got so bright that i remember i shielded my eyes and recoiled back thinking the light was shinning at me or coming right at me, much to my embarrassment later. then, approximately 3 seconds later, i observed a very faint meteor streaking out of the northern sky and disappearing in the area of the southwestern sky , midway up, where the light had just disappeared. i put my binoculars on the spot where the light disappeared and saw nothing but blackness. at first i thought i had just witnessed a supernova, but thought otherwise because the event only lasted afew seconds. then i got this feeling that maybe this \"light\" was not that far away, possibly in orbit or closer, and that the \"meteor\" was some kind of defense system, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. afterwards, i went inside and told both my mother and my brother what i had just witnessed outside. the next day at work i heard on the radio that the eastern us was experiencing a massive power outage and i couldn't help but wonder if what i saw the previous night had anything to do with it. since that event, i've been somewhat hesitant to continue looking at the night sky because i cannot

dark and clear that night, and i could see many stars. as i was walking down my street, i noticed a very bright orange, or orange yellow object low in the sky almost due east. i've always been very interested in astronomy, and have been an amatuer astronomer since i was a young boy, so the object looked unusual to me.  at first i wondered if it could be the planet jupiter or venus, which are often bright, but this object was too bright for that and the wrong color, and it was in the wrong part of the sky.  it also appeared to be drifting very slowly. i would estimate that it was quite a distance away - to me it looked like a very bright orange star.  it also shown with a very steady light - it didn't twinkle or flicker like most stars do.  i watched it in amazement for a couple of minutes but then continued on my walk around the block.  when i got back to my home, i searched the sky for it again but it was gone completely.  thinking that i may have lost it behind a tree or something (because it was rather low in the sky to start with), i kept looking, but never saw it again.  when i was watching the object, i wondered if it could be a plane, but i doubt that.  i saw no strobe lights or heard any noise whatsoever from it.  the thing that rather held me spellbound about it was the brightness and the orange color.  i put the sighting out of my mind for a few days, but never forgot about it.  after about a week i decided that i should report it to you.  i thought it was too unusual to just ignore.  i am a computer programmer by profession, and consider myself to be

and moved in with my sister just on the other side of town, one of these housing additions you see around here all the time now. anyway one hot night,sticky,and clear,i was doing what i always did, i had been up all night watching t.V. and everything was normal.\r\n\r\nkeep in mind this is a housing neiborhood so there are houses and streetlights all around.\r\n\r\nabout 4:20 or 4:25a.M. i was in my bedroom upstairs watching nick at nite. for no apparent reason i suddenly got an urge , not a voice in my head , just an urge to look out the window. i stood up and slowly peaked out the blinds, and when i did, across the street, right underneath a streetlight i saw 3 entities walking,a tall one, a shorter one and a tall one, in that order, the short one was between the tall ones.They were skinny, they had long limbs,slightly larger heads than humans, and they walked funny.\r\n\r\none of the strangest things about this experience was that the exact second i looked out the blinds they were starring at me , like they knew i would look out the blinds at that exact second.Also, they were not walking side by side like three humans most likly would, they were walking in a strait line, and like i said they were walking funny, kinda like zombies in them old zombie movies, backs bent,arms just dangleing,knees bent,like they weren't using much muscle, and heads dangeling aswell but cocked to stare at me.However, because of lighting outside, and in my room, or somthing like that i couldn't tell what color they were or make out any specific facial features,they just looked like black shadows in the streetlight,but not blobs, very well defined,ok.\r\n\r\nthey kept on starring at me and i kept on starring at them and they kept on walking untill i could not see them anymore cause' they went behind the other houses or something.\r\n\r\nonce they were out of my sight the next thing i remember was backing away from the window, puting my hands on my head and saying \"what do i do now\". then i slowly fell to the floor, i could not use my legs at all.So i crawled to my bed and lyed down.I was panicing. i just lyed there in bed, my heart racing,my legs useless,and i've never had a harder time trying to keep my eyes open, but for some reason i was afraid to fall asleep, i thought i would never wake up again.\r\n\r\nas i sat there in my bed i thought about screaming for my sister to come help me, and then i even thought about calling 911,but i did'nt, i just laid down and tried to relax,hopeing all these feelings would go away soon, and they did, thank goodness.\r\nafter a while i stood up and tried walking, it got better and better and eventually my heart beat went back to normal and i could walk again.\r\n\r\nsoon after that i fell asleep.\r\n\r\ni woke up the next day feeling normal'for the most part'. it was a buityfull day.\r\n\r\neight months later as i write this,the lingering psychological effects are slowly starting to diminish, and im getting better.No physical effects by the way.\r\n\r\n

in elsie. my mom, dad, and brother were in the minivan as well. it was after 9 o clock and the sky was clear and star filled. about 20 minutes into the drive while looking out the passenger side window my mother noticed a luminescent blue sphere shape off to her right in the night sky. (this wouldve been placed true west) i looked at it and it was a solid blue sphere shaped object no blinking lights. it was interesting but nothing to cause any questions or such in our opinion. it was then about 30 sec later my mom blurted out..\"look over there.\" on the east side of the sky (the drivers side) we could see a dark crimson sphere just like the blue one. we then looked over and could see the blue one in the same position that it was holding. my father had been driving about 50 miles an hour at the time due to good road conditions but slowed so we could get a better view of both of these lights. they always remained in front of our vehicle window which i mean to say is that we believed them to be traveling possible faster then us because they never truly moved out of our field of vision. my mom and dad rolled down thier windows to make sure we werent getting some sort of glare off a panel light. both lights were there. it was when my dad stuck his head out the window quickly to look at the red light that it was he noticed a ivory colored light in front of but above the van. my dad slowed down to about 15 to 20 miles so we could see the three objects. they were situated as such. the white sphere was in the midle at a higher level then the other 2. the red sphere was lower on the east side of the road and the blue one was on the west side. it was a triangle pattern. the star field was not blotted out within this formation leading us to believe it was 3 seperate objects. after a minute the white sphere lowered slowly and then lined itself vertically with the other 2. the red and blue sphere's began to move towards the white one and they swapped places. blue going to the east side and the red on the west. they then pulled closer to the white light and increased thier speed and we lost them near a clump of trees situated at m-21 which we were approaching at the time of the last visual contact. my main reaction was a mixture of confusion and astonishment. my adrenaline had me up for a little that night. i would be happy to provide a drawing to submit later for you if interested. thank you.

14:50 as we turned down a hill towards our street which is west at the bottom of the hill, we were  facing north north west comming down the hill. i am avid aviation enthusiast so i am familiar with the silhouettes of commerical, military, and civilan, aircraft these object resembled none of the known aircraft. i observed the objects which were equally spaced in a tandem bank to what would be their port sides. the craft then disappeared into the sky which was very overcast at the time but their \"glow\" could still be faintly seen, when they reappeared about two to 3 seconds later there was only four  and they were in pairs one pair was noticeably higher in altitude and to the left (our perspective) of the other pair. the craft then separated into the clouds individually for about two-three seconds again, when they emerged from the clouds again the fifth had rejoined the formation and they were in a tandem bank to their starboard sides again equally spaced between each other, the continued the bank until their formation was heading west (the formation for both banks was a column) the craft then went into a vertical climb at a very steep angle and at a high rate of speed and disappeared into the clouds again. they reappeared 4 seconds later in a delta formation and were banking to their port sides again, they broke formation and stacked themselves vertically in the center of the sky and hovered for about 25-30 seconds just pulsating, the upper four craft then \"slid\" down at the same time until the five were level with the horizon and then started another vertical but more gradual climb and proceed to do a \"continuous\" loop this lasted for 4 seconds they they broke off and i lost them in the clouds. when i reached the bottom of the hill i saw them for the last time before i turned west and caught a glimpse at the craft they were a \"sting-ray\" shape but were completely smooth, they also looked to be surrounded by a \"haze\" i last observed them heading northwest three were in the rear and abreast of each other with two leading abreast of each other, the outer most one of the \"three\" broke formation and slid up under and to the right of the leading two while the two in the rear climbed slightly above the leading three. throught this sighting the craft always maintained vertical and horizontal separation the distance between the craft was consistently equal there was also no sound that was accompaning any of this i lost sight of them in the clouds.\r\n  my reaction to this was i could not believe what i was seeing and was bothered that for the life of me i could not identify what i was witnessing. when i first saw these objects i thought it might have been birds but after observing the first \"maneuver\" i ruled that out. i was actually mesmorized when i saw it i was excited and scared at the same time. a cessna 172 flew over about 3 minutes later and my friend who has no interest in aviation looked up and said \"now thats an airplane.\" i also filed a report with the national ufo reporting center. i just figured the more people who knew the better chance i might have of getting what i saw confirmed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:06:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4643,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4469348,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04042006-0020","longitude":-79.9902264,"occurred":1144101000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1144101000000,"summary":"5
