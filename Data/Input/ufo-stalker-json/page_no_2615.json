from ww ii) while a civilian employee of phillips petroleum company. i'd been recruited while employed in the labatory of phillips refinery in kansas city, kansas.\r\nphillips had developed a lab model of a solid jato unit at bartlesville, oklahoma and we were developing a working model with live firings. \r\ni was posted at \"proving grounds\" a distance from area \"f\" on the reservation requiring driving to \"f\". my immediate supervisor was at \"f\", a small one story building with an adjacent parking lot.\r\ni'd come to \"f\" for some sort of business with my supervisor. just inside the doorway on the left was an office, not my supervisor's. there was this fellow in there whom i'd never spoken with and had no idea what his name was. (all kinds of \"secret\" and \"confidential\" protocol around the place) \r\nhowever, on this particular day, as i was entering the building he called, \"horn!\" i wasn't even aware he knew me! i acknowledged him and he got up from his desk and said, \"did you see that flying saucer out there when you came in?\" i recall remarking, \"no, but i saw the cup and spoon.\" it wasn't unusual for remarks about going to the moon some day and such around the place.  \"come outside.\" i joined him in the parking lot where he pointed up toward the sky and said, \"see that?\" i didn't see anything and he persisted in drawing my attention towards the sky. finally i saw a round disk shaped object, sort of like dull dark aluminum in color. it appeaared about like looking at a lead pencil head on. he asked me, \"what do you think?\" i really wasn't sure and suggested a weather balloon___maybe? i'd no more said that than the object abruptly moved in a straght line for a very short distance. he then said, \"have you ever seen a weather balloon do that?' i, of course, answered, \"no\". then i recall him saying, \"now you've seen one. we used to see them all the time at los alamos.\" with that he turned and walked back inside and i followed and went on to my supervisor's office to take care of the business i'd come for.\r\nto this day, i really have no idea what i was seeing. it was too far away and had no distinguishing features.\r\nthe only other strange and unusual thing i recall was when i was about twelve years old and was coming home late at night from a movie theater. as i was walking near my home i heard a definite spewing noise far above me which seemed to be traveling from the southwest to the northeast. i could see nothing but could clearly hear the sound. it was similar to when one breaks (bends) a firecracker and then lights the exposed powder. that best describes the sound. whatever it was it didn't seem to be moving particularly fast.\r\nby the way, that twelve year old reference? i'm seventy-four now.\r\ndo either of these incidents seem familiar to you?\r\ni watch with interest the history channel programs on ufo and read as well. i can only consider the roswell incident and the one at the air base in england really worthy of much consideration. \r\nwhile on a day off (policeman at the time in kck) there was a reported incident during my normal shift time in which there was much radio traffic of some sort of \"sighting.\" i talked to a fellow officer in which he related how two men came to his house shrotly after the incident. they seemed only interested in the distance (in degrees) the object was from the horizon. one, he said, mentioned some sort of oil spot that had been found on the desert floor in nm (the roswell incident?) that had turned out to be, according to news reports at the time, ordinary 20 wt. motor oil. the fellow told him it wasn't motor oil.\r\nof course, from my personal experience working in that refinery lab, there was no  test that would determine the viscosity of an oil by sampling some sandy samples. \r\nwho knows? like i said, the only two incidents that seem worth serious consideration are roswell and the air base in england. i don't give a lot to my two incidents since i don't really have any information other than what i mentioned.\r\nthat said, i appreciate that some organization is checking out whatever is happening. some must be true.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

we were at a local elementry school filming stunts we were doing off the playground equipment (i.E. slides, jungle gyms, and swings) when my friend was blinded by the object and nearly missed a pole he jumping to. we started recording the metallic looking object. the flash in his eyes was like being cuaght in the wrong position of a mirror and the sun. the object flew around a bit as if looking for something. it started to descend into a field. we ran straight towards it because it was blocked by some trees. when got into view of the object it had already touched ground. the object looked like a giant flat cd with a slightly domed tope and was made of shiny metal with no windows or doors from what we could tell. we couldnt tell what kept it propped up on the ground. we recorded it on the ground for about a 30 second period before it lifted off the ground and sped off toward the mountains at lightning fast speeds. about 3-4 minutes later 6 camo-colored helicopters raced after it. that night we made 3 copies of the tape. then the next day we drove down the fort carson military base. we didn't have ids to get into the base so we showed the tape the to the gate guards. they took our phone numbers, addresses, and a copy of the tape. they took us very seriously. we heard nothing from them until a few days ago. we were just hanging out at his house when his bell ringed. he answered the door and two men were standing there and asked his name. my friend replied and they shoved their way into the house. the two men looked almost identical, wore black suits, very pale skin as they had never been in the sun before, they were bald and spoke in monotone, the only color on thier face was their very red lips. they sat down with us and started asking us questions. they ased if we showed anyone else the tapes, like the media. we told them that we sent a tape to the gazette, local newspaper. after about 10 minutes of questioning us about what we saw, by the way they wrote nothing down, they asked to see the two remaining tapes. we got the tapes and put one in the vcr and one of the men wanted to see the actual tape. as soon as the tape was done we gave the other one to them, then they started to get violent. they said if anyone asked if they were there to say no, if anyone asked about the tapes we were to say it was a hoax, if we told anyone about what we saw that day they would \"lock up all our families and make sure nobody remembered us.\" they then continued to start searching his house. my girlfriend later said two men came by with a warrent to search the property. at my friend's house they even came across about an ounce marijuana and tossed it aside as if it were just another piece of paper. they the left abruptly. we now have no evidence of what we saw. you now understand why i have to remain unknown.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

housing where i lived in the late 60's.  i got to the officer's housing side of the road separating the two housing areas.  i remember the area where i stopped as a dry playground area with a large swing set. i remember stopping dead in my tracks because i knew something was there then over me, and then a bright light that lit up everything around me including the swing set. i do not remember noise to speak of.  i don't remember feeling fear.  the thing seemed to just be sitting above me.  i then remember me just in awe or something limp and not moving, and standing looking up seeing a round or round-like shape on at least the part that i could see though the light.  the bright light went out and then i could see more of the colored lights and the it was gone.  i don't remember being able to see it leave, it just seemed to be there and then not there.  all i remember after that was a feeling that unexplained time had passed by because it was now dusk and getting cooler, and after it left it was dark and i started to run home.  i vividly remember feeling like i had to hurry because i was going to get into bug trouble for not being home by dark.  i also felt that this incident was overwith as fast as it started.  it seemed like an instant but at the same time much more than an instant in time.  my parents never remembered, but i remember my mother saying something about my sunburn.  off and on through the years i have questioned my father about things.  he says he has no knowledge of a ufo sighting that would have been so close to luke afb during his station.  he was a pilot.  i know something unexplainable happened to me, and i know it was not a helicopter or other explainable aircraft of that day.  i knew this when it happened, and i know it today.  i have told close friends, sisters, and parents of this incident; but no one cares much to hear about it.  they just shake their heads and say they don't have any doubt i say something as a child that was unexplainable.  i feel disconnected sometimes, because i don't think they do understand.  it makes me feel like a looney tune. this experience did happen to me, and even at the age i was; i was smart enough to remember things all these years. i yearn to talk to others who may have had an experience, but i don't know anyone.  i don't remember the exact date and time, but know that it was either during the last year or the year before the last year that we lived on luke afb.  and, i don't remember it being horribly hot.  so i don't believe this happened during summer months.  i wrote about this one other time somewhere on-line, but didn't hear anything back.  i can't even remember what the website was now.  not too much to report, no pictures, and no other witnesses that i am personally aware of.  however, i have always had this desire to know more about ufo's, since this encounter.  i am facinated by anything i can watch, and read searching for things that support my own sighting and feelings.  i don't know if it means anything, but after this sighting i have had strong feelings about some things before they actually happen.  i guess you might call them premenitions.  also, with no seizure or epilepsy history on either sude of my families; i had a seizure at the age of 46.  i had heard something on a program that either all or nearly all of the men on a famous ufo case had seizures later in life after their sighting/abduction. who really knows if anything is related to a single incident.  i feel like an infant trying to soak in everything i can learn to come that much closer to some kind of answer for this unknown, strange, and before it happened unimaginable experience.  i saw a hypnotherepist on t.V., and wonder how much money it would cost me to see if there is more that i can't remember on the surface or to verify that something did happen to me.  i feel connected to something out there and don't know what it is.  is there any information you can provide like any other case like mine that was close or on luke a.F.B. during the time that i am reporting?  \r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to at least document this. i hope that whoever reads this will understand my curiosity and unending desire to search for answers.\r\n\r\nheidi maule\r\n\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"21-100

with my friend jake and his wife denise when a big flash of light startled me. now, we were in the middle of a thunderstorm watch so it wasn't to be unexpected. but what really confused me was the color of the flash, a bright blue. after the flash, my truck experienced difficulty, total difficulty, in fact it stalled right there in the middle of the street. besides the truck, i noticed that my watch and my cell phone were powerless too. i got out to check out the engine of my truck and i heard this looping sound very similar to a harley davidson, but i was all alone on the road. no one in sight. well, my heart was up in my throat when i looked up in the sky to see this big blue disc-shaped object. it had to have been that object making the noise, and the more i heard this noise the more it sounded less like a motorcycle and the more it sounded like this weird metallic/electrical sound. i know this is going to sound stupid, but the best way to describe the sound is the sound that those ships make in those matrix movies. the thing was just hovering there for the longest time, i stood as still as possible. as the only thing living in the area that i knew of, i didn't want to draw attention to myself. i've heard to many stories about abductions to try and be a brave man now. after what must have been five minutes, the object started going back and forth across the sky. i ducked down, i wanted this to be over. then after a couple minutes of this hovering over the area, it disappeared in the same fantastic blue flash that it came in. as soon as the flash had disappeared, my truck turned back on all by itself as did my cell phone, but my watch was still broken. i know the encounter took 7 minutes and 11 seconds because my watch was stopped at 8:50:49 and when i got into my truck, the clock just turned to 8:58. my phone was another story. when i looked at it, there were 40 missed calls, all of them unknown. i called a few of my friends, including my friend jake asking them if they had seen the object and had called me. but all i got were laughs and confused reactions. i'd like to forget this whole experience, i feel as if i'm going crazy. i saw something about mufon on the history channel, so i thought i'd give you this story to add to your records. i hope that telling the story to someone who wants to hear it will get it out of my system

believe to have been falling space objects, either metors or metoeites).\r\ni lost sight of the object because it just seemed to go out like someone turned off the light or it excellerated so fast that it left my field of vision without my knowing it. it was about 30 degrees above the horizion all the time i observed it.","distance":"Over One

the shell that looked like bumps (it wasn't perfectly smooth) and it wobbled a bit. it made no noise and it was so close i think just beyond a stones throw away. all we did was stand there and watch it aprox 5 minutes. it suddenly starting spinning very fast and then in a blink of a eye it was half of the size. it was higher in the sky alot higher. we watched it after it had climbed high in the sky it then moved higher and corkscrewed upwards untill we could not see it anymore. and just as it dissapeared from sight there were 3 us airforce jets that came flying in they were green and had a

78 my father and i rowed into a lake not accessable by road to stay the wekend and fish. i think i'll loose credibitity when i tell you i was only 11 years old at the time,but my father and i have spoken about this many times and we remember the same things with his memory more detailed than mine. we spent a long physical day getting into the lake and i was young and not long to go to sleep after turning in for the night. my father and i didnt have a tent, we just turned the boat up on its side and put a stick to hold it on a 45degree angle to protect us should it rain. i was asleep and was awoken by my father telling me to look into the sky, i first saw one bright white light, far brighter than any star ive even seen, it was very high in the sky, much higher than airplanes but about the same size as the light on an airplane at regular flying altitude.The first light did an amazing pattern of directions, very quickly changing direction at every angle not just 90 degree turns but every angle you could think of. this light would make about 8-10 turns then stop, all in just seconds, perhaps 2-4 seconds and another bright white lighht would then fly into view from far out and do the exact same pattern in the sky and stop near the first light, then the first one would take off on another zig zagged pattern and again stop, once the first one stopped the second would repeat the firsts pattern.My father and i watched this for about 20 minutes when they suddenly and at the same time took off in a straight up motion and out of sight, they seemed to go out into space, sounds crazy right? i know. anyhow, about 3-4 minutes after they sped off my father saw and showed me another light far off in the sky's distance, this time the light was flashing and traveling straight accross the sky, it only took a few minutes and it got closer and we knew right away it was an airplane, we watched the airplane go accross the sky and eventually out of view, about 4-5 minutes of the plane being out of our sight the unknown bright white light returned, it appeared as though it came straight down from outter space, not accross the sky but down out of the sky, and again started with crazy , very fast zig zagged patterns accross the sky, and again it would stop after 8-10 moves and the second would repeat the firsts design and stop beside it and they repeated this for another half an hour or so and then suddenly at great speed zipped up and out of our view. a few minutes later my father again pointed out a flashing light off in the sky's distance, another plane, we again watched this plane and about 5-7 minutes of the second plane going out of sight the first bright white light returned again. i can add that everytime a plane entered the sky those bright white lights would leave in a hurry and straight up only to come back once the aitrplanes were far away, the planes would often take 10- 15 minutes to get completely out of sight from where they entered out line of sight in the sky, i often fell asleep while waiting for the planes to leave and the white lights to come back, but my father would wake me every time they returned.Speaking with my father he tells me that after a while he coudln't wake me up anymore, well,,, he could wake me but i couldn't stay awake i was just too tired from the days hike,. my father says he watched those two lights in the sky for close to 3 hours and they would do all kinds of different patterns in the sky, they didnt seem to be doing/flying repeated patterns or \"directions\", if you will? the only consistent things were that they knew a plane was coming far befor we could see it and they would fly into outter space and only come back after the planes were far out of sight, they alweays did one light at a time designs and then the second would do the same directions and stop besides the first over and over again. personally i remember seeing them do this and being interupted 3 time sby airplanes, then i fell slept until moring.\r\n   this all happened back in 78, cam corders were not around back then as you know, nor did we have a camera with us. when my father awoke me and pointed this out in the sky i thought it was what i stil think they were, ufo's, i wasnt scared i think perhaps because i had my father with me, he was my hero and i always felt safe with him around so i didnt feel in danger at all. i nor my father recall these lights being anyhting but bright white, changing shape just slightly if at all, they seemed to be round or disc , they were very very far from us up in the sky, far higher than the planes were flying. this si the best discription i can give of the objects, i lost sight of them when i fell asleep waiting for them to come back and from what my father tells me he too fell asleep after watching them for close to 3 hours and they left due to a plane.\r\n   i realise this is not a very great report, no pictures ot anything of the sort and a very old happening on top of it all.But i assure you this did happen, as sure as i'm sitting here typing this. just thought it might help your data collection if others have reported this to compare it to. i will also add that the airport in cape breton island, nova scotia closes at 6pm it a very small place but the planes we saw are regular sightings there as many planes fly over that area going to and coming from europe\r\nthank you,\r\nrobert white.\r\n   for the record. so not to controdict myself in your questions, i now live in the cayman islands, but was born and raised in east cost canada.\r\n   i keep coming back to this part aftyer i read more of your questions and i wish to elaberate on things. this happened when i was young, my father and i had great health back then, however over the years we have both been in very poor health, i have ben inflicted with an unknown problem/condition wheer i take between 2000-3ooomg of morphine every day just to deal with the pain and keep me mobile, yet doctors cant say for sure whats wrong with me, i've heard it all, the only thing doctors havent told me is that im pregnant! my health problems started about 9-10 years after this \"sighting\" althought i highly doubt they are coneccted, after all, its not like we were close to those lights or anyhting like that.Many years after this sighting my father was put into the hospital wand was there almost 6 months in quarintine, finally one day out of frustration my father left the hospuital with out doctors approval, they never were able to tell him what made him so sick for so long.It took almost 3 yeasrs for the sickness he suffered to go completly away, he is no longer terriably sick all the time but has never experianced god health after that hospital episode. i wanted to ginhve all the details as best and as honestly as i can, i was going to just click that we are both in great health because i dont think these things are realated, but i thought better of it for your research.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

was very fasinated by it since i had seen that same thing back in about 1951 with my grandmother on her front porch when i was about 8 years old.  this event occurred in either the spring, summer, or fall.  the year is an approximate. my timing couldn't be off more than a year or two i think. the incident with my grandmother has been reported also.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4616,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.2105304,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04032006-0009","longitude":-85.9172396,"occurred":71809500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":71809500000,"summary":"A

dusk on a summer evening. we were staring out in front of her house when all of a sudden a silvery disc about the size of a 1970's volkswagen appeared and was hovering about 3 feet over the gravel road directly in front of her house.  the road was about 30 feet in front of her house. the disc had red and green alternating lights around the top of it. it never ever made a single sound. at that time i had not heard of ufo's and had no idea what it could be. my first thought was that i was very scared and should run in the house at once. my next thought was that \"if they were going to get me, they would get me anyway and i wanted to see what was going to happen next.\"  my grandmother and i looked at each other as if to say, \"what is it?\" but we never ever said a word to each other or anyone else about it. i told this story for the first time about 10 years later. my grandmother died about 3 years later. to my knowledge, she never told anyone about it. the disc stayed in that position about 5 minutes. it then took off so fast across the field in front of us that it disappeared almost instantly.  i am now a pilot. to my knowledge, there was nothing in our world at that time that could behave in that fashion. i have always been fasinated about mysterious events ever since and particularly ufo phenomenen.  i also saw a disc like this one about 20 yrs later in columbus, in. i will file that report also.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

event, but i did not remember until few years later, when my sister and i were talking. we spoke of the moving lights under a huge circular apparatus above our heads, approximately 100' in the air. i completely forgot what happened, but i sensed or felt that a amount of time was missing.\r\n\r\nin 1994, i exprienced the presence of three individuals, a tall skinny entity, brilliant white light image or form, and two other small black beings with reflective dark eyes. i remember looking at the tall entity, when he placed his middle finger in the center of my forehead, after that i don't remember a thing, except that i woke up very weak. after this event i started making very futurisctic drawings of temples, devices, etc. i developed a better sense towards everything that surrounds me, and today, i still very inspired and motivated with everything that has to do with the unknown.\r\n\r\na few years later, by coincidence i discovered a long mark in my genital area, it looks like a perfectly performed laser surgery from top to bottom. \r\n\r\nin addition, i removed a crystal like object from the back of my head. it was so tiny that i dropped it on the ceramic floor, making the sound of piece of crystal. and i was never able to find it.\r\n\r\nfor samples, please visit my site www.Alezones.Com this is a living proof of how these experiences changed my life for the

contemplating the stars.  i have seen many airplanes in that area but what i saw was completly different. it was like two stars in form and color, one was behind the other and both had the same size and goes at the same speed very slow. i though maybe could be one single object but i keep on watching it and wanting it not to desappear but instantly it desapeared the one in the front first and then the other.  the were no clouds in the sky, it was completely clear...A beautiful night to see the stars.  i remember by that time mars were near the earth and that night it was beside the moon & that was what i was looking for.  but after that day at the same time i went outside i start to see many of them.  at first i start to think they were satellites but they were to many and some travel in group of two...Some were bigger and others get nearer and their light get bigger, very bright...A white light that i ever seen.  they look like stars, if you are watching the sky you are seeing something like a star and then suddenly it begin to move.  usually they appear from nowhere and they desappear in the same way.  always i see them when the first stars begins to appear but never late at night. i moved to virginia on december 27 and i was affraid i wouldn't see those stars again but i was wrong.  i start to see just a few in a night but since a week ago they are starting to appear again...Many of them and on march 27...(i think is not a concidence the date) but it was the fist time i saw a little one getting out of a big one.  i needed to report this because something is happening whatever they are.  i don't have a good zoom camera but i tried to captured them and i took photos of airplanes and those strange moving stars to compare them...They look very different.  i took the photos with a canon ps510 with a tripod i will sent you pictures of both cropped and putting more contrast to make the objects clearer...But i keep the original ones, full resolution for if you need them.  i will keep on taking pictures of them and hopefully by the end of this month i will get a canon eos20d with a 55mm-85mm lense wich is more better to take this kind of pictures.  i can give you the settings of the camera too if you ask.  i want you to believe me because i have seen them very near and i could not see any shape on them just a great white light.  i got worried because i though that maybe that could be radiation but that is why i am here.  you are the experts, please let me know any info you have if you know something about it.  i can show you in person too if we plan a meeting...I think that is the best proof i can give. well that is all by now.\r\n\r\ny\r\n\r\nnote:the first photo below is an airplane, the rest are the

was out for a walk in my neighbourhood. while turning a corner, i happened to look up into the sky, and see two very thin, very defined beams of light, ssw of my position, about 45-55 degrees above the horizon. i first thought that these were the aurora borealis, but they were stationary, did not have the pattern of aurora, as i have seen them before, and only changed in brilliance. they also only occupied a very small portion of the sky. the second line, which was orange, then disappeared. the remaining line turned from very light blue, to pure white. i observed this white light, but the glare from the streetlights in the neighbourhood had washed out the object. i made it to a darker area, a pathway, and observed the white beam of light for about 5 minutes, until cloud cover obscured it. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be simply a line, surrounded by a dull field of light. it was stationary. when i first sighted the object, there were two lines of light next to each other, one orange, and one light blue. the orange line disappeared, and the light blue one turned to white. a field of dull light surrounded the white line, and it then became blocked by cloud cover.\r\n\r\ni was stunned by what i saw, and felt that i could not adequately explain it. afterwards, i attempted to scour the news for stories of meteor sightings, or instances of aurora borealis over lower north america, but found nothing.\r\nthere were storms over the u.S. midwest at the time, and i wondered if there was any correlation, as my estimate, based on object size, altitude, and position in the sky would place the object in that vicinity.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4609,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.457539,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-04032006-0002","longitude":-79.694458,"occurred":1144084080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,
