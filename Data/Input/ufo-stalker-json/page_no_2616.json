thought was that it was an aircraft.  however the lights suddenly faded out.  i assumed that it was obscured by the tree so i moved further up the yard.  it was then that i saw an orange fireball.  i had seen one before several years ago and assumed that it was just a meteor striking the atmosphere.  however i suddenly felt it was out of place.  i called to my mother to come outside and went on looking for any other lights.  my mother came over and asked what was going on.  i told her what i had seen, and joked that she was going to think i was crazy.  we stared up at the sky for sometime and was about to go back inside when the three lights reappeared, followed by another set of three lights further to the north.  we were both shocked and a little disconcerted.  we have been around aircraft all our lives, since my father is a pilot.  however, we both knew this was no aircraft.  the lights remained on for a few seconds before they appeared to drop and fade out.  we could not hear any engine noise or see any solid shape.  the lights were very bright, and large.  this made is somewhat difficult to judge the distance.  we knew friends that live in that general direction so i called them.  i told her what we had seen, and she went outside.  we continued our conversation when suddenly the lights reappeared.  she was also shocked and said that the lights appeared to be slowly moving in a north eastern direction.\r\nwe remained outside for about twenty minutes, seeing another glimpse of these lights. i called another friend who also lived in that direction.  she was not that surprised and stated that last year, also during april, they were outside doing a program at wolf park.  in the middle of the program they also saw these lights.  many of the staff and members of the public saw them too. i have never been a beliver in this sort of phenomenon and am still not sure what we saw.  i did find it interesting that the lights were in the direction of

satellite moving across the sky because it seemed to be too high to be a jet of some sort unless it was a military craft that flew at very high levels.  anyway i stopped walking and watched it.  about 5 to 10 seconds after i stopped to watch it, the object grew in brightness and remained really bright for about 3 seconds then faded back to where it was previously.  i chuckled and said to myself something like well if this is another ufo then it is acknowledging me that it knows i am watching it.  casually i watched it as it kept on moving off in a general south eastern flight path.  after about 3 minutes or so, i couldn't track it due to trees so i stopped watching and went on to get the paper and go back inside the house.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

my kids off at there mothers home, at the time i was talking on the phone to my uncle when i noticed a strange blue light  to the east south east at first i thought it was a plane. there has been a lot of plane activity in the aria lately so i didn���t think anything of it. i drove down the road continuing to talk to my uncle and watching the strange light as we were talking i began to notice the light didn���t appear to be moving it seemed to be staying with me like the moon in the night sky when your driving at night. at this point i began to get this strange feeling and was telling my uncle about what was going on. i had been watching the light for approx 8 minutes. i was now in marshal county approx 2 miles from state rd 331 when things really got strange i was talking to my uncle and watching the light when suddenly my phone went dead, i looked down and my car stereo went on full volume to nothing but static, and all the gauges in my car were bouncing back and fourth erratically. then my car totally shut down. i hit the breaks to stop the car, looked out the windshield to look for the light and it was gone. i jumped out of my car to look around the sky to see if i could see the light and there was nothing in the sky. my car at this point came back on as nothing had ever happened, all the lights and gauges were functioning normally, the radio was back on the station i was listening to at normal volume, my cell which i had thrown to the passenger seat was now back on and functioning normally. i immeadely called my uncle back, my hole body was shaking at this point, and told him what happened. from his end he said a very loud pulsing sound rite before the phone cut to a busy signal. the time between calls was approx two minutes. needless to say i was really freaked out. later that evening i called the bremen police followed by the state police to see if anyone had reported any weird lights in the sky i told them what happened and they told me that no won had called but the had an officer in the aria and they would be checking it out.

earth's ground.  i saw the first one (i thought it was a plane, we get many over-head), and then a second one, i thought no-way, military!  the third one convinced me, this was no walk in the park, it scared me!  reason why is the 3rd flew in sequence, the sequence was so advanced that they approx. could have been about 100 miles apart.  i can't explain, for one, planes don't fly like what i saw.  they made no noise (the only noise i heard was from other planes, (almost like a roar or a swarm flying in after them?)).  it was weird, the three ships flew, but not that fast, at first.  i walked up the road still seeing them, like i could keep up, soon they disappeared way beyond an enviroment that was almost not noticeable, like a paradox or dimimesion, not of this earth.  i'm not saying they disappeared in a flash, it's that they seemed close, but could have been a hundred of miles away.  red, orange, and yellow is all the craft shown (mostley red), i don't know what it was, besides ufos.

deck and shortly noticed an odd \"star\" low off the aft quarter. it appeared larger and closer than any others and seemed to \"bob\" very slightly.  just before going back below, this \"star\" suddenly executed an extremely high-speed 3 legged manuever in the shape of a perfect figure \"4\" that went almost horizon to horizon in approximately 3 seconds, passing directly over the ship. i immediately reported the incident to the officer-of-the-deck.  he and i went back on deck where he soon witnessed further manuevring & then we quickly proceeded to the cic (combat information center)radar room.  the officer in charge of cic confirmed that four \"unknowns\" were present on radar at the time and commented they \"had been trailing the ship for almost a week now\". when queried by the od as to why we had not launched any aircraft to investigate a potential threat to the ship, the reply was that the craft had been recorded manuevering at speeds as high as 25 thousand mph and there simply was no point. i also recall that when the (very young) od asked why there were no entries of these events in the ship's log, he was informed that they had indeed been reported \"through the proper channels\" and that, \"per standing orders\", such events were never entered into the ship's official log.I  then returned topside and viewed all of the craft via the signal bridge binoculars for about another 30 minutes before having to return to my duty station.  they all appeared as solid metallic orbs with a band of softly flashing lights across their center that changed colors sequentially. while i do remember that there was a distinct and common pattern to the sequence of colors that appeared to rotate around each of these craft, i no longer recall the actual sequence.\r\n\r\nnote: at the time, the kittyhawk was attached to taskforce 77 and the flaghip for the 7th fleet and operating in the deep pacific, so i have no way of determining a precise location.  the ship was on it's way to the gulf of tonkin for a tour of combat duty in viet nam.  while the actual event is still quite vivid, i am uncertain as to the actual date (it may even have been the tour of 1965).  it was a long time ago and while i have previously related this information to several interested parties, this is the first time i have actually filed a formal written report of this incident. it had a profound effect on my thinking and eventually led to my participation in project visit, a not-for-profit texas based ufo investigative organization.","distance":"Over One
