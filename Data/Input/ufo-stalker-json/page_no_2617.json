work. wanting to turn right onto the main road, i was blocked by a tan pickup truck pulled and parked askew in the road, its driver still in the cab. i thought nothing of it for a moment as i took the time to shuffle through my cds, but upon looking back up i grew irritated that the driver in front of me had not moved on yet given that i was running late for work. that is until i looked in the direction he also appeared to be looking.\r\n   there past the cornfield and above the distant tree-line was an enormous hovering object gleaming against the cloudless sky. at that time of morning the sun and clear sky are extremely bright, but this object was shining marvelously and unmoving, huge given the distance.\r\n   the other witness and i just sat in our vehicles watching for several minutes. but it was our similar reactions that are most stunning to me. i am a person extremely interested in unexplained phenomena, but had never been witness. furthermore i am not opposed to shrugging off work or being late. with my house just down the street, i had but to run back down the street and grab a camera or at least sit the watching for the duration.\r\n   rather the truck in front of me simply pulled away and i routinely followed, never looking back. even more peculiar, by the time i had reached the stop sign only a short distance down the road. in fact it was not until about six months later that the memory came flooding back as clear as the object had been.\r\n  while talking to my mother one evening the memory finally returned, but with anger and regret that i could have behaved so carelessly, something i could not (nor could anyone else who knows me) have been capable of without some kind of outside influence.\r\n   i know that this account is all but worthless with the lack of evidence and the loss of memory for such a long period of time (something which angers me even today), but it is my story and sworn truth in all

roseau, county.  so here goes ��� a personal entry for you to send on to mufon if you like.  i was 22.\r\n\r\nlate on a june evening (11 pm or so) i wrapped up a scrabble game with my folks and while dad made a nightcap i headed outside for a little air.  it was a clear night with a slight breeze, just enough to get rid of mosquitoes.  (i was home on the farm doing a summer project through college).  my dad farmed about 280 acres\r\n\r\nwest of the county road 2, about ��� mile south of what is called the summer road.  on the east side of the road is billy hagen���s land (billy now owns dad���s old place, the hemmingson farm back then) .  there is a little grove a bit north of where our road meets country road 2.  bill had the field planted in wheat that summer.\r\n\r\nthere is a narrow ditch grade to the right of our road, maybe a couple hundred yards or so.  and as i stood by the edge of billy���s field, i saw this little light coming down that ditch grade, maybe 20 feet up or even less.\r\n \r\n\r\nnow, there is a little municipal air port in warroad, 12 miles east and another in roseau, 17 miles est.  but this thing made no noise.  and as i stood there i\r\n\r\nsaw this circle of lights going around it, blue and white i think.  it was small.  and then the object stopped.  that���s when it hit me ��� a ufo.  about this time i also realized everything had gone still ��� the crickets and frogs were silent, like they are when a predator is around.  all i could hear was my heartbeat and the\r\n\r\nwind on the wheat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nnow the object slid left, and then right, in a perfect horizontal plane.  that again confirmed ufo in my mind since i know of nothing else that can move \r\n\r\nlike that.  i guess i stood there looking at it for maybe 2 minutes and then, still utterly silent, it arched up into the sky at an impossible speed (very high!) and \r\n\r\nzipped overhead and down the western horizon.  it moved so fast i could scarcely turn my head fast enough and it streaked is moved so fast.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nafterward i told my father who was very moved by this and we stood out there for some time.  he told me about some of the recent sightings ��� don���t recall if he mentioned the sheriff one at that time but i know i heard about it from my folks  so it was either after this or before it.  there had also been cattle killings and\r\n\r\nthe vet had never seen anything like them ��� these cattle had no blood and no wounds that he could find (nothing like the ���mutilation��� cases that so many\r\n\r\nsay are just what animals look like after bloating.  any farmer or vet would know the difference.  don���t know if these were related but a lot of us wondered.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

after dark, car started fine and the lights were bright. arrived at dugout wells (still within the park) about 30 minutes later, lights still bright on car with no dimness.  turned the car off to listen for owls and other wildlife (just rolled windows down and listened through window).  about 10 minutes later (wanted to move to a better spot and get out of car) tried to start the car but nothing happended, it just went tunk.  not even the normal wa-wa-womp that you hear when you have a low battery.  so i opened my car door to look under the hood, thought maybe i lost a fan belt for the alternator and that is why the car wouldn't start.  i just couldn't imagine that the battery would do nothing when it was fine 10 minutes ago.  when i opened the car door the dome light was bright then dim, then off completely, then dim, then off, then bright, etc. while the door buzzer was going through the same things, normal, weird buzz, no buzz at all.  the radio lights came on then started flashing and freaking out, the radio at one point came on by itself then off by itself.  while i was looking under the hood, the cd player started ejecting then sucking up the cd and didn't stop until i asked my friend to pull it out.  it seemed like the car computer was freaking out for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\na few minutes later we are sitting in the car with the doors closed, we are facing north adn to my left but behind me and behind some cottonwood trees but high in the sky, there is a huge explosion of light that stayed there for several seconds lighting up the sky then streaked towards the earth (towards the chisos moutains which were south and a little west of us).  it reminded me of a flare but it stayed suspended in the sky far longer, was far, far brighter, and it streaked towards the earth at a much faster rate of speed than a flare (because of the parachutes on them). \r\n\r\n\r\nmoments later, to the east, on the face of a cliff in mexico there was a light glowing, moving and changing colors.  we could make out the outline of the top of the cliff in mexico which i assume was about 30 miles away.  the produced a glow across the desert which encompassed the car and lasted about 20 minutes then disappeared.  the light on the cliff appeared and disappeared many times during this observation.  about 15 minutes later, the light produced a spot light which scanned the desert, including our car.  the spotlight changed colors from white to blue to red.  this lasted for about 10-15 minutes.  after watching the desert \"glow\" twice from the light on the cliff, i decided to go to bed.  my friend stayed up for a few more hours with the same things happening on the cliff face.  we thought about the lights being border patrol but how could they get a light on the side of a 1000 foot cliff.  and if they could, why did they not check our car out when it was illuminated by spot light and the glow.\r\n\r\nthe next morning, we hiked to the road, got a ranger to jump start my car.  charged my battery at panther junction gas station for an hour.  the battery would not take a charge at all, i mean it stayed on \"zero\".  this really puzzles me.  the lights were bright as they always were when we stopped the car.  i thought it could have been running directly off of the alternator to keep the lights bright but my experience and mechanics tell me that just an alternator could not keep the lights bright.  btw, our cell phone batteries were fine the next day which puts a damper on my magnetic field idea.\r\n\r\nso, could you explain any of this?

had stopped moving.  after just a few seconds the object headed north at an incredible speed and disappeared below the horizon. he said he tried to count down the seconds using the 001 method as it moved away from the jet but never made it to the second zero.\r\nour friend has always been a true blue skeptic about these things, but now as he states, ���i���m not so sure about this anymore���. \r\nthis is the second, close to identical, sighting of this object from our property in six months. i filed an incident report last september 30, 2005 that was an identical match to this one except that object was literally on top of us. it���s color, shape, point of origin (north), and direction and speed of departure (north) were the same.\r\ni have no idea what this object is, where it came from, or what it���s interest is in this area but my curiosity is now getting the best of me. i would like to find out how many other sightings have taken place that have not been reported.\r\nplease

legends, etc.\r\n\r\nduring this time period (i can't be certain of the dates, but i believe it was in feb. or mar. of 2004), i had been reading \"the dulce papers\" online, & seemed to find alot of answers to questions & just generally helped me piece together alot of events/encounters i've witnessed/experienced.\r\n\r\nlate one night (actually, it was around 3-4am), i was sharing a few of these details with my girlfriend on her computer (which was about 5 feet away from the bathroom). while i was speaking with her about some of the specific details i found some sense & reason with, there was a sudden silence, then, i paused (feeling something unsettleing), then, something fell into the sink (in the bathroom a few feet away).\r\n   i had a feeling (at that time) that i had been under closer observation than before (i don't want to sound paranoid, but i've actually got some collaborating witnesses, who don't realize what exactally they've been near...Sorry to be so vague...Don't want to write too much without knowing who's on the recieving end).\r\n  after hearing something \"fall\" into the sink, i said something (to anything that might be in there), waited (was actually pretty scared, my adrenaline was definately flowing), after about 30 - 45 seconds, we heard a whirling kind of sound (difficult to describe) that neither of us had ever heard before, but thjere was no doubt what that sound was (this apartment building was about 1/2 block long, the sound cam from the side where the bbq's are...There's nowhere close by that could've justified this sound...Too far from street).\r\ni then phoned the local police (which, by the way, was right across the street...Maybe 150-200 yards away).\r\ni requested a unit to do a quick drive through the alley & surrounding area of the building. when asked to state what i thought the sound came from, i replied that i'd rather not state an opinion, but that i knew what it was...The officer did not sound surprised or even curious for some reason (it struck me as rather odd, seen as how this city would not be the kind of place where anyone would expect for something like this to take place...You'd have to know glendale, i guess).\r\n\r\nthere is, of curse, some significance (i believe) with other times i've witnessed/experienced/noticed.\r\n\r\n**somewhat related...I'm attaching a digital sketch (or painting) i did freehand, from scratch in the program \"corel painter ix\" about 6 months ago. although, i never saw a being during the event described above, this is aomeone/aomething i had encountered for 5 or 6 consecutive nights in 2001 (approx. 20 sec. ea.), then once more early morning, a few months later.\r\n\r\ni have reason to believe that there are some important details i may have, to somehow help, inform (or something...).\r\n\r\n**side note - i am a two time emmy award winning animator, not some bored paranoid freak (i may be a freak, but that's just me...Lol).\r\n\r\nif someone can contact me, i'd apreciate it.\r\nthank you,\r\n-jm","distance":"20 Feet or

outside, smoking. i love to look at the sky to watch stars full of mistery and scientific puzzles, hopping to see ufo. and suddenly i saw that cluster of stars (8 - 10 stars) moving from nw to se. my first impression was that this is illusion created by moving light clouds below the stars. but then i noticed that the cluster changes its position in relation to the stars. it was one object 1 - 2 meters in diameter but not circle may be elips. it is difficult to describe beacause the object itself was like a ghost, invisible, only weak lights around its conture could tell you that this object is solid and huge and it was moving.\r\nit was not flying saurce, it was mothership, that is how impressive it was. i could watch the object, moving with the speed equal or may be more than the speed of jet plane,  only for 10-20 seconds because i have limitted view of the sky there are trees on my backyard. i came home and told my wife that i saw ufo.\r\n  one week later i was smoking again on my deck. it was around 8 p.M. i looked at the sky and i could not believe to my eyes: i saw the same ghost, on the same altitude, moving this time in opposite direction from se to nw with the same speed. at the moment i saw the object it produced a flush light with size 0.3 - 0.5 meters for half second, like falling meteorit in atmosphere, that made me blind for a moment (1 second). as in the first time i followed this object for 10 - 15 seconds and it went beynd my view.\r\nit is not the end of the story.\r\none week later + - couples day more less, i was smoking again on my deck. it was around 8 p.M. i lighted the cigarett and looked at the sky. and suddenly i saw the same object was moving with great speed from nw to se. if before the object covered this distance for 10 -20 seconds this time it took him 1 - 2 seconds. i was just lucky to be in the right place at the right time to witness this event. from theory of probability my story sounds unbelievable but this is true. about my

phenomenon.\r\n\r\nit then followed that we saw 3 v-shaped objects flying se, though they could have been triangular. they were silent, and their distance and dimensions couldn't be determined, though they must have been quite large when compared to commercial aircraft (perhaps 5 to 10 times the size) flying at a comparable altitude.\r\n\r\nthe craft almost had a translucent appearance, though the front edge seemed luminous (almost as if hazy, glowing lights or a \"string of stars\" had been strung across the front). each object remained visible for 5 to 10 seconds, and it appeared that they flew with their points facing downward. we lost sight of them, as the tree line blocked our ability to follow the craft to the horizon.\r\n\r\nwe saw the first one at about 7:30pm then walked to a less light-polluted area for better viewing. about five minutes later two more objects appeared and flew in the same direction.\r\n\r\nthough, we spotted three craft, chances are that there could have

if they were blending in with their surroundings. had we not been looking at the stars, and had it not been a clear night, chances are we would not have noticed the craft. in addition to their luminous glow, there was an ethereal nature to them, and they seemed to cruise entirely silently and steadily, with no apparent change in

was in brussels visiting my girlfriend and i was lying in bed staring out the window at the full moon in the early hours of the morning.  i started looking for stars, expecting none, as the moon was very bright and full.  however, i saw one light off in the distance past the trees outside the window.  the object seemed at first to be a plane or a satellite.  the object then seemed to go in and out of focus.  i was sure this was because i was tired and could not sleep.  then the object appeared to be a flashlight up in the sky being shaken back and forth very quickly.  then the object completely stabilized and became a perfect sphere.  then i was sure it was a planet (mars?) ands that my eyes were playing tricks on me.  however, this sequence of events (more or less, but not exactly) repeated itself, i got out of bed and got the camcorder.  thinking back on this, this is very strange as i have never done anything like that before, not with a camera or a camcorder.  this woke my girlfriend and she asked what i was doing.  when i told her, she put her glasses on and stared out at the object.  i asked her what she thought it was.  with neither of us having any idea what we were seeing, she suggested i open the window and try shooting directly into the early morning sky.  by this time the birds were chirping and it was twilight.  this made it easier to see the tree branches as points of reference and it seemed clear that this object in the sky was moving in a very unusual way that i had never seen before.   eventually, i got tired of shooting, put away the camera and got back into bed.  as daylight came, the object became harder and harder to see.  i have the camcorder minidv cassete tape, but would like to get it back.","distance":"Over One

noticed a lighted but hazy object with a blinking light on top.  it did not have the shape or movements of a fixed-wing or helicopter so that made me notice it.  (i was in the air force and have seen many planes.)  hard to tell the size and distance but apparently it was several hundred feet off the ground. it came from the east and seemed to lose some altitude before levelling off.  it then flew north.  i paralled it's course in my car but it was over an area west of the town, over farms i believe, and i couldn't get close.  i thought it could have been a blimp but they don't usually fly at night around here and they are based south of here.  i also don't see why it would fly over an unpopulated area of the county since blimps are mainly used for advertising.  boca raton might be the closest airship base.  i couldn't really see if it was blimp-shaped.  blimps usually have moving lights along the sides to advertise something.  the lights on this seemed to be steady except for the one on top.  all the lighting on it seemed to be white including the blinking light on top.  many other drivers were on the road and could have seen it.  it kept flying north till i lost sight of it.  if it was the size of a blimp then it could have been moving at about 50 or more mph.  i was somewhat excited when chasing it in my car, thinking that i may be witnessing something special but also aware that it's more than likely terrestial such as a blimp.  there were several hot air ballons flying around here this morning but i don't believe they would fly at night and are therefore not lighted.  after i lost sight of it i continued with my errands and then came home to write this.
