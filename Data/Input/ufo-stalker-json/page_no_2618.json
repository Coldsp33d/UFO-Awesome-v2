when a large bright white light caught my eye ahead in the sky about 1-2 football fields high(the craft stayed about that far away the whole sighting). at first i thought it was a tower light or something like that but when i got closer to this object it eventually got right above my car in the middle of the highway. i then saw the bottom of the object. it was triangular in shape with red and blue lights on the three corners blinking. i watched it until i had passed it.\r\n\r\nastonished and terrified, i decided to take the next turnaround and go back and see if what i saw was real or not. when i got back to the place of the first sighting, i  no longer saw the craft in the middle of the road but instead i saw the object near the lookout tower on the opposite side of the highway to the right of the tower. i then decided to take the next turnaround and find a spot to park on the side of the road to get a better look. but when i got near the tower again on the highway there was a 2nd craft that was smaller and had red and orange lights as opposed to the red and blue lights of the larger craft. i should also note that every time i saw these things during the hour of my sighting the crafts top bright light kept turning on and off randomly.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw this second craft i got scared because it proceeded to come straight towards me. this smaller red and orange craft eventually went right over me like the larger one did before. this craft looked like the first one did, triangular in shape only with red and orange lights on the bottom at the three corners. it also had a top bright light as well. it passed me and went to the right of me on the highway and then immediately changed directions and joined the larger craft on the left side of me on the highway quite fast. at this point i was not about to pull over and stop as these things were just too close for comfort. i was shaking, i honestly don���t know hwy i was so scared.\r\n\r\ninstead i just kept taking turnarounds and went in circles about 3 times until they disappeared. i saw them going back and forth across highway 281 every time i turned around. it is almost as if they were following me, playing some kind of game. it���s kind of  egocentric of me to think that these things were there only for me but at the time is how i felt which is probably why i did not want to stop on the side of the road for a constant look at these things.\r\n\r\nwhen they were no longer to be seen i headed back to my original destination point, home. about 5-10 minutes later i was near the university of incarnate word still on highway 281 when i saw the small red and orange craft yet again on my left side no less than a football field high. i could not believe that it was near me again. it proceeded to cross my path giving me another view of its bottom and headed to my right until i passed it up. \r\n\r\nso i took the next turnaround yet again and when i got back it was gone. i then went ahead and drove a few more minutes before taking the next turnaround to finally go home. but when i got back the larger blue and red craft had returned and was approaching my left side until it got right overhead of me again. this time however i saw a bright beam of light that looked like those airplane beams you see near an airport or major highway shoot out of the bottom of the craft and proceeded to point it evrywhere. when i say everywhere i mean it pointed it at cars, buildings and houses nearby. the odd thing was it never once pointed it at me. at least i think, though now that i think about it when i saw the craft overhead the light was so bright i had to shield my eyes for a second so it might have shined it on me at once. it very much looked to me like it was searching for something. after it got done with the beam it went on its way to the right of me and i lost site of it when i got too far from it. i should note that when this happened i got the best close up side view of the larger craft. it looked like a disk from the side. i was scared enough that i went home.\r\n\r\nbefore i got home however i saw the small red and orange craft again, flying over 281 and towards my neighborhood near brook hollow blvd until i lost sight of it beyond the trees on the horizon.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home it was around 1:40 a.M.\r\n\r\ni hope to hear something of this strange occurence in the near future as i am confused to what those things were. someone else had to of seen these things. they were just way too obvious and apparent. i ruled out airplanes and helicopters because of the shape and movement of these things plus the fact that there was absolutely no sound of engines. definately the most bizare and scary moment of my life. i did not take any photos nor did i film it as i did not have such devices handy at the time. this is my story as best as i can describe it. \r\n\r\nthank you for listening to my sighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i usually look up to see the stars as where we live they can be very bright and pretty as if you could just pluck them out of the sky.\r\n\r\nanyhow, i noticed one unusaully bright \"star\" and realized it was glowing in colors. not white like a regular star, but white was one of the alternating colors. we do get plane traffic as we are on the flight path of planes coming from new york to bradley int'l airport in ct. i worked at bdl airport as a police officer for 22 1/2 years so i know what planes look like and whate color lights they normally have. this was not a plane.\r\n\r\ni then got my binoculars to see if i could see it any closer. the binoculars actually did help me to see the ufo more clearly. it was at that time using the bincoulars that i noticed a secondary smaller ufo that was also stationary and had rotating red lights. the smaller ufo was disc shaped and the larger ufo was diamond shaped. suddenly the smaller red ufo took off fast and was blocked by the tree line. (i was looking out in a south-west direction from my house). i watched the larger ufo which did not move, stayed stationary for over an hour and rotated lights from white to yellow to green to red to blue and sometimes two colors at the same time. the overall outline was white diamond shaped. \r\n\r\nmy husband works the evening shift and was due home and i was hoping he would get home in time to verify what i was seeing so i wouldn't think i was imagining it. he came home at 11:00 p.M. and i  immediately showed him it and then he got the binoculars and confirmed everything from the diamond shape to the colors. he said it could be a comet, but i don't think comets stay in one spot for one hour? or rotate in colors? it stayed there and we were tired of looking at it as looking through binculars for a long time gets tiring. it was too far way that i knew my camera would not be able to take a good picture or clear enough picture so i didn't bother. now i wish i tried at least! we watched tv for awhile and i went back out to see if it was still there, but it was gone. this was about 11:20 p.M. i looked for it the next few nights just in case i mistook it for a star or whatever, but it has not been back since.

window which faces highway l4 and a large wooded park across the highway (called bird park),  a large white circular orb which caught my eye as it was up high descending in a downward direction angled to the left. it landed somewhere deep into this park.   it caught eye because we occasionally see helicopters fly overhead going to the u.M. hospital and airplanes.  i have even seen an occasional shooting star, but this was not any  of those three things mentioned.  this was much larger and very bright white and was slowly descending  into the wooded area  called bird park which is behind my house across highway l4, close to newport road. the size of this white circle, or orb, was very similar to one i remember seeing directly above my neighbor's yard about 7 years ago. on this occassion, it was during the summer, and i shot straight up in bed with my eyes wide open and remember the bedroom being flooded with extremely bright white light. our shades were up.   i went to the bedroom window and looked outand saw a large white circular, brightly glowing orb hoovering in a stationary mode above my neighbor's home in the front yard area,  high in the sky, with a thin bluish white beam coming down from it at an angle touching my neighbor's yard.  within seconds of standing there viewing it, the beam withdrew into the white orb and the orb ascended straight upwards and disappeared.  my husband was not awakened by any of this, but i was.  i want to the bathroom afterwards and looked back out the window as a reality check to understand that i actually did see what i described to you. i was not frightened by this, but did call a friend the next day and tell her about what i had witnessed.

again at her house, i said dad lets look for ufo's again. so we did. we drove down the same road we dropped her off at. then, my dad said what are those 12 lights lined up in a row?(they were

reflectors or not, but 1st my dad said it was a tractor. but then we stopped right in front of it and pulled off the road a bit. we turned our lights off and the lights did too. i still wondered if they were reflectors or not, but when we looked closer the lights looked as if they were floating because nothing was holding them up (i think im not quite sure because it was too dark to see much of anything.It looked like a telephone line were holding these things together, but the \"telephone line\" didnt run vertically,as usual, it ran horizontally across the road but the same height as a telephone wire.) then when we passed it i looked over and a huge dimmed circle lit up a little but it was very dim. now that i think of it it couldve been a huge light very huge about the size of a

in a clear night sky an extremely bright meteor shape ball of light (with small attached tail) coming down at slight angle (22-25 degrees)toward the north-northwest (direction we were also traveling) several hundred feet above us  and brighter than any other object in the sky. my wife, the driver, noticed me looking out the window and looked out the windshield a second or two before the object \"burned out\" (her decription) as a way of disappearing. both of us at first thought of a meteor just before impact because it was so close and bright right above us and no smoke or trail remained after the disappearance. there was no other traffic in the area during the sighting and the object seemed to come down in a matter of 5-6 seconds for the mile or so it seemed to travel between 10 and 11 mile roads in roseville (designated road names in our adjoining cities spaced one mile apart). no words were spoken between the two of us during the event perhaps due to the awe induced by seeing such a bright (whitish/blue) object flying alongside us and only a few hundred feet above. as the object disappeared so suddenly, we assumed a meteor being burned up in a final flashing gasp overhead, rather than a craft zipping away in another direction. no report of debris was reported later in the area and no mention of a similar sighting was read or heard by my wife or myself. no report was made to local authorities until a few days later after contact with a member of michigan based mufon. no picture documentation could be obtained, although usually a disposable camera is available in our car's glove compartment. not that night, however, but a new one is now waiting in the car for the next potential encounter. everyone who drives should have one at the ready for such possible occasions.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

there, and 15 min. back.) we passed the gravel road and turned on 14. my dad said \"what is that in the sky?.\" the object look like a bright star that eventually faded. i saw a blue light run through the sky, but the blue light(not the light in the sky) turned out to be the light from mcdonalds. we turned right, and dropped her off at her house. this time we continued going down the road. then we turned down the gravel road in which we passed before. as we were driving i told my dad to listen to a song on my ipod. after the song i wanted him to hear another. i had dropped my ipod on the floor earlier that day. i have dropped it on the floor a number of times, but it's never done this. my ipod began to freeze up and nothing worked on it. then the light in the back seat didn't work (it hasn't worked since), but that could be from a bulb that burned out. my dad told me during that, that he saw 3 brights ligts (reddish yellow) shining out in the field right next to us (right where we saw the first light, but that one was in the sky, this was on the ground.Then they dimmed, because i never saw them.) i told him my ipod wasn't working, and i also said i never see any ufo's. well right after that i began looking out the windows to see if i saw anything. i looked in the back window and saw 2 lights that flickered, and then 3 (also reddish yellow.) there aren't any houses out that way either, just a few but their lights would've disappeared in the distance. i thought maybe it was a car, and i didn't say anything for a long time. but the lights started getting brighter and brighter, and faster. i said \"dad look at those lights in your mirror.\" we were far past from when we first saw the lights, and i still saw them very clear and still very bright. we stopped at a stop sign, and then my dad floored it. these lights didn't make a sound, were too spaced out to be car lights, and also car light travels these did not. we finally turned off the road and got on the highway. i looked back and could still see them. then i looked again and a small patch of grass lit up. my dad also said he was getting a really sick feeling in his stomach every time i told him about the lights. after i didn't see them anymore (which was right after the patch of grass lit up), my ipod began to work again. we arrived home that night at 10:12 p.M. approx. but i said before it takes 15 min. to get there, and 15 min. back. we should've arrived home at 10:32 p.M. appox. why did we arrive so early? did the ufo's stop time? i don't know what i saw that night, but i've never seen anything like it, and it was strange. \r\n\r\nthank you for letting me tell you about this experience.","distance":"21-100
