missouri, we stayed for a week, and on the third or fourth day we took canoes across sims lake to a beach where we spent the night. we had no tents, and layed on the beach to sleep. there were no lights, and it seemed like every star in the sky could be seen. i saw a very faint light moving across the sky, about the same brightness as a star. i pointed the light out to other kids until they saw it, then it stopped for several minutes, then it broke into two lights and moved away from each other like a y from the original line. by this time, most of the kids saw this, and we watched them until they could not be seen anymore. that's it. we also had daily f-15 flights at super-sonic speeds at very low altitudes above the lake, so low the sonic boom would leave ripples in the water. we would canoe out to the middle of the lake, and wait for them to fly by. ask anyone who went to s-f boy scout camp in the mid 1970's.","distance":"Over One

corner).  there was a person in front of us and it was a quiet evening.  we'd popped out for a bar of chocolate each.  we crossed the road and the person in front of us walked around the corner and out of sight to us.  someone else on the other side disappeared down liverpool road and the road went very quiet which was unusual for the busy main road into deal town.  it was six in the evening.  i turned round to look behind us because it was so quiet and it was a long road into the distance behind us which stretched up an incline in the distance but there were no cars and we found ourselves alone.  then i noticed three lights in an equilateral triangle as i viewed it (not tilted from my perspective) move steadily and silently from above the roof tops over our flat and i said to my son 'hey look!' at first he didn't but i said 'look quick!  what's that?' and we both saw it as it slid slowly and steadily and silently (it was silent because there were no cars or people anywhere anymore) quite low down in the sky.  it would have needed a grapefruit held at arms length to have covered the lights in a triangle.  yellow on top, green to the left, and red at the bottom.  i said 'wouldn't it be funny if it was a ufo?' and giggled but frowned too as it struck me as very peculiar but as i was with my son i didn't take it seriously. as it passed us the bottom light reflected off the slate tiled roof of the first house on the strand.  so i knew it was tangible.  as soon as it disappeared someone walked from the strand onto dover road towards us adn as i looked behind us the line of traffic the headlights in a row all began descending the incline of the road in the distance.  i said to jack 'shall we run and see it along the houses?' but we both decided not to as it would have disappeared by the time we'd run along the road and got onto the beach.  i asked my son to describe and draw what he'd seen separately to me and we compared later.  we both saw the same thing and our drawings were the same. we moved house since and don't know where they are but it stuck in our memories and we still talk about it now.","distance":"21-100

as if it happened yesterday. i was at my home walking up the back stairs and usually just glance outside the windows as i walk up the stairs. i remember there was snow on the ground and then there was this flash of light. a few seconds after this flash i saw a light red, pinkish color illuminate the sky. i remember thinking to myself that it was similar to the terminator 2 movie where there was a nuclear explosion. i got really scared and thought it was the end of the world. after staring at the sky for 15 seconds or so the lights disappered. i explained what i had seen to my parents and to some friends and i got the explanation that it was a transformer that had exploded or someone had shot off a roman candle. i never really accepted the fact that it was either of those things as the light lit up the whole sky - something that neither of those 2 things could have done. recently i did some research and found out there had been a suspected ufo crash on long island on that date i nearly had a heart attack. i went onto google maps and found my home and then drew a line from the spot where i had seen the light emerge. the line extended almost exactly to brookhaven labs - the spot where the crash was reported. i did not see any type of craft or anything just the strange lights and what seemed like an explosion. i will agree with some of the reports that something did crash

yesterday.\r\n   i had known about ufos and wanted to believe but i was not sure if they existed.\r\n   so anyway on july 18, 2003 it just turned to the 18th from the 17th and it was 12:45 am.  i was at my parent's house and they live in coshocton, oh.  i went out the door to smoke a cigarette and a strange feeling told me to turn around and look up.  i looked up and was just frozen for a second.  a orange boomerang object with a center \"stalk\" that seemed seperate from the \"wings\" by the smallest amount possible.  it seemed high up but i could see details.  it moved in an arc about like from the tip of my thumb to the tip of my index finger at an arm's length.  it was almost as large as the average size moon. so it moved fast, i don't remember exactly how fast but pretty fast.  and its movement was smooth but jerky.  what i mean is it almost looked like it was stuttering but it was moving fluidly (if that makes sense). so this lasted all of 5-10 seconds.          \r\n     then suddenly right behind it, following it almost, an orange \"star\" that moved so fast it left a tracer.  it did not go in a straight line but the motion was a lot more streamlined than the \"boomerang\".  as soon as it appeared then streaked across then disappeared, or during that cycle, another appeared and did likewise. this just continued in very fast repitition over and over.  this all happened so fast it made me a little dizzy and i couldn't tell how many were visible at once.  it is hard to even estimate the total.  they would change direction at very high speed.  not sharp turns but curved turns that were so smooth and graceful that it was very awesome.  they also displayed extreme acceleration and deceleration\r\n     their paths were a similar distance to the \"boomerang\" (thumbpoint to fingertip at arms length).\r\nthey all started and ended in different places in the sky, but this all occured over the same patch of sky.  so they were going everywhich way over the same area.\r\n   this continued for about five minutes and i finally snapped out of my shock. i realized everyone was sleeping by this point, but my sister in college would be up. i ran in and grabbed the phone and was back in 5 seconds.  i called her and told her and she believed me, but what could she do or say?  so i hung up and kept watching.  this whole time i had a feeling i would miss something.\r\n     i had tried to go around the side of the house to get a different perspective but i lost sight of them and ran back to the original spot and just continued watching from there. so after what seemed like ten minutes, i realized i could run in and get either mom or dad up and back out and not miss much. so i ran in yelled \"blah blah come immediately\" and ran back out and my dad was \"quickly\" behind me. a white light similar to the orange ones, which had stopped in the time i was inside, streaked from east to west across the sky.  my dad was half asleep still and very cranky. i said \"see that!\" he said \"no.\" \r\n     it happened again i said \"see it that time\" and he did but i don't think it registered and tried to say it was a bird so i gave up on him.  now my mom had gotten out there but it was over.  i talked to them for a second and at some point in the area where the orange lights were (north) a thick white column of \"smoke\" appeared to have risen from the horizon up into the sky.  like the space shuttle blasted off from cape canaveral.  it was all very strange.  my parents went back to sleep and my dad doesn't totally remember. to this day he probably only remembers because i ask him.  he admits to seeing something, who knows what he remembers.\r\n     the main thing is one year later almost to the hour(very late july 17th 2004) my grandpa of 80-some years died.  he was a very good catholic and gave a lot of money to good causes and was a member of a lot of organizations and such and is one of the best catholics i have ever known.  married to his wife for 50-some years.  the preacher came over to the house on his funeral.  i really beleive it had something to do with that.  \r\n     when i was seeing this i was thinking

high in the sky in a very short amount of time (less than ten seconds) before fading out. the other three lights moved across the sky staying probably a few thousand feet off the ground. they moved from south to north and then appeared to move towards the west as they grew dimmer. they then each rose very quickly into the sky and faded out much like the first one. after looking at a map, i would estimate that i was about six miles to the southeast from the boundries of fort carson and i would put the lights at about ten to fifeteen miles away. they were very bright, but not extremely large. i would compare their size to that of a light on cell phone towers at a distance of about five

some still photos several days earlier.  there are almost always two lights that move on perfectly parallel courses.  after a couple minutes one drops what looks like a flare of the same color that falls straight down.  another one usually follows after that but i cannot remember seeing more than two nor have i ever seen them come from both objects.  one time (see the photo, dated febuary 6th) the flare itself seemed to actually split in two.  there was a brief flash when it did, but nothing very bright.\r\n\r\nas for the february 10th encounter, i first noticed the objects to my southeast moving west at lower altitude than i usually saw.  this was very different and they also seemed to be moving much faster than usual.  i'm assuming this means they were much closer than before.  all of the times i saw them before they were moving southeast to north and 30-45 degrees up from my point of view.  this was maybe 10 degrees at the most.  they were so much lower than before that they were obscured by some trees i have to my south.  however, the objects changed course while out of view and started heading up at what looked to me like a perfect 45 degree angle.  \r\n\r\nwhen the first flare dropped the lead object seemed to stop moving and slowly fade out.  it would start to dim and then pulse back a little brighter but at a lower intensity than before.  the second object changed course between the time of the first and second flares and seemed to level off its altitude.  the strange thing is the remaining object seemed to just disappear as i looked away to move my camera.  as silly as it sounds the remaining object in almost all the cases i've seen them seemed to just vanish if i looked away for a split second after it was done dropping flares or whatever they are.  there doesn't seem to be any missing time involved.  my backyard is fairly large and i've had the porch light on every time.  it seems like if there was concern about people seeing whatever they are the man standing in the middle of a lit yard would be more of an issue than that same man seeing the last object fade away.\r\n\r\ni attached the photo, dated february 6th, to help explain things.  it was taken with a nikon d70 on a 30 second exposure time.  oddly enough, the \"flares\" don't seem to be dropping straight down in that case.  the video itself, unfortunately, isn't all i had hoped it would be.  it doesn't show the colors and in my haste i forgot to turn off the autofocus so it has problems there.  it was on a tripod and was not moved during the clip.\r\n\r\ni've been thinking about it for quite awhile now and i really can't come up with any sort of explanation for what these are.  i've searched the archives at nuforc.Org for sightings that matched mine and came up with a lot of results, especially in california.  there was even one that mentioned the lights being on top of craft that were cross shaped but i have no way of verifying that since i can only see the lights.  there was even one in the uk fairly recently.  why they don't seem to be getting any sort of attention i don't know, but with so many similar sightings there has to be some connection.  \r\n\r\nthe earliest sighting i've had was 8:30 p.M. and the latest is about 2 a.M.  during the sightings i've never had any sense of fear but was pretty much just in awe.  after they go away i start to doubt i saw them in the first place but i'm guessing that's a pretty typical reaction to this sort of thing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

us drove to the nearest city, greenville, to do some christmas shopping and to see a movie.\r\n\r\ngreenwood is a small city in a rural part of upstate south carolina, and the part of highway 25 we were on is fairly isolated. there are a few homes here and there, but not a lot of development. consequently, the road is quiet and on a clear night like the one in question, the stars are clearly visible. \r\n\r\naround 10:30 or 11 p.M., i pointed out to my dad that the star on the horizon was particularly clear and beautiful, and he looked and said that while it was very pretty, he thought it was a planet because it looked too bright and large to be a star. my mom said that whatever it was, it looked awfully weird. the closer we got, the stranger it looked. i suggested that it might be a cell phone tower, and my dad disagreed, because the light on a cell phone tower would be red, and this light was white, like a star. that's when i realized that the object had changed positions in the sky. it had moved from the right side of the sky -- the passenger side, based on my position in the car -- to the left side of the sky, and it was definitely getting larger and closer.\r\n\r\nit's difficult for me to estimate how many miles we drove until it was directly overhead, but curiosity got the better of us in the little town of ware shoals, which is about 20 miles from greenwood. my dad pulled into the median in front of the burger king and he and i got out of the car and looked up.\r\n\r\na large triangular craft slowly floated over us. size in feet is hard for me to estimate and it's been a little while since this happened. i don't want my memory to inflate the measurement, but it was definitely larger than your average low-flying plane. if the sun had been out, it would have cast a shadow that would have covered me, my dad and his suv. it was like something out of an \"unsolved mysteries\" reenactment. \r\n\r\nthe craft was black and the corners of the triangle were rounded. there were lights at each corner which i believe were bluish-white and a red light on each of the three sides between the bluish-white lights. it didn't make any sound at all and it floated at an even pace right over the tops of the pine trees. it seemed to be so close to the tops of the trees that i thought it might brush them as it passed over.\r\n\r\ni know very little about military aircraft, but i looked up photos of stealth fighters later to see if i could find what we saw. it wasn't a b-2, i'm sure of it, because b-2s have a w-shape in the back and what we saw was a solid triangle. it wasn't a nighthawk either. both of those planes are too angular. i'm absolutely certain the corners of the triangle were rounded. \r\n\r\nmy dad and i just stood there looking at it. i wasn't afraid, but i was intrigued. it was fascinating. time seemed to move really slowly, not for any metaphysical reason but because i couldn't believe what was i seeing. i wanted to pull it back and look at it some more. when it passed over -- it didn't shoot off at warp 9 or anything, it just floated over the trees and out of sight -- my dad and i got back in the car. less than a minute elapsed between the time we stopped the car and the time we got back in. i asked him what we had just seen and he said he didn't know, which surprised me because he's always been interested in military technology. we didn't talk much until we got home. we haven't discussed it since.","distance":"101-500

lights on one side of object - lights changed from bright white to red and every color in between (full spectrum of lights came from this object!)\r\n-moved from being over huntington beach (my guess) to being over long beach (also my guess) in approx. 1 hour and 20 minutes.\r\n-at arms length, the object could have been hidden from view if i would have held up a dime.\r\n\r\nhow the sighting happened:\r\ni went out on my back patio at 12:02 am pst to have a smoke and noticed a very bright light in the night sky. originally i kind-of assumed it was a star but after watching this object for a couple of minutes i realized that stars do not change color from an extremely bright white/halogen blue to a brilliant red and seemingly every color in between... this thing was amazing and so bright!! i ran inside and grabbed a monocular that i have and ran back outside to 'get a closer view'... what i saw when i looked through the monocular was a little blurry at first (the monocular doesn't have the best range) but after stabalizing my arm and focusing on the object, the lights seemed to be shaped like a triangle (many small lights making up a triangle shape) and the object was kind-of pulsing. i was in dis belief!! this couldn't really be happening!! i always watch the sky and until this night... i have never seen anything that i couldn't associate with some type of known object (star, plane or helicopter). after i was able to see some shape to the lights, i attempted to contact a friend who lives about 2 miles from me (i felt it was very important to have another witness - especially from a different angle then my view)... but he did not answer...\r\n\r\ni watched this object for 1 hour and 21 minutes until it eventually moved behind a building and was no longer visible to me. during the last 8 minutes of the sighting, the object literally completely disappeared from visibility for about 2 seconds at a time on four occasions!! i would describe it as either rotating and therefore the lit side of the triangle was not visible or the lights on this object simply dimmed out completely... but the object was never completely dark for more then about two seconds. i verbally said \"oh my god\" when the object first disappeared from sight completely and then re-appeared two seconds later... it was absolutely unbelievable!\r\n\r\ni took 5 images with my nikon coolpix 3.2 mega pixel digital camera but only one of the photos came out somewhat decent (attached to this report).\r\n\r\ni really want to know if any other people saw this object and what thier description is... my monocular isn't the best so hopefully the triangle shape i saw was not a trick of lighting or caused by the distance.\r\n\r\nthank you for being here to take this report!! i feel absolutely blessed to have been a witness to this amazing object!!\r\n\r\ndavid arnold\r\ncosta mesa, ca","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
