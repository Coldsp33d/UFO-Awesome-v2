pm, most kids called inside by their parents.  i and another boy a year or 2 younger than myself remained outside.  we laid down on our backs to look up at the night sky, watching all the stars.  it was a very clear evening with no clouds obstructing our view.\r\n\r\nthere seemed to be one spot in the sky where the stars were not visible, making a black hole where there should have been stars.  suddenly a light came on directly above us, casting no light down on us, but defining a shape i can only describe as half-watermelon.  i was dumbfounded as to what i was looking at.  it seemed as if i was seeing only half of the object, then the light went out, having lasted only approximately 5 seconds.\r\n\r\ni laid there briefly trying to compute what i had just seen.  then i asked the younger boy laying next to me, \"did you see that?\"  he answered, \"yes.\"\r\n\r\nwe both laid there for a few more seconds, apparently neither one of us knowing what else to say.  i suddenly had a feeling of something akin to dread, and a strong desire to get inside with my family, for security.\r\n\r\ni didn't say anything to my parents, as i had learned from experience that my step-father dismissed any notions of such paranormal activities.\r\n\r\nsometime later i was plagued by \"grey wolf\" dreams.  vague, and not able to place when, where, and how until much later in life.\r\n\r\nalso in the time frame i had a nightmare in which i woke up the entire family screaming, cowering in a corner of my bedroom.  i only know this because my family brought it to my attention, although i had

trees on the easterly side of our property. the house next to do sits lower than our house and their lights were all on. the object i observed was framed by two of their trees and about two inches above the neighbors roof as i extended my arm and measured with my fingers from the roof to the object. i watched the object for several minutes then decided to go into the house to get my sony cybershot dsc rx100 camera which takes good night photos compared to my iphone camera. when i went back outside maybe two minutes later i was happy to see the object in the same place, framed by the two trees. it didn't seem to have moved at all. i took many photos hoping that some would come out. i just downloaded my photos and to my surprise two came out especially clearly.\r\n\r\non january 30, 2017 i had a sighting in the same easterly direction. i submitted a photo to maryland mufon with photos. i have looked in the same direction for other sightings in the last two months and saw

observe these orbs.  decided to put out game cams.  we were astonished that the cam caught the orb via motion and once we zoomed in on the picture and adjusted the picture with basic contrast adjustments we were amazed.  around 6 people have observed this orb phenomena over the last six months.  the object typically hovers for approximately 15-20 minutes and disappears. this sighting happens on our sheep farm usually around midnight to 6 am.\r\nthe first time this was observed was around sept 2016.  several farm hands noticed two orbs floating in the pasture.  the evening was very quiet.  two orbs floated back and forth appx 100 yards away from the observers.  my brother yelled \"hey!, who's out there and whats your business here?\",  the orbs stopped moving and sticks could be heard breaking as they exited on the backside of our main pasture;  mind you, all our sheep are locked up in a barn at night.  my farm hands stood there watching the object(s) daring each other to go down there.  there's no way it was an sheep or deer moving about.  the two orbs exited the property to the east and disappeared.\r\n\r\nthere have been various other \"pop-up\" occurances between then and present day.  we typically watch it from the top of the pasture and typically it goes away.\r\n\r\none morning in jan 2017 the orb had 'woke up' all our farm animals;  we went outside the house and walked towards the barn;  all the animals were nervous and 'vocal';  making noise like a predator was near or someone they didn't know;  we walked to the barn and watched the 'single' orb this time just hovering around 4-6' off the ground;  appx 80 yards facing south from our perspective.\r\n\r\nduring the last observance this march (2017);  we had the game cam setup and captured those images;  i tried driving my truck to the opposite side from my brothers viewpoint.  after watching and talking to my brother via facetime video;  the object took off and hovered over the home location and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni was reluctant to post this b/c i don't want any attention brought to my farm or family;  im a local public official and wish to remain anonymouse but would be interested in talking to a field investigator.","distance":"101-500
