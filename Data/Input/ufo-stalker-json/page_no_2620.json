north kingstown just past oak hill road but south of the exeter exit, when i saw what looked like two very bright lights on the west side of the road (about 100 or so yards off the to the north and west.  as i approached, i realized the lights were standing still.  i slowed way down in my right lane to get a better look because as i passed the bright white lights, there were about ten neon blue strips of lights in triangular and pentagon shapes just hanging there in mid air above the trees but back into the woods.  i started to pull off the road to get a better look but i was a) shocked at what i saw and had a little bit of fear b) concerned that the cars behind me would be staring at the same thing and would rear-end my car instead of watching the road and c)i didn't want to be late to pick up my daughter from the movies in warwick.  as a result i only got a 15-20 second close look at this \"thing\".  i found it odd that only about 2-300 yards away there was the usual police officer parked on the south side of the road looking for speeders and he obviously didn't see anything (but he was facing north looking for the cars.  i went back with my daughter hoping it was still there and that there was a logical explaination but there was nothing there when my daughter and i returned about 9:55pm.  anyway, i was wondering if any of the other drivers reported anything to explain this very unusual phenomena.\r\n\r\np.S.- i'm a physician with a scientific background.  this souds as odd to me as it probably does to you.\r\nyou may contact me on my cell at 401-623-6164 if you

looked up, the object would have been at approximately 2 o'clock and highly visible against a deep dark night sky.  the moment that i looked at it, it sped with ungodly speed horizontally across the sky to this large, thick, white cloud that was approximately located at 12 o'clock.  the object was cigar shaped and it was pure white.  it was the brightest thing i've ever seen, yet, it didn't hurt my eyes for the split second that i saw it.  it's speed was unbelieveable.  there was no noise from the sky whatsoever.  i knew it was something that shouldn't have done what it did by that superfast

there was something or someone else out there and wished i had been one of those people that got a glimpse of something in the sky.  yet, when i found myself wanting to share the experience, i found

something. i thought that was weird, but after a few minutes, i went out. i was leaning against our barn, looking across a field. there's a spooky woods over there. i was looking across a corn field. this is a rural setting; no immediate neighbors. i was wondering why i was standing there, looking, but kept at it. suddenly, a purple object appeared about 1/2 mile away. it was beautifully purple, amethyst, lovely in color. the first object looked like a left eye shape, pointed on the inside. it seemed to pulse with energy, some huge energy, something out of this world in power. i knew it was 'looking' at me, showing itself off, showing me it was there. as i watched it, it stayed where it was, pulsing. then the other side of the eyes appeared, the right side appeared just like the first one did. now i could see two purple eye shaped things, as big as ships, 'looking' at me. it stayed that way, pulsing with superhuman strength, for about two minutes. then the side that appeared second slowly diseappeared as it had appeared, followed by the first shape. they had trouble controlling the huge amount of power they had inside, or so it seemed. i could tell they had the energy to travel through universes. i saw into another dimension for some strange reason. this appearance has been haunting me ever since. this house is out in the middle of nowhere and very old, seeming to be haunted. i used to be very sure there wasn't anything to fear here, but now i'm not so sure. i want to see this again and can feel something out of this world in the atmosphere. i can't wait for the weather to warm up so i can look at that spot every night. hopefully, i'll see it again. thanks for reading this. joan williamson","distance":"501 Feet - 1

years ago.  it was a late summer night, approximately 10pm-11pm.  i had just got off the bus with my friend as we returned from the summer fair.  the walk was a few blocks from the stop to the house.  \r\n\r\nat one point we were crossing the street in a northern direction.  just before we reached the other side i happened to glance up and immediately saw a star much brighter than the others moving at a moderate speed.  it sort of looked like a dot on an old arcade machine in how it dragged a tail.  but it didnt have a tail.  it was like the light didnt dissipate immediately around the star.  i'm not sure how to describe that aspect of it.\r\n\r\ni was looking at the sky at an angle that put the houses in front of us just out of view.  the star appeared to be moving northwest.  then, as if it knew it was seen, it switched to a northeastern direction at a sharp angle and a faster speed.  then it streaked across the sky and disappeared. (well a small piece of the sky)\r\n\r\nwhen it zipped off, it wasn't like star trek where the space ship gets warp speed and flashes away.  it was like it increased speed continually and simply dissapeared.  this all happened in under 10 seconds.  the time it took to swith direction and zip off must have been under a second.\r\n\r\nnow i wouldnt have reported this if my friend hadnt seen it as well.  i remember that after seeing it and almost tripping on the curb we were both silent for a few moments.  i got excited but i wasn't sure if i should mention it because he might not have seen it, so i said,  \"did you see that?\"  he said he did and that he was wondering if i saw it too.  we had a good laugh about how we saw a spaceship.\r\n\r\nat the time that i saw it i thought it was a satellite, but oddly bright.  it was odd because the light wasnt flashing or pulsating like a star.  it was solid.  i see satellites all the time in the sky when its clear enough here.  i quickly changed my mind when it took off like it did.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":4444,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.0506962,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02182006-0001","longitude":-123.0199789,"occurred":1056956400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Sphere,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1056956400000,"summary":"Bright light moves slowly, changes direction, then zips off fast","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Springfield, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:533339"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Ogden","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Every day i walk around my horse pasture (5 acres) with my dog. there is always lots of air traffic almost every day. i carry my camera with me and take pictures when things look interesting to me in the sky. a week does not pass that i don't catch something anomalous in one or several of the photos. i am sending the untouched original and an enhanced photo. the camera was pointed in a nne direction. the atlantic ocean is about one mile from where i took the photo. there were an unusual amount of chemtrails being laid when i took the photo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4443,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.2723916,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02172006-0007","longitude":-77.818594,"occurred":1140196200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1140196200000,"summary":"I was taking pictures of lots of contrails and chemtrails and caught this object in one of the photos","tags":["photo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4443_submitter_file1__2.17.06..9fifteenam.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4443_submitter_file2__2.17.06..9fifteenamEnl..JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Ogden, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:533340"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2620}
