centre in sonnenberg called internationales haus sonnenberg, which is situated in the harz mountains in germany and surrounded on all sides by natioal park deep forest for miles. the nearest town is sankt andreasberg (st. andreasberg), the other side of the moutain, a fair distance away.  \r\nwe were all playing pool, when i wanted to come back to our rooms located in a place called the wohnhaus, which is where all the workers stayed. i went back there with my sister, and she heard a noise like a bat which got our attention and we looked around, and saw something moving behind the house. \r\n\r\n before we knew it, this huge triangular object hovered over our heads and just stayed there.  we were transfixed by it for im not sure how long, my younger sister was scared, as we had no idea what it was.  then it darted at incredible speeds behind the tree line of the mountain.\r\n\r\nwe ran back to tell the others who thought we were seeing things and laughed at us, so they came out to see it disbeliving us, but there was nothing there, so they laughed at us even more, then we suddenly noticed it was above our heads.\r\nwe hadnt even heard it, or seen it , but it was there, a huge huge spinning triangle mayby at a rough guide the size of a football pitch or bigger.  it had lights all on its outside, circular lights. it seemed so close we could reach up and touch it, but we all just stood there, part scared, we went to move into the wohn house a little scared.  but as if it knew where we wanted to go, it moved and hovered over our apartments.\r\n  it was transfixing, it moved like something ive never seen or heard of in my life.  nor had anyone else.  it could change diections lie no other aircraft i know.  \r\n\r\nit would dart in random directions across the skyline vanishing behind the trees, then just as quickly coming back and hovering exeactly over our heads. \r\n\r\ni couldnt see its colour, or details as it was very dark, there was no light pollution as we were in the mountains, all we could see was the lights that outlned the object.\r\n\r\nafter i dont know how long, the object back tracked incredibly quickly behind the trees and we didnt see it again.\r\n\r\nwe bashed around theories for what it could be, someone said it could be someone playing a trick on us in the forest, or a light display from the town the other side of the mountain.\r\n\r\nbut these are both impossiple, the reasons, firstly someone has to sit somewhere high up on the mountain, deep in the forest but high enough to somehow see through the trees to the conference centre. the conference sentre itself was in a clearing in the forest,  and the treeline the object vanished behind was a good distance away.  \r\n  in the darkness, not only would someone have to be sitting in a forset where wild boar and puma are prominent wildlife.\r\n somehow in the darkess they would have to know where we were in the dark.\r\nalso lights do not make noise.  this object a few times made like the ultrasound noise you can sometimes hear a bat make. \r\n\r\nas for a light show from sankt andreasberg, this too is impossible, there is no way the light would reach us, yet alone hover over our heads and know where we were, and there was no shows going on in the town of anykind.\r\n\r\nwe know this was a flying object but what we dont know, we were in such a remote area who knows what it was.\r\n all we know is that it was nothing we had ever seen before.  i went out on my own a few times in the hope it would come back, but i never saw it again.\r\n\r\ni wish i had seen it again i was fascinated, where i live i often see uneplained things, i always have since i was little.\r\n from ghosts to just things i cant explain.  im good at sensing things. my friends think i was a cat in a former life^^ randomness. but i guess they have their reasons^^\r\n\r\nquite often late at night i have looked over the valley from   our window, and seen lights hovering in the sky.  they just stay there.  they could be a plane. there are a few flight paths around but not that low.  \r\n\r\nthey just hover, then vanish.  my housemate last year was woken by a bright blue light that shone through his bedroom window and blinded him. he had no idea what it was but it scared him.\r\n\r\ntheres a hill we can see from our window, next to it is the village of christchurch,2 years ago around 1am we were writing essays, and saw a light near the village we watched it for a while,it was very bright, which si what caught our attention.  we watched it move into the woods next to the village where ti stayed. \r\n\r\nafter a while, the light started to flash like a code, we went outside to see what it could be flashing to, to see if someone was replying to it, but ti wasnt.  we watched it for awhile trying to figure out what it was.\r\n\r\naround 3am (i think) we decided to call the police, as we were worried someone may have had an accident and were flashing for help.\r\n\r\nwe never ehard anything back from them,and the light still flashes to this day.  though there are often more than one of them, the most ive seen is around 6 lights at once.\r\nits possibe the lights are people hunting in the woods or car headlights? \r\n\r\nprobally those are more probable explanations. we did do some research intrigued by the lights in the sky, apprently we are in a ufo triangle, which stems between newport, swansea (and i cant remember the third point sorry:/ ) \r\n\r\nsorry for this huge post, i would have posted my sitings sooner, but  didnt know of this site until i happened to find a reference to it, on a site called tellmewhereonearth.Com .  so i apologise for such a big post.\r\n\r\ni included some images one a map of the area, one a a photo of the conference centre to show you a rough view, and the third a very bad sketch to give you a rough idea of what it looked like.\r\n  \r\n\r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or

13th. i had stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and wait for my girlfriend to get ready for an upcoming dental appointment. i smoke right outside my garage and almost always look up to the sky. this day was like no other. i was standing there, smoking, and when i looked across the street and up towards the sky, i noticed 2 silver/star objects hovering about 2k feet off the ground and at about 3-4 miles distance from me. looking at the objects, i first thought they were stars. however, the sky was perfectly blue and the wind was blowing at about 10-15mph (direction unsure). as i stared at the 2 objects for a bit longer, one of them shot across the sky coming to a point behind me and my house and once again commenced to hover. this struck me as odd and at this point i knew they were not ballons due to the fact that they were both hovering at different locations and that one had moved to its present location rather quickly and stopped just as quickley. there was no noise or anything emitted by the objects and there were no strange smells or odors in the area as well. both objects sparkled and seemed to blink while hovering in their respective locations. at about this time, 30 minutes had passed and my girlfriend appeared and was ready to go. since we were running behind, i did not mention it to her until later that day. i lost sight of the object once i entered the vehicle since my mind was on driving at the time. i was somewhat disturbed by what i saw. i was a marine for 12 years and am trained to observe my surroundings. i know what i saw and i know that it was not

the east.  these commercial aircraft have red, green and white lights that are visible from the ground and you can always hear them fly over.  this obeject was different.  it was moving east, as a lot of aircraft do,but, no sound or lights were detected.  also, it appeared maybe to be moving ( i guess ) at about half the height of these commercial aircraft.  we viewed this object when it was directly over head and watched it for about 30 or more seconds until we could no longer see it.  i guess it flew past our town so the city lights no longer shown upon it.

cruz alta road, i\r\ncaught a shiny point of light in my periphery out to the\r\nwest high over the mesa at approximately 45 degrees.  the\r\nsharpness of the reflected light appeared and disappeared in\r\nfairly regular intervals, indicating that the object was\r\neither tilting or rotating.   it left no vapor trail, as is\r\ncommon with all planes that pass through the area.\r\n\r\nit's angle in the sky appeared to increase at the same time\r\nthat it's definition softened, until i couldn't see it\r\nanymore.  it left the impression that it was moving higher\r\nand farther out west.\r\n\r\nthen, further along in my walk, i saw what appeared to be a\r\njet in the same area that i saw the object.  it was quite\r\nfar west over the mesa, and left a short dark vapor trail. \r\nmy first interpretation was that it was this i had seen, and\r\nnot being able to see both objects at the same time (the\r\nother had faded), i was about to dismiss it.\r\n\r\nthen, further yet on my walk, the reflective object came\r\nback into view, and i could clearly see it was different\r\nfrom the object leaving the vapor trail.  it was moving in\r\nan easterly direction on a course to cross my path\r\nperpendicularly, traveling very steady in speed and altitude\r\nwith no sudden jerky movements.  all the time, it pulsated\r\nregularly with light reflected from the sun, at\r\napproximately once per second.   eventually, it did come\r\nright over my path.   people driving by could have easily\r\nverified it, but no one seemed curious as to what i was\r\nlooking at and i was too wrapped in it to stop anyone.\r\n\r\nwhen it was near overhead, i tried to see what it was. \r\nsince it appeared to be moving in the same direction of the\r\nwind, i couldn't rule out a piece of trash that had been\r\npicked up.  but if it was, it was the only such piece of\r\ntrash in the entire clear blue cloudless sky, and it\r\ntraveled in a very smooth controlled manner, except for the\r\n\"wobbling\".   my best interpretation was that is was 50%\r\nreflective and rotating, so that with each revolution it\r\nwould once again reflect the light of the sun.  it may have\r\nbeen disc shaped, but the strong contrast between the\r\nreflective surface and the non-reflective \"black\" surface\r\nserved to disrupt a sense of shape.   the wind was not\r\nblowing steadily at ground level, yet the object moved along\r\nquite smoothly and slowly.  whatever it was doing (wobbling\r\nor rotating), it always appeared to be maintaining the same\r\n\"top to bottom\" orentation.  in other words, at no point did\r\nit look like it was tumbling end over end, which is what i\r\nwould have expected to see at times if it were merely a\r\npiece of trash at the mercy of the wind.\r\n\r\nit continued right along, traveling east and toward the\r\nsangre de christo's and \"flashing\" in the sun, and then\r\nbegan rising in altitude slowly as it made it's way over the\r\nrange and out of sight.   i must have watched it for a good\r\n5 minutes or more from the time it had reappeared, and i\r\nhave no definitive conclusions as to what it was.

do this.  i closed my eyes for a bit, then the cat started to get too close to my face, so i picked it up to put it on the ground.\r\n\r\nthat's when i noticed a black shpere-shaped object simply hanging in the air above me.  \r\n\r\nit took me a while to figure out what i was looking at.  i couldn't figure out why the object was simply suspended in the air.  it was about the size of venus, or a little smaller, maybe mars.  i knew it wasn't an airplane for sure, as it was simply stuck in the air.  it wasn't moving, except possibly slightly turning to reveal a red area on a different side of the sphere.  this could have been a red flashing light, i don't know for sure.\r\n\r\ni kept looking at the object to figure out what it was.  i knew it wasn't a helicopter- for one thing, i could clearly see it was a sphere, and not elongated at all.  for another, there was no noise, and we have helicopters fly over the house almost every day, so i know what a helicopter looks and sounds like.  and i think that a helicopter couldn't be that high anyway.  i mean if it was a helicopter, it would have to be very very high to be the size of venus and anyway, like i said, there was no movement of any kind, which means no props or blades.\r\n\r\ni thought perhaps it could be a balloon, but as i said, it was stuck in the air.  in other words, it didn't move at all, except possibly to gently turn over, but as i said, this could have been a red flashing light.  if it was turning over, then it did it very very gently--in other words, there was no bobbing, jerking, jiggling, or erratic movement of any kind.  it just hung there.  very weird.  i finally realized i was very likely looking at a ufo, and i was excited.  i went to get a digital camera, but either the memory card or whatever it is was full, or the camera didn't work.  i think i got one picture, but when i tried to download it to my computer, the computer wouldn't take it.  anyway, i couldn't see the object in the viewfinder, so i just pointed it as best i could and took the picture.  it is exposure 90, but the computer would only go to 89.  i still have it, but i don't know if i was able to point at the object.\r\n\r\ni called my mom out to look, but she couldn't see it.  it was only about the size of venus or mars, and the sky was still fairly bright. that was a bit frustrating.  i kept pointing, but she didn't see it. \r\n\r\nit was there for only about 3 minutes.  i wish i could have taken a picture, but i didn't want to go looking for another camera and lose the object.  i kept looking at it, and then finally it just -- disappeared, which i know sounds weird, but that's what happened.  poof.  gone.  i guess it could have sped off so fast i didn't see it.\r\n\r\nthe next day, i told someone at work about it, and he got excited and kept asking me about it, and said his mom told him a similar thing, but i think that was in phoenix.  anyway, later that day i saw a white sphere, about the size of an average star, and it was gently moving thru the air.  it was kind of erratic. i guess that could have been a balloon, because it wasn't moving very fast and was just meandering thru the sky, but the next say something happened which made me think twice.\r\n\r\non friday, after work, i went outside to see if it was there again, and after scanning the sky, decided to lay back down to duplicate my actions two days before.\r\n\r\nmy mom came out to ask if i was looking for the object, and about a minute later, a very very fast star-like object flew right above my head ( i mean it was way way up there, but you know what i mean) in the direction i was reclining ( it started at my head and moved in the direction of my feet) and then started 'bouncing' or zig-zagging...Those aren't really the words, because i couldn't see the object actually do those things, i just saw it in one place and then in another and then another - like that- then it straightened out and then another object about 2 seconds behind it did very similar things--i know this sounds crazy but it was almost as if they were confirming that they were ufos and nothing else.  i mean this was three days in a row--if the previous day's sighting was a craft of some kind and not just a balloon.  come to think of it i see the slow meandering kind quite a bit--maybe every month, so those could be balloons i guess.  i have never seen a big balloon like those would be but i have heard about weather balloons. are those really big, completely round and white?\r\n\r\n  but there is no way that those fast-moving objects were balloons, jets, meteors or rockets or anything 'conventional'.  for one thing, all those things, except for the balloon of course leave trails of some kind, and these didn't--except for...Well it seems like the air around them was kind of - i don't know, kind of hazy, almost as though they were on a road in the sky.  and it took only about 5 seconds at the most to go from one point in the sky to the other where i couldn't see them anymore.  in other words, clear across the sky in 5 seconds or maybe less. i just thought of something.  take your arm and put it on the table.  point your hand to the ceiling.  now, take about five seconds to lower your hand to the table.\r\n\r\nremember that speed, go outside and do the same thing to the sky, and that's how fast the ojects were going.  try to imagine a rocket going that fast.  no way.  i wonder how fast they were going.  thousands of mph, is my guess. \r\n\r\ni just thought of something else.  when they were 'jumping' it was like what a flea does when it jumps.  you can tell it jumped, but you can't see it actually in the air.  that's exactly what it was like.\r\n\r\ni almost didn't even make this report; it's not like anyone can really prove it.  and i told someone i didn't know about it and she kind of looked at me like i was drunk or something.  which by the way, i wasn't.  no alcohol, drugs, or mind-altering substances of any kind.  and i wasn't dreaming, as my mom will verify.\r\n\r\n  but when i saw the two objects zoom by, compared with the slow moving object i saw the day before, i figured what the heck.  maybe someone else saw at least one of these things.  and i saw where only about 1 in 7 people sees one, and i saw at least 3 or possibly 4 in three days, so i figured this was worth reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinitely the weirdest three days i have ever had.  oh, i wasn't scared at all.  it was very cool.\r\n\r\nanyway, feel free to follow up if you think it will help.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional

on the inside of the bottom had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then red and orange mainly red lights then they were a roquefort blue (what i mean by a roquefort blue the lights on the inside of the bottom looked like roquefort and blue cheese salad dressing and they were a light blue the lights looked like roquefort salad dressing and were light blue) they hovered over the treetops in the backyard and still had roquefort blue lights then again red and orange lights mainly red lights. then 3 triangler ufos showed up they were yellow lighted with red dots at every corner. and a huge cone ufo showed up and then all 3 circle ufos and 3 triangler ufos and the cone ufo disappeard they were gone as fast as they came they were all going towards the ocean except one traingler ufo i guess they crashed out in the ocean. and the one trainger ufo looked like it landed in a nearby pasture. we were done grilling our food on the outdoor grills out in the backyard. we went to the pasture where the ufo landed we saw foil and metal wrapped around the trees. it was a clear night outside. and the trianger ufos made a humming
