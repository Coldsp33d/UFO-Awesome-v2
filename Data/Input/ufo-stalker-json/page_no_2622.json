i am still puzzled. i tried to film them, but my camera could not pick up the image.\r\n \r\ni have had other sightings and do have some pics of past sightings, if interested.\r\nthank you,\r\njennifer f.\r\nchula vista, ca\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:32:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":4407,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.6472841,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02092006-0002","longitude":-117.0817155,"occurred":1139212800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,  Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1139212800000,"summary":"Large, extremely bright light in center with pulsating lights","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Chula Vista, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:536620"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Menahga","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving from home menahga mn.To the twin citys for work when i was about 10 miles i seen a big bright light looked like a meter coming staight down.I was waiting for it to hit in the feild when it stopped and went up about 200 feet and hovered there.The shape was a diamond in the inside and a circle of lights around it.As i keept heading south to the citys it stayed in front of me getting further away but only a couple of blocks this thing was the size of the metrodome.It stayed in the sky the whole time of my drive.Not a star or planet or plane i seen it come down stop before hitting the ground.Moving way to fast for anything we have.Then my cell phone rang it fianc'e she asked if i seen the metor,i said its not no metor i still see it, it stopped before hitting the ground and is moving slowly in front of me.Which it did all the way to the citys but moving further away,a coworker seen it at 6:15.I can't believe it was'nt on tv or something.There was two other veicles at the time it came out of the sky i know they seen it to,they hit there brake lights.

overdue. i became very anxious waiting for his arrival and went outside to look down the highway to see if i could see the school bus coming that he would be traveling in. i was trying to be patient and so i just let my eyes wander thru the neighbor, up and down the streets, and i soon caught something out of the corner of my. it was a small  red light flashing thru the trees across the street from where i lived. there was  a church there, and tall trees behind it.  at first i thought it must be a helicopter since the town i was in was situated between fort campbell and fort knox. i kept noticing the light and as it moved toward me, directly toward me, i still assumed it to be helicopter, until it came closed. it made no sound and seemed to be gliding. it continued to make it's way toward me,  with no noise and i became a little anxious. i had been standing in the grass but as it appeared to approach me directly overhead i stepped onto the sidewalk. the object appeared to stop and i looked up. could not be sure how big it was, did not appear to be very large but it was very to see the underside or what i assumed to be the underside. it had been green and red lights that were rotating clockwise all at once. the lights were very brilliant but not casting any light down from them. i assumed it was round because of the way the lights were situated but i can nver be sure the size of the object or the shape. i was a little breathless and i was almost excited but not unduly concerned. i think  iwas more curious than anything. i did however remember being almost froxen in place while the thing hung over my head. i went indoors and drew a picture with crayons of the description as well as i could and waited for my son to get home, which he did a short time later. i asked why the bus was so late and he told me there was engine trouble with the bus. i did not ask him to elaborate. i was just glad my son was home safe and sound.  the reason i am writing this is because it haunts me to this day. i have also have had some strange things happening to me in the past few years that i can't really explain away although they are not dramatic circumstances i still have no answers to them.\r\nthis event happened in logan county kentucky in the spring of 1979 or 1980.P.S. i do wish that i had had the foresight to have taken a picture. it would have been an

me, that it still gives me cold chills whenever i think about it.  i thought it was time to pass on the information to someone who might be able to make heads or tails out of it.  at the time of the encounter, i lived with my wife in a little apartment just outside the city limits of salisbury, north carolina.  i was employed as art director at the corporate headquarters for pic 'n' pay shoe stores, located in charlotte.  i commuted back and forth to work, a distance of 50 miles one way.\r\n\r\ni don't remember the exact date.  i do remember that it was sometime in early november 1977.  the day had been miserable, with a cold steady rain.  when i left work, it was already getting dark.  the drive home usually lasted about an hour in clear weather.  i knew the drive home in all the slop and rush-hour traffic was going to be a \"bear!\"\r\n\r\nmy apartment was located near an old, abandoned drive-in theatre off highway 601.  as i sat at the stoplight at the intersection of statesville boulevard and what is now known as north jake alexander boulevard, i noticed in the distance to my right what at first appeared to me to be \"heat\" lightning.  it struck me as being rather odd in that it was cold (mid-30s) and the flashes were different in color -- alternating among reds, yellows, blues, and greens.  then i thought that maybe something was going on at the old drive-in theatre, but as i drove along jake alexander, the area affected by the flashes seemed to be centered over the intersection of jake alexander and highway 601, just south of the old drive-in.\r\n\r\nas i got closer to the intersection, i slowed down and rolled down the window slightly to try to pick up any thunder or any other kind of noise.  the only sounds were the wind pushing rain through the crack and the car's engine.  about 50 feet from the stop sign, i pulled my car over to the shoulder of the road and stopped.  the flashing was now directly over me.  i shut off the engine and listened.  there was nothing but brilliant flashes of different colors followed only by wind and rain.  i was dumbfounded.  as the clouds were very low, i could not make out any distinct shape -- only glowing clouds alternating colors.  it made absolutely no sense.  i remember at the time several vehicles coming up beside me over the next few minutes as they stopped for the stop sign.  each time i would roll down my window enough to get my left arm out and point straight up at the clouds.  no response.\r\n\r\ni must have sat there riveted to my seat, watching the greatest, noiseless light show i had ever witnessed.  the colors seemed to dance all over the place above me, in no particular order or sequence.  i thought to myself, \"i have got to share this with someone!\"  i started the car and turned right towards my apartment.  if anyone would believe me, my wife would.  or so i thought.  i bounded through the door like a kid at christmas, telling my perplexed wife about what i had just seen.  you would have thought i had lobsters coming out of my ears as she just looked and stared.  and though i pleaded with her to grab a coat and follow me back to the car, she said there was no way in hell that she was going out in a cold rain to look at flashes of light.\r\n\r\ni practically dove back through the door and headed the car back towards the intersection.  however, the lightshow had gone.  there was nothing in its place but darkness and the tiny glow from the flashing intersection light.\r\n\r\nwell, that's it.  i wish i had more to tell, but that's the extent of my story.  i will tell you this though, the event had a tremendous impact upon my life and how i have looked at the world ever since.","distance":"21-100

sometimes it would go over and then up and down, but it usually went one direction and then stopped.  when i noticed it, it was about at \"10:00 o'clock\" position in east.

followed the moving light (the biggest one) as it slowly moved ne and i began to lose sight of the other two. i decided to take the next exit ramp to get a better vantage point and when i did i

figure out what we were seeing. most thought it was a meteor, some called it a 'falling star'. i was just in awe...I felt i witnessed something spectaculor and not a meteor! that was 41 years ago..I was 15 or 16 at the time, and i have never forgot what i saw...It wasn't until recently that i realized that i just might have witnessed what is now known as the 'kecksburg ufo' the memory of that evening is still clear in my mind. the object traveled from west to east (from where i was standing) the exact physical address i was at at the time was 499 belgrove drive, kearny new jersey (facing the passiac river towards newark new jersey) the object seemed to get slower and traveled until it was out of my line of sight.","distance":"101-500

adirondacks in upstate new york, don't remember the exact location now but it was probably near the indian lake / pharoah lake areas.  it was around 11pm.  we had eaten dinner and were standing around the campfire.  we were camped on a penninsula on the lake.  it was a clear, calm night.  we then noticed a light coming over the tree tops in the distance probably a mile or so away.  we continued to watch it because we did not know what it was a plane, star, etc..  however, as we watched the light it came lower and closer to us until eventually it was just over the treeline and had reached the edge of the lake.  it was simply a small white light approximately the size of a basketball or so i would judge. silent.  when it reached the edge of the water it just stopped and to my eyes \"blinked\" away and it was gone.  my brother claims it shot up at an angle in a flash into the sky.  i did not see that, just that it blinked away. that was the end of the incident.
