that was bright red it stood out from all the other lights in the sky.  i stood outside wondering if it was an oddly colored star, but it started moving westward in the sky slowly at first, then it started flying in ways that no plane or helicopter could possibly move.  it seemed to zig-zag back and forth horizontally, now it had really captured my attention and i stood outside for three hours watching the object, i grabbed my binoculors and i could see not only red lights but also green, amber, white, and a small blue flash.  the next night i went out to smoke and to my surprise it was there again in the same location, this time i tried to take piictures with my digital camera, but i didn't have much sucess getiing a good picture.  i began looking every night and i saw this thing in the sky every night for three months.  i tried to get a better view from my telescope but the lenses weren't good enough.  i started going out at night trying to follow the object and see how close i could get.  i never managed to get too close until one night my sister and i were on our way home from dover and spotted the object, she had witnessed it from my house with sveral other family members.  we decided to go up the mountain road to get a better view.  when we got to the top we could see the object closer it was hovering in one spot so we stopped the car and waited, the object had a bright white light shining and started to move closer toward the car, we became frighted and very quickly drove down the mountain.  my mother had called the news channel to tell them i had been seeing this object, but i did not call back, i had alreadly been teased at work for telling my coworkers and did not want to have the news crew come out.  i have no idea what the object was and i don't have strong enough equiptment to get a better view or any clear pictures. several times when driving around looking at the object we noticed there were two more identical objects in the same area, they had the same lights and wheneverr there were more then one they seemed to travel in a triangular pattern in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

\"listen\" for any sounds.  i looked down for a split second to turn off the radio.  when i looked up, the object was gone.  completely gone from anywhere in the sky.  this was a beautiful clear sunday morning with not a cloud in the sky.  i opened up my sun roof and look around thoroughly.  the object was nowhere in sight.  then suddenly, where the triangle was hovering a jet airliner came into view from the ne.  it flew slowly into view from the right side of my car's front window and headed on a path straight across my window in front of me, obviously headed for a landing at geiger international airport.  with myself seated in the same position in my car seat and by aligning my vision again with the rear view mirror, i could see that the path of the airplane was exactly where the triangle would have been only seconds before.

while each triangular side appeared to be nearly or precisely equalateral, and able to display maybe fifty different small piercing round or square shaped lights so bright, their shapes at the base were hard to determine. and only red white and blue, and always and equal amount of all three colors on each side, randomly distributed with no apparent pattern aside from the overall pyramid pattern. and always, each flash came on for only an extremely quick flicker just like a strobe-light. just like you see on bicycles and most emergency vehicles. it would not suprise me if each light flickered red, white, and blue from the same spot each time. no other lights of any other magnitude or color were ever seen. \r\n  these craft never hovered more than a foot or more above the ground, and none of them took off or went up into the sky, nor ever descended from the sky either (no doubt they did though).\r\n  none of them appeared to be showing off...Just hanging around casually, except for the craft right in front of me which appeared to be guiding itself emotionally by hovering side to side while apparently having the ability to rotate on it's central axis just mildly enough so as not to really scare me but to let me know it was not afraid, and could get serious if i drove any further (which i did not). \r\n  the other crafts may not have noticed in the very short time i came upon them, but this \"one\" craft before me seemed to be playing point-guard for the rest. also, they were probably quite sure that the occupants of the nearest house, a two-story, were asleep as it was nearly 2:00 a.M., on a week day.\r\n  many large trees surrounded the otherwise sprawling suburb scattered around an occaisional open field or farm or two. \r\n   5. i hit the brakes. stared only for a about two seconds, and decided, \"i'm outa here\"!... shifted into reverse, did a backwards y-turn toward my right rear up a slight embankment of earth, and tore off in the oppposite direction up the miramonte dr. that i came from.\r\n   6. i was about thirty yards from where i backed up when i actually had the nerve to look in my rear view mirror and noticed he was tailing me!  not too closer however when i seemed to be outgaing him as he was getting smaller in my rear-view. half way to el camino real, i noticed it was gone and was certain it had no intention of following me, and just wanted to shoo me away. thank god! i was always under the impression that this was a geniune ufo, and could have done anything it wanted to.\r\n   7.  it just disappeared in my rear-view mirror.

moved straight up in the air.  i then thought that it must be a hellicopter.  the sun was then coming out and i continued to watch the lights and the object moved toward our housing area.\r\n\r\nby the time it was in clear view the sun was up and it was in no way anything i'd ever even heard of.  i even called 911 to ask if there were any gov't things going on and i remember her asking me why? i told here because what im seeing isnt anything i've ever seen before. lol she told me to get up at the same time the next morning and see if i saw it again.  displeased we ended the call.  oh i did ask if anyone else had called in about this she said no.\r\n\r\nit flew directly over our house and the detail was strange because there really wasnt that much.  it was black, coal black the front was the shape of a ball and i could see windows but they too were black the only reason i knew they were windows was because of the shine.  a short way behind, the middle of the ship was thin tubular with 2 rather short wings not a perfect triangular shape but wide then narrowed to a rounded point or end.  past the wings the tubular shape continued to the back and end of ship where there were 3 fins as a plane has and behind those were round rocket ship engines [ok i dont know what else to call them] but when u see a rocket ship [nasa] go up it was just like that except it only glowed and there was no noise just a low hum.\r\n\r\ni did get up the next day but it was a little bit later than the day before, there was nothing and nothing on the news anywhere.\r\n\r\ni watched this ship from the hills of mira vista and went to the back yard and watched leave.\r\n\r\nto this day...No one has ever reported seeing something of this shape.  and i'll tell you if they do that's something that should be investigated.\r\n\r\njust for a bit of info.  my brother-in-law's brother was there at area 51 [as he told us] he said yes it was true he had seen them.  another siting was in concord ca my

direction. it looked like some battle taking place far away. there may be a plausable explaination but in all my years of observing the heavens, i have never seen anything like it. \r\nthe flashes of white light were located from my vantage point very close to sirius in the souther sky. they were faint but i was still able to see them with the naked eye in town. at first when i glanced up i thought they were on a jet but as i watched. they were random, not moving, like little explosions far away. very quick probably not lasting for more than .03-.05 seconds. i am 99 percent sure i also saw a green/blue streak, very faint that looked about 1/4 of an inch long. these were not meteors, not irridum flares, not like anything i have seen before. seriously, (no pun intended) it looked like something you would watch on tv like a space battle far away. my location is in west texas and i have witnesses. i checked the star charts and satellite locations and was unable to explain it.

disapearing as the object flew over head and then that stars came back as it was flying by. extreamly large, dark in color, noticed one forward portal or low light centered forward and one aft, and centered. ufo was coming from the west to the east in direction. immediatly i called the temple airport about a craft flying there and asked if one was in flight. they had nothing on radar. informed me to call fort hood. i called west fort hood military air field, and they said nothing had been flying in the last couple hours, and the planes don't travel that rout. then stated there was nothing on radar either and no flights in two hours. then the person on the phone asked me what was my name, phone number, and address. i then said , \"no thanks\" and hung up. why were they wanting to know

ny. my father owns a house on lake champlain in willsboro bay. we were up at night sitting on the back deck of my father's boat house. it was a very quite and still night, there was a heavy overcast, but at a high altitude. i noticed what i thought was a plane at that time, flying across the sky from west to east, and at first i thought nothing of it. but it turned around and went back from east to west and behind the mountains there. the light came out again and flew the same pattern, going from east to west and then turning around. the third time it came out i took notice because i thought it odd that this, what i thought was a plane at that time, was flying in circles. i was aware that there was an air force fuel depot directly under where this object was flying. this is directly north of skagarack mountain on the shore of lake champlain.\r\n\r\nso i mentioned all this to the guys i was with and i think we thought it was a government plane and one of us came up with the idea to flash our flashlight at it. immediately, a beam of light shown out of the object and illuminated the porch we were standing on to the point that when we turned around there our shadows were cast on the wall. the distance between the object and us at this point is approximately 1 to 1.5 miles and none of us were aware that a light could shine precisely on 3 people from that distance. this is the point that we all knew that something very abnormal was going on. we all became very alarmed at this and i remember that we began to tremble. the object then went west, behind skagarack mountain again, on the north side of the mountain. we thought that it may have left because it did not come out again moving east as it had before. so we were slightly relieved, that perhaps the air force was not after us. however, it came out from behind the skagarack mountain on the south side, north of rattlesnake mountain, this time a little closer to us!\r\n\r\nat this point it was going strait up and down, repeatedly coming from behind skagarack mountain, and each time it raised above the mountain, the beam of white light was painting us. it was almost as if it was playing a game with us. then it flew over the mountain and started flying around the bay, and this is when we got a really good look at it. it was basically a ball of pulsating light, there was no wings, no rotors, and discernable body or fuselage. just a pulsating light that would change colors constantly, as the colors changed, one color seemed to just meld in the next color, i remember it being mainly reddish orange. perhaps the oddest thing was that it was absolutely silent, it made absolutely no noise at all. it moved well within the normal envelope of normal aircraft, there was nothing remarkable about how the thing moved. at this point a train was coming down the tracks on the opposite side of the bay from where we were, and the object immediately lost interest in us and painted its light on the train and followed it for a short time. then it left the train, floated across the bay maybe .25 miles north of where we were and headed to the same side of shore that we were on. it disappeared behind the horizon there and at this point my friends and i ran around the front side of the house to find it but it was gone, and that was the last we saw of it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4361,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3579929,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032006-0019","longitude":-73.3911945,"occurred":713257200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

looking at the stars so while we were waiting i normally just gazed up at the sky and looked at the stars.  well on this night i just happened to be looking up at the stars then my mom asked me if i wanted a drink or anything and i looked at her and said something and when i looked up back at the sky, the star that i had seen not a minute or two ago was gone.  now i was young at the time but i knew at the time stars don't just disappear.  i looked at my mom and told her that a star had just disappeared.  the strange disapperance of the star wasn't the only weird thing that happened.  not within a couple of minutes of this star disappearing and my ranting to my mother about a star disappearing about two or three what looked liked black  army helicopters had started to circle right around where the star had originally been. before the helicopters had come by i thought i had just been seeing things but once the helicopters came i started to think there might have been somethign that happened that night.  i only tell you guys this now because i just now heard of guys, perhaps there was a similar sighting or something that my observation might be able to help you guys out with another sighting that might have been similar that night. to be honest i wasn't too sure of the year, i'm only 22 and i saw it when i was like 10 or  maybe even younger than that.  anyways thanks for your time i hope you guys find this useful.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":4353,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.7739053,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032006-0011","longitude":-117.9414477,"occurred":707362200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":707362200000,"summary":"Please
