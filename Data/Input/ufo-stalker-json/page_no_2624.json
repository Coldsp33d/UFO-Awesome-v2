(the ufo light was in line with the airport beacon earlier)  as i got closer and the lights became further distinct and separate i thought \"what the hell is that?\", as the nearer light was obviously the airport beacon light and was rotating and singular in nature, while the other source of light was brighter, multicolored and stationary.  i passed the airport and, constantly watching the light, drove about a quarter mile further along the road.  as i neared the second source of light i was able to discern that the source of the light was a vehicle of some kind just off the road and slightly above tree level.  i drew abreast of the object, pulled on to the shoulder of the road and exited my truck.  i walked around to the passenger side of the truck and stared at the craft nearby.   i was both shocked and elated, as it was obviously a ufo i was observing.  (heretofore i was not a believer in these phenomenons.)  the craft was about fifty yards from the road, just above tree-top level.  it was a saucer, elliptical in shape as the top and bottom of the craft did not meet, but ended in a flat side.  there were lights of several colors all about the ship, around the outside, on top and from the bottom.  i estimate its diameter as approximately one hundred feet, based on its close proximity to the trees immediately below it.  it was completely silent, no discernable sound apparent to me.  i observed it for 30 seconds to one minute.  at that time i heard another vehicle approaching from the other direction, and i turned my head for about two seconds to see if the driver was going to stop, which they did not.  i turned back to observe the craft and it was gone.  it was nowhere to be seen.  in order to be hidden from me it would have either had to cloak itself or travel very quickly from view.  at no time during this encounter was any sound emitted from the object.  as i observed it it was in a silent hover about a quarter mile from the dexter airport, directly above an explosive depot for a local business.  i did report the incident to the local newspaper, the watertown daily times.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":4347,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.0149952,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032006-0005","longitude":-76.0425109,"occurred":595863000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":595863000000,"summary":"Elliptical disc, 100' diameter, bright lights all around, soundless","tags":["sound","lights","disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Dexter, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:540997"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Panama City Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at the moonspinner condo's in panama city beach with my husband.  this place is on the gulf of mexico and is right next to st. andrews state park...Very quiet and not light polluted.  we were on the 8th floor balcony closest to the park chatting and looking out at the sky as we spoke.  i saw to the left of my field (toward the park and the canal) a shape flash into my vision.  it was like an elongated nose-snubbed-off candy corn shape with a very bright fire coming out of the back end.  the fire was shaped like a golf tee as if the object rested upon the tee like a golf ball--wide end down.  it was pointing  out to sea and away from the direction of the canal and land.  what struck me most was that as i looked at this object, it was there long enough for me to notice details about it.  i saw the underside of it as if it were a plane flying low.  the underside was wavy like a corregated roof--you know the old fiberglass kind they used to make?  it had 3 ridges and two valleys in this wavy design:  one ridge on either side of the belly and one in the middle separated by the \"valleys\".  this i saw clearly and it puzzled me for three reasons:  why was i seeing the underbelly of a plane at night so clearly? why did it have a tail of fire or light, and why was it flying so close for me to see these details?  then i realized after it disapppeared as suddenly as it came that it couldn't be a plane.  it didn't make sense.  it shot away out of my vision without any trail of light, with out me being able to see it go.   my husband saw only the flash of light because he was looking at me when i was talking and didn't look up until i stopped talking and stared.  \r\ni have reported this before at the time of the occurance, but i am not sure if it was to your organization.  i am still wondering if there is a way to explain this all away.  i was not imagining this.  it still leaves me wondering.  i have a drawing of what it looked like that i drew back then and will include it.  was it a nasa secret object?  did i see an extraterrestrial object?

just there, then gone, and then approx. a mile or less away, one appeared and then the other. no speed, no streaks, just there one moment and then gone. \r\n\r\nwe were freaked. we walked up the beach a bit to see; each one looking at the other in quiet wonder and disbelief.  in 10 minutes they were all gone...No flashing lights; no tail rudder lights and no sounds.  they were just there and then nothing. we spent the next 45 minutes in travel, plus the next days via cell phone conversations asking each other, \"did you see what i saw?\" we both agreed that we did. \r\n\r\ni am not crazy...Don't do drugs, quite intelligent and am not conned easily.  i do believe in other life out there (only a fool would think this would be made for just only us [hence a lot of wasted space]), but i cannot ignore what i saw. this to me was a change, and when i would read other people's stories about sightings and think they were crazy, well, then i must be just as well. \r\n\r\ntake it for what you want, but i was an aero-structural-mechanic in the military originally, and did the other thing later...I know aircraft, this was none we have, or anything else. \r\n\r\nwell, that's it...I don't know what is out there, but something more than we are is truly there. resubmitting for spelling errors, because when you talk about something most won't believe or be in an agreement of such, well, once types faster than the words can keep up with. \r\n\r\nthank you","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:45:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":4344,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.1301184,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032006-0002","longitude":-80.1408786,"occurred":1079515800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1079515800000,"summary":"Multiple objects over the ocean","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Fort Lauderdale, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:541000"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Tallahassee","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were leaving a friend's house in tallahassee, florida. we saw this fireball looking thing flying through the sky. it appeared to be a fireball with something metallic and shiny attached to it. we got out of the car and watched it go across the sky from east to west. it seemed to be very close to the surface. we lost sight of it after it went towards the west, and some trees were blocking our view.

noticed it kind of pulsating and then it would disappear totally then re-appear a few minutes later. went inside and got a digital camcorder to document it. after getting some (so-so) footage the batteries were to low to continue so i shut the camera off and just watched. a minute or two after turning off the camera a fast moving object to the north of my position was moving towards the object. i then turned the camera back on to the \"play back\" mode just to use the screen as a zoom lense and learned that it was a twin engine jet of the \"fighter-interceptor\" type. i was an airforce intel ops specialist for some years and had training in recognition so i know a fighter when i see it(dimly lit heat signatures on camcorder screen from engines indicate sub-sonic speed to avoid sonic boom wich i didnt hear). there is stewart airfield in newburgh, n.Y., approximately 20 miles due east of the sighting. after seeing the jet i went back inside to quick charge the battery and told my son to come out but before going back out we looked out a west facing window and observed the jet flying what i know to be a \"cap\" or combat air patrol in the general vacinity to the south of where the object appeared. we then went back out to video more and as we turned toward the area of the sighting we watched the jet fly off due west never to return, at least for the hour or so we stayed out there. the sphere then reappeared, pulsated, faded in and out then disappeared. it did this repeatedly for some time. i went back inside, my son got in his mothers' vehicle to fend off the cold and continued to video. consequently, every thursday since, if we go outside after dark anywhere from 4 to 6 oddly lighted aircraft (they literally look like \"flying police cars\" with their pursuit lights on) fly a huge \"square\" flight path, mostly to the east of but including the area of the sighting. some sound like prop planes, some make no noise at all. at least one of these craft initially left very odd contrails that slowly dispersed and lingered for what seemed like days. ever since the initial sighting these aircraft return every thursday and consequently every weekend my wife seems to have \"sinus problems\" coincidence? one last item, the wednesday following the initial incident a helocopter passed about a quarter mile away and about 200 feet or so off the ground from our house. it was white underneath and black on the sides and top with no markings or lights what so ever. this occurred at about 3:15 p.M.. the video is shakey at best and was recorded on an old tape that has pictures of my daughter on it. after i edit her i'll make it

started sparkling red and white.  i thought it was a helicopter or a satellite.  curiosity made me retrieve my binoculars.  i looked at it and immediately saw a saucer.  it was just hovering for several minutes.  i was in disbelief.  i woke my husband and he said, \"thats no plane or satellite.\"  i said it's a ufo and he agreed.  then he went back to bed - not impressed (he wakes up at 3 am).  at first it was a gassy image.  i watched the ship for several minutes spinning.  i was shaking and in disbelief - had butterflies in my stomach.  the longer i watched the more amazed i became.  the ship was oval and flat with white lights around the bottom.  suddenly two rows of lights were spinning in opposite directions at a rapid pace.  the lights were no longer white, they were were red, yellow, blue, green, white, orange, pink, and purple.  this went on for about 5 minutes and then stopped and just hovered again.  the lights stayed off and suddenly it began shooting off flashes of white light in front of it.  (it was like lightning lighting up the sky in front and above it - or flashes like a camera flash bulb.)  this went on for several minutes, then suddently it shot backward, then forward spinning on its sides - while the colored lights were moving he did this 2 times and then started flashing the lights again - this is whn i noticed a smaller image that appeared to be further up.  they were flashing each other back and forth for over 5 to 10 minutes.  i watched this until the smaller ship disappeared.  the larger ship continued to o the same flashing moving eas and further up in

cerritos, california, which is about 15 miles southeast of downtown los angeles. i was outside and had a clear view of the sky in all directions. the sky was clear and visbility was as far as i can describe, unlimited.  there were numerous commerical aircraft visible in several directions, mostly in the lax pattern. while speaking with a coworker, i noticed a red light in the northern sky. it appeared to be a planet or star but the red color was brilliant and remarkable, as reds usually disipate over distance. i will do my best to give a more detailed explanation of its location: when i noticed it, it was about 25 degrees west of north and about 30 degrees above the horizon. it appeared to be either a high flying aircraft at distance or a star/planet, but as i said, the red color was intense. the light appeared to flicker or strobe, but not in any regular pattern. i thought it may have been affected by the same condition that makes stars \"twinkle\", air currents and temperature changes.  while in conversation with my co-worker, i watched the \"thing\", probably because it appeared so brightly yet so apparently high in altitude.  i noticed that it was moving from west to east, very slowly. slow enough that it took maybe 10-15 minutes to go appx. 45 degrees across the sky. i remarked to myself that some of the pilots of the multiple aircraft in the area must see it, if i could see it from the ground. i watched alone while speaking with the coworker, but finally mentioned it to him/her at about 2050 hours. at that point it was almost directly north. there was no detectable noise from it, and it moved so slowly that its movement was almost indistinguishable.  once i mentioned it, we both watched it and tried to identify it. i am not a pilot, but i believe that the red light on an aircraft going from left to right would be on the opposite side of the fuselage. the \"thing\" moved at a constant altitude, which was totally indistinguishable due to the lack of noise, brightness of the \"thing\" and slow speed. we watched for about 5 more minutes until it was about 15 degrees east of north. we both discussed it, trying to determine what it was. suddenly, at about 2055, it either dived towards the ground or turned northbound at a very high rate of speed until it was out of sight, which took less than five seconds. it was moving very quickly. either way, it appeared to be going \"down\" in relation to where i was standing. still, no noise. once it began to move away (or down), it changed color to a whitish, more like an aircraft light. i still did not notice any flashing anti-collision lights or green/red orientation lights like a commercial or private aircraft would display. i had no recording/video equipment, but even if i had, i don't think that it would have been useful due to the small size and lack of gross movements of the object until it left our view. at no point could i see any detail as to the shape, size or actual speed of this thing. i don't believe that what we saw was necessarily a anything special, but i'm sure that someone in a city this large must have seen it. please contact my email address with any questions.

above the parking lot. it made no noise and seemed to emit no light wich seemed odd because it appeared to be made of light. it's edges i remember well because they were so sharp. they, to me, looked absolutely perfect and symmetrical to the atom. it was the most beautiful thing i have ever seen. the sphere with the spikes looked large. it's longer spikes were probably 3.5 to 4.0 feet long. the spere was probably 1.5 to two feet wide. so it may have been up to 10 ft. from point to point. we both stared, jaws dropped, for a minute or two. i then ran inside to get my father. \" dad, dad come quick!\" i said. \"hold on son just a sec.\" he replied. come on! come on! i exclaimed. \"what is it son?\"  \"dad theres a ufo or something outside!\" he finally ran back with alan and myself to the front door. the object however was already gone. years later, approx. 10, on the way back from the beach another friend and myself saw a similiar object. it was a similiar sphere only this one was about .8 of a foot across. he got a better view. i was looking at the girl in the back seat. i saw what looked like three or four different patterns of spikes emitted from the small sphere in only a split second. it , from the corner of my eye, looked like it almost hit the car so i looked out the back window for the object instead of turning around but i did not see it. i then turned from looking at the back seat and sat down. i waited for a while observing the oncoming car lights and streetlights. i knew that neither was what i had just witnessed. i turned towards jeremy to tell him what i saw. he was looking forward with both hands on the wheel. he had a funny smirk on his face. he looked over at me, i was already looking at him, and he said, \" man your not going to believe this but a star thing just flew over the car.\" he said he could see it off in the distance as it swooped downwards and headed straight for our car. i would guess that it was only 3/4 of a  foot above the car as it passed over. jeremy said it was spinning as it flew. during both occasions i had no doubt that what i was seeing was either angelic or extraterrestrial and definately not man made. would you please let me no if you have had similiar reports or know what you think i might have seen? p.S. the second sighting was on the way to houston from surfside beach. circa 1989.","distance":"20 Feet

the sky then i saw 3 red lights above some trees (i thought it was a airplane but i kept looking).During the sighting i felt scared because it had to of been about 20 or 30 feet above us. when i first saw it i only saw 3 lights two next to eachother and one over the other. about 5 minuits after i noticed it i couldnt see it anymore because it went behind some trees. then about another 5 munuits later it came back over the trees going very slowly and went right above us and it was pretty close to the ground. after it past us we watched it go over to a big feild next to us and then we went to go get our friend to show her and we came out then it was gone. no where to be seen","distance":"20 Feet or

four others witnessed a silver, shiny, metallic looking object of unknown size coming from the south and moving in a north/northwesterly direction over the masspike in the allston area. i'm a pilot. i know what airplanes and helicopters look like in the daytime and night time. this was neither. as for balloon? it was not. a balloon at that altitude would have moved with the wind. which would have been towards the east on that day. this was moving very slowly in almost the opposite direction- in a north/northwesterly direction( obviously controlled and under it's own power). we observed it and talked about it for at least five minutes. we were unable to determine its actual size or altitude except to say it was below cloudlevel. there were no referances to size, since we observed an object that was neither an airplane nor a helicopter. and there was nothing near it to make a determination as to its size. it appeared small and reflective and under its own power. maintaining its altitude which was very high, but below cloudlevel. this lasted for at least five minutes,perhaps more, when it suddenly disappeared. any claim to it being a balloon also disappeared at that point. because balloons move with the wind, especially on a windy day, and not against it. it vanished.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4319,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3624308,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01272006-0004","longitude":-71.0568632,"occurred":1093935600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,
