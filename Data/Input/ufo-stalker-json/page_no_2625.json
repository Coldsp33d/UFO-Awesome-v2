slowly though.  up, down, side to side, and diagonal movements were seen.  closing one eye and keeping my window as a point of steadiness, i kept watching for a while feeling very emotional and unsure what i was really seeing.  i compared its distance to other stars nearby and was positive it was indeed moving.  afraid the object would leave, i was fearful to get out of bed to wake my sister and my mom.  quickly i jumped out of bed to gently wake my sister in her bed on the other side of our bedroom.  after she saw it and started to get emotional with tears, i told her to get our mom in the next bedroom.  she didn't know what to tell her, so i told her to just tell her i wanted her to come here.  sleepy, but not pissed off, my mom came in.  i told her to lay down with me and look up there (pointing). of course at this point the ufo was still there, but was paused and i was starting to feel like an idiot.  then it started to move again after my mom had been watching for about 45 seconds.  i asked her if she saw \"it\".  she said she did.  the three of us all squeezed onto my bed and watched it for a while, dumbfounded and with watering eyes.  my mom said she'd seen one

was staying in my home town. i had one beer in the hotel bar before we left to go to a night club. outside the hotel,it was a beautifull summer night and the sky was totally clear.Visability of the stars was excellent so i looked up to see the stars and from my peripheral vision caught sight of something moving very fast. my instant thought was that it was a satellite ( i have seen many of these), but instantly realised that it was not. the objects were moving far to fast and there were five of them in formation. the objects were star like with a red colour. they were at a great altitude and travelled across the entire sky within 5 seconds. they were in a straight line flying side by side, until they reached the other side of the sky, where they broke off from this formation and begun to weave in and out of each other before dissappearing vertically in different directions into the night. the whole episode lasted between 5 and 10 seconds. i called to my friends who were laughing and joking and told them what i had seen, however they thought i was winding them up and dismissed me. i spent the rest of the night trying to evaluate what i had seen, and form some kind of rational explanation. this process continued for a further two days. i considered military aircraft but these objects moved across the sky at least 10 times faster than any aircraft i have seen and the aerobatics that were performed before they disappeared were completly out of the question for a conventional fighter jet in my opinion. i resolved that i needed some form of explanation from someone, but bearing in mind my friends reaction, i was a little reluctant to say the least. i looked through the local phone book and foung a local observitory that listed itself as a local ufo group. i decided to call them anonymously. the person that answered the call seemed to be less than serious about what i was reporting and i felt that he was not taking me seriously and perhaps thought i was some sort of crank. i decided not to pursue the matter further. since that time  have never forgot what i saw that night, and everytime i look up at the stars, it is the first thought in my mind. last night i was watching tv and saw a program about a ufo sighting in the 1980's at an airforce base in norwich in the uk, and decided that now the internet is so widely used i would begin to make some enquiries for some form of explanation, without feeling ridiculed. i thank you for reading of my brief encounter and hope you may be able to offer some possible explanations, but i am also aware that if you offer some explanations, it may just pose more questions for me, if they do not fit completely with my experience.","distance":"Over One

community called chestnut hill and on 1/4/06 at approx. 8:18am (est) i was out on my front porch about to sweep the leaves off when i glanced out at english mountain.  i noticed a very large oval disc-like silvery-white object, darker around the bottom and bottom edges, in the sky just above and south of english mountain.  immediately it looked strange because you could tell that it wasn't a cloud because of it's perfect oval disc-like shape.  from the couple of minutes that i was able to observe it there seemed to be some distinct geometrical patterns associated with it such as squares running from the far edges reaching inward towards the top of the object.  something similar to the latitude and longitude lines you'd see on a map.  the object wasn���t moving at first and then approx. 2 minutes or so, maybe less, the object began rising upward very slow and suddenly shot straight up and out of sight as if it winked out, simply disappearing.  when it shot straight up it punched thru a thin layer of cloud cover leaving a hole in the clouds exactly the same shape as the object itself.  there also appeared to be a wisp of smoke or cloud vapor of some sort that seemingly trailed the object as it broke thru the clouds.  english mountain is directly south of my home and it appeared that the object was somewhat further south of english mountain and not directly over it.  from my standpoint i would estimate that the object was 1 to 2 miles from my location and higher than english mountain which is 3600 ft.  that would make the object very large in diameter if i was able to discern the lines and shape from that distance.  as soon as i saw that the object left the hole in the clouds with the smoke trail i went inside and got my camera and took these photos which were taken within the first 3 to 5 minutes after the hole was made.  the photos are still on my digital camera and have not been erased.\r\n","distance":"Over One

neighborhood. at some point i notice, up in the sky at some distance but somewhat overhead (making the object appear both high up and rather large to me), a disc shaped object. i remember at the time realizing even at that age that what i was seeing was completely unusual. \r\n\r\nneighbors were summoned from their houses, people gathered and were in a vacant field (still vacant and viewable on google earth @ approx. 423 putnam st. fort wayne in. it is the open lot nearest this point at a corner) to point and stare up in the sky toward the south east, at what i can only describe as a \"saucer\" with a row of multi colored lights (i believe orange,red,blue,purple w/others a possibility) that seemed to change over a short period of time. not quite what we see today as the \"classic disc\" but rather with a row of colored windows through the center. definately thinner height wise than wide. \r\n\r\nthe object hovered for some time although i don't recall losing sight of it, because people were awaiting a reply from someone who had gone inside to contact the local ft. wayne airport. when the neighbor emerged he was told that there wasn't anything on radar but that there was apparently a \"weather balloon\" over the skies of ft. wayne that day. the adults milling about the whole time did not for a minute believe there was a weather balloon or anything else they had ever seen in the afternoon sky that day.\r\n\r\nthese were relatively well educated, middle class people who all believed they were seeing something unusual. this was absolutely an \"event\" in my little neighborhood. these people were not the type who would gather as a group. i never before or after saw any of my neighbors behave this way. \r\n\r\nalthough it has been many years since this sighting, it stands out as one of my oldest and deepest memories. my family recalls me telling them of the occurence. unfortunately i have never had the nerve to contact the neighbors who might still be alive to ask their version of the story. not sure how i would approach the subject with them even if i could find any of them today. \r\n\r\nmy dates/times are approximate, it was just too long ago to be certain the date. the above recounting is correct to the best of my memory. i have not since then, ever seen anything in the skies that i believed to be unusual.

and go to the bathroom along side of my truck. as i was standing there between the tractor and trailer. i looked up and there was the ship. i finished what i was doing and walked arround to the front of the truck and looked at it while it was looking at me.The ship was black. it looked in a way transparent but you couldn't see through it. the way the ship was built it looked like it was structured from the inside out. it had areas on the bottom that dropped down instead of a flat surface. the front was ovel. the second level was set back a little and filled the whole body of the ship the third level had a small dome also set back. it looked like it had a window at the front of it. when the ship moved it went ouer the top of me and i could see the back as it was departing. the back, to me resembled an old appartment building with steps and different landings. it had odd shapes at the rear of the ship. the ship when it flew off there was no sound or wind . during the time it was stopped i didn't see any lights. the ship had to be antigravity. when it flew off it stayed at the same level as the ground. the ground is hilly in that area and the ship bounced up and down with the ground level as it flew off. it's flight was from the north to south direction. it took off slow and it's speed elivated to like a flash of light in a matter of about 6 seconds and then it was gone. i didn't report this when i saw it. in about the year 2000 i got a computer.One day i looked up ufo's and saw a picture of one that looked pretty much like what i had seen.I did a write up of what i had seen but never heard back from my report. i looked today for a picture but i didn't find one.Also i talked to a worker at a delivery in michigan i was making about a week after i saw the ship and he said

squirrel, bouncing around on the wall above me, when i noticed a very small white object moving high up in the sky behind it. it was moving smoothly like an aircraft. then suddenly, after going just a few degrees across the sky, it completely disappeared. i thought, oh well it is very high up, perhaps you can only see it when the sun shines at a particular angle. then i saw another suddenly appear in the same small area of the sky and do exactly the same thing. then another. their paths were sometimes in completely different directions. unfortunately i did not have any binoculars on me. as far as i remember, i did not see more than one at once, so i cannot be sure it was not all the same craft or object. all of them were in just the same very small portion of the sky above me, and all just disappearing. if these were normal craft, or even military craft, why were they all flying so close to each other in different directions?. or was it a single craft?. i did not see anything that did not appear to be moving in anything other than a straight line, although i did not see anything go that far before it suddenly faded out.\r\n\r\nthe objects were all very small and appeared to be very high up, and i believe they were all white. they were too small to really resolve any features on them, but i remember when i saw the last one, it definitely appeared to have some kind of structure, rather than being amorphous. \r\n\r\ni think each moving object was visible for perhaps 2 seconds before disappearing. i saw around half a dozen of them do this serially, going in different directions, within a small area (a few degrees) of the sky, over a total period of about 30 seconds to a minute. it was a bright sunny day, with no clouds in the sky, and there was nothing i could see in the sky that would obscure the objects' trajectories.\r\n\r\ni followed several high up aircraft after this, and you could easily see their reflection in sunlight as they travelled right across the sky.\r\n\r\nperhaps there is some explanation in terms of very bright satellites, iridium flares, a strange clustering of meteors all going in different directions and visible in daylight, or just a bunch of reckless miltary aircraft that are all clustered in one spot, and pretty much invisible except when sunlight is in exactly the right direction?.  none of these ideas make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\ni have wondered if there is some perfectly normal explanation for this, but i cannot think of one. i dont recall seeing anything quite like this ever before.

mostly on gravel. the roads were very icy and we could not drive fast. the object continued to follow us the entire way along-side the car. it was very low and very close to us. when there were trees along the side of the road the ufo moved up above them, then would dip back down beside us. then we got to a highway (hwy. 14, douglas county). we turned onto it and the object moved behind us. a very large beam of light came down out of it, illuminating a field on the left side of the road, then moved onto the highway behind us. it was strange, almost as if something made an audible click inside my brain when the light came out. by this time we were all hysterical. the object lagged behind us, then started to gain. another car came over the hill in front of us and the object was literally gone in a split second. i have seen the ufo several times since. it would come to my home (where we were headed in the car) and it would hover outside where i could see it from my pillow in bed. i would fall asleep when it was not there, then feel as though someone was staring at me. when i would open my eyes it was there! the object changed shapes depending on the shape of the moon. sometimes it was round, sometimes a sliver. one time it was like a circle cut precisely in half. after several weeks of seeing the object outside my window, i called law enforcement. i wanted someone else besides family members to see it. when i picked up the phone to call, the white ufo turned yellow. i dialed the number and it turned orange. when i told the dispatch that there was a ufo the object turned deep red in color! i was too frightened to go outside to take a picture as suggested because i thought it might put out another beam like before and zap me or something! the object hovered for several minutes, getting lower and lower. seconds before the squad car drove by to check it out it was gone! i have seen it off and on in the years since, as recent as this summer in garfield and leaf valley, mn. i often wonder if i have ever had more contact with them than i remember. when i moved to long prairie, mn i saw it there a few times, and once when i was in osakis, mn.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

so i was returning a book that was over due.  i noticed a huge moving light in the sky about 30 yards away from me.  must of been atleast 3 football fields long, huge. i can only image how big it is up close, it was huge. there were three rows of lights.  top bottom and middle. top and bottom row was plain yellow lights, middle row was an intense red shining light.  very intense light nearly blinded me.  and strangly a big gust of wind was blowing.  it was a wierd shape to it, like a star- like triangle, cylinder shape. i didnt get a chance to get my camera, but by the time i went back outside, it was still moving behind some trees.  i belive some other people saw it too.  2 or 3 cars pulled over.  i have seen others in the past but not as huge as this was was. sorry for not having
