michigan city. we live in a mobile home park but in the back yard a lot of stars can be seen. we were out then, specifically looking for shooting stars from the upcoming perseid meteor shower.\r\n  it was close to midnight, friday, august 5. my daughter and i were laying on a sleeping bag scanning the skies. my wife was sitting with us in a lawn chair.\r\n\r\n  at the same time, my daughter and i both spotted three very faint circular lights coming from a generally northwest direction. they were in a tight triangular formation. the lights were so very orangish pale, like a flashlight on its last battery charge or those orangish street lights. we both called out at the same time.\r\n  as soon as i saw them i immediately lost sight of them (night vision rods and cones stuff?) a moment later i found them again to the southeast just before they disappeared into the sky glow from area lights. my last impression was that they were still the same color, still in a tight triangle formation; with the two \"wingmen\" very close to being inline with the leader, and perhaps, appearing slightly oval in shape. no sound whatsoever.\r\nit all happened so fast that my wife didn't even see them.\r\n  reactions: 1) wow -what's that? 2) could it be a ufo? 3) maybe its geese? there is a pond several blocks to the south of us. every so often geese will fly over even in the dark. but

work i noticed many unusual cloud formations with a heavy mist decending from the swirling patterns from central points of many clouds. i called a friend further north of me to look a few miles south in the sky toward where i was to see if he could see what i was seeing. i pulled over for a few minutes to observe. he stayed on the phone with me untill i got to my job location, and we were puzzled. i hung up, and left my phone in the car and started to work.I was feeling a sort of a buzzing sensation in my spine and body. when i looked up again, i saw the first cloud clearing to a perfect cirle of blue sky and a puff of clouds caused a perfectly formed fire bird into the clearing. the image was very detailed and i could see the feathers on its head and wings.The image rotated in a deliberate counter clockwise direction causing it to look like a swastika, at this time i ran for my phone recalled my friend to ask if he could see it and he could..... the image rotated again after about a minute into a clearly defined spiral. the clouds re closed in on it slowly. my heart was in my throat at this point because the internal vibration and sight of this. my mouth became very dry.  i scanned the sky and saw a very large gasious impression of another shape. 4 donut rings at a box like lay out with more of this heavy gas like material decending from it. on the center line of the box was something like a cloud infolding on itself causing a rib like look of a whale or cylindrical pillar. it looked like a ventilation system without a vehicle behind it.\r\ni have been looking at the sky since and noticed large contrails with paddle like formations on one or both sides. the night of the event i saw huge crystiline ring around the moon at 4 am that night, and again the next morning around the sun. it was hard to sleep and i spent hours trying to research and rationalize what i had seen. i am nervous of reporting it, but also have to know if any one else has seen this. i have taken a few pictures of the contrails since and cary a camera now. please call if you need drawings and i will show a picture of a 1569 ezekiel bible drawing of a very similar occurance. to the 4

looked just like glass or mirror and reflected the streetlights,headlights and all from below,but it was glowing red in the center and on the bottom was a hole about 2ft. with a perfect flame coming

as if it was something that happened everyday. that was when i gave up, i mean i jumped into the car with the other five people i was with and we went south because it was one way on that side of the street and got down to the clearing in the medium to turn around and go north like the craft but it was bumper to bumper traffic and we basicly got ourselves stuck in traffic when the more intelligent thing to do would have been to follow on foot and walk under it and point it out to everyone in their car's and created a hundred or more witness's. it took me years to figure out how outragiously stupid we were for doing things the way we did, but were we being somehow controlled? were we all being involved in some kind of experiment under control of the army core of engineers or the c.I.A.  since 1970 everyone i have told this to, my parents, my friend's even a preacher, has said \"well, geez guy you better cut back on that stuff you been smokin'.\" i have gone through nothing short of a whole education about of what i tell people about these things.  that is i mean, the people that are so hard headed they would not believe in such things even if one landed in their front yard got out and offered the idiot's a tour of their ship!  i know beyond the shadow of a doubt that our government knows everything that is going on.  if we have sattelite's that can see everything going on on the ground (even in 1970 we had several hundred up there and alot of them were for domistic survalence, under president nixon) how could they not see something like this? the simple answer is they can and have and are.  i truely wonder, after hearing about some of the declassified records of the army corps. of engineers releaseing a pnoumonia virus in key west back in 1953 to test how it would effect the civilians as it was caried up the state by the breeze. if you check the records on the death's in 1952,(there were 2) then look at the ones in 1953,(there were 6) then compare it to the one's in 1954 there were 3. it has to make you wonder just what they are up to today. do you think they found a concience and don't do anything like that anymore? we can only pray! i think it is truely amazing that people capture u.F.O.'s on video and yet some people as thick headed as james oberg will still sit there with a straight face and say it is only mass halucination, it makes you wonder how much they pay him to make such a jack-ass of himself? anyway, if you have faith and the common sence god gave a centipede you will know to simply be calm for it will all be all right!\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

after it made its little turn, then i kind of lost track of it.\r\n\r\ni saw the object 15 minutes later as i was driving! it was basically just hovering around or moving very slowly, not in the same spot as previously, but not too far away.\r\n\r\n5) i thought it was amazing since i'm always so skeptical of things like this and i've never actually seen a really convincing ufo picture or video, and to see this thing in person was awesome. i wasn't afraid or anything, i don't believe it was aliens, most likely some sort of new us airplane. i almost didn't believe it until i saw it for a 2nd time 15 minutes later.\r\n\r\n6) the first time i lost sight, it had moved behind my car, and then it was just hard to keep up with. the 2nd time i was driving, and after a while it just moved to the side of me and i couldn't keep up","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

sight. at first i thought it might have been a helicopter's spot light, but there was absolutely no noise. plus it moved to fast to be a copter. i've spent the past two weeks going over & over it in my mind. and rechecking the sight out each day i'm at work. there are wire stantions and wires for powering the train and a expressway overpass in the area. but no obstructions were in the path this

march 9th, 2005, i ventured from near cedar city in s.Utah to groom lake, nevada, roughly 2 hours west.  it was not my first trip to area 51 and i had witnessed ufo's there several times before.  i went on a wednesday night as i had heard from various credible sources that wednesdays were the best nights to go as it was the middle of the week and there would be less precautionary measures taken to hide unidentified objects.  i navigated via a topographic gps to a location point on an open cattle range owned by steve medlin.  i watched three b-52 bombers circle groom lake behind the mountain range which stood in front of me until the sun went down.  i scanned the skies and oly saw the milky way and the stars and it was very dark that night.  about twenty minutes after sun down is when a spectacular event occurred.  first, let me tell you, i never saw them come in.  all of a sudden, they were just there.  there were multiple lights glowing heavy orange.  they appeared all around the sky, three hundred and sixty degrees.  they were as far away as the mountain tops bordering groom lake and as close as the valley floors in some directions.  they held their positions in the sky, but there were brilliant pulses of light coming from them.  when one of the objects pulsed at a certain intensity and number, the other objects stationed around the sky would mimic the same pulses.  i watched this happen for at least 20 minutes.  i had crawled out the window of my suv with my digital camera and was circling my vehicle, trying to get as many shots as i could of the event.  after each shot, i was clicking the dial over to view mode and reviewing my pictures so i could erase any pictures that did not take.  at one point, there was a flash of light behind me that illuminated my vehicle.  i turned around and saw one of the objects very close to me.  i estimated about 300 yards away.  it was a very bright orange color and it was only about 30 feet off the ground.  i have to admit, i felt very intimidated at this point.  i turned my camera toward the object and set the dial back to camera mode but the setting would not change.  i tried to turn the camera off in attempts to power cycle it, but it still remained stuck in the picture viewing mode.  i then witnessed the power locks on my vehicle trigger off and the doors locked by themselves.   luckily my window was still open.  at that point it seemed that somebody cancelled the show as all the objects dissapeared at once.  the weird thing was that when i looked up about 90 degrees, i saw about thirty pin points of light moving high above, somewhat eraticly, toward the east.  about one minute after that, i witnessed what appeared to be fighter jets with blinking tail lights and rumbling engines heading the same direction as if they were in pursuit of these objects, that by the way, were leaving them in the dust.  after they dissapeared, the sky was empty and i saw nothing for the remaining two hours.  let me add one more time that i never saw them come into view or leave view.  they were just, all of a sudden, there and then, all of a sudden, gone.  that's what gives me the creeps about the whole thing.  i get the impression that they might of been there the whole time, long before the sun went down but i could not see them.","distance":"21-100
