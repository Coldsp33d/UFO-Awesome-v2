live up on a hill on the border of golden and lakewood that overlooks denver and its suburbs to the north.  he knocked on the window for me to come and look at something.  i am a mufon investigator so i watch the skies often.  he pointed out a bright greenish light in the sky to the nne.  it was just sitting there perfectly still.  i thought it looked very strange so i grabbed my binoculars.  he then pointed out that there were actually 4 objects.  all of them were still.  that looked even more interesting so i grabbed my video camera.  once i got out there with the camera they began moving.  when i got my camera on them there were three left.  the forth had moved off to the east.  when i began video taping one object began to move off to the east, and one to the west.  the one to the west then came back moving to the east.  then while filming the remaining light, which was perfectly still, just its right and above it another light lit up.  form reviewing the video, it looks like it was there blinking dimly, then got much brighter and stopped blinking.  soon after, the bottom light lit up very brightly.  when it got very bright, it appeared like an angled disk shape.  it then began to move to the east like the rest and dim out.  all of them did this when they flew easy and as they got dimmer they also began to blink.  the remaining light did the same thing.  it began to get extremely bright, and then it began moving east.   here again it would get dimmer and begin to blink.  this can all be seen on the tape.  as it moved to the east, i noticed yet another light appear the same place the last one had appeared.  this one was dimmer and began move to the east blinking immediately.  when the tress got in the way i stopped filming.  however, we could see at least two of the light off in the distance over denver.  then after a few minutes they began to fade too dim to see.\r\n\r\nat this point i called the director of investigations to let him know what we saw.  that call was made at about 5:55. while on the call at about 6:15, my friend could see another light appearing in the same spot they had appeared before.  i got off the phone and went back with the camera, however right when i got the camera on it, it faded very dim.  my friend saw another one of them over denver that was lighting up very bright again.  again once i got the camera on it, it faded out.  because i thought they might be reacting to the camera i put it away.  a couple minutes later another light appeared where the others had.  this time, this one stayed still.  it looked like it actually was two light side by side.  as it sat there another light began to light just below it to the left.  the light appearing looked very disk shaped through the binoculars.  after 30 seconds or so as it finally seemed to be finished appearing or whatever it was doing and they both moved to the east.  one headed east over denver, the other seemed to keep a regular distance from us and moved in an arc to the east with us in the middle.  once it got due south of us, it just seemed to hover out there.  we then noticed one out over denver.  this one seemed to be east of downtown and it had two lights, one at either end.  it moved south and appeared very large for as far away it was.  i would say about half the size of a dime at arms length.  the light towards the front was brighter, and eventually the light at the back began to pulse.  it eventually dimmed out.  we could see one of the light heading east still, but after a couple minutes it began to get too dim also.  at this point the light to the south was no longer visible either.\r\n\r\nin total we saw nine of these objects and got seven on tape.  you can look for yourself, but it does not appear that these objects had the characteristics of any known craft.  the closest would be a helicopter, but that would not explain why some appeared to come out of no where, and why they seemed solid at first.  it also would not explain the apparent disk shape.  two other things i would like to note, although they seem extraordinary is that they seemed to react to being video taped, and they seemed to intentionally blink to mimic airplanes.  watch the video and see for yourself.  although this is a compressed version of the video i have posted.  i do have the original and i will show it at the next colorado mufon meeting.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

showers that are characteristically overheard. i was also very slow, unlike the fast streaking of a meteor. the color was a very bright amber color. it didn't look like a craft of any sort but i could tell that it had a \"ball\" or solid object at the head of it with a long tail streaming behind it. i couldn't help but notice it it was slow low to the horizon and bright. i even started looking at the drivers going past me to see if anyone was staring upwards towards the same area of sky. no one was...\r\n\r\nalso, after driving a bit after it happened, i pulled over at a meijers gas station

anonymous because of the seriousness of my sighting.  for many years i never mentioned it to hardly anyone.  trust me, i have now seen ufo's before, and i know that they are real.  my own story begins back when i was a young kid (around 14 years old-1969), and growing up in a small town named scottsville, kentucky.  my grandparents and i witnessed something extremely unusual and bizarre on one particular dark night.  that strange dark night changed my life forever, and i truly became a believer in what i thought was impossible.  we were sitting outside on my grandparent's front porch talking and such when i decided to go out into the yard and look around.  my grandfather was inside the house at the time.  my grandmother was outside with me sitting on the porch.  the sky was very dark that night, and no stars were visable anywhere.  after i had walked out into the front yard for a short distance, i just happened to look up into the night sky.  i was totally shocked to say the least at what i saw!  it was absolutely incredible.  hovering directly over my grandparent's house was this very large glowing football shaped disk.  the disk appeared to be about half the size of a football field-very large.  it was just hovering there silently with several colors of glowing lights all around it, and not making any sound at all.  it couldn't have been more than 20 feet above their house, and was over the tree tops not burning anything.  i yelled for my grandmother to come quick and see this \"thing\" for herself.  she came and was somewhat stunned too.  then we yelled for my grandfather to come outside and see this thing for himself.  he did so, and we all just stared in awe at what we were witnessing for close to ten minutes.  we even wondered if some being would come out of the saucer!  then, suddenly the object just simply disappeared as it took off so very swiftly-in the blink of an eye.  our local news covered the sightings of several of these mysterious disks that night observed all over scottsville and allen county.  a school friend of mine later on even informed me that his family saw five of them hovering over their farm pasture on that same night, and one of them actually landed for a short period of time.  the air force told us that what we had all seen was a meteorite.  funny thing is, i have never heard of a meteorite hovering over an area silently for over ten minutes, and then vanishing-and perfectly shaped like a large disk.  i am convinced that the craft that we saw that night was under some kind of intelligent control-alien control.  i think they may have even been trying to contact us in some way.  anyway, you have my story and it is the truth-every word of it.  i am a christian, and have no reason to lie about something like this because i know that it is important.  we are not alone!  to my surprise i found this out several years ago on that strange dark night way back in 1969 as a teenage boy.\r\n\r\nthank you-jonas

many people on this trip, it was only myself, my husband (at the time) and a good male friend of ours, still awake around the fire. we were discussing ufos, etc. and although none of us had ever had a sighting, i had mentioned a book that i had read that said one could request a \"fly by\". only seconds after my comment, my then husband pointed to the horizon. we, of course thought he was joking until we saw it too. just above the horizon hung a little ball of colorful light. in a blink of an eye, literally, it was right in front of us, just around 150 feet up and probably 400 feet across,triangular (somewhat elongated) and inky black except for the lights, and absolutely silent. \r\nthe lights were at the three corners and at one point were \"chasing\" like christmas lights (lighting one at a time in consecutive order).\r\nwe made a few comments to each other like\" i cant believe my eyes\" and \"oh my god..\"it then turned on its axis so we saw its profile. it was long and slim from the side. we could still see the lights, but of course instead of chasing in a triangle they were just going up and down (make sense?)\r\nafter about a minute and a half of this, it left at a 90 degree angle from which it came. again, it only took a second to get back to the horizon, but let me state, that we could see it go. it wasn't as if it disappeared then reappeared far away. the rest is important too, i think. we were of course speechless. i went to bed first, felt no fear, as a matter of fact, i felt extremely peaceful, and slept well.\r\nwe didnt speak of it the next day, or for another six months or so. i would think of it pretty often, but had no desire to talk about it. then one night it came out and the flood gates opened and the three of us remembered the

facility known as new jersey boystown. it was dinner time, and we lined up along side a chainlink fence to make the walk to the mess hall. the sky was clear and would soon become evening. as i remember there was a full moon to the left, and as i waited i just gazed at the moon. there appeared to be a speck come from the left side of the moon (seemed to come from behind the moon). that caught my attenntion right away, as the speck grew bigger and closer. in a matter of seconds it was a huge as a house right in front of me! now it took 40 years for me to think of this, but the object seemed as though it was moving at a speed far slower than i imagined...That is to say it seemed like it was 'flying' rather than tumbling to the earth. the object looked like a huge fireball, but more like an ember or like a piece of charcoal with darker shades of red where it was perhaps cooler. there was indeed lots of fire and a trail of smoke. the object moved from my left to right and it seemed 'guided' to me (again, not like it was tumbling to earth) i was 16 at the time and not told too many about it except my family. after the incident we talked about it in the mess hall, but most thought it was a meteor. i have a differing opinion these days. it took 40 years for me to make my own conclusion...Kecksburg rings loud in my ear these days...What else could it have been?? oh, and there was no sound coming from the object other than a hissing, but it was not loud. sometimes the smallest details elude you for a long time...But considering the moon is 186,000 miles away and the object was in front of me within seconds...How is that possible? if it were a meteor wouldn't it take longer to go that distance? well, there you have it...Something i have thought about for the last 40 years.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

night in this report, it was so clear i could easily make out several constellations, like orion in the night sky, from street level. \r\n\r\non the night of december 10th, 2005, at approximatly 10:34pm i was bringing in groceries from my car parked in front of my house. upon closing the car door with the last load of groceries in hand, i noticed three bright orange lights moving south accross the woodland sky. they did not have blinking lights like a typical aircraft, and their movement was very steady. i first noticed them because of their color, they matched the color of a streetlight, only smaller and farther away. they moved without formation at first, one leading the way, with another following slightly behind and farther below. the third followed from a much farther distance and was catching up to the first two lights. i watched in awe, i never thought i would see something like this, especially not in woodland. i followed them accross the sky as they moved now south west. the first two began to slow allowing the last light to catch up, it proceeded below the other two at approximatly the same vertical distance to the second light, as the second was to the first, but slightly ahead of the second light. they came to a complete and slow stop, and stayed in that formation for about 40 seconds. the lights were now evenly spaced, to each other and at a slight diagonal angle, angling south. then the 3rd light, the lowest one in the sky proceeded to move further south, but by very little, then stopped once more. i noticed accross the street one of our local teenager population walking down the block and called to him and pointed into the sky, he looked and asked what the fuck is that, to which i replyed, i don't know. he kept walking\r\n\r\nit was at this time that i had the sense to try and capture a photo on my cell phone. unfortunatly, the street lights, and overall low quality of my phone cam, yielded a picture with a fuzzy and completely black sky, no lights. so i immediatly called my father, my first call met with the typical \"i'm sorry the number you've dialed is no longer in service,\" so i hungup and tried again. this time i got him and told him to run outside now, because i was watching 3 ufo's in the night sky. \r\n \r\nwhile i was on the phone and watching the second light moved back north, making the light formation into a triangle in the sky. i was even more interested now, these were no aircraft, and no way in heck these were stars, sattelights, or otherwise, they had made a geometrical formation in the sky! \r\n\r\nthen something even more amazing happened. my eyes began tracking what looked like a slow moving man-made made its way across the sky, it had blinking lights that were very dim. it was heading north and slowly headed towards the center of the triangular shape formed by these lights. it passed through the middle of this triangle and about 1 second later, the second light, the northmost edge of the triangle shut off, it didn't zoom, blinkout, or flahs, it simply, shut off. it was followed about 3 seconds later by the third and most southern light. the 1st and most verticle light lingered for another 5 seconds before shutting off as well, leaving me with a black sky, no minimal or dim lighting replacing the locations of these lights, as if there would be if they were spotlights of some sort turning off. \r\n\r\ni don't know what these lights were. i don't think they were man-made because man made civilian or military aircraft operate with minimal hull lighting and with blinking lights on the wings and tailfins, this includes helicopters, this minimal hull lighting gives the appearance of very dim flashing lights slowly travelling accross the sky i saw no such blinking lights, and the orange lights were simply too bright to've been coming from the hull of such a craft. the color of these lights was suspect as well, they were the same rosy orange hue as a typical street lamp, but much farther away. while these lights were not blinding or illuminating to the ground or sky, they were easily bright enough for my peripheral vision to pickup when i first noticed them, which is pretty bright. i am not making a statement as to what they were with this, only a statement as to what i think they were not. if mufon or its members could find out what plane this may've been that i saw travel between these lights, or if anyone on that flight reported these odd lights, or if there were any helicopters travelling in a group of three with lights that match my description in the sky that night, it would go a long way towards easing my mind.

the sky.  this morning at 4:55 a.M. he observed a light coming from the west.  he said it was like a floating street light and was the orange-yellow color of street lights.  he watched it for what he thought was 2 to 3 seconds and estimated it covered 10 miles in that time.  he said it was round and it appeared to be reflecting the light color.  he knows where the airport is and said the light veered off course to miss the airport.  there was no sound.\r\n \r\nthen at 6:10 a.M. he saw it again.  this time coming from the east.  the description was the same except it appreared to have a headlight like he has seen on helicopters.  it was flying slower than an airplane or helicopter.  this time he could hear a low engine-like sound except it was pulsing or skipping a beat as it went.  it went all the way across the sky.  \r\n \r\nhe was not sure the two incidents were the same but appeared similar.\r\n \r\nhe would like to know if anyone else saw what he did, so i told him someone

description of object(s): \r\nthe object was glowing in a way. but i beleive it was just a metallic object, and the glowing was from the brightness of the engine reflecting off of the vessel. it looked that way because it was high in the sky. i could also see the reflection from the early morning fog, that there was one big head light on the front. this was not a plane. ive lived in fresno all my life and i have seen everything that can fly. and this was not something out of the ordinary. i know what i saw. thats why i am reporting this. this is completly true. its 7:00 am here in fresno. i just got done deleivering the paper. so this just happend. im sober. i deleiver the paper 7 days a week. and ive never seen this before on my route. the wierd thing was. is that i saw it twice. which i think is rare. i could also see that there was a dark spot on the center bottom of the craft. and you could hear the engine very quitly. it sounded like a low airplane engine, but with pauses in the sound pattern. \r\n\r\nsize of object(s): \r\nif you hold out your arm, close one eye, and hold a nickel in your two figers. it would be close to that same size and shape.

(the newspaper) i was almost done with the second street at the beging of my route. then all of a sudden i seen this ball of light in the sky behind me. it looked like a moving street light. it was orange. it moved about the pace of a slow helecopter. i had to stop and watch this thing in the sky for about three minutes. then it went out of sight. (about 10 miles in the distance). (second sighting) this time i seen it coming from the east of me on a street called spalding. this time i could focus more on the object. it was moving about the same pace. i watched it for about five minutes. but i seen more of the object this time. it just kept going til i couldnt see it anymore. it was staying about the same altitude. \r\n\r\ncan sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? \r\nsatellites dont have head lights. blimps dont glow. airplanes have blinking lights and are loud. if this was of the military then why was it so bright. i am not crazy. this is what i saw. if you want to know more please contact me. \r\n\r\nwitness background: \r\ni work for fresno bee. and i am going to start college this coming semester. \r\n\r\nviews on ufos, before and after sighting: \r\ni beleive that this whole ufo thing is a little more real than we think. \r\n\r\nreported sighting?

looked due west and spotted a jet that was near what looked to be a small orange dim star.  i thought briefly about it being one of those orange lights that i've seen but figured it was simply a star.  i was about to look away when it appeared to be moving along with the nearby jet (roughly 1/2 an inch away from it in the sky as viewed from the ground).  i thought that perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me and stood up to get a better view, away from the trees.  the \"star\" had pulled to roughly an inch away from the jet and was heading directly towards us, travelling due east.  i watched them both approaching for just a second more and called out to my husband.  he came outside and we watched this still dim orange light was being  pursued by a jet.  i told him to go inside and get my camera.  he went inside but couldn't find it (mother in law had moved it by the coffee pot in the kitchen). instead, he grabbed my father in law.  as this was going on, i was watching the orange \"star\" get closer and closer to us with the jet still pursuing but quickly falling behind.  by the time that my father in law and husband came back out, both aircraft were nearly above us and flying at a relatively low altitude.  the jet was about 5 inches behind the craft and we could hear the rumble of its engines and clearly see a contrail.  the craft that it was chasing was completely silent and had no contrail.  they were low enough that we could make out a dark underbody for the first craft.  all any of us could say was \"oh my god\" and \"oh ****\". it had a dim orange colored light towards the front with a second dimmer white light towards the middle.  i could see what appeared to be a whitish light at the rear of the craft.  we could make out a dim outline of the ship itself and it seemed to be narrower towards the front with a much wider back.  it was completely silent as it passed over and its lights were much dimmer than the flashing lights of the jet chasing it.  we watched it as both passed over our roof.  the last time i saw it, it was roughly 8 inches ahead of the jet(viewing from the ground) and then we couldn't see anything but the jet still following the same path.  we were all excited but scared, too.  we went back inside and all told my mother in law about what we all saw.  nobody wants to go outside again. i know that i was shaking like a leaf and

brightly white lighted, to watch the road farther southeast toward hwy. 115. i had called a friend by cellphone about whether to leave my roadgate unlocked. the persons using the rectangle aircraft were listening for radio in the area, and started the ball aircraft northwest, about 200 ft. up,with a trail of bright white electric fire behind it, and a thin white vapor trail behind that.  the ball aircraft went north of where i was, turned very sharply to the south, and stopped, hovering directly above my car and self. it dimmed down, looking smaller, so to look at it casually, one would think it was a somewhat large planet or star.  i didn't try videotaping or using cellphone. i calmly drove away along marvin rd. a family who rented my farm years ago stated that in the mid-to-late 1970s, several times they had seen lights of an aircraft go down in the woods to the southeast, and not come back up again. they had considered the possibility of dope-hauling aircraft, as some publicity had been started on what later was the iran-contra federal dope-running scandal. my seeing these 2 aircraft may be the first time anyone willing to speak up has done so. the u.S. started flying b-52 bombers on hazardously low practice through the area in 1980. the lack of complaints by area people, as so many have relatives in the armed forces, seems to have made this area desirable, with its isolation, by the persons using the rectangle large aircraft. i think we are facing ordinary sinful humans using tesla-type radio field-to-negative-static-electric-field multipurpose aircraft, able to act as a submarine-boat or aircraft or spacecraft. a tuning selection allows the aircraft to fly invisibly, with fraction-of-a-second repeated becoming visible to keep watch, but too fast for a casual watcher on the ground to notice.  that's why still cameras may get photos of these machines, while the photographer may not notice such at the time. it's like looking at an electric fan in motion. usually the blades are a blur.  using a strobe light in synchronization allows a series of flash views, each one showing the fan blades as if still, not in motion.  i am very displeased about this problem, as the radiation from these tesla-aircraft has caused severe mutation-type and direct injury environmental ruin in other parts of this nation; an example is rock creek hollow, west virginia, where various soil fungi and bacteria have mutated and attacked the root systems of forest trees, including black walnut, white oak, and mulberry.  if your members will use degaussing-field protective suits, it prevents tesla-aircraft from causing radio-field temporary knockout, paralysis of arms and legs, or dizziness and a very strong feeling of fear.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Louvres","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

bonnet of my car. my car was facing a large area of open space in the park.  it was a warm night, and there was very little breeze.  \r\n\r\ni was just gazing around, when, over the tree tops, this, initially what i thought was a jet, slowly glided over the tree line. i watched for a few seconds, and became curious. so i walked towards the path it was taking.  it was strange, because i seemed to walk a fair distance before it reached the are above me but dont really remember the passing of time that well.\r\n\r\nupon apporaching it, i assumed it was a military jet, but the nearer i got, i realised there appeared to be no windows, there were no lights. i stopped as the craft went over head( and bear in mind this is only about 100 - 150 feet above me) and there was a pattern, which i can remember to this day.  it was going so slowly, it may have even hovered, i half expected to feel some wind when underneath it, but nothing. \r\n\r\nthere was no noise either and no lights, as the craft moved on, i looked at the back of it, there was nowehere for the fuel to escape from, no vapour trail, nothing, just a black \"side\" to its rear.  it was just flying with no visible means of staying up.  i can remember feeling cold, as it moved away, again so slowly that i probably could have ran after it. \r\n\r\nit glided over the trees and then out of sight completely. i can remember feeling stunned by it, it wasnt until i got up close that i thought that this might be something out of the norm.\r\n\r\nafter i returned to my car, which seemed to take a lot longer than when i walked to have a look at the object. i gazed around, and my curiosity was then further aroused as there seemed to be about half a dozen helicopters in the distance all hovering around the area (i would guess the radius was several miles) the choppers werent frantic, but i just remember that there was quite a few of them. \r\n\r\nthe only other thing i remember, was, if you think of a shooting star speeding across the night, in the distance i saw a light shoot off into the sky, from more of an earthbound location into the sky and a gradual angle.\r\n\r\ni can remember not feeling scared or nervous at all, throughout the whole thing, i just remember being intrigued. upon lookng back, i was probably mad to walk towards it, but i felt no fear, nothing. the temperature drop was strange.\r\n\r\nseveral things confused me, firstly that i was very close to heathrow airport (no more then 10 miles away) i dont remember walking towards the object properly, although i must have done. it seemed to move so slowly and so quietly. the pattern on the underneath wasn't that involved, but not necessary for a craft at all.\r\n\r\nafter the event, i looked some info up, and found that black triangles were a relatively common occurance, although the one i saw seemed to differ slightly.\r\n\r\nit is something that happened that i will never forget, and it is still very clear in my head what happened that summer evening. \r\n\r\ni hope this helps your database.","distance":"101-500

approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. to the nne, i could see what i thought was an aircraft headed south at approximately the same relative altitude as the rising moon from my ground perspective. the bright white light which appeared to be the same intensity as a small aircraft's and about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, also appeared to have red light in a halo effect around the white light but at a greatly reduced size and barely discernable from the white light.  i estimated the \"aircraft\" to be approximately ��� mile away from me based on numerous other aircraft sightings over the years of airplanes flying overhead en route to our local airport.\r\n\r\ni watched the \"aircraft\" for approximately (1) minute and realized that it's lateral speed was slowing and it was now turning further west towards my location which could account for the illusion of it slowing down.  although it still had the red halo effect, i realized that it was not an aircraft rotating beacon or navigation light.  i then called to my wife and twenty year old son to come outside and we watched for (1) minute more as the object began to slowly weave left to right and began to drop in altitude. the white light dimmed slightly and then it suddenly dropped what appeared to be (3) red fragments much like flares dropped by jet fighter aircraft.  the object zig-zagged left to right and still continued to drop in altitude headed south.  it emitted (3-4)red fragments and appeared to turn due east.  its size continued to reduce which led me to believe it was moving away from me.  it was also appeared to reduce in size every time it emitted the fragments.  it finally disappeared altogether which left my family and i, awe struck.\r\n\r\ni have been a patrol sergeant with a local law enforcement agency for almost twenty years and have observed several missile launches from vandenberg afb which is approximately (200)miles se of me.  the launches leave a visible smoke trail from my town and sometimes i can see the booster separations and engine burns, if the sky is clear.  i have also observed dozens of space junk re-entries, satellites including iridium flares, and orbiting spacecraft, but i have never seen an object perform as this one did tonight.  it went from controlled navigation to weaving like a drunk driver and then straighten itself back out in seconds.  i have seen jet aircraft drop flare counter measures before and they have a systematic ejection, controlled decent and separation.  these fragments did not.  \r\n\r\ni have a navel air station approximately (30) miles west of me and fa-18 hornets fly overhead day and night.  they are flying over to the china lake and nellis afb test ranges, so i'm accustomed to the sounds they make, the navigation lights they have and the speeds they transit our airspace at. this object had no sound and from the estimated distance and the fact that it was after 2300 hours, it was quiet.  there was no sound, no explosion, no smoke and unlike anything i had ever experienced before in real life.\r\n\r\nwe believe it was a ufo.   \r\n\r\n
