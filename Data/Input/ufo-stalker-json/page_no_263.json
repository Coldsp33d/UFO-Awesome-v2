States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The time was about 9-9:30a.M, it was a cool, clear, sunny march morning with magnificent blue skies and good long-distance visibility. i was sitting at my kitchen table on the computer in the relatively open dining room/kitchen area with the bright skies lighting up the room. i heard a low-flying jet aircraft likely an airliner entering or exiting the pattern at boston-logan international airport (about 40 miles to the north of my house), it seemed slightly louder and more high-pitched than most of the usual modern airliners with high-bypass turbofan engines or acoustic liners and more like the older low-bypass turbofan engines on aircraft such as the md-80 series (or historically the boeing 727), the aircraft sounded lower too than usual, noting the high-pitched sound i suspected that it may not have been an airliner but possibly a air force reserve c-5a galaxy of the 439th airlift wing at westover air force reserve base out on a training sortie, as the last of the older c-5a models (all based at westover as this report was written) is due for decommissioning the before the end of 2017 my interest was peaked and i jumped to the window to get a glimpse of the aircraft. i looked into the bright blue skies but realized the airplane i heard had already passed out of view over my house, instead my eyes caught sight of something else much higher. the object appeared to be a shiny silver or grey metallic color but i am unsure if this was its actual color or just the sunlight reflecting off of it, it had the color and glint of an airliner at cruising altitude but unlike an aircraft i could clearly not see any wings or tailplane/horizontal stabilizers on the object and it produced no contrail, it was an oval, oblate, or rounded cigar shape to it with no visible appendages. i rushed out to my front porch to continue watching the object, it continued a very constant and swift path towards the south or southwest at an altitude i could not accurately determine but would guess to be in the realm of 30-35,000 feet maybe 40,000 or more depending on the size of the objects, i could not determine the size of the object due to the lack of a reference point or any surrounding objects and its sheer distance, its speed also seemed faster than that of a widebody airliner at cruising altitude (slightly). the object produced no sound however it could have been drown out by the sound of the low-flying airliner (which i could see/hear had departed to the east and i believe was most likely an airliner in the md-80 series or potentially an airbus a320 with the rolls-royce turbofans) i continued to watch the object as it continued farther from my field of view still shiny and reflective and fast, i could not photograph the craft accurately because i did not have an advanced lens camera at my disposal, only an iphone 5 which takes notoriously blurry and indistinguishable photos of far away objects. i considered running back into the house to look for my binoculars but at the rate the craft was moving out of sight it was apparent that it would most likely be out of sight by the time i came back outside with the binos. the ordeal lasted no more than 2 and a half minutes as the shiny, wingless, featureless oval continued out of sight before being obscured by trees and the horizon. as an avid aviation enthusiast with solid eyesight who frequently watches the skies for civilian and military aircraft and is skilled with identifying aircraft i can say that this did not resemble a conventional aircraft as it had no visible external features (wings, engines, horizontal stabilizers, vertical stabilizers or other aircraft parts that are clearly visible on large commercial airliners and military aircraft at cruising altitude) and also the craft did not produce a contrail at all although its reflection from the sun was similar to that on aircraft at similar altitudes. i don't know if the craft could have been a satellite as its trajectory was similar to one however as far as i know satellites in orbit or space stations are not visible during daylight hours (let alone in the bright sunlit late morning sky) it appeared to be too large and high-altitude to be a normal drone of some sort and the crafts identity and origin is still puzzling to me. in the years of watching the skies i have very rarely seen something i cannot identify or explain although there have been a few occasions in and around the area of plympton, ma and surrounding towns i have noticed very high, small, silver or shiny objects during bright cloudless days on at least 3-4 occasions before this, they usually appear to be at an incredible altitude with an indefinable shape due to the distance and are either entirely stationary or moving at a relatively slow pace in its position, this object was similar to those instances in its reflective nature but appeared to be moving at a more rapid and constant pace with more of a definable shape and if i were to guess it appeared to be somewhat lower. i will continue scanning the local skies, now with good binoculars at hand and will continue to report further sightings if they are to occur and try to get photo/video the next time around.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"One summer evening in the early 1990s (i do not recall the exact month or year), my wife and i were in our back yard just after sunset, lying on chaise lounges and waiting to see how soon we could see the first star in the waning light.  this was in erdenheim, pa, a residential suburb just north of philadelphia.  to aid in our quest, i had with me a pair of 14x70 astronomical binoculars that i had often used to explore the night sky as an amateur astronomer.  the sky was clear and the evening was windless and quiet.  while scanning the sky near the zenith, and before any stars became visible, i noticed a tiny dark shape directly overhead, silhouetted against the fading sky.  it was semicircular in shape (like a half moon), did not reflect any glint of sunlight despite its apparent great altitude (seemingly high enough to have been still in direct sunlight), and did not exhibit any lights or contrail.  there was no sound.  as i watched it for a minute or so, i observed that it was moving very slowly southward, in the direction of its curved end.  i told my wife what i was seeing and handed the binoculars to her; she had no difficulty finding and tracking it.  for the next 10-15 minutes, we continued to pass the binoculars back and forth, watching it.  as we watched, it maintained its slow speed in a curving path of constant radius that eventually completed a 90-degree left-hand turn toward the east.  it rotated as it flew, such that its curved end was always pointing in the direction of its motion.  without nearby reference points, it was difficult to estimate its size, altitude, or speed with any precision.  however, assuming it to be of a similar size as conventional aircraft, it was much higher than any commercial airliner, and moving much too slowly to have been sustained aloft by conventional aerodynamic lift.  my estimate at the time was that it was well above 40,000 feet and moving less than 50 mph.  although distinctly visible as a dark shape at 14x magnification (though with no structural details visible), it was too high to see at all with the unaided eye.  after 10-15 minutes, we stopped watching it and turned our attention back to stars that were finally beginning to emerge; it had become increasingly hard to track the object in the darkening sky and its slow consistent flight had become tedious to watch.  it was not an unpowered balloon, because of its curved flight path and its shape (squared off at the back and moving in the direction of its short axis).  it was not a helicopter, because it was much too high and silent, as well as lacking navigation lights and having the wrong shape for any helicopter.  it was not a bird, because there was never any flapping of wings and, again, the shape was wrong for a bird, with no visible head, neck, or tail.  it was not a conventional aircraft, because of its extremely slow speed and the lack of any navigation lights, as well as the lack of any sound or contrail.  it was not a dirigible, because of its shape and the fact of its motion in the direction of its short axis; also, propeller-driven dirigibles do not cruise in the stratosphere.  we assumed it might have been some classified experimental aircraft, especially given our proximity to the willow grove naval air

she had no difficulty finding and tracking it.  for the next 10-15 minutes, we continued to pass the binoculars back and forth, watching it.  as we watched, it maintained its slow speed in a curving path of constant radius that eventually completed a 90-degree left-hand turn toward the east.  it rotated as it flew, such that its curved end was always pointing in the direction of its motion.  without nearby reference points, it was difficult to estimate its size, altitude, or speed with any precision.  however, assuming it to be of a similar size as conventional aircraft, it was much higher than any commercial airliner, and moving much too slowly to have been sustained aloft by conventional aerodynamic lift.  my estimate at the time was that it was well above 40,000 feet and moving less than 50 mph.  although distinctly visible as a dark shape at 14x magnification (though with no structural details visible), it was too high to see at all with the unaided eye.  after 10-15 minutes, we stopped watching it and turned our attention back to stars that were finally beginning to emerge; it had become increasingly hard to track the object in the darkening sky and its slow consistent flight had become tedious to watch.  it was not an unpowered balloon, because of its curved flight path and its shape (squared off at the back and moving in the direction of its short axis).  it was not a helicopter, because it was much too high and silent, as well as lacking navigation lights and having the wrong shape for any helicopter.  it was not a bird, because there was never any flapping of wings and, again, the shape was wrong for a bird, with no visible head, neck, or tail.  it was not a conventional aircraft, because of its extremely slow speed and the lack of any navigation lights, as well as the lack of any sound or contrail.  it was not a dirigible, because of its shape and the fact of its motion in the direction of its short axis; also, propeller-driven dirigibles do not cruise in the stratosphere.  we assumed it might have been some classified experimental aircraft, especially given our proximity to the willow grove naval air station, and therefore gave it no further thought – although i did always wonder whether experimental aircraft (even those flying well above commercial air lanes) were required to display navigational lights, especially after dark.

sob, that's a flying saucer.  it was the standard traditional ufo that is portrayed in the movies, to include lights around the center of a saturn shaped huge vehicle that was hovering , just north of us in the approximate vicinity of the henderson industrial complex..  we watched it hovering silently for about 5 minutes, when it started to slowly heading west, down lake mead blvd.  i suggested getting my car keys to follow it.  i ran inside, & wife said, never mind, because it took off at a tremendous speed & was quickly over black mountain & disappeared. no sonic boom, no sound at all.  we were unaware of any aircraft that was capable of that kind of performance.\r\nmy wife called the air force to report the sighting & was basically thanked, with no further action necessary, as i cynically expected.  she also called the henderson police & reported the sighting.   the next day there was an article in the newspaper that a henderson policeman driving east on lake mead blvd

summertime. i woke up to flashing lights and the dog barking at something, and i thought at the time it was like police lights outside, the bedroom, so i looked outside. i saw a cylinder shaped object in the front yard, with bright multicolored flashing lights and spinning around the top in a circle. it was hovering, close to the ground if i were to guess now probably 10 feet off of the ground, and i remember a strange buzzing noise. my brother was sleeping in the same room, so i tried to see if he was awake but he didn't wake up. time was very slow, almost like everything stopped, but i could still move. i saw a bright white light coming from the hallway, in the room my brothers group home mother slept in. the light was so bright almost like a big spot light almost blinding, and i thought i was dreaming, and being curious i walked over toward the door to see what the bright white light was down the hall. what i saw i will never forget ever in my lifetime. i saw a tall dark skinny almost human shaped body, figure come out of the room and stand by her doorway, it was not dressed it had no clothes, no genitals, it had dark charcoal grey skin, long fingers but it only had two or three fingers. the figure had a strangely large head, no hair, but the shape of the head was round with a point on the top. i remember the dark black eyes the most like black mirrors, that where teardrop shaped, they slanted up on the right and left side and they did not close, it also didn't have a nose, just 2 small slits below the eyes and a small mouth. i stood there trying to figure out what i was seeing and it stared at me. then i saw 2 more and they looked at each other, they didn't speak or make any noises at all, and then they started walking toward me, at first i froze, i was so scared, i panicked. is all i could think to do was to run, so i  turned around and jumped on my bed, and put the covers over me and crawled into a ball, and closed my eyes, i was shaking so bad, i prayed that it was only a dream, and that they would not come. i don't remember anything after that. \r\ni also remember i wasn't scared at the site of the first alien it kept tilting its head while it was looking at me, i was trying to understand what i was seeing, and i was curious as we just stared at each other for about 1-2 minutes about 8 feet away from each other, i did have the urge to walk towards it but never did, something initially was comforting to me, i cannot explain that feeling. it seemed to somehow report to the others without talking that i was awake and that is when they came. i did get spooked when the other two of them came towards me, and i remember not feeling the same way about them, i felt an uncomfortableness with them. i remember feeling like time stopped or slowed in some way, and everything around was completely oblivious to what was happening around me. \r\nthe part that i find odd was that the group home mother later had tumors, and deceased because of them. i always wondered if that was the cause, or if they were there to help her. i have only shared this story with 2 people, only because i don't know what to make of it. i usually questioned myself if it was just a dream, but i can remember everything, the feeling, the lights, slow movements, the encounter, the fear. i of course do not have any evidence also another reason for not really discussing it with anyone because i thought people would accuse me of making it up.

the object wasnt flying, it was hovering. thats when i noticed that it wasnt making any kind of sound.. we all 3 noticed, although i could hear them talking and freaking out, i couldnt help but to stare in awe.. it was a solid object that was about 30 feet away from us.. it was a large black triangular object with red and white lights, sometimes orange. the weirdest part about this and what made me finally decide to report this. is im missing time. im not for sure if an 'abduction' happened but i remember watching this object, but the next thing i remember is being in the car and driving away from the lake... i dont recall ever even getting inside the car or driving away in a hurry for that manner.. i have dwelled on this for years, i didnt know what else to do.. everybody that ive told about this, acts as if im making this up or im going crazy.. so i thought maybe you guys might read this with more of an open mind.. i know what i saw and it was unlike anything ive ever seen in my life..","distance":"21-100
