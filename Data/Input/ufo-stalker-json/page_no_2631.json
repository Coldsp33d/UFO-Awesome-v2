neighbor who retired from the air force a few years ago with 24 years of service. at that time he was the person in charge of maintaining the planes. i started to tell him about what i had saw back in aug. when he stopped me and said he had heard this story before. he told me about a friend of his that had worked under him before he retired. this person is still active and does not want anyone to know who he is which is why i am making this report. my neighbor had his friend call me so that he could tell me what had happened. after talking on the phone for a few moments he asked if i had time to meet with him so he could tell me face to face.  i met with him yesturday sunday dec. 4. he said that he was in his yard taking pictures of his daughters birthday party when one of the kids noticed these two lights coming towards them and pointed them out to him. the kid asked what kind of planes they were. when he looked up at them he frist thought that the one in the front was a police helo with its search light on. then he relized that there was no beam coming from it. as they got closer he could see that the first one was not any type of aircraft that he knew of. he started to take some pictures of it when it suddenly shot up and out of sight. he did get two pictures of it just as it turned. after that he watch the second light coming towards him and it turned west towards the air force base. when it did he could see it was an a-10. the next day he spoke to the pilots that had been on duty and said he spoke to the one that was flying the a-10. a couple of hours later they were called to the base commanders office. when they got there they were told not to talk about this with anyone. they were told, in short, that doing so would be a very bad carrier move. he then gave me the two pictures that he took and said do whats right but don't give anyone my name. i agreed and he left. i have the two pictures if you tell me where i will mail them to

(the light was like a very bright spotlight -like the ones in ny that shine up to the sky from the wtc site)this aircraft flew to and then away from the object heading south while still having it's light shining from the rear.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I and my spouse were driving home from sacramento,ca. to our home in walnut grove,ca.We were talking about her work and how her day and night went.I was driving our car and my spouse was sitting on the passinger side,we were just past the elk grove blvd exit,going south toward the twin cities exit that we take to get home.Suddenly terri my spouse said to me, geez look at those lights in the sky,they were off to my left and quite large,then she said they seem to be flying in some sort of formation,at this point i made an effort to look but only at intervials because it was hard to drive and look.The size and brightness was what first made her notice them. not long after she saw the lights we realized that they were extreamly larger than anything else in the sky,including stars.  other aircraft were visiable off in the distance and these lights were huge in comparison to them,and didn't really look like conventional passinger airplanes. then we realized that these lighs were in some sort of formation,at that point terri said maybe they are military,going to travis airforce base.But as she kept looking it became obvious that what ever these lights were they were not ordinary airplanes. she finally said they are in the form of a triangle,how strange,at that point we realized that the distance between these lights covered a huge area they were much further apart then we realized. we saw no blue,red or any other kinds of blinking lighs on them as on the aircraft we normally see all the time at night.This object covered a huge area of the night sky,they it didn't seem to be moving and we thought it was hovering,and if it was moving it was at a what seemed to be a very slow speed. what caught our attention next was the fact that there were no stars visable in the triangle itself,the reason for this observation was that the rest of the sky was literally filled with stars,it was a very clear nite no clouds of any sort u could see for miles without any trouble what so ever. we really were not alarmed because we had seen many strange objects in the sky when we lived in sonoma ca. a number of years before,in fact we would sit outside in lawn chairs with several of our friends and talk,so we did think it was strange but we really were not alarmed at that time. but terri continued to watch it until we were on twin cities rd , she would have had to turn clear around to keep looking at this triangle,and it was hard to do in our car.So we started to joke about it and terri said i don't really need any aliens in my life at this time ,and i laughed and said well we will stay off of their turff and they can stay off of ours. we continued to drive toward home and ever now and again she would look to see where this thing was ,at some point she either quit looking or she couldn't see it we really arn't sure which it was. then when we arrived home,we told our oldest daugher (she and her 11 yr old daugher live with us)about the this thing we had seen .Our daughter kind of stopped in her tracks because shortly before we arrive home our 11 yr old grand daugher and one of her friends who lives a  couple of houses down from us, came and told her about the u.F.O.They had seen shortly before and they said it freaked them out(their exact words)to the point that they ran into her house and were scared to go out to look at it again, our daugher kind of sluffed it off ,thinking they had just seen stars or airplans and were stretching the story as kids that age sometimes do. they told her it was in the shape of a huge traingle and didn't make any noise ,they said it was moving but not really fast and not really slow (again their words).But they didn't try to look for it again because it scared them. so when she said to us oh my god that is what whitney and her friend just had told her a short time before all three of us kind of stopped and thought ,now just what was it we saw? we talked about it for a little while and told her all that we had seen, we just kind of looked at each other and said well maybe it was a u.F.O. i had seen what i thought was a u.F.O. when we lived in sonoma but they were different .I had seen a huge white light suddenly appear over some rather large mountins (it was in the shape of a triangle but the size of it was absolutly mind boggling to me and it disappered as fast as it appered like when u turn on a light switch an the lights are on then u flip the switch and they are off)it was only visabel to me for a min.And maybe not that long it was really quick.Terri and i talked a little more about it but she was exausted and wanted to go to bed .I ended up staying up all night playing on my computer and talking to friends about this,but i wasn't scared or anything like that just really courious.I had been fascinated with the subject for years but when we moved from sacramento i kind of became kind of complacent about the subject.But after i started to really think about our experience,i thought you know maybe we should tell someone about this and see if there were any others that seen this thing, hence this monologe (sorry i seem to be going  on and on  about it)and our decision to report this incident. thank you for having this place on the internet where i could report it. i have also called a man who belongs to mufon and lives in truckee,ca.I left a message on his answering machine ,left him a short rundown of this sighting, and hope he will return my call at some point . but i thought maybe it would be a good idea to report it to you also. thank you for your time. my name is mary-aileen logan and my partner is terri logan.Hope you can maybe give us an idea what this is all about .

it didn't move, drift, rise or fall, and being sure it wasn't a helicopter, i ran for my binoculars (10x30's). when i got back, it was still there. through the glasses, it resolved into a perfect sphere. then, to my amazement, a passenger jet (on its normal approach to lax) flew right at the object, banking hard to its left, and behind it, so i could see it in perfect relief. from my view, the object appeared to be 2/3 the height of the jet's fuselage, making it about 20' in diameter. the object began to slowly rise straight up, taking about a minute to disappear. i went to the store, met someone else who'd seen it, and after marketing, looked up to see four military jets streaking back and forth in the sky where the object had been. nice

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My self and a longtime friend were travelling east on highway 32e about 12-15 miles outside ashdown, ar. i was driving, when i noticed an aircraft flying fairly low, to the east n-e. i though at the time time it seemed to be flying kinda slow but didn't pay to much attention to it. we travelled a few miles further down the highway, when we turned south on l.R. 33. about 1 mile down this road the aircraft became visible, after having lost sight due to trees. at this point, neither me or my friend have said anything about it. this particular road is  approximately 3 miles long. the whole time we're both watching this \"plane\". i'm becoming increasingly worried about the \"unnatural\" speed of the craft at this point. it moved similar to the speed of an ultra-lite glider. keep in mind that we are in thick woods, dirt roads (for the most part), \"deer country\" as we call it. after travelling to the end of l.R. 33 we turned left onto red bluff road, at which point, we lost site of the craft due to trees. we travelled approximately 2-3 miles and turned right onto l.R. 31. it was at this point that we could see the object much closer. this was also the point in which my fried turned to me and asked \"what the f--- is that!?\" we continued to head south on l.R. 33 watching this thing when trees would allow an unobstructed view, which was quite often. the road is windy and at one point it pretty much straightens out. from this vantage point we could see the craft well. it had lights on it sort of like a plane, but they didn't look like a planes lights. the bulbs i mean. it was shortly after watching for some seconds and coming to the realization that this thing could not stay aloft in the air at this rate of speed, i told my friend \"some thing's shouldn't be messed with\", and turned around in one of the few driveways. as i started to drive back the way we came, i looked in my rearview mirror and seen the craft come out above the trees about 15-20 yards and stop above the road. giving in to my own curiosity, and my friends plea's, i turned and went back. about 1/4 mile from where i had turned around there is a bridge. we stopped on the bridge and turned my honda crx off, and rolled down the windows. the craft was still just sitting over the road. we listened but heard absolutely no sound whatsoever from this craft. my friend is an avid deer hunter and estmated the distance to be about 300 yards, straight in front. i would also add that this was a beatiful starry evening and a almost, if not full, moon (i remember the conditions distinctly). this was the first chance that we had to make out the lights. they flashed sequentially like an airplane would, but they were not \"placed\" in such a way. they would flash from right to left. blue, white, red. we couldn't make out the shape of the craft, but it must have been 30-50 feet long, if i had to guess. we watched it for about 2-2 1/2 minutes. the whole time the craft sat motionless, soundless. it started to bother me, because i started thinking that maybe the craft was coming toward us at the same incredibly slow speed it was travelling at and it just appeared to be sitting there. but the lights never got bigger, or smaller and never moved from side to side once it stopped. it appeared to just stop in mid-air for a prolonged period. i manuvered my honda back around, and we left. with it still sitting there, despite my friends objections. i just didn't feel comfortable driving any more near it. i can't speculate what it was in fact, but i do know that it is the only thing that i can honestly say just did not belong there. that's the best way i can describe it. this area also has a history unexplained craft. thanks for your time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

this to you. these lights often appear, my mother has been witness to this as my brother has and his girl friend. these lights are most unusual not like regular fcc aircraft lights not strobe, or red or blue or bright white but amber and large not too bright; only ps craft are completley silent twice have i seen these lights move befor fading out they are most probably not flairs as they do not asend or desend but move horazontaly across the sky at a very low altitude about 8 oclock to the horizion  these lights should be investigated you will not be dissapointed! if you have any out here please chk it out all my sightings are consistant 3 or more large amber lights, same pattern ,these lights stand out from all other aircraft -no craft is visable carrying lights but i once saw them make about a 160 dgr. turn in wich a three light triangle went from a still position of about 20 mnts. to this turn all lights moved in unison as if connected then flew due south as far as my vew was not obstructed all on a paralel plane and moved  very slow this was at about the 7oclock vew of the horrizion and probably no more than a couple of miles due west of our back yard near the sighting tonight.Ie. from the spacing of the lights that moved this craft seemd to be at least the size of a football field no smaller i am a landscape artist and am a very good judge o0f distance from most vews in my area i also had many points of reffence even though it is mostly very rural and dark at night as ther are freeway lights and powerplant lights and various housing developments scatterd about and small mountians powerlines and a small airport about 20 miles due north of here wich disperce many small aircraft inwich i can obtain a visual relationship of flying craft i cannot give an altitude but only the relationship between the lights and the normal aircraft that is seen regularly,ie.Cropdusters, fixedwing highaltitude,helo.Ether comercial but mostly border patrol wich none of look anything like these large amber lights. these lights appear so often that i have only reported them twice as a collective. but have seen them on at least 6 diffirent occasions.Mostly because on those times i looked or at least was trying to be aware if any should appear i probably will not report the next sight unless it is remarcable in some way all of my sightings that i have seen are not aircraft that iam acustomed to seeing and do not have proper lighting no strobr not red not blue nor bright white nor do thes lights remain lit for a very long period of time always appearing on low

sw, where they dropped from sight.  again, total silence.\r\nas i recall, our reaction was mostly one of curiosity, and we were wondering what it was that we had just seen.\r\ni still wonder what it was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then

the object approx. 300 ft. over my home, directly between the light of the moon and my view. i saw the object from the leading edge, the silouette, and the trailing edge. this was an evening of a leoonoid meteor shower, so i origannally went out to see if i could see any shooting stars.I knew what it was because of the distance between the object and the roof of my house. it moved extremely wierd like dipping in the front like it was falling off a cliff then instantly the back would dip just as quickly. the bottom surface was dimpled as though it had been struck by different sized meteors. it was like lookin at the surface of the moon. the dimples had plumes or splash marks. the only sound i heard was a light wind and it was from normal wind. i yelled inside to my wife @ the time and called her outside. she was really nervous and went in and locked me out on her way in. i knocked and asked her to come witness the object as it moved over our home and all the way down a 7 mile plain behind our old house. the object even though it was hard to focus on because of the vibrating but seemed to be moving at like 3-4 miles an hour extremely slow across the field but hard to focus on still. ifor the next few weeks i was actually just wierded out, i couldnt believe i had seen one so close up. i could even see that it had small round portals flush on its fusalage.The object seemed pearlglow from the bottom view and leading edge, it glowed like psydellic tera cata from the trailing edge, like it was boiling steel.It finally dipped behind some trees. this thing was like the size of ahouse, floating through the air. the wierdest thing ive ever seen. i still know exactly what i saw ,could not have been anything else. made the hair on my arms stand straight up.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line
