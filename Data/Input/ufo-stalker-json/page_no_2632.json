\r\nlocation - sunderland, uk \r\nshape of craft - 2 light balls or cigar craft \r\ndirection coming from - east \r\ndirection going to - west \r\nother aircraft around at the time - military jet before and after sighting. \r\naltitude - the height of a two story house \r\nsize - the two balls of light were the size of two beach balls put together. \r\nshort description - two balls of light seen flying (same height) at a low altitude. \r\n\r\naccount of events - i was outside on the night of november the 18th i was sky watching i have been sky watching for nearly the hole month of november on the night i decided to do the watch not from the front of the house but in the back garden i took my usual equipment out with me and set up my things such as camera, torch etc��� and was ready to have a good sky watch. my friend was with me for about 30 minutes he saw a shooting star or a possible satellite fly across the sky he sighted this for about 3 seconds two days before i saw a very similar thing the night continued and we saw nothing else. my fried was then picked up by his parents at 19:00 on the night i went back to sky watch. i was watching for 15 minutes and recorded no events. but then at 19:23 i saw two lights fly across the sky i was in utter shock because the thing was so low in the sky it was only the height of a two story building it had not engine noise what so ever that is another thing that really startled me about it i watched for about 20 seconds as it flew past i quickly acted and ran down two stairs that leave off the patio and then i had to get up a flight of 8 stairs these are stairs because it is a house that was built on a slope so there are stairs down to the garden which is a very strange layout. i got up the stairs and got my camera ready i saw the two lights as it past out of sight behind a tree. there is a massive double gate at the top of the stairs and it is chained it is chained because we have recently been getting burglars attempting to get into the garage and steal like they are known to do i pulled endlessly on the chain but it was no use it just would not come on i am not sure if this is due to the cold temperature and the chain was stuck on by ice or frost or something along those lines but it would not come off. i ran down the stairs and round to the other set of stairs which is at the other side of the garden and is a very long way away i got up those stairs but when i got up the stairs there was nothing at all to be seen. but i am 100% sure this is a ufo it could not be identified i just do not know what the hell it could be. \r\n\r\nmilitary fighter \r\n\r\nthis is one thing that is really odd about the sighting i think the government could be chasing this thing as before the sighting i saw a military jet go over which is unusual for that time of night i heard the roar that fighters make and it flew overhead leaving a trail that fighters commonly made it had all red lights flashing and all the other lights were on and it went off into the distant in a southerly direction then a few minutes later was when i saw the ufo go toward the east then about 2 minutes after the sighting the fighter (possibly the same one) came back and went off to the east it think it was the same because it had all the same lights on it. so i think the government could have possibly been chasing this thing. \r\n\r\ni have attached a drawing of the ufo (picture 1)\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nthe location the ufo past (picture 2)\r\n\r\nif anyone reading this wants to contact me about this please contact me

eyes.  we didn't say anything at first because we thought it was merely an aircraft of some sort, but the light was so bright. the light seemed to have been several miles away then suddenly and unbelievably fast the object was within 100' from our car.  i almost hesitate to describe the object because it was so much like all the stories you hear of flying saucers but the craft seemed to be oval shaped and there were windows all the way around the side and you could see light inside the windows.  the bright light that we saw originally was coming from under the craft as it hovered beside our car. then in an instant, as quickly as it appeared, it dissapeared back over the horizon.  my husband and i were so shaken that we pulled the car over to discuss what we had just witnessed.  we both had seen the same thing but could not explain it. my husband and i are devowed christians and have no reason to fabricate such a story.  i would simply like to speak with someone with the hopes of better understanding what we saw that evening. what stands out in my mind so was the intensity of the light from beneath the craft, there is just no way to describe to you how bright it

or 22 2005. i can't exactly remember because the event happens everynight. i was watching a movie downstairs in my basement and went to smoke a cig. i am a person who has also been interested in astronomy my entire life and am fascinated in the stars. as i gazed into the night sky, i noticed an unusually bright star in the sky. the star had a bright faintly blue band across it and a faintly visible, transparent halo around it. figuring it to be mars at first because i know that mars was the most visible planet in the sky at that time, i stared in wonder. then it came to me that mars appears almost dark orange. this was bright yellow with a faintly orange tint, and last i checked, doesn't have a band across it. so i started assuming saturn because jupiters ring isn't visible with the naked eye. then it wobbled and slightly dropped. stars nor planets descend in the night sky and wobble. i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and rubbed them and began to look again. then when i compared it to the moon, it was lower. this thing was in the air. i refused to believe what i thought i was thinking so lit another cig and continued to observe. i noticed it was drifting and then it appeared to start a direct, very slow, almost unnoticable decent towards me and stop. \r\n\r\ni must say this.I am a former us marine. my mos was avionics technician f-18's. i have seen many different types of aircraft both military and civilian and none of them hover anything like this, and none are dead silent. they also have multiple lights that flash in an arranged pattern. this thing was bright, one solid color, silent, and the band i saw at first, is not a band. its extremities, but not wings. it also began to appear as either 2 seperate balls on top of each other joined by this blue colored now v shaped joint is the best way to describe it, or a longer type object. it was hard to distinguish because it would change slightly when it drifted to a slightly different position. it appeared to move in a manner to try to remain unnoticable, but i could tell. i went inside and grabbed my moms cell phone camera and went back outside and was suprised to see it there still, though it had shifted to a slightly different position but same general location. i struggled to snap off 2 different shots as it was very difficult to get it on the tiny little display, and i'm still not sure if i got it or not. after about an hour, i started second guessing myself and walked inside shaking my head almost laughing at myself that i even thought i saw what i think i saw. was i going crazy???\r\nyeah, i must have been tired and my mind was playing tricks on me. after all, don't ufo's move really fast at odd flight patterns and only last a few seconds at best. they're also supposed to have lights and zip around and do neat little tricks. they also don\"t start backing up when you aim a camera at it!!What do they care if you snap a few shots.\r\n\r\nthe next night, same day, i ate dinner and went outside again to smoke. i looked up to the same spot i had witnessed it the night before and of course i saw nothing. i began to laugh at myself at what i saw the night before. in geberal curiosity i thought, what the hell. i'll walk around my house while i smoke and just see. as i walked i a glimpse of a light the same color and brightness that i had seen the night before peering through a small gap in the top of the tree line to my left. it was dusk and still a little light remained. again as it had been that morning the sky was crystal clear. i moved further up my driveway thinking to myself that there was no possible way that i was seeing that thing again. i got to the front of my house and plain as day their it was, craddled between the bowl shaped gap in the tree line. now, i had a reference field to all but the top side and it sat directly in the center. it didn't take nearly as long to see it move this time as it had before. it was going left and right, up and down in a wobblly manner. i ran inside and got my parent to come out and see. sure enough, they both saw it. it wasn't making large movements, but very noticable comparing to the trees around it. then it moved up over the tree line and slightly left out of the clearing and continued to hover. it was at about a 45 degree angle and i assumed it to be about 20000 feet or so due to its size. i ran inside and grabbed the digital camera this time and my binoculars. i started to aim, but again had trouble getting it to show up on the display. so i just started to point and took a couple of guess shots. by this time it was dark, and stars had started to appear. i went in and downloaded this first batch to my comp. i was absolutly amazed at what came out. the picture resembled nothing like what i saw. the image was red and moving around very rapidly. you can tell because it resembled a still traffic shot. i thought that may have been the slight movement of my hand, but in a few of the other shots, there are 2 stars in the background, 1 blue, 1 green. i went back out and watched in disbelief and awe as i took a few more shots over the past hour and a half. again, it never left. i had called the nuforc and left a message and emailed them the pics.\r\n\r\nthe next day, i got call from them. this was a monday. the so called scientist that spoke to me insisted it was mars and hadn't even looked at my pictures. he had a bad attitude and completly blew me off belittling me the entire time. i wanted to say something really bad but he hung up before i could retort.\r\n\r\nok. thats the beginning of a very long story that grows day by day for almost a month now, non stop, every night, all night. from sun down till i don't know how long, assuming sun up. brief summery of things since.As i have taken more pics (over 200) and watched, now i have a telescope, i have been able to detect many other things going on. theres more than 1 in the sky. there is a peremeter. they post in different positions and no matter where i go on my property, which is about 2 acres that is very open then extends into a fence of thin woods, neighborhoods around at a distance, a dark sky, and road that brdges 2 kinda busy roads about 5 miles from the interstate that gets dead at night. in some of the pics, you can see orbs as well as the objects being photographed. you can tell they are 3-d and have indentions. i discovered them by mistake as they are invisible (or were to me until now) when i looked at one of the pics i took by mistake when i couldn't get the camera to flash and began to point it at a differnt spot and it went off. this pics is one of my favorites. they look like the diagrams of cells you see in biology books and it even appears that they are splitting! there tons of them and they where all around me!! i had no clue. i can see them now, but they appear as just circles in which the area i see them is slightly fainter and distorted compared to the rest of the sky. i see many shadows that buzz past and flashes that shot by. i have pictures of this too. sometimes i can see what looks like a tiny diamond that sparkles very sharply just in the air no more than 10 feet away and at sternum level with me. whenever i stare at that and take my focus off the surrounding area, i can see a figure that looks like the shape of a small human. this is not like the typical description of the greys that i have heard so much about. they are about 4 feet tall, some shorter than others, and they will not approach me. if i get closer than a few steps towards it, it vanishes like it just fades into the area behind it like a chammeleons blends in with the color of its surroundings, but when i step back, reappears. these are very real beings that have the technology or ability to do this, like camoflouge. there heads are properly proportioned to there bodies, and there eyes are black, but not as slit as they are oval and on towards the top of there head, like a bug almost, but human. also the very top of there eyes appear slightly reflect light like a pair of sunglasses has that tiny bright spot where the sun reflects off. they observe every move i make and are everywhere i am at night, and can point them out to anybody, at least the crafts that i think are more or less personal transport units.They have no facial features other than eyes and almost look like kermit the frog in the face. i have a picture of this as well that i took inside my house looking out because the first time i thought i trully saw it it looked liked something was peering through my window, and more than one. i had very mixed emotions about the pic because i tried to regard the images i saw as reflections of like out the window. but i showed it to several people and my best friends who lived with me for a week and saw almost everything i saw, and still can like me, though he is in the mountains, have concluded that the images are real. this was primarily based on comparing the shots we took in my jeep when we got some daylight pics in the subdivision down by my house. when we left we got on the interstate and took some shots while in motion and window up in a few and only got 1 flash with no images of kermit looking creatures peering back. i must correct myself. in the picture with the image, there are 2. one right at my window peering from through the bottom, with a reflective flash off its peeering eyes, and another image in the back to the right that had very serious eyes that were slightly more slanted and slit and looked more like it was watching the other figure like a boss observes his subordinate.\r\n\r\nthere ones in the woods that look exactly like the watcher one in the air as i first decribed from day 1, but they seem to have a different task. they analyze, everything. study everything around them to the last detail with what looks just like a double lens laser pointer that emits either 1 or 2 either red or white dots on whatever it is looking at, including you! i have watched them before and seen the dots appear on me. they stay back and do their own thing, almost always in the same spot just floating slightly around. i have now noticed in the past 2 days a different one. this character at first looked like a a small cloud with whitish yellow sparkles. when i got a good look at it with binoculars in tree line gaps, i can tell it has a definite shape, like a human wearing buffy clothes, and the sparkles dont sparkle but are a constants glow placed in very specific places and when they appear to move very wildly about it, that it it moving that part of it body. he seems to be top dog because he points his little beams at the other guys and they react. also, when i stare at him for more than a few seconds with binoculars, those little dots start appearing on me. i also feel things start to get all around me and get what feels like a forced sense of overwhelming paranoia. thats when i also see the figures that i mentioned earlier that at first look like floating diamonds. i need to get a picture of him, need a new chip for digital camera cuz my other one is loaded up. they really got pissed when i pointed my telescope at him. i decided that might not be a good idea, and took it back in until i can asses that a little better.\r\n\r\ni at first wanted to remain unanimous, but after emailing coast to coast, and oops, the cia, about this matter, in which that was a while back and far less detailed, and no response from anybody, i want to get into this field and research the hell out of it.Especially because since i informed the cia, you can't go more than 1 second without seeing either an f-18, i know them from the bottom and light patterns because i worked on them, recon plane with its spotter lights for taking nighttime aerial photos, a helocopter or some other military aircrafts like those used by the fbi or dea to watch people from above, and most of the time they fly at very low altitudes and very slowly over my house.\r\n\r\nthis is not a joke. i would like from somebody to please at least look at these pics. you can send an investigator out to my house if you wish any night you choose and you will see i'm very serious about this. i have nowhere else to turn. i had given up actually until i saw your web sight. i have been thing very extensivly about creating an organizations that follows up on these kind of reports that everybody, including so called ufoologist such as the one that didn't even give me the time of day despite the fact i have many pictures, yet goes off claims in which no evidence other than a single persons testimony is provided. that just blows my mind and makes me think no wonder why we can't publically prove life exists outside this planet.I have come to the conclusion that the government not only knows about these occurances, but will not do anything about it except do anything they can to deny it and discredit or shut up those who can prove it. it will be up to us, as citizens, to stand up to this. it will take undenialble proof and i want to get as involved as i can in the field as humanly possible after exeriencing this.

when i was 13, i have been *taken*??At lest 4 times that i remember, the evens are alway similar, but only the first time i was really frighted, and not the last time but the one before someone famous

lights on a radio tower only they are different, brighter, and appeared to be moving at the same rate we were along the roadside above the tree line at about 300 feet. i asked peter if he sees what i see and he too confirmed that it was really happening before our eyes. there were 3 vertical white/amberish lights with a weird cloud like fog or glow below them. they are moving a bit faster than we are at about 35 m.P.H. or so until we come to a stoplight. the 3 lights begin to morph or compress into 2 lights then 1 light, still with this weird foggy glow below them. the glow was constant until the 3 lights became 1 light then the glow surrounded the light & faded away. the center light became very small and looked exactly like a star and it stopped moving. we commented on how clever this seemed because it truly modelled itself to blend right in with the other stars in the sky. we kept our eyes on it, exhilarated at what we both were witnessing together. just then a much bigger glow appeared around the star and a much bigger elliptical 45degree angle glow also faded into view, it was huge, it took up our entire field of view through the front windshield. the glows all appeared to me like an aurora borealis kind of plasma energy, it took on a slightly bluish tint. our light signal turns green and we turn left heading east on sumpter rd..Then the star became much brighter and began to expand and split just like a cell does when it grows under a microscope. it split into two symmetrical distinct balls of light with these outer ring glows, we were really getting excited about what we are witnessing and i pull the car over to get a better look, just as we slow to a stop, the glows and lights expand at the same rate a firework display does, only it stays perfectly symmetrical in it���s expansion. we can see streaks inside of the plasma ball glow, that squiggle and move a bit like electricity. we are both gasping and our expressions are pretty hilarious as we are oh, my god���ing and , what the #@!% is that. then the entire formation imploded or shrank an a fraction of a second and simply vanished!\r\nno trace after 1/2 second. it simply vanished. we both had goosebumps from head to toe and were astonished at how big this was for us, and how long event took right near a busy intersection prime time on a friday night. many cars were around us and driving, i choose to know if they were looking up and saw it. surely as big as this was somebody else must have seen it too.  this is an experience that confirmed for me what i felt in my heart. we are being visited by other worldly energies, and or craft. no scientific explanation can begin to explain what this was. whatever it was... it truly was in and then out of this world, in less than a second!\r\n\r\nwe called people we knew from the school and heard that many of the students and families leaving the event also witnessed the event, and they told us the consensus was it was the space shuttle. to which we thought was ridiculous, but hey as bizzare and life altering this was for me, i can imagine that people would try to rationalize and justify such an amazing phenomena.\r\n\r\ni am a graphic designer and immediately came home with my friend peter and recreated in photoshop exactly what we saw and the timings it happened in so we would verify and validatebetween the two of us the accuracy of our event. we showed it to our family and a few friends, and then put it aside. i felt it was time to share it. i recently edited the images into a video sequence so the effect could be witnessed in realtime the way we saw it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

cigarette.\r\n2.  i live under the departure leg for columbus metro so i always watch the departing aircraft.  i first noticed the sound, before i could see the lights.  it sounded like a heavy (jet turbine at low rpm) but our airport only supports up to a 737, so i figured maybe a c17 or 141 out of fort benning.\r\n3.  as the aircraft approached, i thought that was too low (2000-2500 ft.) for a heavy.  also too slow, maybe 160-200kt.  as i made out a triangle shape i thought maybe a b2.  as it got closer i saw it was smaller, so maybe a f117, but i've seen those at airshows, and you don't hear them coming like this.\r\n4.  the two objects flew directly overhead, silhouetted against a clear sky.  they were in conventional formation, ie: wingman trailing port. the shape was close to an equilateral triangle.  the nose had a white strobe, and perhaps a static white too(?), port corner red strobe, starboard green strobe.  i focussed on the trailing edge: it was solid straight.  this was not a 117 or b2.\r\n5.  i went in and told a relative (who worked in the aviation engine industry) what i saw.  he joined me on the deck and 8 minutes later one similar (or one of the same) aircraft flew the same heading (approx. 330 no deviation or unconventional mannerisms) over our heads.  he couldn't identify the sound of the powerplant, and commented that it had an unusual lighting configuration.  we both looked at the trailing edge and agreed this was not a 117 or b2. both he and i are aviation buffs, and have built plastic models of most types.  i have a good background in flight simulation, so i think my guesstimates are informed.  i have no doubt this was a conventional aircraft, but am unable to name it. best wishes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

that street is e-w oriented, so therefore has the best view of the w sky w/out trees or houses blocking view.  after watching it for a couple minutes (the \"w\" formation hung in the sky as if it were a giant, much brighter version of the \"w\" in the constellation cassiopia), i remembered my video camera and ran back in to retrieve it.  one of my other sons went to get our next door neighbor (also retired air force), and we got back out on the street almost simultaneously.  while the neighbor and others watched, i fired up the video camera, only to watch it die repeatedly due to low battery charge.  frustrated, i stood w/the group (which now included other neighbors coming out of their homes) for several more minutes.  at one point, the anti-collision strobe and running lights of a small civilian aircraft appeared to approach the formation of lights from the n, then turned away and circled for a couple minutes before departing the area. from our perspective, i believe the small airplane was much closer to our position than the bright lights.  no engine sounds were heard from either the small plane or the bright lights, which is one reason i believe the lights were more distant (somewhere over central santa rosa county. after about 5 minutes, the lights independently and slowly broke formation, one by one, starting w/the furthest right or northern light.  there was nothing odd about their separation, until we noticed that as each one broke formation, they moved down visibly, then after 2-3 seconds, would just vanish.  from the time my oldest son, 19, first viewed the lights until the last of the five vanished, approximately 10 mins elapsed. at that point, my neighbor suggested maybe they were helos (we live adjacent to hurlburt field, home to usaf special operations.) as a retired usaf special operations flyer, i challenged his theory based on the angle and distance - they'd be pretty high in altitude.  plus, it's very rare for hurlburt to launch five mh-53's at once for a night training mission (usually no more than 2-3 at a time.) once they vanished, we all went back inside, and i didn't think much more about it as we were awaiting guests for a monday night football party.  the next day, i heard people calling in to a local radio station and discussing the lights in the sky, so i contacted some of my active-duty friends and had them check local flight and military range schedules.  the results came back negative.  there were no military aircraft up and operating at that time over the western ranges of the eglin military reservation.  also checked w/both navy and army contacts, and ditto.  since then i've spoken w/several others who also witnessed the bright lights in the sky monday night.  as a retired special ops aviator w/nearly 5,000 hrs in the air, i'm very familiar w/seeing other aircraft in the night skies, especially in our area of heavy training ops.  these bright lights defied anything i've ever seen, and altho i tried to assign several normal explanations, none of \"the usual suspects\" held up under scrutiny.  i and other witnesses of these lights are fairly certain these were not caused by any normal explanation.  unfortunately, i can't offer any visual evidence as my video camera was low on batteries.  i really, really regret that!  feel free to contact me if any further questions.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":4083,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.9960027,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11092005-0001","longitude":-90.0741885,"occurred":1131417600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1131417600000,"summary":"Five bright lights in sky evenly spaced;
