States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My name is steven m. shoemaker, and this is a statement on the events that took place at approximately 2200 hours, on october 29, 1979.   at the time of this incident, i was 25 years old, and was a sergeant (e-5) military police officer, on active duty in the us army.  i had departed fort wainwright, alaska a few days earlier, and was driving to my next duty station which was fort snelling, minnesota (awol apprehension).\r\n\r\nwe had turned off hwy 29 in north dakota, and were headed east on hwy 1 in marshall county, minnesota. we were enroute to my sisters apartment in thief river falls, where we were going to spend the night prior to continuing on to the twin cities.\r\n\r\ni was driving a 1977 chevrolet nova (v-8, 305 engine,  * speedometer only went to 80 mph on this model).  my wife susan (3 months pregnant) was in the car with me, and we were just past the town of alvarado when we observed an extremely bright light on the road approximately ��� to 1 mile ahead. we wondered what the bright light was, thinking maybe an accident or a road construction site. we figured that we would see what it was in a few moments when we got there. after about a minute or so we determined that whatever it was, it was moving because we were not closing on it.\r\n\r\nnow being the cocky young military policeman that i was, i decided that i was going to find out what this light was.  i accelerated to a high speed (i���m guessing close to 100 mph because the needle was buried past the 80 mph limit).  \r\n\r\ni���ll describe what happened next. as i started closing on the light, i observed that the light was an extremely bright yellowish light, which appeared to be approximately 4 to 6 feet in diameter. it was above the centerlines in the road, and was about 3 to 4 feet above the road surface.  as i got to within approximately 100 yards of the light (traveling at about 100 mph) it suddenly came off the center lines into the middle of my lane and was coming right at me. i immediately locked up the brakes and swerved onto the shoulder of the roadway (everything in the car was flying into the front seat). instantly the light was back to approximately ��� to 1 mile ahead of us again.\r\n\r\nnow i was a pissed off, cocky young military policeman. i took off after it again, determined to see what the light was. again, as i got to within approximately 100 yards of the light (traveling at about 100 mph) it suddenly came off the center lines into the middle of my lane and was coming right at me. i again immediately locked up the brakes and swerved onto the shoulder of the roadway, and instantly the light was back to approximately ��� to 1 mile ahead of us once again. this time i was able to observe that the bottom (approx. ���) portion of the light merged into a brighter whiter light than the rest of it. it was so bright that we had to squint our eyes when we were closing in on it.\r\n\r\nnow i was really ticked off. so off i went after it for the third time, with about the same results, however this time i estimated that we came within 30 to 50 feet of the object (we almost hit it).  at that point we decided not to try that anymore.  we followed it (at a safe distance) for a couple more minutes, i turned my lights off & on, and flashed my brights at it a few times, but it just kept heading down the road.\r\n\r\nthen it just disappeared. i thought that maybe it had gone out of sight down a hill, but there was no hill. about 1 mile later we entered the town of warren, mn. as we continued past the town, we observed a bright light in our rear view mirror. we watched it for about a minute then it disappeared (i don���t know if it was what we chased, or if it was just a car that was behind us).  we talked about what had just happened, trying to figure out what the heck that object was. i don���t think a ufo was high on our list because one would think of ufo���s as flying away, not playing a dangerous game of cat & mouse in northwest minnesota. (what really ticks me off is that i had a good 35-mm camera in the car, but didn���t think about it at all during this incident)\r\n \r\nwhen we got to my sister���s apartment, she was asking us about the kinds of animals we saw on our trip down the alaskan highway, and while i was telling her, my wife said ��� and we saw a ufo too ���.\r\n\r\nmy sister immediately said, ��� it wasn���t in warren was it ? ���  at that point i got a knot in my stomach,  and the hair on the back of my neck rose  with that goose bump chill thing.  i said ��� what do you mean, it wasn���t in warren ! ��� (since we had just drove about 3000 miles, and she nails this sighting to within a few miles).\r\n\r\nshe said, ��� tell me what you saw ���.  so i told her what we had seen, and she stated that a marshall county deputy sheriff was hit by the ufo about 2 months ago. \r\n\r\nnow i was heading for my new military police unit at fort sheridan, il (with duty at fort snelling), and i didn���t want to get labeled as a loony so i only told my friends and relatives about the ufo that i chased.\r\n\r\na few months later i heard the deputy sheriff (val johnson) being interviewed on a radio talk show, and i made up my mind that i would call him and talk with him.  i called up to marshall county and they said he worked at the oslo police dept. i called the oslo police dept and stated why i was calling. they called val johnson at home and he okayed them to give me his home phone number. i then called val and stated that i believe that i had chased the object that had hit him. i described to him what had happened. he stated that of all the people that had reported ufo sightings up there, he was sure that i had chased the object that had hit him. he stated that as i was describing the incident he was remembering the small details about the light (such as: it being above the centerline, and it having a brighter whiter lower portion) that he had never reported in his statements. in january 1997, my son had a hockey tournament up at thief river falls. we had just gotten a computer with access to the internet, so i started contacting people from the warren, mn area to find out how to see the sheriff���s vehicle (i had heard it was on display). i found out that it was in a museum building on the county fairgrounds, but that the museum was closed during the winter months. one of the people i talked to ended up being the editor of the local paper up there. he stated that he had covered the story back in 1979 and also stated that he thought it was just a hoax since there was no other witnesses or evidence. i told him that i had chased that hoax 2 months later with my wife also seeing it. i told him that i was not some kind of nut, that at the time we chased it i was a policeman also, and that i was now an officer in the us army national guard (a helicopter pilot). he stated that he might have to rethink his position.  anyway i finally tracked down the lady who was in charge of the museum. she lived in thief river falls (about 30 miles away)  i told her my story and she stated that when i got up to warren,  to call her and she would drive over and open it up for me to see the car.\r\n\r\nwhen we got to the museum, we had to track through about 3 feet of snow, and dig out the front door so we could get in.  i got to see the police car, i took pictures of it and all of the investigative reports. she even opened the chicken wire cage it is in and i got to look inside of the car. it was chilling to see the unusual damages to the car, and reliving that night when reading the reports that described what had happened to val johnson, and how exact the situation was that had happened to us that night. i feel real fortunate that i was able to avoid colliding with the object that night\r\n i have often thought about what it was, and why it would be playing cat & mouse with a car in northern minnesota.  the only theory i can come up with is as follows: if it was some kind of extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings that were observing our civilization, they would surely be interested in what could hurt them. the grand forks afb (and icbm missile silos) is not to far from there . could it be possible that the object was monitoring the military base from that area ?  it being about 3 to 4 feet above the road surface would give it vertical obstacle clearance and keep it below the radar screens. it being above the centerline in the road would give it left and right side obstacle clearance.  vehicles like the sheriff���s squad car and my car were probably minor inconveniences to its mission, requiring throwing a scare into the occupants if they got to close.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

haven ct. and providence, ri. at about 3:18 or 3:19 am we were both looking straight ahead and my friend was talking, and we had some rock music on. we had just passed exit 2, and the night was extremely clear. all of a sudden, ahead of us and a bit to the right something lit up, traveled directly downward, and then was gone again after a little more or less than a second.  i thought it disappeared well before it hit the tree line. its distance from us was difficult to determine because of the darkness and the brightness of the object, but its speed was extraordinary- it must have covered a few thousand feet in that moment we saw it. i could not have blocked it with the head of a pin at arm's length, but would have easily blocked it out with a small capsule of medicine at the same distance.\r\n    the way it lit up and left a light trail because of its speed and then disappeared has since reminded me of a firefly or spark in the fireplace. i thought it might have been a plane at first, but it was traveling far to fast, and straight down. in reviewing it to try to explain it, i was immediately certain that it had too much downward velocity to be a falling object from this planet- it would have had to unnaturally accelerate downwards to reach that speed, which means something either from outside the atmosphere or with rather impressive engines. \r\n    when it happened i immediately sat forward and tried to account for it, and second-guessed myself for an instant until my friend exclaimed loudly, turned the music down and asked me \"did you just see that?\" our perceptions of it were slightly different, even though we had both been looking essentially straight at it. he thought, and i agreed, that for it to be an airplane was impossible because of the speed unless it was a fighter jet flying directly into the earth. i thought it might have had a slight arc to it, but couldn't be sure, whereas he thought it was entirely straight down. we both remarked at how bright it had been. certainly it must have been at least several miles away, and probably a bit farther than that, although the darkness and the light of the object made it difficult to tell, we agreed. we differed most on the perception of color: he thought it was blue, and i thought it was white. it reminded both of us of a shooting star- the way it lit up brightly, traveled, and disappeared- but we could not account for its angle or proximity. \r\n    as he drove the rest of the way to providence, i spent the drive searching the sky for any repetition, of which there was none. the event had lasted just a second, maybe a little more or less, but we were completely at a loss to explain it. the only thing that makes sense to me is if a meteorite suddenly lit up (although it should have done so on entering the atmosphere) and then burned itself up again. i have not been able, however, to find any prediction of, record of, or reference to any such event thus far.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":4037,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4880091,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10272005-0001","longitude":-71.5172398,"occurred":1130408340000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Rhode

planes going by.  at around 8:00 pm on october 26th, 2005, i noticed an airliner coming from the northeast.  this seems to be a pretty normal flight pattern for commercial airlines.  on this night, it was partially cloudy with low level clouds.  the plane i noticed was flying higher than some of the other flights i have noticed of prior times.  my townhome is close to vicinity of where i took note of the airliner coming from the northeast; because of this, i have taken note of the particular flight patterns of this area pretty well.  as i was glancing up at the sky this particular night, i noticed there were about 6-7 orange lights in the sky towards the northwest.  i immediately slowed down to safely keep an eye on them without losing sight.  the lights were too big to be of highflying airline lights.  they were evenly spaced apart and formed a single row. they appeared to be the same size and they did not seem to be moving.  the lights did not look real close at all.  they seemed to be far out in distance unless the lights outlined something bigger.  i was in utter shock and almost did not believe i was seeing this.  i did see this, though.  i probably watched these lights

appeared to a dark (charcoalist) and completely unlit triangular shaped object moving slowly away and to the south at a relatively low altitude (approximately 1,000 to 2,500 feet).\r\n\r\nas i focused on the object and my eyes better adjusted, i sensed that the edges of the object, which seemed to be almost sharp and thin, tended to blend in and out with the background sky, although i could still follow the object because of the way it distinctively blocked out stars in th e background.\r\n\r\nmy eyes adjusted fairly quickly to the low light of the sky and stars, and i could determine better that the shape was more like a \"v\" but with the arms of the \"v\" slightly wider than the character \"v\" but not quick appearing to be a 90 degree angle.  viewed as a \"v\" and not a triangle, i got some impression that the legs of the \"v\" where connected to make the \"v\" a triangle (no center opening), but this area seemed to blend in and out with the background stars.\r\n\r\nthe bottom surface was almost flat, but with a series of ring-like protrusions running along the \"legs\" of the \"v\" shape and pointing downward.  each ring was approximately 75% of the width of the \"leg\" and seemed to protrude significantly and appear very dimensional.  there were approximately 4 to 6 equally spaced rings along each \"leg\" starting at the end of each \"leg\" and each centered within the width of the \"leg.\"  there were no other distinguishable details on the bottom.\r\n\r\nas i watched for 30-40 seconds, i became more and more aware of a medium-low frequency hum and slight whoosh sound directly from the object as it moved away from me.  the evenly balanced (harmonically) sound was remarkable quiet and consistant, not increasing or decreasing, during the entire viewing.  as i focused my eyes on the object, the sound was easier to hear as if i was able to focus on the sound source.\r\n\r\nthe general direction of flight seemed to be towards mcdill air force base, but a little more east of it.  the object never changed direction and remained at a unexpectedly slow speed.  at no time did i feel i could identify the object.  \r\n\r\ni did consider what what others could consider it to be and tried to think through a comparison.  in comparing to a b-2 stealth bomber, i determined that the trailing edge seemed straight across (not zig-zagged) and the angle of the \"v\" less (70-80 degrees versus 90 or so for a b-2).  it also seemed longer than a b-2 and moved at a much slower speed than a b-2 even on landing approach.  after careful inspection of pictures of the underside of a b-2, i am clear that the object was not a b-2 and, in particular, the rings i observed on the bottom of the object bear no resemblence to a b-2 whatsoever.\r\n\r\nafter 40 seconds or so, i was still able to see the object blocking out the sky and stars behind it, but the details of the rings on the bottom were not as noticable and the sound was fading away.\r\n\r\ni called for me wife just inside the back door to come out and look.  i stopped looking at the object for less than 5 consecutive seconds while directing her to come out, but by the time she came out (less than 10 seconds), i could still (but barely) see the black outline against the stars but i could no longer hear any sounds; she never saw or heard it.  after about 50-60 seconds i could no longer see it, although based on the direction and speed it did not pass over a horizon to me or behind buildings or obstructions.\r\n\r\nrecap/notes:\r\n\r\ni first noticed the object because of the way it appeared so black/gray against the stars and it's relatively low speed comparatively.  the rings on the bottom were particularly unusual and unlike any aircraft i have ever seen or read about. while i studied the rings for 5-10 seconds, i became very aware of the very low, hum/whoosh sound coming from it.  the complete absense of interior or exterior lights or lumination or reflections was also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nevery comparison i tried to make to known aircraft i dismissed instantly as particularly different, not just \"not quite the same.\"\r\n\r\noverall, i'm feeling somewhat concerned about this observation and its implications, which is probably why i'm making this filing.  i have an engineering background, have been an aviation enthusiast for a long time, and am a keen and detailed observer.  although i would prefer to have this object turn out to be a b-2, the only possible  aircraft i am aware of it was similar to, it is not like the b-2 or any aircraft i know about produced or even just developed since the late 30's around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

made mental notes of the few constellations i knew, and when i turned in a east, southeast direction: i first noticed it.  due to how bright it was, and it's roundish shape, i thought it might possibly be venus, but then i noticed the colors beginning to change.  at first a very slow pulse between white and blue, but as i called to my wife to come see, it began to speed up, and ultimately reach a sort of \"flicker\".  this process took about 3-4 minutes.  we went inside and got our binoculars, and went back to looking.  then it began to move.  sharp, sudden jerks to the side, and back again.  still doing the blue/white flicker.  my wife is an instructional pilot here at tulsa's spartan school of aeronautics, and could verify that the object did not move in a fashion that a plane or helicopter would.  common sense would tell most people it wasn't either of those things.  after watching it for several minutes, i know this sounds odd, but i got a feeling of foreboding.  like we were risking our own safety by observing it.  honestly, i got scared.  my wife did as well, so we grabbed our things and went back inside.  i didn't go back out to see if it was still there.  but i did call the police non-emergency number, and filed a report.  the officer wasn't particularly helpful when i asked if other people had seen it to, but he said he would put a call out to patrolling

st. when we saw a light in the sky.  at first i thought it was a helicopter or maybe a plane, but it didn't have the standard blinking lights required by the faa.  it was simply an orange light that slowly pulsed about every second or two.  i thought it might be mars, but it was too bright, and i quickly determined that the object was in our atmosphere and probably at a low altitude.  when we first entered the bridge from crown point, the object was in front of us, but, by the time we got to vacation island (in the middle of the bay), it was behind us.  it hadn't moved.  we had driven under it. so it wasn't a star or planet.  determining its exact altitude, however, is difficult, since it appeared as a point light.\r\n\r\nwe parked on the island and got out of the car.  the object was silent and stationary and continued its slow pulsing.  i looked at it through my binoculars, but i couldn't make out any structure.  it just appeared as a point of light.  it appeared to perhaps be burning, and twice we saw glowing debris or embers fall off it.  the \"debris\" appeared as another light, same color but smaller and dimmer, and it disappeared after falling quickly for a second.\r\n\r\nwe watched the object for about five minutes total.  it didn't move at all during that time.  then a low cloud bank came in from the ocean and obscured our view.  the clouds continued through the night, and we didn't see the object again.\r\n\r\nit couldn't have been a meteor, since it was stationary.  my best guess is that it might have been a road flare or firework attached to a kite, but even that's improbable, since it didn't move at all.  it wasn't a missile launch, either.  i've seen one of those, and they move way across the sky and leave a trail.  i haven't seen

eye can not. i decided to take my digital camera on one of my exercise walks and shoot the empty sky just to see if i could capture a ufo. beginners luck! of the 70 or so shots, one frame had a suspicious looking speck with a tail on it (not a vapor trail.). i enlarged it on my computer and-paydirt! the photo was taken at the intersection of soliere and country club in flagstaff arizona, one mile from my apartment. shot was pointed about due west into the sunset, just after sunset. i did not see the object when photo was taken, only when reviewing them later on the computer (this, i heard, is common.). there is a low cinder cone volcano west of flagstaff, from my viewpoint, and the object was over the northern end of it (maybe a little past it at, i guess, around 10 miles.), obviously moving very fast. i cropped and enlarged the photo on adobe photoshop cs, got rid of the color data making it black and white, and then jacked up the contrast. when i did that, i noticed something very interesting. the \"tail\" on the object was a motion streak. since the shot was taken at 1/500'th second, a motion streak would indicate extreme speed. in the photo, the object was edge-on, and looked like a dark hockey puck with a lighter dome on top of it, not glowing. due to the extreme enlargement, the object is somewhat pixelated, but enough of it can be seen to tell the tale. camera data: used 5x optical-only zoom, 1/500'th second shutter, infinity focus, f4.5 f-stop, sony digital camera cyber-shot dsc-f717, hand held and available light, lens carl zeiss vario-sonnar, automatic exposure control, no filters. shot was taken at 5:53pm on 4october2005, phoenix arizona time. i had taken a shot of the same spot just a couple of seconds before, with no

nieghborhood half way between castroville and hondo, for the weekend. my friend jesse and me were outside on his porch hanging out and talking and looking at the stars, it was a clear night  with a good size cloud over head. i was looking towards the east approximately(compared with hwy 90) then i turned towards the west approx.I looked up at about a 45 degree angle in which i was looking over the roof of the house. and i saw what i thought was a satilitte because it was a white light a little yellowish and it was going in a straight line going east. i even told my buddy jesse \"hey look there's a satelitte right there\". and almost as soon as i said it, it did a rapid turn between 45 and 90 degrees to my right(it's left) staying the same speed. and it did the same thing after a few seconds in the oppisite direction. it then it was just sorta \"swirving\" left to right like a bug. which by then i already realized that satelitte do not do that. so i called my other friend jr out of the house to look at it. by this time it was still in clear sight but under the cloud i mentioned earlier that moved a litte towards the east. so that gave off that it had to be in the earth's atmosphere for it to be under a cloud. it was still moving rather buglike, it almost seemed to be moving up and down but very little. it could of been just the angle because it was further away going towards the south east about(still in referance to the highway). after about 30 more seconds it was from under the cloud where you could see just stars and black. then it just disappears. it was how it looked before but it just vanishes like someone flipped a light switch and it went out. during all of this i didn't get all excited about it so i can remember everything about it and i didn't want to get it mixed up with something it's not. and i kept my self concentrated and normal so i don't get rapid eye movement so it doesn't look like it's moving in odd directions. with out getting excited over it. but it wasn't close enough to actually increase heart rate and it wasn't wierd enough even tho it wasn't anything i could explain. the only thing i did not account for was time but it felt like a few minutes. i am a person who is into watching ufo files on the history channel. and i do reading on ufo happenings, i would even on day to even do some research my self with people's

clear but dark sky for meteorite streaks.  stars were fairly bright. from the east i saw a bright light approaching to the west from an approximate distance of 3 miles which i suspected to be an airplane or jet.  it seemed to be moving at an unusually high speed.  i am very familiar with standard aircraft speeds and the rates they progress through the air (at night). this above average bright white/yellow light approached and covered an amazing distance in a short time.  it appeared to maintain an estimated steady altitude of about 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  i do not recall any flashing red or green lights which are always active on airplanes flying at night. as it drew nearer to within 1/2mile?? i expected to hear its engine however it was completely silent at all times.  normally an aircraft flying even twice that distance would have made a distinctly familiar loud sound.  there was no wind or obscuring noise to mask any normal engine noise if it produced any.  i began watching it more closely when i percieved the unusual speed and brightness of light.  it travelled east to west for about 15 seconds then made a fairly gentle curve to the south but with no unusual maneuvers. i guestimate it's closest distance to me to be about 1/2 to 3/4 mile however perception at night can be tricky. i am very certain it was not a satellite or meteorite in the upper atmosphere.  no way! it was relatively close.  it went out of view as it passed behind some woods by my house.  the entire event lasted approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute from when i first noticed it to when i lost sight of it.  i estimate the distance it apparently travelled during that time to be 5 or 6 miles and its constant speed to be about 300 to 400 miles per hour. that configuration is highly unusual in this area of normal light air traffic and flight patterns are not usually in that direction for aircraft.  i ran to the house taking 20 seconds to fetch a good pair of binoculars and ran to where the woods would not obscure my view.  i did not see the object again.  however it appeared as though there was an airplane travelling northwest (from where the object appeared to be headed) at the expected (much slower) normal rate of speed with the usual flashing lights.  (i have pilot experience so i consider myself to be a good judge of observance).  i am a fairly avid reader of ufo phenominon however this is the first time i have ever witnessed anything out of the ordinary in this realm.  i would never make a bogus claim and am confident of my observational skills.  i was surprised at what i saw and felt a little excited when i went to get my binoculars.  (i always keep them hanging near the door in the event an airplane flies nearby). \r\n   i am cautious not to claim the object to be a classic ufo for the lack of blatently obvious unusual characteristics they are reputed to exhibit.  the most compelling factors were the high speed, silence and to a lesser degree the bright light.  (i realize, depending on atmospheric factors, that aircraft lights can appear to be rather bright at times). factoring in the vagaries of nightime observation and perception, at most, i would only go so far to call what i observed to be an \"unusual peculiarity\".  i wish it could be run by me one more time for a more conciencious consideration. unfortunately, my attention to the episode was not completely piqued until the event was half over when i suddenly realized what i might be seeing.  i was left scratching my head wishing i had intensified my observational effort from the moment i first saw it.\r\n      ","distance":"501 Feet -

(i did what i could, but i used the video setting of my digital camera, and it came out very dark, and i don't have the technology to lighten it.)\r\n\r\nafter i returned, and tried to film it, it began to slowly move southward, down my street it seemed, and then curved to the southeast, out of my view.\r\n\r\nit frightened me when i first saw it.  really scared me.  it took awhile for me to realize i could capture it on film.  when i got my camera, i fumbled it around a lot.  i was shaken.\r\n\r\ni know it was not a plane.  two planes flew by later, following their normal east to west, or west to east paths that i see all day.\r\n\r\nthis object was very low in the sky.  probably less than 500 feet above the ground.  it was close enough that i should have heard some sound from an engine.\r\n\r\nit was also huge.  i can't say how big, but from one end of the strobing lights to the other, it was far bigger than any plane i've seen.  i'm even familiar with the sight of c-130's flying at night, having lived for two years at the marine military academy, right next door to the confederate air force, and an airport that allowed c-130's to practice touching down and lifting off.\r\n\r\nthis object had a solid row of strobing lights that moved in one direction.  i've seen no plane look like that before.  it was not a plane.  it was also not a helicopter.  \r\n\r\nthe only thing it could have been, besides being an unknown craft, is a blimp.  actually, come to think of it, it couldn't have been even that.  a blimp would have blocked out the sky above the lights, and that was not the case.\r\n\r\ni'll attach the films, perhaps you can clean them up.  the second film is the longest.  the strong row of lights you see are streetlamps.  please remember, i was very shaken when i took these, and it's a crappy digital camera recording.  thanks for all your diligent work in taking these reports.\r\n\r\n~~kevin\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":4010,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.0404225,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10212005-0002","longitude":-87.9050036,"occurred":1129787100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1129787100000,"summary":"Tilted saucer or triangular object just above treeline","tags":["saucer"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4010_submitter_file1__ufo_sketch1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4010_submitter_file2__100_4912.MOV","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4010_submitter_file3__100_4913.MOV"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:553340"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Boulder","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving in my car with my girlfriend, victoria blackwell, beside me and my 12 year old son, alexander manyhawks wolf-toney, in the back seat. we were coming from nevin platt middle school on baseline road east of cherryvale road, where we had just picked up alexander. he got out of school at 15:30 and took a few minutes to get to the car, so i estimate the pictures were taken between 15:45 and 16:00. \r\n\r\nwe were headed west on baseline road to go to taco bell at baseline road and broadway for a snack. the low cloud formations over the flatirons were creating some memorable images, so i stopped the car just west of the foothills parkway and got my sony dsc-p41 camera out of the trunk to take some pictures. \r\n\r\nfirst we stopped in the parking lot of the st. andrew presbyterian church at 37th street and baseline road to get a clear view without the power lines going along baseline road. there was an open meadow toward the foothills there, so it was a good location. i took four shots. the first one was without zoom, the other three were zoomed to varying degrees. i estimate the time here as about three minutes total, arriving in the parking lot no sooner than 15:45.\r\n\r\n[the second shot, i just realized as i reviewed the pictures to write this report, had a ufo in it, too!!! there was a radiant diamond shape in front of the tree line on the far side of the meadow! we didn���t notice that last night! so i have included this image as well as the other along with this report, and have modifed the short description narrative of the report to include this. while taking all these pictures, i was oblivious to anything ufo related going on.]\r\n\r\nafter shooting in the church parking lot, i proceeded west on baseline avenue and took two more shots; one without zoom just after leaving st. andrews and another zoomed some while near taco bell. after we went through taco bell, i went south on broadway to ash avenue, where i turned east and immediately turned north and came to a stop on the corner of ashley lane. i estimate arrival to this spot to be no earlier than 15:55. \r\n\r\nhere i had a great, unobstructed, close-up view of a stretch of the flatirons and took a slightly zoomed shot to eliminate the foreground and capture a nice scene. a few seconds later, waiting for some traffic on broadway to clear, i took a second shot of the same scene to make sure i had a good image. then we went home, a few blocks away in the martin acres neighborhood. i wish to note that all images were taken from the driver���s seat of my 2003 oldsmobile alero, with the window fully down to get a good resolution.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived home, we were talking about differing things and planning the evening activities, then i started looking at the images through the view screen on the camera. the first thing i noticed was an anomaly on an image alexander had taken last saturday morning as we passed through castle rock, co on i-25 southbound going to a soccer game in colorado springs. [this image was on the same memory stick and i am submitting a second report to you regarding this other incident after i complete this one.] \r\n\r\nwhen i zoomed up on the glowing form above a hot air balloon he had captured, i got excited and i told alexander he may have inadvertently photographed a ufo. then i decided to download all the images on the computer and look more closely at alexander���s shot on the computer screen. when i did, i decided to print it out, along two blow-ups of the anomaly. \r\n\r\nas i prepared to do this, i took a quick look at the last two images i had photographed of the flatirons to see how they turned out. i was stunned to notice a glowing spot in the clouds on the second image. when i zoomed in on it, it appeared to be a pattern of four lights arranged in a circle or diamond pattern in the sky shining through the clouds. then i went about printing an 8��� x 11 inch photo of this and the other image, and making two enlargements of both these anomalies. i made the enlargements with corel photo-paint 8 and digitally saved them as separate images. \r\n\r\nthis was all very exciting to me, as i have had many sightings in my 56 years of living, but never have had the blessing of capturing any of them with a camera. victoria and i had attended the recent mufon event in denver. we were moved by the documentary we saw of compiled evidence from a mexican journalist. victoria then saw two ufo���s seemingly playing with one another in the sky off c-470 near lone tree, co, the next morning as she went to work. after that, i had prayed for an opportunity to get a photograph or video, but had no idea i was photographing any of them yesterday. and to discover while preparing this report today that i serendipitously photographed two separate ones within 15 minutes was wild!\r\n\r\nand unbelievably, the encounter was not yet over. while i was immersed in the profundity of having finally captured a ufo on camera and the delight of my son preceding me with his picture from last weekend, alexander noticed a red balloon we had placed behind the horn of a bison skull hanging on a wall of my living room last friday evening was beginning to shrivel. he also noticed the seven others in the room i had brought home for him from a celebration at the denver va medical center i had attended last thursday were just fine. so he pulled it down and examined it.\r\n\r\nafter a few moments, alexander told me there was a hand print somewhat smaller than his on the balloon. this was curious enough to get my attention, and we continued to examine it together. i have decided to detail this in another report to you immediately following this one. i was convinced that there was a strong possibility an alien entered my home tuesday evening and handled this object, leaving some remarkable impressions which i have documented with my digital camera and a video.\r\n\r\nindeed, at this point, i am ready to methodically document all my encounters with your organization and you will be hearing more from me. and i am reasonably certain i now possess an extremely valuable artifact providing evidence of an alien presence, so i hope to be in contact with one of your associated scientists in the near future for a scientific analysis of the balloon and the apparently heat or chemically-formed impressions on its surface where it was handled by some unknown life-form.\r\n\r\nsincerely, \r\n\r\nhenry c toney jr\r\nmail: pob 3733, boulder, co 80307-3733\r\nemail: inritoni@att.Net\r\nvoice: 720-404-6063\r\nfax: 303-494-5675","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":4008,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0190656,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10202005-0004","longitude":-105.2610156,"occurred":1129762200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,  Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1129762200000,"summary":"Within 10 minutes, took 2 series of 2 images of same flatirons landscape within seconds; 2nd image in both cases shows a light pattern.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4008_submitter_file1__DSC02494.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4008_submitter_file2__DSC02569.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/4008_submitter_file3__DSC02575.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Boulder, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:553341"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2633}
