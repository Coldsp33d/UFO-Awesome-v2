observatory on the evening of friday sept. 30, 2005. it was a crystal clear, steady night (referring to the air currents) and the sky was perfect for viewing, as they usually are at 7000 ft. altitudes. the moon and mars had not risen yet and venus, jupiter and saturn had already set so the night was also quite dark.\r\n\r\ni teach amateur astronomy and i always start with basic sky navigation using binoculars and small aperture refractor scopes before opening the observatory and the large telescope. i use a 5mw green laser pointer quite extensively for guiding to and pointing out objects that are visible with small optics. it���s very bright and easily seen up to 20 miles, and although air traffic is quiet in this part of arizona i���m still very careful where i point it.\r\nwe had been observing for about an hour when my wife asked me what this object was on the eastern horizon just above tree top level that was radically changing in brightness. i took my laser pointer and pointed toward it, but not at it, to confirm it was the star mira pulsating due to the thick horizon air and went on with our viewing.\r\n\r\nabout 40 seconds later the four of us were quite startled and speechless when a very bright (brilliant white), round object about the size of a nickel at arms length, suddenly appeared above us in the nnw. i immediately took a time and position check and had my brother confirm it at 8:16 pm, az 350��� 41.21���, alt 22��� 49.612���, or about equal distances between the stars dubhe and polaris.\r\n\r\ni had the binoculars around my neck and focused for my eyes so i had time to take a look, and it appeared more spherical in shape. it made no sound and cast no shadows for as bright and large as it was. our wives were yelling, ���what is that thing and where did it come from���!  all of us had the feeling \"we\" we're being observed. after about 30 seconds or so it receded away from us to the nnw and below the horizon in a second or less. i say ���receded��� because it didn���t just fade out and disappear from a stationary spot in the sky, it sped away from us at an incredible speed and disappeared down below the horizon. none of us have any idea what it was, but we're very sure of what it wasn't.\r\n\r\ni���m 56 years old and been an amateur astronomer all my life and have never been treated to such a stunning sight as this. we have cross-examined this incident from every angle and have concluded that it had to have been the green laser activity that caused this sighting. take it from there!\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nron firestone","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

i was traveling south on the 605 freeway. i had just passed the intersection of the 605 and the 60 freeway, near el monte, ca.  the time was around 6:30 pm, and the sub had just gone down.  there was still adequate daylight in the sky, when i noticed a long line of white smoke in the sky.  a flying object was leaving this white smoke trail, doing several loops in the sky.  i could not see the type of flying object, but the white smoke trail was coming from the west and the object was travelling quickly towards the east.  thge object was not directly above me, but maybe 40-50 miles to the southwest.  the end of the smoke trail was dissipating and colored orange/red by the sun that had just set in the west.  i watched it for about 5 minutes as i travelled south on the 605, and i noticed that other drivers were also gazing upwards and perplexed.  suddenly, the flying object stopped emitting the strong white smoke trail, but i could still see by its shadow that it was moving eastward.  in an instant, it turned 90 degrees and seemed to jet in a southernly direction.  the object moved quickly and was at a very high altitude from what i would estimate.  i initially thought it was some air force plane dumping gas, or maybe the combination of the setting sun's light on the high altitude plane's emissions, but the 90 degree turn threw me off.","distance":"Over One

like them before.\r\n\r\nfirst time was when changing out some ram in a server at work.  as i walked out of the data center in our kearny mesa complex, i saw what appeared to be a \"dancing\" street light, sodium yellow, leaving strange trails in the sky, close to the horizon.  it eminated no sound at all, but was quite distant.  the light source was highly specular -- like very bright pinpricks of sodium-yellow light.  behind them were trails of sparks.  it was weaving very slowly back and forth, slowly descending until it disappeared behind the trees, where i could see the light source extinguished.  my initial reaction was that this was some kind of night-time gimmick of the air shows that miramar marine base was putting on at the time.  however, as my house is used as the turn-around point for nearly all the aircraft that seems to fly in these shows, i must note that no aircraft was flying over my home at the time, and these objects made no sound at all.  therefore, it is strongly unlikely to be airshow related, at least using military jets.\r\n\r\nthen, as i was driving home, having just merged off the clairmont mesa onramp, south-bound on the 163, heading towards 52 west, i noticed a *pair* of these things gliding through the sky.  one was flying a straight line, while the other was undulating sinusoidally around it.  both were leaving spark trails, that often seemed to drop reasonably close to the ground.  they appeared to be flying in a westerly direction, almost heading in the same direction as my home, and did not appear to be over miramar base at the time.  when arriving home, i didn't see anything, and didn't hear anything either.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

but discernable line did connect the 3 spheres, but the inside of the triangle appeared blue like the surrounding sky. the object was traveling in a straight line, while slowly rotating counterclockwise. the object was traveling at a high speed, silently, and if i had to guess at the altitude, comparing it to a jetliner which travels at around 30,000 ft, i would say this object was 15-20,000 ft. i only saw it long enought for it to rotate about a quarter of a turn (2 to 3 seconds) before it disappeared from sight in the blink of an eye. i know about aircraft, and i understand

just chatting after a hard days work. at around 6:30 pm or so, i looked up at the sky (something very bright caught my attention from the corner of my eye). as i looked up i saw this huge bright round fireball (not really a fireball, but instead a huge bright round ball). i called out to my fianc���e. we both thought it was a meteor but quickly changed our minds as this object was completely round and close enough to where we were (as if you tried covering a full moon with a hand right after sunset), and this bright, huge ball traveled west to east at an incredible speed. it was of an intense blue with pinkish hues of color when we first saw it. it trailed what i would describe as a fire tail. it made absolutely no sound though it was low enough we though it would crash. my heart was pounding and fear overwhelmed me. what really caught our attention was the intensity of its brilliance, of its colors. i have never seen such beautiful colors. though it was still daylight its brilliance was greater than the daylight itself. we watched in amazement as it started to plummet downwards. it slowed down and changed colors just before it vanished.  from blue it turned a brilliant orange/red. at this point my fianc���e and i thought it was going to explode and we better leave. that did not happen. instead, all of a sudden it simply disappeared in front of our eyes. it did not fall nor did it fly away, nor exploded. it just simply disappeared in a yet brighter color than it previously had. all that was left behind was a small, thin trail of smoke.  it was definitely not a meteor or shooting star (too close to be that and besides, it was intact). it has been by far the scariest experience i've had in my life. i am now aware that other people in florida witnessed a fireball on the evening of september 20, 2005 over the florida's skies and at other dates as well. my fianc���e and i are still in shock.  what was it? is anyone investigating that?  it has been by far the scariest experience i've had in my life. the colors, its intensity and the act of disappearance have forever changed my views on ufo's, and am fearful to observe the sky. i was not a believer.

hit it with a rock. it did not wobble on it's axis as a balloon might but was perfectly controlled. it moved very slowly (perhaps 5 mph) and came right up to the sw corner of our yard where it paused (about 60 feet away) before it slowly started reversing direction to head back across the golf course toward green acres terrace across the golf course. when it got over to the circle on green acres terrace it reversed again and came back toward us but only came back until it was about 100 yards away this time. when it reversed this time it went farther away and then came back toward us again but did not get as close as the previous time. i asked my father, \"dad, what is that?\" he said, \"i don't know.\" i knew what it was; a ufo. i told my brother to go inside and get my polaroid camera. he said, \"you go get it!\" the object seemed to be almost swinging back and forth as it moved in a kind of searching pattern back and forth across the golf course moving further away with each pass until it was gone within 15-20 minutes. it was rotating slowly the whole time.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

have a cigg. as i was exiting through the sliding glass door, i noticed a light in the sky. this, of course, is not an uncommon sight. there is a municipal airport in my city and 3 international airports within 30 miles of here in wich this area is the major traffic coridor for. so my first thought always is airplane. anyway, before i opened the door, i thought i saw the light move very erratically, from left to right. i kept watching as i stepped outside. thinking the movement might be an illusion because of my movement i stopped and watched it. it was definately moving left to right and right to left with intermediate pauses. i have seen these many times since february of this year. but this one moved the most extreme to date. usually they just tack across the sky, very gradually, like a boat would on the sea. the best way to describe this object, is just a simple point of white, blue, or red light. this one was white. it reminds me of when i was a teen and i'd be outside at night and you'ed see a satillite cross the sky. but if you've ever seen one, you know they travel a very predictable path. a very clean arc across the sky. these look like that, except the movement. and to date, they never moved this obviousely. usually only in small increments. it was going from west to east till it went out of sight. my reaction was that was the best personal evidence i've seen with my own eye's that i didn't see a satillite. i then sent a \"fast blast\" to coast-to-coast am w/george noorey. i then found web site i could report it to and did. i kept watching it till the house next door blocked my view.
