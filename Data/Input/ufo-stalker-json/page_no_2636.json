sunset. i didn't look to see the exact time. the sky was pink, orange and reddish colors that indicated the sun was in the process of setting sometime soon. there were huge puffy white clouds low in the sky as i sat in my car facing a northerly direction on route 110 at the corner of melville road intersection where i had to stop for a red light. i was first in line in the left turn lane as i intended to turn left into melville road heading west towards farmingdale. i looked at the traffic light for a second after it turned red and then my gaze suddenly went towards the right of it because i noticed what i thought was the moon. this object was directly to the right of a huge white cloud and this 'moon' was just hanging there. i kept looking at it and noticed that it was a lot larger than the moon would ordinarily be, and that it was shimmering. i remember thinking to myself, \"why in the world is that moon shimmering?\". i'd never seen the moon do that and the color of it was like a silvery-white and very round, almost like a smooth satiny finish to it that is more like a shimmery atmosphere, than a material. it was absolutely beautiful. \r\ni kept watching it while waiting for the red light to turn green and it remained stationary so i believed it was the moon. but then it started to move downwards adjacent to the cloud and i then knew it wasn't the moon i was looking at. as it moved downward it gradually turned into an elliptical shape and it struck me that i was witnessing a genuine ufo in flight. \r\ni was angry at myself for not having my camcorder on hand in the car and moved so that my rear-view mirror was almost in line with the ufo. i had lined up the object while it was still a round shape next to the mirror and saw that the object was a bit bigger than the size of a quarter compared with the mirror. when the ufo reached the bottom of that cloud it resumed its round shape and hovered for a few seconds, then started moving under that same cloud towards the west. the traffic light had not changed yet so i kept watching the ufo and saw it move towards the west under the cloud, which was more grayer on the bottom of it by then. the ufo kept travelling towards the west at a great speed in about 2 seconds and after it got to the other side of that same cloud, it went upwards in a vertical path while still appearing as a sphere. after the ufo arrived at the top of the cloud but still adjacent to it, it went behind the cloud and disappeared from my sightline.\r\ni have never seen anything like that before in my entire life, or since, but in those three minutes or so of watching that object, i truly believed it was extra-terrestrial. i've never done drugs or alcohol and was not on medication and my mind was perfectly clear and i have no emotional problems. there was nothing at all that would make me doubt what i saw was an accurate witnessing of a ufo. after i watched the ufo duck behind that cloud, i thought that maybe i should have gotten out of the car and told the person in the car next to mine to look up in the sky. i didn't do that which i now regret. i might have had other witnesses to back me up also. however, i did feel that i was privileged to have seen this ufo and it may never happen to me again in my lifetime. but just for this one time, i saw somethng that many people never get a chance to, probably because they don't bother looking at the sky like i did. after the light changed to green, i had to drive on and continue home. i have since told several people, including members of my family, about my ufo sighting, but they apparently don't or won't believe. it's not surprising since they didn't have first-hand experience like i did. yes, at first i thought maybe i was hallucinating so i pinched my skin hard a few times and no, i hadn't fallen asleep and dreamt it. i later on realized that melville and some of long island is home to many aerospace related companies and that, perhaps, these ufos are observing them. they couldn't possibly have been hovering over long island just to watch the traffic patterns and other evidence of human development, could they? i also thought that if the ufo isn't extra-terrestrial, then maybe the u.S. government is testing  spacecraft that can hover above cities and then move at great speeds to another area. but then, where did the government get that kind of technology that possibly nobody else has? i have since retired and moved away from long island but i am still very much fascinated and curious about that ufo i witnessed and all others. i certainly hope that valid answers will be forthcoming soon before i grow too old to care anymore. sorry, i have no photos of the incident. just my vivid memories of it.

(is there any known weather balloon or anything that fits that description?) it appeared to be quite close (although it is admittedly difficult to judge distances of lights in the dark sky) and was completely silent.\r\n\r\ni was quite excited and told my wife what was happening. when she put me on hold (oddly, to tell a customer at her work that i was watching a ufo), i started yelling out loudly that there was a ufo in the sky, hoping that one of the neighbors would look up. i���m sure i sounded like a nut, but i was hoping that some other people would see what i was seeing (i don���t know if anyone heard or looked up and saw it). \r\n\r\nit was moving fairly quickly, and since the air was very still, it seems unlikely that this was a balloon or anything else floating in the wind. i ran inside and grabbed my camera. the object was still quite close but i was having a hard time getting the camera to focus on it in the dim light. frustrated, i watched it for a little while longer and decided to try to take a picture again. this time it focused and i got the attached snapshot. it was quite far away by now and appeared as just a small dot in the sky. in the picture the object looks blurred because, presumably, the shudder speed was long. the combination of the movement of the object and my hand shaking is what caused the object the be shaped that way (i am assuming this because it was clearly round to my eye).\r\n\r\nalso attached is a photoshop sketch of what i saw, as the photo is so poor and doesn���t really illustrate my sighting. it���s quite a cartoon-ish attempt but i think it shows what i saw well enough.\r\n\r\ni have another report from 12-28-2004 that i can send you, along with another photo, if you would like. let me know. i hope you can look into this sighting tonight and let me know if there is any explanation for what i saw tonight (and have seen many times here in prescott valley).\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

were standing outside of the school discussing upcoming sports events while the girls played in a nearby playground. during our conversation one of the mothers stopped speaking mid-sentence, pointing upwards behind me. i turned around immediately and saw two lights, one red, the other white, clearly visible in the sky east of me. these lights appeared to be at least a mile away and at a fairly low altitude (to be an aircraft). the lights seemed to be traveling at high speed, heading from south to north and remained visible to me for at least 5 seconds before they 'vanished'. the sky was rather clear, with very few scattered clouds. the lights didn't go behind a cloud or other obstruction from my vantage point. \r\n   there is an airport not far away but i've lived here my whole life and i'm used to seeing aircraft approaching and leaving and these lights were not in an area nor heading, nor speed, nor altitude consistent with this. the other odd thing about the lights was that they appeared to blink, not like aircraft strobe lights which flash.\r\n   i could see the lights clearly, enough to distinguish their color, but i could not discern an object between them, probably due to the low light at the time.I'm sure the sun had already set by this time so i doubt this was a trick of light on a cloud. i've also seen military aircraft over the years fly over this area at a similar altitude and speed but these were always clearly heard. so far as i know noone there heard any sound from the object.\r\n   at first i thought the object to by a low flying jet, but the lack of engine noise at what appeared to be such a close distance makes me think otherwise. in all likelihood it was an aircraft;but, the speed, odd blinking of the lights and abrupt way in which the object disappeared from sight leaves me baffled.\r\n   i continued to observe the the sky for several minutes, thinking the object may have turned, causing me to lose sight of the lights, but i saw nothing else.\r\n\r\n   i hope i haven't wasted your time and that maybe this report might help in some way. thank you.","distance":"Over One

2 bedrooms and 2 brothers in one bedroom, mom and dad downstairs.I was a teen at the time, 13, maybe 14yrs. old. i'm not real sure on the year it happened, i'm guessing around 1967-68. all i remember is me and one of my sisters who is 2 years older then me looking out our window from our bedroom and staring at this saucer shaped ufo hovering over the trees in our front yard.Don't really remember why we woke up and no-one else did, everyone else was asleep. i remember being so amazed at the beautiful lights rotating around the bottom rim of the saucer. they were moving in a clockwise rotation red, and then turn green in a counterclockwise, and then yellow. i remember there were little windows, i'm thinking maybe three, from my view, that i kept trying to see in, just kind of a warm yellow glow, i'm trying so hard to see something inside. remember,we are looking out from the upstairs window, and its less then 30 to 40 yards away, almost eye level its so low. no sound at all that i can recall, i can't keep my eyes off of it. it moved a little out of our view so that we had to run to another bedroom to watch it, waking up a younger sibling who got so scared when she asked us what we were doing, and we replied, watching a flying saucer, she got up to look out and it shot in the air so fast by the time she got to the window she could barely see it. what puzzles us to this day almost 40 years later is why we didn't scream the house down, or run downstairs to wake up our parents. we just simply went back to bed and went right to sleep. we didn't talk about it to each other for years. i think this bothers me the most, you would think we would have stayed up all night talking about what we had seen. we casually mentioned it to our mother when we were adults, and she said she had seen lights out by the barnlot several times before they moved in 1969 when my brother had been killed in vietnam. through the years i have seen other unexplained things in the sky, but nothing compared to that night. i will never forget it!!\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet,

noticed a bright object low in the sky, which i thought was a star . i had a 4 inch reflective telescope and told one of the kids to run in the house and get it for me.  i sent it up on its tripod and proceeded to watch the star.  i couldn't keep it insite when i realized it was moving.  i finally moved the telescope in accordance with its movements and soon discovered that i was not looking at one light, but three.  these were not lights like a headlight, but more like interior lighting . i kept watching it, keeping my telescope aimed at it and this went on for probably 20 minutes, since this was late in the evening it was getting dark and although i could not see the outline of the object, the lights were visible all the time.  there were no other lights, no running lights, no strobes, just these three illuminations.  since i am a private pilot and spent three years in the air force i knew something about flying and do have  running lights , and this thing had none . the time it got up to me i estimate it was maybe 300 to 400 feet above the ground and when about a quarter of a mile from my location it made a left turn which took it straight west. when i first saw it it was in the southeastern sky and came straight towards me for 20 minutes or so.  when it made a left turn i could no longer see anything.  the rules of flying keep you at least 1000 feet above the city or high enough to glide to a safe distance in case of engine failure.  i doubt this thing was anymore than 400 feet above the ground.  i had an insurance agency and had been talking with some of my agents about unidentified flying objects.  on monday morning when we were all together one of my agents told me, i would not believe what he saw.  he had been making an insurance call and decided he needed to relieve himself before he made the call.  he pulled down a side road, shut off his car, and was outside when he noted the three lights coming straight at him and going over his head at about 400 feet above the ground.  he described to me exactly what i had seen with my telescope.  i was in fort wayne, indiana and he was about 20 miles away from me close to decatur indiana.  we saw the same thing but it went right over his head.  i did not know then nor do i know now what i saw.  it was certainly an unidentified flying object.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

outside and around 9:15 pm. the intersection i turned from was route 700.\r\n\r\n2. tilden rd is a very dark country road. i immediately saw a bright red light over the north side of the road. because the road is so dark, the light stood out right away. it was a small globe of a red light that blinked on and off. although i looked very hard, there were no other colored lights associated with the globe. that seemed odd to me because airplanes and helicopters always have white or green lights too.  \r\n\r\n3. at first i thought it was mars but then i realized it was too bright to be mars and was in the wrong spot in the sky. then i saw that it was moving, slowly, from north to south, and i knew it could not be a planet. it was a small globe of a bright red light. of course i thought it could be an airplane or a helicopter, but then it started to zig-zag up and down slowly in a meandering line, which no aircraft would do. it made no sound and seemed to be about 10-15 treetop levels up in the sky. again, it did not have any white or green lights associated with it; it was just red. it blinked slowly.\r\n\r\n4. it moved slowly from north to south. i turned a bend in the road and lost the object behind some trees. i drove a short way down the road to my house, and got out of the car. i could not see the light in the sky above the house. i went inside and told my husband al about the light. he wanted to see it, but i wanted to i stay home (i'm 9-1/2 month's pregnant and did not feel like leaving the house again). \r\n\r\nhe got into the car and drive down tilden rd toward allyn rd to look for the light. he was driving west. he caught sight of the red globe on the north side of tilden rd a short way away from our house, above a clearing. he said when he saw the red light it did not blink on and off at all and stayed steady. it was halfway between the middle of the sky and the horizon. it did not appear to be moving. as soon as he pulled the car over and got a good look, it suddenly disappeared, as if it knew he was looking at it. it was not near any trees or clouds, it just disappeared. \r\n\r\n**what is noteworthy is that when i saw the light, it was traceling from north to south, but when my husband al saw the light, it was in the far north region of the sky!**\r\n\r\n5. we were both very spooked by the light but also intrigued. i have completed college-level astronomy coursework and have engaged in skywatching, and i feel the object was out of the ordinary. my husband and i were both scared by the light.\r\n\r\n6. my husband drove home and told me what he saw. after some debating, i decided to take another look and we both got into the car and drove down the road to clearing. we did not see the red light again, but as we turned around to drive east to go home, we both clearly saw a bright white light flash up in the sky directly ahead of and above us. tilden rd is extremely rural and there are no light sources on or near the road.

about 11 pm at night.  after a short conversation about the days events, my friend mike pointed to a cloudless sky and  told me that he learned about  the location and names of constellations in science class and began pointing out  the little dipper and the names of certain other star formations for me.   as our eyes were scanning the horizion,  my friend happened to notice 3 colored lights that appeared to be close by.  it was dark of course,  but i would estimate the lights to be about two miles away and about one mile high above the ground.  we were with-in 5 miles of an airport,  so the occasional appearence of multi-colored lights of small aircraft in the sky  was not unusual,  and  we both agreed that this is probably what the lights were and continued to scan the skys looking for other interesting constellations.\r\n\r\nabout 15 minutes later,  my friend looked to the horizon again and brought to my attention that the multi-colored lights were still in the same place as they were before.  we naturally thought that this was very odd,  but decided that it was either another airplane traveling the same flight path or the same plane had circled and just happened to be in the same location that we were looking.  we quickly went back to obsevering the stars. \r\n\r\nsome time later,  about 20 minutes,  i happened to look in the direction of what we both dismissed as a airplane sighting,  and again,  in the very same place and of the exact orintation, i saw the same multi-colored lights.  i quickly brought it to the attention of my friend and together we tried to come up with a rational explanation as to why and how  an object could suspend itself in the air in the same exact place.  i finally  came to the conclusion that it must be a heliocopter,  but my friend reminded me that heliocopters are extemely noisey and it was a very quiet night with no breezes. if  the object was a heliocopter, we would definitely hear the sound of the motor and rotor blades.\r\n\r\nwe both became very puzzled,  and our attention was now focused directly on the object for about 10 minutes.  as we stared at the lights, i strained to make out some kind of outline or silhouette of the object,  but i could not see any definite shape because the object seemed to absorb what little light was available and blend into the night sky.  just as we were discussing what this thing could be,  it  suddenly moved at tremendous speed to our left at a 45 degree angle upward, about 5 miles in the sky, paused for a brief second, and then shot straight upwards  to the very outer  stratosphere of the earth,... then stoopped,  hovered,  appearing as a point of light for a second,  and then suddenly  propelling itself into deep space at an even faster speed that i had ever seen any man-made aircraft accelerate to.\r\nthe acceleration was so abrupt, that it is hard to believe that anything alive inside the craft could survive the g-forces involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy friend and i looked at eachother in astonishment,... all we could say to eachother is \"woa\",... \"what was that?\".  the next day we told all are friends.  some of are friends believed us,  but most did not.  however,  those that did not believe us, could not come up with an explanation either.  i am in my 50's now,  but i will never forget the experience,  and the memory of it is still fresh in my mind like it happened yesterday.  at the age of 17 years old, i was a (\"i don't believe it, unless i see it\") kind of a young man,  and i cerntainly did not  believe in extraterrestial spacecraft,  but after this 1969 sighting, i soon changed my opinion..\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
