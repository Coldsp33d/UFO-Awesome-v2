about 8:45 pm cdt i noticed a solid, white unblinking light moving due north. it appeared a few degrees east of alioth, the 1st star in the handle of the big dipper. at that time it was about 40 degrees above the nw horizon, at an azimuth of 315 degrees.  by it's brightness (about the same as alioth at magnitude 1.8) and speed i assumed that it was a satellite in low orbit.  i watched it for maybe 30 seconds, until it was near megrez, in the upper left corner of the \"dipper\", then looked away. that's about 5 degrees south of where it started.\r\n\r\nless than a minute later i looked back and it was gone.  instead there was a much dimmer light but moving at exactly the same speed and over exactly the same path, but in the opposite direction.  i'd estimate it's brightness as similar to megrez, or magnitude 3.3.  it disappeared within a minute when it was a little south of alioth.  there was no noise, no change in color or brightness or direction except that presumed course reversal.\r\n\r\nbtw, i used astronomy software to get all these numbers except duration. that's an estimate.  everything else is accurate.\r\n\r\ni tried to find out what i saw. i had seen a satellite about 15 minutes earlier in another part of the sky.  when i checked to see what satellites were visible between 8:20 and 9:20 i was able to identify that first satellite, but no satellites passed close to alioth at all. i'm also an amateur pilot, and i doubt it was an aircraft; there were no running lights and no strobes.  it couldn't have been a landing light because it got dimmer, not brighter, as it moved south.  \r\n\r\ni know this is not exactly a major sighting but this is the 1st moving thing i've ever seen in the sky that i couldn't readily identify, and i've been looking for

greensburg.  i saw a very bright light hovering in the sky in the distance.  at first i thought it was the moon or a tower light, but i had never seen it there before.  it was too bright to be a tower and too small to be the moon, plus i could see the moon.  the object stood still for a few seconds and then moved straight up slightly, then fell out of the sky at a 45 degree angle.  it fell very low to the ground, i thought that maybe it hit ground.  it fell directly in front of me and to my right.  it fell below the level of the buildings in the area, but i was unsure of its exact distance away.  it startled me.  i drove towards it down pittsburgh street trying to see if i could still see it, but it was gone.  i know it wasn't a comet because it lacked a tail it was just a ball of white light.  i was at the top of the hill and i tried to get closer, but once i was in the valley i turned around and went home.  it was in about the same area that i was in a few weeks ago, but the other time it was a series of three green flashes of light in the sky, big enough to see from a great distance.  i was inside at the time, but immediately after the last flash all the power in the area went out, it only went out for a minute or so, but i think that the two events were connected.  this would have been about the same time last month.

especially since it was starting to get dark(for air safety reasons). then i called out to my brother and a friend who were in the kitchen at the time, and said quote'look at this weird object in the sky' they ran out and saw it as well. the object was very clear, it was very very very odd that it did not make a sound or have any lights what so ever, was just a circular dark object. it was moving east to west for a minute or so, then just stoped and hovered at that position for a good 5 minutes, then strangely started heading away from us, untill it vanished into the clouds at a distance. the second we all saw the object, we knew within a second that this was not ordinary, infact we were happy that we had seen it and laughing while staring at it, saying to each other i cannot beleive we are looking at a ufo. this was seen by 3 people and we all know for a fact that it was strange, and definately something that could not be explained. i can assure anyone it was clear and obviously a

the state (iowa city, brooklyn, knoxville, des moines area, atlantic, 30 miles west of fort dodge,and from i-80 in the stuart - menlo area) within minutes following sighting at approximately 5:50 a.M.  most witnesses had the impression they were seeing a white-to-green ball of light close up, that is, within several miles of their location, although one witness in northern iowa thought it was in the omaha area some 100 plus miles sw of his position.\r\n\r\nfollowing show hosts verbally wondering about mufon, beverly trout, mufon state director for iowa, called in and was put on the air, giving telephone and e-mail address, and then when the show received lots of calls the following morning, with callers wondering what mufon had found through investigation, trout called in during a break and host put her on the air again.\r\n\r\ninvestigated by telephone by beverly trout with 10 witnesses.....\r\n\r\nwhite-to-green ball of light moving from east to west, with some \"falling\" motion specified by the witnesses, and with reports of 2 to 7 seconds duration, to most witnesses seeming to be at high altitude, i.E. above average commercial flight altitude of 35,000.\r\n\r\nperceived speed of object shows some variance.  some witnesses indicate this was slower than a meteorite/falling-star event, indicating a somewhat floating motion.  others saw it as very fast, but still not in the falling-star/meteor category.\r\n\r\none witness sitting on his deck drinking coffee reports it \r\nwent over his head at 90 degrees as it then headed on west.\r\nhe reports a smoke trail behind it, but no diminishing in size (and upon being questioned, none of the witnesses report the ball of light as diminishing in size as it seemed to move west and downward while in their line of sight.  two other witnesses indicate that they thought there might have been a little elongation (trail??) to the light\r\n\r\nthe witnesses are not sure what they saw, citing color, movement etc. as being a bit different than they think a meteor ought to look - although not ruling out that possibility.\r\n\r\none witness, a lady truck driver, on i-80 at mile marker 87 headed west to blair, nebraska, maintains that the light/object moved to within 1/4 mile of her position on i-80 and down over a field to the right (north side) of i-80, and at about the altitude of 300 feet the light simply went out.  she wanted to stop and go investigate, but had to deliver a load to blair at 8:00 a.M., so didn't have the time.  she estimates size of the light as size of semi-trailer and about ten (10) feet across, and that it was moving at no more than 50-75 miles per hour as it descended to the estimated 300 feet altitude over the field.\r\n\r\nthe witness west of fort dodge, iowa was looking sw, and if he had been seeing (at the same time) what the truck driver thought she saw, he'd have had to look sse.\r\n\r\nfrom telephone conversations with the various witnesses, it would appear that mufon is left with an inconclusive investigation.....\r\n\r\nquestions that at present have no answer:\r\n1 - was this only one (1) event??? with the possibility that something did come down close to the ground, and then move off briefly with lights out, and then perhaps move on to resume a colorful lighted passage on west???\r\n2 - could there have been two (2) events (given the truck driver's perception; or was she simply way off in her estimation of distance and size?\r\n3 - in some past cases ufos in trouble have been able to continue on their way after sometimes descending to a lower altitude; could this be an example?  who knows?\r\n\r\ncertainly, this remains an open case.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3857,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6030948,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09182005-0001","longitude":-93.6045164,"occurred":1126702200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1126702200000,"summary":"White
