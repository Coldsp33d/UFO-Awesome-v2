saw john and his helper, leon, coming down the road (leon joiner road) in john's truck.  he saw me and we stopped to talk at a pond across from leon's house.  it was beginning to be dusk.  it was between 7 and 8 pm.\r\n\r\ni pulled over and parked and we (leon and i) were standing beside john's truck talking. i noticed an orange, pinkish object over leon's shoulder that caught my attention.

looked up in the sky to see the stars. i immediantly noticed two bright orange objects high in the sky above our car. at first i thought they were stars but the orange color gave them away. i alerted my dad who was at the wheel and he pulled over and my dad and mom and i got out to look closer. the objects did appear very high, silent, and positioned side by side not moving at all. after a few minutes the object on the right started moving slowly away from the other and then just appeared to go dark and dissapeared. the remaining object was motionless for 15 seconds or less and then just like someone turning a light switch off, just went dark without appearing to move at all and disappeared. we drove on home (next street over) and i remember my parents discussing the incident, wondering just what we had seen. i called the local branch of the weather service(just in case) and ask them if there were any weather baloons in the area that night. they said there were none and
