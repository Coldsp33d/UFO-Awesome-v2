{"content":[{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Thunderbolt","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This sighting happened in mid september 1974. i was 22 at the time. i lived with my mother on wilmington island outside savannah, ga. my brother, a friend and i were driving into savannah in his small chevrolet truck to see a friend. it was dusk and just starting to get dark. my brother turned on his headlights and they came on but immediately started to dim. we were on a bridge over the intracoastal waterway leading into thunderbolt. when we \r\nwere over the bridge he pulled off onto a road by the river leading to a marina and we stopped to try and find out what was wrong. three friends of ours in a van saw the truck \r\nfrom the bridge and came over to see what we were doing. one of them worked at a gas station and had a little mechanical training. i got out from under the hood as it was now getting crowded and leaned against the side of the truck looking out over the marsh. i saw bright lights in the sky and was trying to determine what it was when one of our friends from the van looked out over the marsh and said, \"that's a f*cking flying saucer!\". i was coming to \r\nthe same conclusion but wanted to be sure before i told anyone else. it was a metallic disk fairly large or much closer than i though, i guessed it was 60-80 feet in diameter. it had a round bottom and top with a small dome in the middle of the top. there was a short mast on \r\ntop of the dome. there were bright white lights rotating around the rim of the disk and a steady blue light on top of the mast. though it was getting dark when we first saw it it appeared to have a dull metallic finish. it looked just like a cartoon flying saucer. i thought it was about 1/2 a mile away and about 1500-2000 feet in the air. it was north of us moving slowly west. there was no sound from it. we watched it for a couple of minutes until we lost \r\nsight of it behind trees on the bluff at the edge of the marsh. the friend with mechanical training had traced the problem to a known bad voltage regulator and managed to unstick it so we could use the headlights. we closed the hood and were standing near the truck talking when the ufo came back into view from behind the trees. it was lower now and closer. we watched it and soon realized it was headed straight for us and still getting lower. when it was \r\nprobably 200-300 yards away and now down to about 500 feet i started worrying that maybe we were in danger. i didn't know it at the time the but several of the others were also starting to get worried. the ufo stopped moving and hovered for about 10-15 seconds (at least it seemed) then it slowly started moving towards the northeast and began gaining altitude. after it reached approximately the altitude we had first seen it at it picked up a little more speed \r\nand continued on a northeast course more or less following the path of the wilmington river. even at the fastest we saw it move it was probably going only 25-50 mph. a few minutes after it left a car with six excited teenagers in it pulled up along side. they said they had been following a flying saucer they saw at isle of hope and wanted to know if we had seen it. we were getting in our respective vehicles and had been there for 20-30 minutes so we told them we hadn't seen it. you could actually still see it's lights to the northeast if you knew where to look. there was no mention of anyone else seeing it in the newspaper or on the television news. it had to have been visible  to other people crossing the bridge over the river. we didn't report it either. this sighting happened about four miles from hunter army airfield which was not active at the time. i don't know whether they even used the radar during the time it was in caretaker status. the illustration is crude but the shape and the lights are as accurate as i could make them. the drawing was done in about 1993 using ms paint. i took a picture of the monitor since all i had was a dot matrix printer. i lost the file to a hard \r\ndrive failure so this is a scan of the monitor photo done a couple of years later.","distance":"501 Feet

first one, because i was taking a class at the travis airforce base and they wouldn't let anyone off the base for about an hour. finally they let us go and my husband called me on my cell to tell me there is a ufo in the sky. he had one of those lights that have a billion watts and pointed at it and it came toward them and freaked them out. i came home and watched from my house and saw it zigzag back and forth then stopping in midair hovering and then there was a flash of light and 4-6 objects shot out of it downward and then the object left. it happened again in january i believe. me and my son joked around and would looked if we saw our friends in the sky...And they came again...And again... we've noticed they been coming every two months. there was an incident were there were crop circles before all this happened. my son woke me up last month about 4 or so in the morning to show me the object in the sky...He was flashing the light at it and it would follow it if he moved it to the left and then when he moved it to the right and it followed. it scared me so i made him stop. but i want you to know that i will try to be more thorough and try to get a video of it. i saw a broadcast on the tv... so i decided to tell you guys what is going on here in fairfield late at

very large blinding white light and the other lights were not colored or flashing.\r\n\r\ni was on the beach in malibu at night around 8pm with my dog...Like the article below they were moving slow and rather low, cruising as if patroling the beach and nearby mountain area.  \r\n\r\ni do not rememeber hearing any engine but at the time they were so obvious i took them for military vehicles (us)..It is only later when i talked to pilots and found out there is no known craft fitting the 'wedge-shaped' description, did it occur to me that they might not be ours.\r\n\r\nthe size was larger than an average plane but not outrageously large like some triangles are being described.  they might be considered about the size of 2 planes..But the body is 'fat' and they look very sort of chunky unlike the ufo's i've seen that move at incredibly rapid speeds.\r\n\r\nthe first one came toward the beach perpendicular to it flying inland from out in the ocean --when i first saw it, it appeared to be a star from far away but then it got larger (a blinding white light) and seemed to be stationary over the ocean..I began to think it was a helicopter..But it finally came close and flew overhead and i could see it was this clunky wedge-shaped body, it sort of curved and fly overhead then another one came out of the north and from behind me and also flew in a leisurely way overhead...Since there were two and i was still thinking they had to be ours because they looked so ..Workhorse like and really seemed to be patroling..I didn't pay much more attention..I didn't lose sight of them they continued cruising around for a while.  i was on the beach walking my dog for about 45 mins..I am attaching a photo i found online that approximates the way they looked..\r\n","distance":"501

that might have made me more aware than others to take a second look at these lights. with my naked eye they just look like stars but way too low in the sky for stars. one is bigger and brighter than the other. they have come every night for the last 4 or 5 nights. they show up before sunset and are gone about an hour and a half later. i got some excellent video footage of these lights. when i zoom in the larger light (actually both lights, but i focused more on the one i could see better) it changes from brilliant white to purple to emrald green and sometimes seems to change shape. i can see right into the thing as it changes colors but it has a distinct border...It's not like a blob light it's very purposefull in shape. these lights hover and are pretty still.\r\n\r\ni am in the elverta, california area. if anyone from here reads this these lights are appearing it seems somewhat over elverta road just down from the cherry brook fire dept. i see them from my backyard and i live on colonnade way. if anyone from this area reads this please keep your eyes to the sky... also at around 10 pm every night for a week there is another light that comes pretty much directly over the fire station and it is gone by 11:30 pm my video does not take night time shots very well so i have not been able to capture this one on film. it is a single light too low to be a star but high enough that people would preobably think it was one.\r\n\r\nalso enclosed in this report are two pictures i snapped of a seperate incident about a week ago ..Maybe a week and a half of a silver round light object right over my duck pond. this object was moving and caught my eye as i walked out back one morning around 8 am approx. i ran for my camera and got off 2 snaps of it before it traveled

georgia tech.  i went outside where my wife had just pulled in the driveway from visiting a friend.  i lit a cigarette and was sitting on the porch with her discussing her friend's impending divorce. the time was about 11:55 pm.  i glanced into the cloudless night sky and saw what appeared to be a shooting star without its tracer racing from the south heading in a northern direction.  i grabbed my wife's arm and pointed towards the object (she has never seen a meteorite and i was excited).  it was high...Looked to be skipping across the atmosphere at an extremely high rate of speed.  it was orb-shaped, almost as if staring at a distant street light with a faint halo.  the whole object had what i can only refer to as a faint, dark illumination surrounded by this halo.  on either side, it had a brighter illumination similar to a faint satellite catching the suns rays two hours after sunset. it was almost triangular, but that could be my imagination.  before i could say the words shooting star, it slowed tremendously and veered east in a pendulum motion, then north, then continued back to where it had first slowed in a southern direction.  during this southern veer, three more similar objects appeared... one from the south, one from the southeast, and one from the southwest.  one moment, they were not there, and the second moment they were.  i did not see them race across the sky like the first object.  they just suddenly appeared and slowed.  all four converged on each other as if showing some kind of interest, forming a circle.  then, they rotated counter-clockwise and diappeared instantly towards the north.  all four vanished just as quickly as the three objects had appeared, almost like a meteorite burning out.  i can honestly say that i have always been fascinated with the \"what if\" possibility of this sort of phenomenom, but have always said that i would not believe unless one landed in my yard and offered me a drink.  my wife witnessed this same event, and even though her excitement was truly non-existent, i cannot say the same for mine.  it has changed my beliefs.  i immediately called my brother in north carolina and woke him up to tell him.  i feel like i need to tell everyone i know, but at the same time, i don't want to become the weird person in the neighborhood.  what i saw was amazing.  all my life, i've looked at stars, planets, satellites, comets, and meteorites, and i can say i have never in my life seen something like this.  it lasted approximately ten seconds, but honestly, it was probably even shorter than that.  about ten minutes after the occurence, a jet high above plodded across the sky.  the speed of these objects were 100's of times faster.  it was as if they went from 5000 mph to 500 mph instantaneously.  i am still somewhat in shock.  i watch all of these \"crazy people\" report their abductions and their visitations on these shows that aire about ufos.  like most of the population, i laugh at some of the stories we read and witness on tv.  i don't know if i can laugh anymore.  i don't know what to believe.  i'm still amazed almost 18 hrs after the event.  is that a common type of sighting?  they weren't in my backyard... they were high above like a meteorite.  wow","distance":"Over One

blacktop that heads south off of sr 159 just east of blackhawk. we got maybe 1 1/2 miles down the road when i noticed a bright light on the left side of the road up in the sky,i asked my girlfriend to look at the light and i asked her \"why would a plane have it's landing lights on out here?\" i knew there is no airports around this area to land a plane! we dropped down into a low spot in the road and lost sight of it for a moment,when we came back up,it began slowly moving over the roadway ahead of where we were driving. as we approached,it moved from our left side to our right side and i said \"what the hell is that!!!\" as we got closer. the whole time the object stayed about tree top level,maybe 50 to 75 feet off the ground and moved across a farmfield on our right side.As we drove up beside the field i stopped the truck and said again \"what is that??\" my girlfriend said \"i don't know\" as she staired out the window,i wanted a clearer view so i rolled down my window and sat on the window opening looking across the truck roof as the object had stopped moving over a grove of trees about 100 to 150 feet away from the road. i reached inside the truck and shut off the running engine of the truck,my girlfriend asked me \"what are you doing?\" being freaked out alot by what she was seeing. \"sshhh!\" i said. \"what are you doing!!!\" she asked again. \"ssshhhhh!!! shut up and listen!!\" i said. the object was making no sound,but a wind or hissing sound. we couldn't see a outline very well but by the pattern of it's lights it must have been disk or triangular shaped. it had a light on the very top and different colored lights around it's edge,underneathe it was what looked like \"windows\" and at the bottom center was a single red light flashing slowly. both me and my girlfriend (weird thing was) at the same time felt like we became afraid and needed to leave the area right away,so we started the truck and left the area. we never told anyone and later found out other people in that area had called the local tv station reporting a ufo in the area (wtwo station in farmersburg,in.)this is the first time i have reported this to anyone,all these people are seeing something!!! i have been afraid to tell anyone because the public thinks you are some kind of a \"nut\", i'm sorry i withheld this so long.","distance":"101-500

through a dangerous pass around the right side of a small peak. i had been in a prayerful contemplative mood when i looked up towards the area where the peak was and noticed the four lights. initially i supposed they were two cars headlights folowing one another, but i remembered there was no road at that height, in fact it wrapped the base and i was on it. i believe just before the lights appeared a cool circular wind began to buffet me in circular and upward movements then all of a sudden the 4 lights shot forward and struck me in the chest. the next thing i remember i was taking a step as a great explosion of light seemed to leave my head. i was absolutely freightened following. the lights were gone but i became rather paranoid immediately following and was rather afraid to continue on

was going and drove me the rest of the way. i offered to buy him a coffee, he declined, turned around and went back the way we had come. later that night i looked up and saw a group of stars that looked a little like a kite. for some reason i took to them and started identifying with them in some way i guess. i used to call them the stars of sam the name of my girlfriend at the time. later i

jumpers. it is a quiet spot in the burbs but not an isolated one. i frequent this spot and do a little fishing etc. allot of people go there. it closes at dark although there are no gates. on this particular night i was star gazing at sunset as it was a good observation point to watch an unusual planetary alignment that had been going on for at least a week. i'm not an expert on star gazing but the planets seemed to be in the western sky near a crescent moon. as the moon cycle changed it moved away from the planets.  anyway i gazed for what i thought was about 15 min and decided to call it a night and started back to my truck. as i approached my truck i could see police on the other side of the pond in the local cemetary shining thier spotlights into the area i was parked. i thought, jeez i better get out of here or the'll be down here busting my chops for being here after hours. i drove home. when i got home it was 10:30 pm  an utter impossibilty  i only live ten minutes from the boat launch. i estimated my time being there as 1 hour tops. i got ther about 15 min before sunset and as stated only gazed for 15 minutes maybe 30 minutes tops. when i started thinking about the whole ordeal i got very confused. were the police on the other side of the pond investigating something? i have never seen them in this location with spotlights and i have no clue why they would be looking from that location to my location as they could have just driven over to where i was in about 5 minutes. it does not make sense? i also noticed that i had a sore on my lower back that itched and had like a kinda a welt near it. it wasn't painfull or anything just itchy. it was gone the next day. well this is my story, it is completely true. i estimate i cannot account for approximatley one hour of time perhaps a little more. i dont have any recollection of anything like an abduction happening or anything like that .\r\nbut i can assure you something happened down there. what it was i cannot say but i am still puzzled some days later.
