still hoovering about 3 minutes had passed i started shaking and getting nervous and video taped the lights and them took pictures and noticed they were getting a little farther away from me and told myself i have to call someone i know, so i called my friend kimmie and asked her to go outside and see if she can see any lights in the sky, by this time i was shaking because the lights weren't moving just hoovering. i decided to take a second video and watched as one light faded off and disappeared in a blink. my friend i called was in montgomery by lake conroe she didn't see any lights that night. i asked the owner of the house can airplanes bye seen from here be seen going to the airport she said no. i knew they weren't airplanes or weather balloons. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501

point military academy and stewart airport are nearby. i am in between these two and often see helicopters flying over.\r\nthe light was extremely bright and i couldn't see behind it as it was pointed straight at me.\r\nas i waited to ball the pilot out i realized it wasn't making any noise, and it just seemed to be looking back at me.\r\nthen i realized i had my phone in my side pocket. i began to

it covered five foot of the sky from my view in just a minute.  the star seemed to get brighter and then dimmed.  the star had an odd shape.  it had tree spikes from the top and the what looked like
