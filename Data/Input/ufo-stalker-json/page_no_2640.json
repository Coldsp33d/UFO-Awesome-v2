memories, they were of the same place, surroundings, fears, etc. her family has experienced abductions for many years, and i believe my association with them was not a coincidence. i have included

two police officers and a civilian pilot were in a 182 cessna aircraft about 10 miles south of a major northwest airport, operating in the arsa under approach control. the aircraft was in a race track holding pattern oriented north and south about one mile by two miles, at about three thousand feet msl over a freeway. the weather was clear with bright overhead sun, and no wind, smoke in the area was rising almost vertically. visibility and cieling were unlimited. the temperature was mild to warm. other aircraft were in the area but none were in the immediate vicinity. as the two pilots were involved with flying the aircraft, the observer in the back seat was spotting vehicles on the ground practicing techniques to acquire and maintain visual contact with targets on the ground. on the south bound leg, on the eastern most track, the observer saw a round ball like object about two to three feet in diameter with a seamless, mirror like surface tucked into the four o'clock position, relative to , and keeping pace with, the aircraft, about two hundred feet out and about three to five hundred feet below. there was no visible means of propulsion, and no light sources. the only reason it was visible was the contrast of the shiny object to the dark ground. the object was seen to follow the aircraft through a ninety degree turn to the west, then a ninety degree turn to the north. it continued in it's relative position, flying formation with the aircraft, on around to the southbound leg. this period of observation was made by the observer alone who did not notify the pilots, not wanting to be ridiculed. towards the end of the southbound leg the right seat pilot observed the object idependently and without being advised by the observer. upon being asked the observer then advised that he too saw the object. the left seat pilot could not see the object as it was tucked in too close to the right side of the aircraft. as the scheduled turn to the west was made the left seat pilot made an unusually steep bank and it was at that time he too saw the object. the observer asked about the possibility that the object was a mylar type silver ballon. it was pointed out that it was a virtually windless day and further that the indicated airspeed was about 75 knots and the object was maintaining it's position and turning with the aircraft. approach control was quiried as to the presence of any possible radar contacts in the immediate vicinity. the reply was negative. although there was no direct question as to what was being observed the controller asked the aproximate range from our aircraft to the contact and was advised within one quarter mile. there was a standy order then an advisory that there were no contacts in the area, and then , \"did we wish to make a report\". the left seat pilot did not think anyone would believe the incident, and that it would not be worth the trouble. the right seat pilot was a low time pilot and was concerned about possible sanctions against his license to fly. the observer went along with both pilots who decision was made not to report. the observation continued and an inquiry was made to the ground units by the observer if they could see anything in the proximity of the aircraft. the reply was negative, and when asked by ground units if we were watching a ufo the reply was, \"as a matter of fact yes we are\". there was no confirmation from the ground. then as the aircraft turned onto the northbound leg the object suddenly, and very smoothly accelerated out in front of the aircaft at about the same altitude. it covered the distance of about two miles in about two to three seconds accelerating from about seventy five knots. the object the executed a ninety degree right turn to the east, after a radical deceleration as the turn was made. this maneuver can be best described as the object displaying the characteristics of a 50 cal. tracer round fired from the aircraft. as the turn to the east was completed there was again a display of acceleration that was almost unbelievable. again the analogy of a 50 cal. tracer round is consistant with the flight characteristics of the object. the acceleration, a ballistic curve, and the speed were all about what one could expect when observing a projectile being fired from that type of weapon. the object was seen to enter the trees on the northwest shoulder of a mountain to the east, appearing to have crashed. that observation was made by one of the pilots. the observer was instructed to fix the exact location of possible impact while the pilots flew a north, northwesterly course from the southwest corner of the pattern intending to overfly and positively fix the location for ground investigation. as the aircraft approached to within about a mile to a mile and half of the possible point of impact, the object flew upwards out of the trees at about a twenty five to thirty degree angle to an approximate altitude of five thousand msl. the accelleration again was extremely fast and smooth, but as the object leveled out on a southerly course it, as rapidly, decelerated to a more liesurely pace, about one or two hundred knots. the object continued on this course for about thirty seconds to a minute when it executed a left turn, about forty fivr degrees to the south southeast and accelerated away at an astonishing rate dissappearing from sight in a very short time. a similar object was seen at a later time in an area to the southwest of the original incident displaying similar characteristics, such as altitude, speed, and last know direction of travel, to the south southeast at a high rate of speed. this information came about as a television show of video recorded sightings was on. the wife pointed out one of the objects, a silver ball, and mentioned her observations. she was unaware of the similarities of the two incidents at the time of the conversation. the pilot of the plane is an expierienced high time civilian pilot. the copilot is a low time licensed pilot and is a police officer with about fifteen years expierience. the observer is a twenty year police officer with some expierience flying and is a military veteran. both officers are still employed and the two pilots continue to fly.","distance":"101-500

when i was looking down again, i heard a sonic boom. i looked up and saw a plane flying overhead, and dismissed it at that. when i looked down again, what i didn't notice before, was a huge cylindar shaped craft, flying very low seemingly over a school a few houses up the street from where i live. i was glued to the spot, and took in every detail. at first i thought it was a top secret military craft or something of the sort, but the governmet wouldn't fly that over a city. it appeared to be about a block or so long, and about 1/2 tall and wide. the craft was completely convered in metal with many wires overalping the metal sheets connecting the entire outside of the craft with wires. some parts of it were rusted, and it looked very travel worn. it looked like it was made out of the exact same material as the death star in star wars. i looked for any openings for the pilot, but found none. when it started moving away, i saw that the entire backside was just a huge fan (about 1/2

taking a few minutes to travel a short distance, but all the while i was hearing a sonic boom, so it must have been traveling very fast. by this time the first plane that i saw was gone, so it couldn't have been that. when it started moving out of my field of vision, i went as fast as i could to the front of the house to see it better. even though it took so long to travel such a short distance, by the time i was at the front it was gone. i could not hear anything for a few seconds at that point. the birds even were not chirping, it was as if the world was on mute. i knew i could still hear because i could hear myself breathing. after a few seconds i was able to hear everything again, and everything seemed back to normal. i am the only person that i know that saw this or

highway 15 miles just east of salem. there were clouds in the sky in three different layers but no rain. as i was driving west i noticed through my perifial vision to my left that there was a large dark spot in the sky so i looked to my left and saw a large object floating about 30 feet off the ground! i yelled and emediantly slowed down the car and did a quick u turn and pulled over to the south side of the highway, got out of the car and looked very clearly at this thing! everyone in the car got out and asked what was wrong and i told them to look up over there and they gasped! this was an object with the exact demensions of a hocky puck in that it was flat on top, flat on the bottom and round on the edges. it was flat black and not shiny. it had no windows, no lights and made no sound. i noticed that the trees and shrubs just beneath it were not being disturbed in any way. also under this object was the county jail facility or some sort of correctional facility and there was a gaurd in one of the towers. we yelled at him to look up but he just looked at us. he and the facility were about 75 yards from the highway. this object was about 80 to 100 yards in diameter and was just so massive that i could hardly believe it even though i stood there looking at it! i could have easily thrown a rock at it and struck it. it was just floating there 30 feet off the ground and it was tilted at a 45 degree angle and it was that way for about 2 minuts or so then it began to move which sent all of us to hide behind the other side of the car. it titled over to its other side at 45 degrees and remained there for about another 3 minuts. this allowed us to see the roof of the object which was as flat and smooth as its underside. it really looked like a giant hocky puck and was flat black. it then tilted again to the other side for about 10 seconds and then slowly began to move westward at a 30 degree climb angle at about 40 mph. we got back into the car and u-turned to head west to follow it. it then picked up great speed and by that time i was already pegging 90 mph in persuit. just then a police car passed us with his cherries fully lit but no siren and i never even noticed that he was behind us. he passed us like we were sitting still and we all assumed that he was chasing this thing as well.\r\n \r\nif that was not bizarre enough what happened next was even more unbelievable. we lost site of this object in the low dark grey clouds but passed by an air national gaurd station about 5 miles east of salem. i u-turned again and went back to that station, got out of my car with my brother in-law and we told the gaurds there what had just happened. they were totally unconcerned! i wanted to speak to their radar operater but they refused to allow me on the base. after about 5 minuts of argueing, i had enough so i simply pushed one of them aside and ran for the building that i thought may have the radar in it. they tackeled me and put my arms behind my back and led me back to the gate. they threatened me that i was guilty of a federal crime by \"breaking into a federal facility\" and would be arested if i didn't leave. we got into our car and left there headed for salem again. we didn't see the police car or the ufo anymore.\r\n \r\nwe then arrived at our relatives house in salem and told them what had happened. to my amazement they chuckeled and said that they could tell that we were newcomers to oregon. i asked how. she said that they see them all the time! two days later at the vetenarian clinic while getting our dog a shot i told the vet what had happened. to my amaizment he too stated that this is a common occurance in and around salem! i heard this again from a store clerk and a parking attendant who states that on two seperate occations he personally spotted a ufo stuck to the side of one of the mountains east of salem. so if there are so many sightings why then aren't ufoligists going there to film these on a regular basis?\r\n \r\none thing is for sure, since that time on that highway my life has changed forever in that i am now obsessed with these crafts. i have dedicated all my spare and free time to understanding how these crafts fly, how their propulsion systems work and what intelligent race of beings fly them and why do they never come down to earth and land in the middle of a major traffic intersection and begin a dialog with us. this would block our govt's effort to convince us that what we see is swamp gas comming from the planet venus.\"","distance":"101-500
