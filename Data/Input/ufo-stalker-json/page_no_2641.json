noticed a strange movement of light in the sky (was in the middle of nowhere so it stuck out a bit!).\r\n\r\n3. at first i thought it was some kind of reflection on the windscreen but it was obvious it was not when my girlfirend said she could see it too. once we realised it was above the cloud level and had observed it's eratic movements we were a bit stunned.\r\n\r\n4. the object was a greeny grey colour (obscured by cloud)and resembled a fat rugby ball above the cloud level. it was a cloudy night yet we could see something moving beyond it. it's movements were completely eratic covering vast distances, left right, back and forward. changing direction far too quickly for it to be any kind of human craft. there didn't appear to be any noise (although we were inside the car travelling at the time). it was quite large as we could see it without looking hard and it was well up in the sky.\r\n\r\n5. at first i was a bit confused as i tried to think of a logical answer for what it could be. i was still driving so asked my girlfriend to have a look. she wasn't sure either and then confusion turned to a little fear. both a little freaked out being in the sticks and something strange above us. it was only a short distance back to the hotel and we had our eye on it all the way. when we reached the hotel we got out of the car and looked to the sky but whatever it was had gone. we probable saw it for approximately 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n6. we lost eye contact when we got out of the car and when we looked again it had gone.\r\n\r\nno piccies i'm afraid. only had a camera phone with us but were too stunned to think about taking pictures (and possibly a little scared to keep looking at it).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3755,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.718495,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-08222005-0002","longitude":-1.968243,"occurred":1123997400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1123997400000,"summary":"Greeny

white ball of light floating across the sky. at first i thought it was a white balloon, so i disregarded it, until i saw a second one follow it, about 5-10 seconds apart. it was in same shape, appearance, and speed as the first one. then there appeared a third object, same as the first two. it had a smaller pinpoint of light trailing it and then another white ball of light closely following it. there were 30+ objects seen over a span of twenty minutes. the intervals of seperation were anywhere from several seconds to a minute. they all traveled in the same direction across the same path in the sky.The lights were traveling from northwest to southeast and seemed to be at high altitude. there was a full moon out and a clear sky.  the lights were not planes because there were planes in the area at the same time as the lights, which had no flashing lights on them. in fact, one of the lights actually crossed the path of a plane, the object flying over it. one of the objects that flew by halfway through the event appeared lower in altitude or bigger in size because it was observed to be rotating as it flew through the sky. there was a black spot that could be seen on it. the area in which the objects flew is residential and very well lit with street lighting and the sky has the soft glow of the city of chicago lights illuminating it. there was no mistaking the lights for planes, helicopters, balloons, or any thing else except for silent, fast moving white lights. the police were contacted but a cruiser came about five mins. after the last light flew by so no official sighting was taken. there was an air and water show earlier that day on the chicago lakefront the cop told us, so he said the craft might have been military. however, the lights were seen flying extremely close to commercial airliners (our area is in a holding pattern for chicago midway airport) and the nighttime nature of the event left his explanation suspect. we tried recording the lights with a camcorder, but they could not be see through the view finder. through binoculars, the lights appeared to be triangular/oblong shaped, except for the large one seen; it had a pear/dumbbell shape. we lost sight of the objetc because of trees. if there was any other report of this sighting, could you please let me know.

an object of the size i saw, moving fast enough to flouresce at that luminosity, would transcend the sky as fast as any other meteor you see in the sky -- less than two seconds to cover an entire great circle overhead.  this was just kind of floating down lazily, as if it didn't have a care in the world.\r\n\r\nsince the only thing i knew that was that bright and moved that slowly was something lightweight that was on fire, i was absolutely certain it was a flare of some kind, hence i never reported it.  sea world is known to have nightly fireworks displays, and that night was no exception.  however, i thought it odd that a green flare would make its way, at full luminosity, all the way from sea world to my city block, complete and through the marine layer clouds (remember -- they're dense water vapor clouds!), intact.  even on a clear night, it is not possible to see sea world's fireworks displays from my house;

road (between bradley and hamilton county lines), there is a section of road which runs along a ridge, full of cow pasture.  the distance between the ridge and road i'm sure is less than a mile.  we noticed a simple star like light between us and the ridge. as it was backdropped by the ridge but appeared so tiny, it was slightly out of place.  planes usually have more than one light and flash.  we flashed our car head lights.  it proceeded to follow us several miles down the road.  it stayed slightly above tree level but within visual range and alongside our car for most of the trip except for a \"popular\" intersection (hwy 58,60 and georgetown)when it skirted around and ahead of it and us, and we lost visual contact just for a few seconds while it did this.  as the place we were going was right past this intersection, we turned into a driveway.  we flashed the lights of the car as we turned in and it actually turned and came back some but still stayed down from or ahead of us and away from the intersection.  i walked out in a cow field and had a spotlight brought to me from inside.  spotlighted the ground for some other people to walk out, me, the field and it (completely dark by now).  it generally hovered right above tree level the entire time completely silent and able to hover completely still.  never got too close (within shooting range, not that i had a weapon- but we're talking rural south) but it was still fairly close.  after i spotlighted it, it made a few non-impressive maneuvers (circles and squares and zig zags)- well within the capabilities of a stealth hellicopter i would guess maybe, but enough to get curious responses from the crowd. it was generally yellow but appeared red to me at times.  everybody else got bored with it and went inside? so i stood out in a cow field for a full twenty minutes looking at a light that was looking at me. we watched each other until it got bored with me. it never did fly off. it moved slightly to the right of the road and then further above the tree line and proceeded to go dimmer.  right at the point i was having problems seeing it, it gave three little twinkles and disappeared.  witnessed by six people (including a child).  would a stealth helicopter (even perhaps an unmanned craft) be audible at a mile's distance in the country? are they allowed to fly with just one light?  better yet, could the government really be stupid enough to waste stealth craft in watching (me)...Talk about big brother.  or alternative two.  either way, i'm the only one that seems flabbergasted.","distance":"501 Feet

louder & more frequent.It had been raining,so i thought maybe it was a raindrop falling on a bucket or something in the back of my truck.Then i finally couldnt ignore it any longer.I asked my girlfriend if she heard it.She heard it also,then i looked out the driver side window,& there were three glowing circular objects floating,we couldnt tell how close or far it was,that was scary.So i locked\r\nmy door.Because we couldnt focus on it, i decided to crank the truck,turn on the lights,& press on the brakes all at once to try & shine light in that direction. as soon as i did this. the circular obects disappeared,& some kind of thing was in its place. the only way i can describe it is, it was about one foot tall,it had a rectangular head,no eyes ,no nose, no mouth. it had a tornado shaped body. it was still floating, back & forth to the sound of the beeping.I was scared so i put the truck in gear & took off. we didnt go but about fifty feet or so, and i decided to turn around and shine my headlights on it.When i did, it was not there. what is strange to me,we didnt talk about it, we went back to her house & fell asleep. the next day i called & reported it to the police. they told me some people reported hearing hovering noises over their houses. i asked my ex girlfriend recently, what she remembered about this, she remembered everything. i want to know has anyone ever reported any sightings like this.\r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

anyway, i was standing out there getting some freash air in the middle of the night when i saw what appeared to be a \"wedge\" shape with red lights down the side fly quickly and quietly down palm canyon drive, the main strip in ps. i heard nothing and it only lasted a brief moment. there is an air museum in ps and for the veterans day parade they fly vintage bombers down the same route, and this object was a little smaller than those that i had seen. i came inside and told the other nurse that i saw a \"ufo\" but i think that it was the next generation stealth. her husband is into this stuff and she knew exactly what i was talking about. anyway, i had a few moments and was trying to find any information available on this object, which i know i have seen on tv before describing just

the moon, i saw a plane flying (probably coming from newark), and above the plane i saw this white object, i could see that it was not a plane, as it had no wings, and there were other planes flying in the area. they all look dark grey as the sun was setting in the west, and i was following the object as it flew (more like glided) from southwest to east. all of the planes that i was looking at, as i mentioned appeared dark grey and i could see the red and green lights. this object was white and was definately not a plane or a satellite. after approximately 5 - 10 minutes the object vanished from view heading in a easterly direction.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

watering the lawn i happen to look up and there is this object to the north stationary as in not going in any direction but moving or rotating and changing shape i think because the object was reflecting the sun which made it really hard to see it would twinkle like a star would except for the sun was still up and this thing was much lower than a star as i was watching this thing it looked like it was changing shape and that it was giving off some kind of heat  you know the wavy haze that comes of the pavement when you look down a road when its hot in the summer time? at that point i knew it wasn���t a plane and i called my roommate he told me to get his video camera which i did. when i got back outside, this thing had moved to the south east. it was my first time using it and i spent most of that hour trying to get as much video as i could which i did the video didn���t come out as good as i had hoped. i had problems keeping the camera still when it was zoomed in on this object. but you can clearly see this thing wasn���t a plane and it changes shape. at one point i saw a commercial airliner fly right past this thing. i wish i had got that on tape but i didn���t. the pilot had to have seen this thing. my roommate (he is a network manager for an architectural company) came home at 7:30pm i pointed this thing out to him although this thing was further away at this time and he agrees with me this thing was no plane and neither he nor i could explain it. the object kept moving to the southeast and we wanted to see if we could see this object on the tape so we went inside to check it out. \r\n\r\ni found this kind of interesting after the fact i realized that this object where it was first seen for about the first 10 minutes was directly over a a bio gas conversion project landfill its where they collect methane gas and other gases from the decomposing waste and converts it to reusable power. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,
