just hovered for 3 to 4 minutes and then sped off at lightning speeds through the trees in a southwesterly direction and quickly disappeared. during this event i was in total awe. i was only ten years old. i felt like somewhat paralyzed. i wanted to run but i was in too much shock. after it sped away i ran as fast back to the house as i could. that was probably only 60 yards. a few days later i

to the intersection of dundas and ossington to catch a bus. a kid on a bike was stopped on the side walk and was staring up at something, i asked him what he was looking at and he pointed out three objects in the clear blue sky, the weather conditions were perfect,not a cloud in the sky,temp,was 26 degrees cel. wind blowing off the lake from south to north at aprox. four to five mph. the first thing i thought was stray baloons from the carabana celeberations, but they weren't drifting,then i thought they were hand gliders, but they seemed too high,and they were not seagulls either,causr the birds move in their flight these objects did not, at first. when i first saw them they were in a triangle formation, then after a few more momentes, they changed formation to resemble the belt of orion, placed as it would be in the night sky in the fall, i think. then after what seemed like one or two miniutes, they resumed the triangle shape and remained stationary for at least thirty to fourty miniutes. during this time an airbus a320 passed over head and the size of the plane was equivilant to my thumbnail in perspective.The airplane blocked one of the lights from view as it passed for a split second. that made me think that these were not balloons or hanggliders. i rode my bus to ossington station,and looked again to see if they were still there, and they were, in the same possition. i made my payment and pointed the lights out to two people who work at the store and they watched for five more minutes,aprox. the objects began to drift or move off to the south,then they faided from sight, later that day i saw a lone balloon moving across the sky from south to north and you could tell it was a balloon by the way it moved in the wind.\r\n  i was not in possetion of a

look for there are a lot of them. about the time i try to talk myself in to thinking it's a opiticial illusion  something happens to make me know it is happening. they look like brinking stars -- they ones that look most like stars are the closest that seem to follow me the most. they have streaked across the night sky & stopped right in front of the pickup & turn with my every turn. there are also star like ones that you can see are turning different colors. they seem to be farther away but when you look at them with binoculars they are rarely clear / almost blurry but then one night i seen two\r\nmuch closer than normally & the reason they where never clear to see was they are moving & bouncing around so fast / whipping up & down they apear blurry. i noticed the clear star looking ones first because they would be low in the sky & very bright. i thought if it was'nt a star it was a satilight. my first reactions were i can't be seeing these things & it scared the hell out of me. i

the west dipping just below the mountain. the sky was very clear and we were noticing a smaller commericial jet heading east comming slightly to the south and above us. one of us commented on how clear the jet was visible at that time. while we both we looking at the jet in those few seconds an object appeared to the rear of the jet. we both made comments at the same time. it was something like \"do you see that?\"!!! or \"oh my god\". it only took me a few seconds to scan and compare the object to the jet and know i was witnessing something truely remarkabe. now you could not ask for a better visual sighting as the sky was well lit from the sun but blocked from our eyes from the mountain to our right. i watched this ufo follow the jet and slowly get closer to the back of the jet. the jet had a jerky motion to it. the ufo just glided. the jet had exhaust exiting while the ufo nothing. to my best recolection i could hear the jet and nothing from the ufo. i am not a ufo expert. but this ufo was so admormal looking from any aircraft i had ever seen. my best comparison at the time was a music cd in color and shine. it was slightly smaller than the jet but round. it was sleek, no bubble on top like alot of photos i've seen. so anyway, we continue to watch the ufo close in on the jet and suddenly it disapears. i never take my eye off the jet as it moves more to the east of me by this time. suddenly it appears again. but this time it is in front of the jet slightly above it and to the south. it somehow moved to stay in the same position watching the front of the jet. this went on for several seconds or so and then it gave us the grand finally. the ufo moves upward and excellerates more as it goes. it went straight up in the sky until i could not see it anymore. we watched for a good half hour more hoping to see more but that was it. i knew i witnessed something very special that day. i probably would have stayed much longer but my fried bernie williams was getting restless. i grew up watching jets from the mountain right behind the little league world series field in south williamsport. people use to sit on sky line drive for something to do. i lived right next to an air force bace in fort worth texas. i always watched jets passing by. but i never before or after have seen anything like this. i beleived before this, but now i know for sure. i

little girl was laying on a cement wall that surrounded the lot that we were standing in.She was looking up at the sky when she asked her father what that was up in the sky.We all looked up at the sky and thought there was a bird floating in the sky.The object that we were looking was blinking and started moving in a north easterly direction towards a jet's exhaust trail when all of a sudden another one popped out of the clouds and was blinking just like the other object that was just beneath the clouds to the the northeast of us.The blinking light that emerged from the clouds started moving towards the other blinking light.These lights seemed to have a bluish haze around them visible from the ground.Both blinking lights then flew into the clouds and disappeared from sight.We thought that whatever we had just witnessed had gone and we turned to leave when something shot down from the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed and went behind some trees about two hundred feet from us.The silouette of this object was clearly visible through trees as it came to an unbelievable dead stop behind the trees.The object then began gliding to the right and stopped in an opening in the treeline just above some houses and hovered in frontof my  friend and i and his daughter before emitting an extremely bright light and seemingly vanished in front of our eyes.There are three of us

of the busy traffic to the right of us.After it left in a bright flash both my friend and i seemed disoriented.I asked my friend what time it was as we crossed the street and he answered that it was seven fourty eight .Thirty minutes elapsed as we watched this object hover in the air in one of the busiest intersections without seemingly anyone but the three of us noticing this craft that lit eveything up around us ,including us,it seems.I can assure you that as crazy as this sounds it truly occurred ,i have two witnesses willing to undergo any type of validity test you may have.I would willing undergo hypnosis to prove i am telling the truth .This is so bizarre that i can't believe i am taking the chance of being thought of as crazy by reporting this sighting.My friend and his daughter will verify this happening in the city of winnipeg in broad daylight.I have not been feeling the same since this happened,can't quite explain the feelings of anxiety i have been feeling since this happened.Hope this is the first and last time that this ever happens to any of us. any futher questions would preferably be done over the phone.This really happened and i implore that anyone that was in this vicinity on july 28/2005 and witnessed what we did please report it and not  fear the ridicule that i expect until verified through whatever means may exist.My questions are did this craft leave any trace evidence.Can show the exact spot where this thing hovered over rooftops maybe twenty five feet in the air.Was in a clearing between trees .Could there be evidence in the trees that it hovered beside.Am willing to show exactly where this craft hovered.Can also draw photo of what i saw.So can my friend and daughter.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

talking. \r\nwe got on the subject of ufos. my kids (emma 6 & molly 8)\r\nasked me if i had ever seen a ufo. i said no but i'd like too. just then my wife says \"like those\"? i thought she was just being funny. i looked to the west where she was pointing and just like they where on que,2 ufos. a chill went up my back. in all my life i've never seen anything like these 2 diamond or oval shaped objects with an dark red or orangish glow. they were traveling from the west in a side by side formation end to end. they almost appeared to be linked. very close. they were moving very fast. no sound. it was a very clear night and we could see some airliners and small planes nav lights. this was certainly not one of those. they flew right above us and made 5 or 6 very sharp angular turns, still staying tip to tip, until they were heading north. the whole event was maybe 30 seconds and they were out of sight. i've been a star gaizer and sky watcher for a long time (i'm 50) i've been to air shows, seem lots of meteors (i've even seen one hit the ground in kansas. satellites, comets. i'm an aviation buff so i know things that fly. i've never seen anything like these two things. my wife and kids saw the exact same thing. we were all stunned. we talked about it for days. little variation on our sightings. i thought i saw a darker diamond shape or shadow on the bottom of the objects.\r\nvery sincerly\r\nmark sisk\r\n \r\n
