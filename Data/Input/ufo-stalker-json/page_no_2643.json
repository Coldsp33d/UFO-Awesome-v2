States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"    although it occured over 25 years ago, i still remember the sighting very clearly.  my brother and i who were 6 and 10 years old, respectively, were in our family room at the end of our house watching television.  it was a tuesday night around 8 pm...I remember that because we were watching \"three's company\", which aired on abc on tuesdays back then.  for no apparent reason, my brother got up from the sofa during the show and went to the window facing south. he looked out and saw something in the sky above our street.  he told me to come to the window.  i did, just in time to see a circular pattern of orange lights rotating and slowly moving down the street perhaps 200 feet in the air.  we ran to our parents room on the other side of the house to tell them what we had seen.  our mother was very intrigued by the story, but our father was less than enthusiastic and dismissed it as a plane or something else of normal origins.  by the time our mother got to the family room window, the object had floated down the street beyond our line of sight...It was now behind the treeline and gone for what we thought was forever.                                                        i'm not sure if it was the following night or a few nights later, but certainly not very long after the initial sighting, my family was in our parents' bedroom watching television, i'm guessing approximately the same general time of night (8-9 o'clock).  my brother was once again compelled to look out the window, this time to the west toward a pasture behind our back yard.  at the far edge of the pasture, about a quarter mile from our house was a line of pine trees where, hovering just above that, maybe 200 feet in the air, was the same object we had seen previously.  my mother and i sprang from our seats to see the object, this being her first look at it, while my father once more seemed disinterested.  my mother wanted to get a better look at it, so she and i quickly threw on coats and rushed outside to the back fence while my father and brother stayed in the house.                                                          this time we viewed it straight on, so it appeared as a horizontal row of lights.  the object displayed the same orange lights on bottom as before, but it had more colorful lights around its central edge.  i remember the various colors (green, blue, orange) being somehow different from what one might see on a conventional aircraft; not necessarily brighter or duller, but just different, and no blinking either.  it was a chilly night in early march, and the trees hadn't budded out yet, so the canopies were bare of any foliage.  this allowed an almost unobstructed view of the sky above.  my mother and i watched this object with great interest as it simply sat in mid-air making no sound except what my mother describes as a gentle swooshing...I don't recall any sound coming from it myself.  as we peered at this strange sight, my mother and i scanned the sky around us in all directions, where an even stranger thing caught out eyes.  coming across the sky from four different directions were four tiny, solid, unblinking balls of red light approaching the object simultaneously.  we watched as these things steadily approached the larger \"ship\" at an altitude about a hundred feet above it.  they converged to a point just above its center and, one by one, each descended into the top of the larger object.  as soon as this process was completed, the object seemed to activate itself by turning on two larger, brighter lights, almost like spotlights.  these lights criss-crossed a couple times before finally turning off.  soon afterward the object began to move away from us gradually until it retreated beyond the treeline and out of sight. my mother and i turned around and walked back into the house, never to be the same.                                                           we never saw the object again after that night, although that's not to say it didn't ever return, as it very well could have.  the experience left my mother and me with a profound belief in extraterrestrial life and visitation.  neither of us expressed any fear during the encounter, but rather a great fascination and excitement. my mother and i do not believe we were abducted, but we are both dead certain even after all these years that the object was not anything of this world.  it didn't exhibit any behavior characteristic of man-made aircraft, and although it could understandably be confused with perhaps a blimp by someone less observant, we know that it definitely wasn't that...At the time, goodyear had a blimp base just 20 miles south of conroe, so we had seen blimps flying on numerous occasions at night.  there was absolutely no mistaking one for the other.  it is one of only a few experiences my mother and i shared which we have continued to discuss many times since, and we both consider ourselves very fortunate to have had the opportunity to witness something this extraordinary...We will always cherish the memory of that night.  and after going to see \"close encounters of the third kind\" later that year, my father deeply regrets that he chose not to go out that night to see the object with us for himself.  as it was back in 1978, before the technology became affordable, we had no way of videotaping the experience, and the only camera we had at the time was a cheap one incapable of nighttime photography.  we have only our memories of the event to rely on now, but maybe that's all we really need, for as long as we believe with all our hearts that what we saw is something rare and special and genuine, physical proof isn't really that vital.  of course it would have been nice to have something to show others what we saw to establish crediblity, but that's impossible under the circumstances.  whether anyone else believes our story or not, we know it actually happened, and i feel that's what truly matters.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3681,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.3132769,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08032005-0001","longitude":-95.4495612,"occurred":258437700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":258437700000,"summary":"My

were standing on the corner of henderson highway and hespeler in a lot that has a couple of basketball hoops set up.My friend's little girl was laying on a cement wall beside the basketball court looking up at the sky when she noticed something unusual in the sky and asked her father what it was.All three of us were standing there pointing up in the sky at this object that we first thought was a bird. a bird usually circles and rides the updrafts when up high.This was very high up since it appeared to be just under the clouds.It was not moving ,just sitting there blinking.It was at this time that we realized we were looking at a ufo.This blinking light then started moving in a northeasterly direction towards a jet's exhaust stream when all of a sudden another one of these blinking lights popped out of the clouds and started moving towards the other blinking light.When the lights were right besides each other they popped back into the clouds right beside the jet exhaust.We thought they were gone so we turned to leave when all of a sudden something caught my peripheral vision to right of me and i saw a craft drop from the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed and then decelerate to hide behind some trees .We observed the silouette of this craft through the trees as it glided to the right of the trees towards an opening where it stopped and hovered.I think that this craft attempted to sneak up on us but we just happened to spot it dropping from the sky and glide behind the trees.I was scared shitless when i saw the silouette of this craft through the trees,i have been a ufo buff since a child and here i was watching a ufo gliding behind some trees attempting to be sneaky.This may sound like total bullshit to the public ,but it happened and i am willing to take a lie detector test or any other test to prove what we three witnessed. when this craft stopped in the clearing above some houses just feet away from traffic i knew that we were looking at the same type of craft that i have seen on unexplained mysteries .It is so hard to write this without feeling that i may meet with ridicule but i have two other witnesses who experienced exactly what i did and are willing to undergo any lie detector/hypnosis to prove what we saw in broad daylight in the city of winnipeg.The craft that appeared in front of us hovered for what seemed like a few seconds and disappeared in a flash of bright light.As this thing hung in the air everyting around me seemed to come to a stop. dont remember hearing the sound of the traffic which was right next to me until the bright light that was being emitted fromm this craft as it hovered dissipated.One minute this thing was hanging in the air  above the houses and then everything around me got very bright and then just as quickly this craft was gone in a flash.One second we wer looking at this object and then it was gone.This is totally fucking mindblowing.Excuse my language ,but i don't know if i will feel normal again.After we witnessed  whatever /whomever we saw ,we left the area and crossed the street pushing our bikes until we got across the street.I asked my friend what time it was as we rode along and he replied that it was seven fourty-eight.We were in this lot for thirty-six minutes,it was only a couple of minutes from the time that we saw the blinking lights till one dropped out of the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed and then stop on a dime behind some trees.We feel that there was some time lost that we cannot explain.We could not have been standing in that lot for a half an hour staring at this craft without someone else noticing.What has happened here.Are these entities able to somehow control time.Any further questions regarding this incident if it is taken seriously can be answered by calling my cell phone.There are three of us who witnessed what i have described here and all of us will willingly undergo any type of lie detector test and beat it hands down/even undergo hypnosis to uncover anything that may lie in the subconscious regarding this true sighting.

east so i was walking to the west. i live just a few miles east of dm air force base and i enjoy watching the planes fly over, so when i'm outside i always watch the sky. when i got to the back yard i put the ramps down and looked up out of habit. i saw 2 small objects off in the distance coming toward me so i stopped to watch them. i've always loved aircraft and can id just about anything in the air from the hellcat to the raptor. as they got closer i realized they were round and had no wings or roters. they were moving slow like a helocopter but with no sound. one was very clearly not from the base. it was flying at about 500 ft in a straight line traveling from w.N.W. to e.S.E. the second object was either much smaller or higher up like maybe 1000 ft traveling with the first one. as i watched they both passed directly over head. when they did i could see that both were round and looked like polished steel. then both objects stopped dead and shot up and away back the way they came. it took about 10 to 15 minutes to get to me and less than a second to disappear from sight. the larger or lower one was the only one i really saw shoot back to the west. the smaller one just seemed to vanish in place. i can only assume it followed the other one. i didn't report this sooner because i wasn't sure of what i'd seen, that was until last night 8-1-2005. i was standing looking out my back door watching a storm coming in. it was about 8:30 pm and i saw two lights traveling at high speed one behind the other just north of my house. i walked to my side yard to watch them to see what they were. i thought they were both air force jets because i could hear the engine noise. then all of the sudden the front one made what looked like a 90* square right turn south. it's flight path was well east of my house. the one following it made a sweeping turn that took it almost right over my head. when it did i could see it was an a-10 flying at about 300 ft. the a-10 got back in behind the first object and a few seconds later the first object shot straight up out of sight. the a-10 started up after it but then turned out heading west back toward the base. i know the second light was an a-10 but the first one was what looked like what i had seen in may except it looked as if it were made of light.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

friend of mine and his little girl of nine years were standing on the corner of henderson highway and hespeler in winnipeg manitoba on july 25/2005 at seven ten p.M. there are basketball hoops located on this corner and cement walls around adjacent to the hoops.My friends little girl named shelby was watching the sky when she asked us what she was looking at up in the sky.When we looked up into the sky there was a cloud cover above us with what at first seemed to be a bird flying at high altitude just beneath the clouds.As we observed this object we noticed that it was blinking and remaining stationary.The object then started moving in the in a north easterly direction when all of a sudden another blinking light popped out of the clouds and caught up to the other blinking light and together they flew  into the clouds above them.The reason i am reporting this is because of what happened next.After they flew into the clouds we turned to leave the lot we were observing this phenomena from.As we turned to leave something caught my peripheral vision and i turned quickly towards this while pointing at and yelling at my friend and his daughter.There was a silouette of a craft gliding behind the trees and it glided right into an opening in the trees . i am still freaking out about we saw in the clearing. there was a ufo hovering above some houses observing my friend , myself and his child.We are still not sure how long this craft hovered in front of us or whether any other citizens of winnipeg witnessed what we did .The corner where occurred is one of the busiest areas of the city.This is located right at the foot of the disraeli freeway,so my frind and i have discussing this since it happened.As we were observing this craft right in front of us it suddenly got very bright and the craft was gone in the blink of an eye.My friend, myself, and his child then proceeded to leave this area and headed for home.As we were riding our bikes away from this event i asked my friend what time it was and he answered seven fourty eight.We were standing there observing this thing for thirty six minutes.From the time that we stood there and pointed at this object till the the time that it shot down from the sky and attempted to hide behind the trees,only about two or three minutes elapsed.This would have made the sighting of the craft in the clearing at approx. seven thirteen p.M. since i walked onto the lot at seven ten p.M.This all happened very quickly yet seemed to take a long time. we were feeling very disoriented as we headed for home. i am willing to take any lie detector test to prove what i experienced was real.So are my friend and his daughter. we are quite sure that what we experienced was quite real because we all describe the same saucer

witnesses,at least i hope we are not.What the hell is going  on . we were about two hundred feet from this craft as it hovered over the houses.Went back to this location to study our vantage point when we sighted this craft over these houses.It would be impossible for the whole neighborhood not to see something like this.Our question is why didn't anybody else notice what should have been front

island.  i was going to get ready for work.  i was sitting up in bed having my coffee at 6:45 am,(my bedroom was on the 2nd floor of a 2-family house and in the front of the apartment.) i was looking across the street at my neighbor's house, which belonged to jackie parascondola and his family. something caught my eye.  it was exactly directly in my full field of vision.  i called my mother to see it and she was amazed too.  (she is now deceased and cannot corroborate my accounting of this incident).  i ran to get my 8mm kodak movie camera, but it lacked film.  the object was approximately 30' above the roof directly dead-center over jackie's house.  it looked like a small water tower (oval-shaped top and 4 legs descending from the top).  it was light tan or beige.  it stood absolutely still and suspended in mid-air. it didn't go sideways, tilt or turn around or upside down. no lights, no sound - just suspended and quiet.  we watched it for about 10 solid minutes.  it stayed there about 5 minutes doing nothing in direct line of my gaze.  all of a sudden it started to move straight up in a direct line about 30 feet, slowly and in complete silence.  it came back down to the original height over the house and then moved in a straight line directly to its right about another 30 feet.  it went back to the original position for a few moments and then went left.  it went behind the trees on the block and we couldn't see it anymore because the sun was rising from the east, which completely obliterated our view.  it moved slowly and steadily and in complete silence.  it was a mechanical object that seemed to be made of metal.  it appeared to us to be controlled because of its measured movements.  it never went fast.  always at the same rate of speed.  to this day, every time i see a water tower, while driving, i think of that object.  the object was maybe 5 feet in height and about 2-3 feet wide.  it was longer than it was wide.  i have always wanted to report this and now,  42 years later, it is still clearly visualized and remembered by me. i can draw a picture and i can even go back to the house and take a digital photo and sketch what i saw, if requested. anyone have a similiar experience?

ship hovering above the woodlawn cemetery in baltimore, maryland.  \r\n     2.What made us notice the object was the enormous size of the space craft, and that it was just hovering over the cemetery.  \r\n     3.When i first saw the object i thought it was a huge space ship.\r\n     4.The object was shaped very similar to the saucer part of the star ship enterprise on the new generation series.  only the saucer part, not that other space garbage they put on the enterprise that looked like \"discovery\" booster rockets.  it didn't need none of that crap.\r\n     it was dark metalic like color with tiny lights all around and underneath.  it appeared to have a few lights that were extended off of the bottom surface of the craft.     \r\n     it was huge man!  it seem to be just as large as the grave yard, but it was hovering above it.  it was making a low frequency sound like.....Jshr...Jshr....Just hovering.\r\n     5.  when my friend and i saw the space ship, we pulled over next to the grave yard.  i asked jay if he was seeing the same thing that i was seeing and he said yea.  we were talking about how huge it was and the jshr motor sound it was emitting. we also talked about why it was over woodlawn cemetery like that..You know...What was it really doing other than hovering.  when it left we jumped with excitement because neither of us has ever seen anything leave and travel so fast before.....Did i mention that it was huge?  after it left we agreed not to tell anyone....Well it was 1981!  we did tell the band though.\r\n     6. it left at a speed so fast that my eyes could barely keep up with it.  it never changed sounds, it just \"zipped\" away.  i guess the sound it made when it left could be compared to the sound of a bullet whizzing.\r\n     it left in a \"z\" pattern. not a lot of z's, but like one big z and it was back with the stars.\r\n\r\n    comment:  the followint year i was employed by the nsa (national security agency).  i thought it

the hillside on the west side of the vc highway. they were about 50 to 100 feet off the ground. i was driving so, i saw the lights but i looked away as i was driving. i was thinking to myself thats a low jet. i thought it was a jet plane coming from reno. i looked back at them. they were still in the same spot some 30 seconds later. then i began to wonder. what the heck is that. must be a helecopter i thought. then i really began to stare. no it's not a helecopter. i knew it was no helecopter or plane. yet, i could see no object, only lights. they were not moving. i could see the brush on the hill bright as day. i saw some things moving in the brush. little objects scurrying about very quick like that of coyote's or something. my heart began to thump. the adrenaline kicked in as i realized this was something different than that i'd ever seen.\r\n     i was driving still and slowed down so i could see more of it. i was very realized and already had a hunch it was a ufo. i said out loud, \"haha yeah you know i can see you.\" as soon as i said this, the lights began to turn. they were no longer shining on the brush. they span approximately 100 yards apart with 2 on top about 30 yards apart and the lower ones at the sides about 100 yards apart. they looked like the lights in a stadium kind of. they were very big and bright. there were no other cars behind me i could see lights from nor in front of me. \r\n     my heart was racing fast. i was frightened. i no longer was really watching the road. the lights had my total attention. they turned around and began slowly hovering down the canyon towards the highway i was driving on. there were then smaller lights below the larger ones that were blinking in succesion around and repeated. thats when i realized it was a round object. i was freaking out. my eyes were huge i'm sure and i was awake and ready to notice every detail. the lights came closer down the canyon as if to head me off at the pass. like direct coordinates at my speed to meet me at a certain point ahead. i knew i was heading straight towards them at the same time. i was afraid, yet i was curious. \r\n     so i kept driving and looking as they became larger and closer. i was amazed. entranced by the realization and curiousity i barely even looked at the road ahead. i was just staring out my downed window. my radio became all fuzzy and then was silent.\r\nmy car was driving fine. \r\n     soon there became an embankment on the side of the highway that separated the lights from my vision. i knew from driving the highway many times that the embankment recedes as you approach dayton hill where the canyon is. i also knew the thing was moving down the canyon at the same speed i was. the suspense was incredible.\r\n     i came to the hill and as soon as the embankment receded, there i saw something that i will never forget for the rest of my life. i was at top the hill and the canyon beside me on the left. right there as the ground cleared way, i was gazing into the middle of a set of windows! yes, this was real. i was not even watching the road. i was mezmerized by the depth. i was staring straight into a spacecraft from another world. it was indeed a saucer. yes, there were long windows draping all the way across and around. i saw the tiers or stories, the floors. i saw the walls. everything inside was white.\r\n     this was incredibly astounding. i had no clue what to think or anything. all i could do was stare and observe.It was like i was above it and as i went down the hill i became level with it.\r\n     on the left bottom story in the windows were aliens that i first saw. there was a female. they all were wearing white robes. she had a bracelet and a necklace on, that of gold or silver and makeup like blush on her cheeks. her arm was on the shoulder of a younger one, a boy and they were looking right at me. right into my eyes they were. she nudged herself to him and spoke to the other younger children along the window maybe 10 or so more. they were all smaller like a 5 year old. she was talking to the older boy and them without speaking! and me! i felt a joyful feeling inside as they gazed into my eyes and she then smiled and pointed at me as to show them that i understood her and them. her long finger, their faces grey. she had 3 fingers and a thumb.\r\n     i then had a terrible feeling. i looked up to the second story. there was 2 beings there in the middle of the room. i was about level with them i think. the being i first saw had a long draped back skull like that of the movie alien kinda but the face any eyes of e.T. his skin was chocolate brown and he too was wearing a white robe. his skull was maybe 2 feet long behind his head draping down. his face looked a lot like e.T. the kids faces below looked like the alien pictures you often see yet their eyes weren't black. their eyes were shaped like the pictures but they were white with irises. blue eyes, the girl had green eyes.\r\n     the one with the draped skull on the second story was standing and holding a clipboard against himself in his white robe. i noticed all that stuff as he noticed me. his mouth dropped! his eyes bulged! as he realized i was looking at him and them and he was staring straight into my eyes! he was frightened that i saw him. it was deffinately not part of his plan. his eyes were white with huge blue irises and pupils. i'd estimate i was 20 feet from his face.\r\n     i made contact alright. he immediately turned to the other one in the room in front of him. the one in front of him was sitting. i saw the side view of him but only his head at the time. he had a human like head. not a draped skull. i could see wrinkles all over his head. it made him look very old. no hair on any of them whatsoever.\r\n     he was not in white. he was wearing a black suit from what i could see. he turned his face toward me! right after the one with the clipboard looked at him after seeing me! he turned his face toward me. ohhhh myyyy goddd was i scared!!!! he was so so so so so old looking it sent shivers all over me. his face was all wrinkled and old and his eyes all beady! they were pure black. as he and i stared eachother in the eyes i realized he was a man. he was a human. he must've been thousands of years old and very wicked. i was petrified. i was scared shitless. he gave me this snarling look yet at the same time i could see his smarts. there was some kind of bigscreen in front of him blinking at the outer rim of the windows edge at the end of the ship windows on his floor. he then looking at me directly, raised his hand up with a very long finger and smiled or smirked as he hit a button on some kind of panel in front of him.\r\n     instantly! the windows covered themselves with a fanlike shell that was that like of ripples like of a chinese fan decending from the top. corrogated riffles about 1 foot high each decending from the top to the middle. they were breathing like and sparkling with colors. i noticed that they were very sharp looking like razor blades all on the top along the riffles.They could cut through anything!\r\n     the bottom sealed up and began blinking lights around in succession. that must be how they do their airports. that must be their laws or regulations i thought.\r\nthen it began to spin. my window was still down and i was close to the bottom of the hill as i heard the riffles begin to hummmm! they sounded like they were some kind of giant fan blades. the object tilted at about a 45 degree angle. as it spun faster and faster i could only see the outline of it. like it was suddenly cloaked. kinda like a rim on a car as it spins. it spun so fast it began to become invisible. it then shot up into the sky leaving a small white trail behind for a split second.\r\n     i was petrified. i had reached the bottom of the hill and pulled over. i had to look through my rear view mirror to switch lanes from traffic. i pulled over and got out of my car. i looked up. i wanted to see it more. it was sunny outside. there were cars going by. it only takes 3 minutes to get down the hill. i was at the top at 11:00 p.M. and the bottom around 8:30 or something. yet, i didn't even realize this. not at all. i had no conception of time. i was tired. i went home and crashed out. i woke up and remembered the hill. i don't know how it was daylight when i got to the bottom of a 3 minute hill at 11:00. i don't remember anything between that time accept for driving down the hill. i have only told a handfull of people this story.\r\nthere's more to it as well in the day and the months that followed. i will tell more if i get a chance. i want to send sketches so i will begin the drawings from memory tonight.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Insignia,  Louvres","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

you spin it??  the craft just moved in a straight line.. i followed it with my eyes as long as i could until it passed in the direction over my house...I never forgot what happened there and remember
