dancing together..During the whole thing the dancing lights were or seemed further away than the other lights but still pretty close..They dance down to the tree line and then back up further away and then left and right and down again...Over and over.. finally they just disappeared around 5:30 maybe 5:40...Not just blinked off or anything but just sord of faded away. tonight i have been checking obsessively to see if there is any strange activity in the sky or if the 2 bright lights and blue light are there.....Thinking that if they were stars (which i know they weren't, but am trying so hard to understand the whole thing) that they would be in their position or atleast nearby (since it is not 2:30 am here yet) but there is no sight of any of them.

could i not....We stayed up and watched the entire thing. could you please tell me if anyone has reported this sighting as well from the sacrament/elverta area of california the am hours of july 31st

unimaginable speed. the sky was clear except for a cloud right above our heads. the height of the cloud was unknown and covered an area the size of a pizza pie held at arms legnth. this thing came at such a speed as to be beyond anything we have ever seen. it entered the cloud and was the size of a dime held at arms length. it did not exit the cloud as expected rather it sped off in the same direction that it came.The reverse direction only took 2 seconds and took off in the same direction that it came in at such a speed that by the time we started yelling the other players missed seeing it as it disapeared in the distant horizon. later that night we were all playing hide and go seek.Jimmy and i chose a hidin place together. what happened to jimmy and myself is too bizzare to tell on paper. i am afraid if i explain it you will think of me as crazy. i have not seen or heard from jimmy since about 1965 however his wife came to my office around 1985. she was helping a friend but

were stopped at a light for a while... i watched. it seemed fixed in location. my husband thought at first it was moving until we stopped and he looked too and saw it wasnt moving. it faded for a minute then came back. if anything it might have been gaining altitude as it seemed to get smaller and dimmer.. but then came back. i swear it looked like someone had lit a candle inside a red paper bag... or orange... kinda cross between the two. it wasnt huge but it wasnt small. it wasnt that high up either. i kept my eye on it telling husband to hurry home so we could get binocs. we got home (about 1 min away.. about 1/8th mile away) and ran back out. by this time it was quite dim bug again came back. not really changing posistions but again seemed to come back down lower a bit or at least get brighter. it was never bright like a light really... it seems more \"organic\" if that makes sense... it didnt blink or anything but it \"flashed\" or \"flickered\" i guess is better way to put it. it would both get brigher and dimmer variable. there was at one point some slight movement. almost like it was being jarred. if i could guess i would say (from what perspective i did have which wasnt much) that it maybe moved 15 ft in any direction pretty quickly, again like it was being bounced around or jarred. almost like it \"wobbled\". it would get quite dim when this happened. it was just slightly foggy or maybe just a bit cloudy. as it got dimmer, and more \"flickery\" i had a hard time telling if it was \"going out\" or \"leaving\" or being covered by fog/cloud layer. i know for a fact that other people saw it because i saw other people looking out their windows on the drive home. it was very obvious in the sky. i was really suprised that i didnt hear anything about it. i once saw a blimp (my first live viewing of one actually) come from very far away that was lit up on the inside.. it was a saturn blimp so it too was red... and i thought it was a ufo at first until it got closer of course. my first thought was that was what this was and it was just moving away from us. but because of its movements and behavior that was totally ruled out, especially after having watched it for so long. in total from the time we first saw it, until it was out of site, was about 15 minutes!  i watched the news but didnt hear anything. i was too afraid to ask anyone if they

a conventional aerial vehicle was coming into sight, quickly turned into a wide eyed stare. this was no ordinary vehicle type that i had previously observed!\r\nit was about the size of a large family saloon, saucer/disc shaped and dark metallic in colour.  the main distinctive feature, ( as if the rest of the vehicle was not distinctive enough), was a narrow flat band which broke up the shallow squat base of the disc, from the deeper top part.  \r\nthis band had black rectangular slats in it and it appeared that this band was rotating about the circumference of the disc in an anticlockwise direction, (observing from underside), while the rest of the vehicle remained static to the direction of travel.  the band was spinning at the same speed the vehicle was moving across my field of view.  could this be part of the propulsion system?\r\nit moved perfectly straight and level at quite a slow speed - say 5-10mph or so best guess.  there were no lights and no sound at all.\r\ni

disappeared.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":3615,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.6928646,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07232005-0002","longitude":-118.1498332,"occurred":1121743500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,

took them to be head and brake lights from a car on the nearby parkway but they came right at me in an up and down motion.They stopped when i back-tracked and advanced when i moved forward.Not wanting to turn my back to them i walked back wardsto the end of the street.I then walked around a few blocks to get to the other end of this street.As i approached the corner i became aware of a very low frequency hum and a flickering light in the sky,it was as if the whole atmosphere was vibrating.I then noticed two balls of light about the size of softballs once again advancing toward me.Again i backed away and they went out.I then noticed to my right a large white object behind some trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nicould not determine its shape through the trees.It was not glowing just a non reflecting white.At this point i felt a bit scared and that i had seen enough.I felt like i shouldn,t be seeing this-like something was warning me to stay away.My fear now overcoming my curiosity i fled and went home.I felt tired and weak the next day.My teeth hurt for several days.I think the low frequency hum loosended my fillings.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3614,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1414855,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07232005-0001","longitude":-73.3578955,"occurred":1117741500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1117741500000,"summary":"Large

sale\" in near-by altoona, pa. they do it once a year and it can be seen from as far as ebensburg(30miles away). i also jumped to conclusions when i first saw the display of circling lights. as far as the \"jumping\" light that changes from white to red to blue... what you are witnessing is a star. the red and blue are a result of scattering. white light is made up of red,o,y,g,blue,i,and v. i'll bet you if you watch it close enough you'll also notice the o,y,and g. as for the jumping, that is a trick your own eyes are playing on you because of a light target and a dark reference point(usually a pine tree). obviously i am or was a skeptic. april of 2005 this all changed! i am now a believer but still very logical.\r\n   my girlfriend and i were travelling on old22 from cresson summit toward cresson. half way down the hill i noticed a very bright star in the horizon. i pointed it out to my girlfriend. suddenly she said it turned blue and i looked to find it to be true. it was then obvious that this was a moving object coming in our direction. when it was about a mile away and approaching it was now red (still only seemed to be a single light). we made it to the rite-aid parking lot and got out to watch as it flew overhead. i saw at least 50 other people whom should have noticed. when it flew over sheetz (gas station where there were many oblivious patrons),it was approx. 200' off the ground and completely silent.We now could see 5 red lights stretching at least 40' apart from each other. i want to say it was v shaped but it was imperfect. we jumped in the car and followed it back up the hill toward rt.220. my car was going the same speed as the object. 35mph. we entered the highway to persue when it stopped only to start travelling back down the hill(toward the direction it came). as it turned around, i started to blink my headlights to see if i could coax a reaction. it just kept going. i had to drive to the next exit (gallitzin) in order to turn around and get back to cresson to follow. by the time we got to cresson summit exit, we could not find it anywhere. a couple days later, i was sitting in the parking lot at work still trying to make sense of it. i thought it must have been a helicopter. then i noticed in the distance a helicopter about 1000/2000' in the air. i did not even have to get out of the car to hear it. i am amazed with what we saw and would like somebody's logial explanation. by the way, i also noticed , in the following days, cresson's electrical supply (i think it's called a sub-station... i don't know the term...It's a bunch of xfmr's and towers and what not)is right under where it turned around....
