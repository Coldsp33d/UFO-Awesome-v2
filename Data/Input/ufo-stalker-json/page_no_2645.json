States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First, i feel i should include some relevant background information before describing my sighting (my first of four), because my sighting was not typical at all.\r\n\r\nalthough i never told anyone about it then, as a child, between the ages of around four and six (just a close guess), i experienced what psychiatrists now tell me are known as \"invasive voices\"; however, these \"voices\" were not then, and are not now, auditory at all, but rather best described as \"telepathic\".  for some reason they went away about the time i started school.\r\n\r\ni never experienced anything similar until november 1996, when i was 27 years old, and i was in a storage locker i had rented to store my car at night.  all of a sudden, at that time, i began receiving telepathic communications, and, just as when i was a child, the \"voices\" were both male and female, and human-like.  at first i did not make any connection between these \"voices\" and my early childhood experiences (that dawned on me much later), and i thought then that these voices were \"spirits\" of some kind, although i had been raised generally atheist and had studied biology and chemistry at a top-twenty university (emory university in atlanta, georgia) for two and a half years.  that is to say, even though the idea of non-corporeal \"spirits\" seemed implausible from a contemporary scientific standpoint, i felt an intense desire to identify the source of my unusual experiences, and \"spirits\" seemed the only logical conclusion then.\r\n\r\ncontact with these voices has persisted since november 1996, sometimes for days or even weeks on end, although at times they just go away for short or long stretches for no apparent reason.  the nature of the communications i receive is so varied and complex that i would literally have to write a book here to detail it adequately; suffice it to say that it has always seemed \"real\" (not psychiatric) and that, even before seeing ufo's, i always suspected i was being studied by aliens.  however, as anyone might imagine, sharing such a belief with others was, and still is, rather difficult, because it usually results in ridicule and a pariah social status for me.  even those who have believed me briefly almost invariably change their mind later and believe me to be hallucinatory, or worse, in the case of the uneducated or religious, possessed by \"demons\" or \"satan\" or something similar.\r\n\r\nsoon after beginning to receive regular telepathic communications back in 1996, i went first to catholic priests for information about \"spirits\" and \"demons\", and then to psychiatrists for information about schizophrenia, looking for answers to help explain what i was experiencing.  religious persons (including a catholic archbishop from south carolina, who wrote me personally) told me that either i was possessed by \"demons\" and that nothing could be done or (as in the case of the archbishop) that i should see a christian psychiatrist.  psychiatrists (both christian and atheist ones), after extensive in-patient and out-patient examination, have declared me schizoaffective, claiming that the source of my telepathic communications is my own mind and that i suffer from a neurological disorder.  however, outside of experiencing these voices, i have absolutely zero symptoms related to any sort of mental disorder; ie, no hallucinations, grandiose or irrational thoughts, strange behaviors or beliefs, or any other psychotic or psychiatric symptoms.  throughout the time between november 1996 and june 2003 (the latter date being when i had my first ufo experience, described below), i was torn between believing that i was mentally ill and that i was in fact in contact with aliens.\r\n\r\nthere were two major reasons i doubted, even prior to having ufo sightings, that my experiences were neurological.  first, i have had two very vivid dreams, both prior to my first sighting, in which i saw humanoid aliens, and after both of these, i awoke absolutely \"knowing\" that i was an alien contactee and not insane.  in the first of these dreams, i awoke with a start and \"knew\" i had just seen a short, gray, humanoid alien standing right in front of me, raising its hand to me \"in greeting\" (as i have been told by my \"voices\").  this first dream occurred in las vegas back in early 1997 (possibly february).  the second dream occurred in los angeles later in 1997, and was quite different.  this time, upon waking i did not believe i had been in any sort of actual contact with an alien, but felt that i had only just seen an image flash across my mind.  this image was not of the typical gray alien that is now popularized, but instead the head only of something extremely frightening, which is best described as a large humanoid praying mantis (sort of a cross between a human being and a praying mantis).  after this second alien dream, i woke up indescribably terrified of what i was experiencing.\r\n\r\nthe second reason i have always doubted that i am insane has to do with the nature of the communications i receive.  to explain much of this in detail, however, as noted above, would require that i write a book.  suffice it to say that it has always seemed far too complex, intelligent, external, and usually \"sane\" in its own right to not be real.  however, before my sightings began, i was quite torn, because psychiatrists repeatedly informed me that many schizophrenics and schizoaffectives believe thoroughly that their \"voices\" are real.  it was often hard to doubt medical opinion.  however, no type of medication has ever had any effect on my experiences.\r\n\r\ndespite often believing that i was being experimented on by aliens, not least of which because these \"voices\" told me so, the doubt and confusion i suffered from as a consequence of my not having \"proof\" (as i always called it) of what was going on led me to plead with them often, sometimes in anger, for such \"proof\".  finally, in mid-june 2003 i was granted such \"proof\".\r\n\r\nthe details of my first sighting are relatively unimportant to me, although i will describe them as best i can here.  the important thing to me is that i now know beyond the shadow of a doubt that:  a) i am being studied by aliens, primarily for information about the effects of telepathic contact between our \"species\", b) the crafts i have seen are indubitably from another planet and are connected to the telepathic \"input\" i receive, c) the mind of any human can literally be controlled somehow by these aliens (that is, they can cause a human to say, do, think, feel, etc, just about anything from afar, although i have no idea how they do this), d) these aliens can actually \"speak\" through me, although it has been explained to me that human language is an extremely poor mode of communication (very slow and ponderous, fraught with miscommunication potential, primitive in terms of symbolic sophistication, etc) and that therefore they generally prefer not to do so, and that e) these aliens, and presumably all others, adhere more or less to what i would term an ecological non-interference parameter in their dealings with earth (or at least have done so for a very long time).\r\n\r\nanyway, very early in the morning on a still, clear, and pleasantly cool evening on some date in mid-june 2003, i was engaged in communication with these aliens as i walked around the campus of the university of colorado at boulder (where i attended graduate school briefly back in fall 2002) when i finally got the \"proof\" i had pleaded for for so long.  i was on the quad, with no other persons around that i could see (although, in a town as large as boulder, there had to be some people nearby who may have seen it), when i was \"told\" to look up.  when i did, directly over my head flew a solid black, triangular (but slightly indented in the back), tri-lighted spacecraft.  it was larger than an airplane, but not huge.  it flew at an extremely low altitude and very, very slowly (almost stationary).  it made no noise at all.  the three lights were at the apices of the craft and were each of a different color, although i cannot remember what those colors were.  rather than being frightened, which i imagine most people would have been, i was ecstatic, and the aliens and i \"bonded\" a great deal that night.  i \"told\" them i could handle being experimented on much better, now that i at least knew for certain that i was not insane or that some other bizarre explanation surrounded my telepathic experiences.  i laughed and cried soon thereafter, and just generally felt like a turning point in my life had arrived.\r\n\r\nsince that time, i have had three other sightings, two of which were of a craft apparently identical to the first one i saw.  the second sighting occurred only a few days after the first (definitely still in june), right in the heart of downtown denver, colorado, very early one sunday morning (i do not remember the date).  this sighting is difficult to report, because it is so hard for others to believe, but it did occur.  i did not notice any others around me, and the streets were largely deserted, but i am certain that in the middle of a downtown area the size of denver there were others around.  again the craft flew directly overhead, very slowly, at a low altitude.  i remember that my exact location was somewhere near the federal courthouse and the greyhound bus station.\r\n\r\nthe third sighting also occurred in june 2003, in olympia, washington.  however, this time i saw several crafts (maybe seven or so) flying or hovering at a very high altitude.  i could not make out the shapes on this occasion, but i am certain they were spacecraft because i was \"told\" to look up again and because the lights that i saw were zipping around at a phenomenal speed.  i actually asked telepathically whether the crafts could become invisible, and one of them blinked out and then blinked back on again in a stationary position.  gauging from the extremely high altitude on this occasion (the lights looked like very bright stars from where i was sitting), i would have to say that the speed at which these craft could move was astonishing.  they moved across the sky very quickly to my eye even at that distance.\r\n\r\nthe fourth sighting was again of a black triangular (delta-shaped to be more precise) craft, and it occurred beside a lake near the university of washington, in seattle.  i actually have a photograph of the craft that i took on this occasion (the voices had to remind me that i had a camera on me and \"tell\" me to take the photograph!), but i cannot transmit it with this email because the hard drive of the computer i am using right is not functioning properly.  however, i have the photograph on disk in my possession.  it is not a very good picture, and all one can see are the three lights (which in this case appear all white) and a vague shape, but nevertheless i can assure anyone who reads this that it is of a so-called ufo (a spacecraft, that is).\r\n\r\nthere are countless other things to report about my experiences with the aliens who are now studying me, but some are so complex and some are so difficult for others to believe (eg, other humans around me being controlled like robots, etc), that i do not think this is the proper forum.  i doubt highly that anyone could hear about all of my experiences and believe that i am sane, unless they are truly of the belief that aliens can control things on earth in very bizarre and profound ways.  to be sure, if someone reported to me some of the things i can report, i would have a very difficult time believing them, and i thoroughly understand when others feel the same way.  for that reason, i rarely share information about ufo's, aliens, strange occurrences, etc, with anyone.  it almost invariably proves to be a mistake when i do.  however, i know that i am not hallucinatory and that i never have been, and that my experiences are real.\r\n\r\nat this time, i experience telepathic communications intermittently.  usually i feel as though i am being \"watched\" from afar somehow, and quite often i suddenly start receiving telepathic messages.  occasionally i feel as though my behavior is being controlled, but that is rare.  also, more and more so i feel as though i am alone and no amount of effort to communicate with these aliens seems to elicit any sort of response.  apparently, round-the-clock contact, which i experienced for years, has either stopped or tapered off considerably.  i do not take any sort of psychotropic medications, nor have i for a long time, nor have any of them ever had any sort of effect on my experiences.  finally, i have never had any sort of bizarre hallucination, belief, or experience that did not involve these alien \"voices\".\r\n\r\nanyway, i apologize if i \"protest too much\", to quote shakespeare, but i just want to be sure that any reader of this knows for certain that these accounts are of thoroughly real and physical events, and that i can attest with utter certainty that there is absolutely zero chance at all that any explanation other than the involvement of aliens and ufo's is plausible.\r\n\r\nfinally, for those who have never had any sort of experiences like these, let me say that once the shock and awe of it all wears off, they are often generally unpleasant.  being afraid of being abducted, controlled, experimented on, etc, is not fun, and the aliens who study me have assured me several times that, and i quote, \"nature is [their] only friend\".  also, harboring something so profound and being unable to share it with others is extremely stressful in many ways.  when i first \"knew\" what was going on (even before the sightings), i thought that certainly the us government, news stations, nasa, etc, would be thrilled to learn of it and that i might become some sort of national celebrity or something.  that has not proved to be the case.  in fact all persons in any sort of position of power who are not complete believers in extraterrestrial life and ufo devotees invariably label me immediately as a lunatic and dismiss my claims.  apparently, other humans either:  a) are sure you are insane, b) do not care much at all, or c) are in awe of you for a short while (until they talk with others about your claims and are convinced by them that you are insane).  being a \"contactee\" (or \"experimentee\", which is a better way to put it in my opinion) is just something you have to get used to and learn to cope with.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3603,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0149856,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07182005-0003","longitude":-105.2705456,"occurred":1055660400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1055660400000,"summary":"First

the\r\nbooster rockets are not what i seen, this thing was not any ways near the shuttle, where i seen this thing , i was at 6 gun shopping plaza . and it went over head before the shuttle had lifted off , in fact it seemed to have timed it self to be at the launch site just as it lifted off .\r\ni was in my car , waiting on my wife to come out of the store , when i\r\nspotted this thing going over head and it made absolutely no sound and\r\nthere was nothing sticking out on it and no wings or rudder or stabilizer also it was staying at the same altitude in a level flight pattern and it went right overhead . it looked like a big cylinder shaped tank with rounded caps on each end  sort of like a bit larger than a railroad tanker and it moved slowly from west to east and it was probably in a line about 50 miles west of where the shuttle went up . \r\ni could not imagine what was keeping it up in the air !\r\nas a matter of fact , right after this thing was out of site , is when\r\nthe shuttle went up , so nasa was surely aware of it's presents , \r\nif not , it's because they aren't saying they seen it .\r\nit looked like a propane tank and it was painted a barn red color and it was about 20 ft. in diameter and about 40 or 50 ft. long .\r\nafterwards , just as the thing was going out of sight over the trees, my wife came out and i tried to get her to see the thing but it was too far away , but then the shuttle was going up in an arc toward the east and i didn't see the boosters drop off because it was too far away from my location in the old six gun plaza in ocala.\r\ni guess no one seen what i did and maxine (my wife) didn't see it either until it was way east of us but i seen it when it was almost overhead and watched it until it was out of site going in a strait line and at the same altitude at about 40 or 50 miles an hour. \r\nthis took place about 4 or 5 pm in the afternoon on a clear day as the\r\nsun was going down in the west .\r\nssssooo , what was it ? this is my first sighting of a ufo  and i am very curious if any other ocala resident seen this thing ? it seems imposible for this thing to be up there and not have any visible means of being supported in the air !\r\ni have checked other ufo sources and i don't find anyone seeing an object of this sort , so i am wondering if there is anyone out there that can corroborate my sighting ? i hope that i'm not the only one that seen this thing .\r\np.S. file #2 is a picture of what this object looked like , it was very simular

timothy lake. it all started sometime after 11:00pm, when i noticed two lights which appeared to be on the mid/lower right part of mt hood. i then asked kristin to come look at the lights. at this time, we didn't think much of it... maybe very large camp fires??? we then headed towards the outhouse with our dog makai'o. upon approaching the outhouse, we had another view of the lights, and there were now three of them, forming a very geometrical triangle with a wide bottom, and two narrower even sides. the lights were also more towards the left side of the mountain at this time. we now were speculating that this experience was something out of the ordinary. \r\n\r\n\tafter coming out of the bathroom we sat on the rocks, and really started to \"tune in\" to the lights. shortly there after, the bottom left light got a bit dimmer, and started to move towards the bottom right light, and ended up merging together briefly. the light then returned to about where it came from. during this whole time, the lights were shifting, and getting lighter and darker. at one point, i flashed the flashlight about 5 times, the bottom right light responded with about 5 blinks/flashes right afterwards. i began to focus on the reflection from the lights on the lake. it appeared as if the reflection created a distinct doorway, at which time i said something along the lines of \"oh my god!!! it's a doorway!!!\" kristin saw exactly the same thing, and we both felt surges of intense energy and chills,  as we noticed the dark figure of a being walking towards us, within the doorway. this experience was so intense that we were both gasping, our eyes filling with tears, and repeating the words \"oh my god\" many times, while clinging to eachother. we both felt an indescribable connection with the energy/being within the doorway. then we decided to walk towards the being in the doorway, which was also an experience that words cannot fully describe. \r\n\r\n\tmakai'o was a bit groggy at this point, and ready to head back to camp. at first we tried to leave him at camp, hoping he would fall asleep, as we headed down to the lake. he did not like this idea so much, so we returned to him to take him with us. all three of us then headed back to the lake. makai'o was now satisfied, and started to doze off as kristin and i sat in our chairs, and watched the lights. (it is now unclear as to the order of experiences, and we both also feel as if we may have forgotten a few things as well.) as an afirmation to my thoughts that first of all, these lights were the lumerians, and second of all, they were now acknowledging that i am now moving in the right direction in my life and on my spiritual path, the lights moved into a perfectly straight line. sometimes, the bottom light in particular would get extremely bright, and surge with energy, in relations to our thoughts and what we were saying. one example of this occurance, which stands out, is when i said that i would tell diane they (lumerians) say hello. the bottom right light got extremely bright again, and then briefly went dim, when i thought about how brian was going to climb mt shasta the following weekend, and i wondered if brian would have any experiences with the lumerians. the same light also did this upon my recieving the message that they egerly await more conscious, closer interactions and engadgements, as we do.  there were more then a dozen simmilar correlations with our thoughts and things we said. we were guided to hold out our hands at one point, and we could actually feel them holding our hands. an airplane flew above, and the lights on the mountain at that point were forming the exact same triangle as the lights on the plane. another plane flew above us later, and for about 90%? of the times that the planes light blinked, a frog would ribbit. this went on for a good period of time as the plane flew over the lake, and kristin and i found this to be quite amuzing. at one point the lights were pointing in a particular direction in the sky. when kristin looked in that direction she saw the exact same formation of lights that were on the mountain. the bottom right star faded away. then she looked back at the mountain and noticed that the bottom right light had also appeared to be \"gone\". she then looked back up at the stars, and noticed that the \"missing star\" was now there, and she then looked at the mountain where the missing light had also retured. during this whole experience , the bottom right light stayed to the right of the upper middle light. i visualised the bottom light crossing over to the left side of the upper light, and thought that this would signify crossing over into the assension of humanity, and earth, from our current reality, into the reality of love. shortly after this visualization, the bottom right light actually did cross over to the other side of the upper light. this seemed to be another afirmation. \r\n\r\n\tthis whole experience must have been for more then an hour and a half..... but it was all so timeless.... we really were within another reality/state of being. the main message i recieved was that we can be in that state of being whenever we want, and that the lumerians (and others) are always holding our hands along the way of our paths, but that we are the ones who have to do the work,take action,make the right decisions, and just simply exist within the vibration of love. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t ","distance":"20 Feet or

avenue, looking at the sky and clouds as i usually do while walking home.  at 7:03 pm, i watched a jet climbing at about 7,000 to 10,000 feet altitude heading out of jfk airport heading due west, make a slow, wide turn to the southeast.  at the same time i noticed that there was what at first looked like an orange/red balloon flying eastward at about 5,000 feet in front of and below the jet.  as the jet flew over the object, the object made a slow tight circle underneath and towards the jet as if it was watching the jet make the turn southeast.  the object waited about ten to fifteen seconds after the jet had made its turn southeast and started moving straight up to about 15,000 feet and then moved through the top of a very large cloud bank and out of sight at 20,000 feet or higher.  i saw clearly during the objects slow tight circle (a circle of about a city block) that this object was disk shaped and its shape was much more defined against the white cloud behind it.  the object���s movements were completely smooth compared to the very wide left turn the jet had to make to turn southeast.  it didn't wobble or move erratically at any time.  i can't be sure as to its size but i figure it was about 1/20 the size of the jet it passed underneath.  the jet looked like a 727.  i have seen many lost balloons floating across the sky before and they all moved according to the direction of the wind.  this object first traveled east and then made a slow small circle under the jet as if taking a look at the jet as it made the turn towards the south.  i watch the sky

approached the town hall i noticed a craft about the size of two cars parked next to each other hovering above the power lines, maybe 20 feet above them.  they were the large kind of power lines, the twin span ones that run over the road, not parallel with it.  anyway, it was about the same size as the power lines were wide, and it was circular, the typical ufo disc shape, but very small in comparison to what youd think a ufo would be in size.  the color of it was very strange, it looked dark and shiny both at the same time, almost like a shimmering black void.  there was no noise coming from the ufo whatsoever, not even a hum or buzz- no sound at all.  there were no noticeable windows, or doors, only a circular ring of white lights that did not blink, except for a moment when i got out of my car.  it was a very strange feeling to see it, because i have been enthralled with ufo's since i was a child and always thought that if i ever saw one i would probably be frightend out of my mind, but seeing the object up close i felt no fear whatsoever.  in fact i stopped my car to watch the craft for a couple of minutes because i was so overtaken by seeing it, again i felt no fear whatsoever.  after observing it, i got this incredible urge to get out of my car and approach it.  as i opened my car door to get out, the white lights that went circular around the object started to blink and i immedietly got back in my car and started to drive away.  as i drove away, i got my courage back up and turned around to go back to see it one more time, and it was gone.  my immediate reaction to seeing the ufo was that i was seeing a ufo.  the whole time i observed it, the energy in the air around the object almost felt suspended, like the object had its own foreign energy field that this atmosphere was uncomfortable with.  afterwards, as i thought back on what i had seen, my opinion of what i saw never changed or wavered.  i shared the story with everyone i felt comfortable sharing it with, mostly with negative feedback.  what made me the most confident about the encounter was the fact that six months or so later i saw the same object hovering over the river near my house, only this time my brother was in the car with me and saw the object as well, and he had previously been doubtful about what i saw before.","distance":"21-100

virginia man, reporting that his wife witnessed something strange late in the night, during a storm that hit our area the previous day  (clifton is approximately 12 miles west of springfield, in which i reside).  email sighting account in part: \"we had a power outage last night and my wife was awakened by the answering machine clicking on and off as the power tried to recover, and then it went out completely. she went to the front door to see if it was raining or windy and saw a very large object hovering over a nearby house about an 1/8 of a mile from our house. it was larger than the house, seemed to be at an angle to her view with the bottom exposed and had lights all around it evenly spaced. when it began to move away, several lightning flashes were seen and then it was gone. the power returned two hours later\".\r\n\r\na second email was received the next day stating that he had a chance to talk to his wife about this sighting and he added that it would seem that his wife might have actually observed \"balls of lightning\". he also wrote: \"what she describes sounds just like a multiple ball lightning display which she says disappeared as she watched it, and then a bolt of lightning went up into the space above the house from the ground to where the lights had appeared to be\".\r\n\r\na little more details were obtained during a telephone interview that was conducted  march 31st. sighting took place around 12:30 am, march 23, during a thunderstorm, as she was facing south, towards manassas. the length of the appearance lasted just a few seconds, from the \"balls of light\" formation to the vertical lightning flash. \r\n\r\nit is my belief that this woman may have witness a natural, rare atmospheric phenomena (rap) involving multiple ball lightning, or mobile luminous spheres. to be a witness of one or two of these lightning balls are rare but witnessing a group of ten or more is phenomenal!\r\n\r\naccording to dominion virginia power website, their electrical outage legend summary dated 3/23/2005, indicated that there were about 24 homes that were affected by this storm in the northern virginia's fairfax county area.\r\nmarch 23rd temperature:
