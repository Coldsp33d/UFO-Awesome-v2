satellites we were tracking.  once we had adjusted to their flight path, a 3rd similar object came from the west and \"met up\" with the other 2 objects in a diagonal path.  we tracked the 3 objects for another second or so before they were sufficiently to the north that we could not see them anymore.  total viewing time was approx 8-10 seconds.  there were no observable lights or fluctuations in the flight path.  we both talked about the experience for about 10 minutes and agreed that they were not satellites (larger and faster moving), birds (uniform speeds and trajectories) or airplanes (no lights, sounds and faster).","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

near the end of summer.\r\n\r\nsomewhere between 10 and 12 p.M. on a relatively isolated road somewhere near the carmel, in mejier (which is where we were headed) my twin brother, father, and i had an encounter with a large, floating triangular shaped object. in our station wagon with our dad driving we were seated in the back of the vehicle. my brother initially spotted the object coming to the left of our vehicle. it matched our velocity and followed directly above our vehicle for fifteen minutes or so. it made no sound and had red, white, and blue lights on its three tips (we both made note of this thing in particular). i couldn't see significantly above this craft as it was directly above us, but i had the impression it was pyramidal in shape (looking back i swear i saw another light on the top of the object when it left us but my brother saw no light). it followed us just above the tree tops, which i estimate was probably 20-30 feet above our car (possibly even less it was incredibly close to our car). my perspective of it was massive (it covered a good portion of the sky above our vehicle) but its size was probably about three to five times our car's size. it gently rolled back and forth very slightly between the left and right windows of our car; allowing us to see it above our car while we were inside of it. the object seemed to hover more toward where my brother and i were sitting in the center of the car. my father, as he was driving, never looked up to see the object. it seemed odd to me that he didn't look up, but we never actually arrived at a place where he could or would stop the car. the purpose of this object has always been baffling to me, but it seemed distinctly interested in our vehicle and ours alone. another odd thing i noticed when we were driving is that there didn't appear to be any people near our vehicle (on foot or in other cars). the only other vehicle i possibly i spotted was probably a mile behind us. when we approached the nearby mejier the object veered away (back to the left, the direction it came from), i never saw it rise a significant height but it seemed to move off to the horizon. my brother and i tracked it as long as we could until it looked like a multiple colored star in the distance. it remained stationary and i eventually assumed that this was in fact a star and not the object itself. we may have mistaken this star for the object in the distance as we lost sight of it, or it may have remained stationary for some reason at that point. we looked back in that direction when we came out of the mejier and the light remained, and i assumed it was a star.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

10:30 we were coming up on the final turn onto our road.  my friend was ahead of me.  he made the turn, as i came up to it, i thought i saw an orange light out of the corner of my eye directly north of us.  but, when i looked up, nothing was there.  i looked back down, and saw my friend had shut his bike off in the middle of the street.  i pulled up and asked him what he was doing.  he said, \"did you see that?\"  i said, \"the orange light?  yeah, i saw it for a split second, but it was gone.\"  he said that when he turned on our road he could see it for about a full second, and it simply disappeared.  we made our way back home, and stood around in the driveway talking about what we had seen.  about 5 minutes later (10:36 pm or so) we saw the light again.  it was low enough to get lost behind some trees.  it was about as large as if you held a pea out at arms length, and very bright.  we ran out to the road to re-aquire the light.  we watched it for about 30 seconds, it was north of us, heading south, right at us.  it didn't seem to be traveling very fast.  then, like before, it disappeared.  it didn't look like something was simply 'turned off.'  it looked as if the light caved in on itself.  we went inside to grab the video camera, sure that the light would return.  we went back outside, and waited.  we didn't see the orange light again, but, at about 10:45 pm to our disbelief we saw what appeared to be a triangle with a solid red light at each corner.  there was no sound, and no flashing lights.  it was traveling se at a pretty high speed.  assuming it's altitude to be around 30,000 ft.  i would say it was moving at about 500-600 mph, and would be much larger than an airliner.  at this point, we realized the battery for our camera was dead.  30 seconds later, it was only visable as a small red speck in the sky, that faded to nothing.  a few minutes later, my friend was in the garage, and i was standing just outside of it.  i glanced over our house, and saw what i thought to be a very bright star.  i looked away, thinking to myself i didn't remember seeing a star that bright in that position in the sky.  i looked back and noticed it was moving north, slowly.  as it moved it was dimming.  by the time i yelled at my friend, and he ran out, it was about half as bright as it was origionally.  we watched it slowly move north and fade in intensity for about 20 seconds.  before it was totally faded out, we observed a 'core', something solid the ligt was coming from.  it simply was not visable once the light had dimmed completely.  we were scared through each of these observations.  i am unsure of what, but, there is definitely something going on out here.  this is not the first time that i have seen strange things in the sky in recent months.  i have seen things by myself, as well with one or two witnesses (my room mates).","distance":"Over One

have dinner, and then sit out back on their porch to smoke cigars, cigarettes and have some beers.  when this activity takes us into the evening, ���the girls��� get out their astronomy book to look up and discuss the constellations that we can see (during any particular time of year).  that saturday night we (myself, john, elly, steph, and michelle (john was in the bathroom at the time of the incident)) noticed a few shooting stars, so we began to pay particular attention to the sky.  about 10:30-ish, i saw an object coming from west moving east, and i said, ���what is that!���  everyone looked at where i was looking at, and had the same surprise reaction that i had to it.  we (me and elly) got out of our chairs to step out into the middle of the yard to get a better view of this object.  the object crossed the sky but did not follow the curve of the sky, in which it should have disappeared over the horizon, but instead it seemed to have just kept going strait ���out���, due east, and it seemed to have disappeared about ���10 degrees��� above the horizon.  as it was moving out of sight, it seemed to me that the object split into two, but the object was quite blurry at that point to me.  the person i was standing beside (elly) gasped and said that the object just ���zigzagged��� then disappeared.\r\n\r\ni have glasses that i use to see distances clearly, unfortunately i did not have them that evening.  when i do not have my glasses i can easily make out the shape of airplanes with their lights on in the night sky, but this object had no lights and it appeared to be high in the sky, and i could still make out a basic triangular shape of it, which in my opinion means that the object was very big.  \r\n\r\nbecause we ���watch��� the sky regularly, and we live by ft indiantown gap (the gap), and harrisburg international airport (hia), we pay attention to the airplanes that we see, more for casual conversation pieces then anything else.  airplanes usually take about a minute to cross the sky unless they are some of the jets out from the gap, or from the air national guard unit at hia.  but when they cross the sky quickly like that, they are low and you can hear them, and clearly make out what they are.  this object crossed the sky in about 15-20 seconds, and as stated earlier it had no lights and made no sound.  \r\n\r\ni asked what everyone thought it looked like and what they thought it was.  one person said she (michelle) originally thought it was a bat, because of it shape, but when i made a ���big deal��� about it she could clearly see it was too high in the sky, and moving way to fast to be an animal.  she did not get out of her chair to watch it so it left her sight as it passed into the trees.  she only saw it for about 5-10 seconds.  elly who went out into the yard with me, said that it has a basic shape of a ���stealth fighter���, and she states she clearly saw it ���zigzag��� before it disappeared.  steph had no opinion except that it looked like nothing she ever saw before.  michelle and steph went home shortly after the ���incident���.  we (me, john, who saw nothing, and his wife elly) stayed up and watched the sky intently.  \r\n\r\nthat night we saw about dozen-ish shooting stars, 9 airplanes (after the incident), 6 satellites, (which is unusual in itself), 2 birds (probably geese) and one unknown object. \r\n\r\nanswer to question area/technical:  we live near an airport, power station (tmi), railroad, military instillation (ft. indiantown gap, and power lines because of the

look for this very object(s) as seen last 4th of july at the same time in the same general area of the sky.\r\n\r\ni first spotted it a 9:03pm (sprint time on my cell phone) at approximately 123-degrees magnetic bearing from my location at approx. 7-degrees elevation.  it was a bright, steady red light, comparable in brightness to that of the red navigation light on a small general aviation aircraft, of which there were two or three in the south pattern at gillespie field airport at the time.  the color of red seemed slightly deeper than standard navigation light red.  the object was moving very slowly but steadily from south to north and ascending slightly.  after about 5 minutes, it began to flicker a bit.  the flickering progressed with time to where at 9:15pm it was flickering as if a flame being blown by wind.  no regularity to the flickering.\r\n\r\nat 9:17pm, the light flickered out as if it was a flame source that ran out of fuel.  i watched it through the telescope as the last glimmer of its light flickered out...And it was gone.  last bearing, 107-deg magnetic, 12-deg elevation.  (based on alignment with polaris(north star) and subtracting local magnetic variation of about 14-deg.)\r\n\r\n\r\nits appearance through the telescope gave no more details than looking at a bright star through the telescope.  there was no smoke trail visible as i might expect from a burning flare.  flares can leave a smoke trail in the air that their own light will illuminate.  there was no parachute or balloon visible that might have been illuminated by the light of a flare.  no falling sparks visible.\r\n\r\nthe 9pm local airport weather reports:\r\nmontgomery fld -

was sitting on\r\nthe beach with a friend about twenty feet from the water.\r\nwhile we were talking i noticed what i thought was a shooting star several miles east of us and traveling from\r\nsouth to  north.  at that time i thought it was quite odd\r\nto see a shooting star as we were under fully overcast\r\nskies.  i didn't give it any more thought since i was more\r\ninterested in the girl i was with.  \r\n\r\nseveral minutes later i noticed the tops of distant trees\r\nbeing luminated much like a cars headlights light up trees\r\non a distant mountain.  again i thought it was odd as\r\nthere are no trees that tall in the direction i was looking.\r\nthis still wasn't enough to distract me from the girl.  though i did mention both occurances to her.\r\n\r\nseveral minutes later as we talked we both noticed it\r\ngetting lighter where we were sitting.  we looked around\r\nand didn't see anything unusual until we looked up.\r\n\r\nsitting at about 45 degrees above us and about 100 feet\r\naway was a glowing sphere about 3 feet in diameter.  it was\r\ncompletely silent.  it was slowly rotating and had a \r\ntexture that looked very much like liquid crystal, the\r\ntype used in lcd displays.\r\n\r\nfor several minutes it didn't move at all. then it\r\nslowly started to follow the edge of the water coming\r\ntoward us for several more minutes. it then instantly\r\nshot north just over the trees.  it didn't appear to \r\naccelerate, it seemed to instantly be going at whatever\r\nspeed it went leaving nothing more than a slight woosh\r\nsound. it was out of sight in less than one second.\r\n\r\nwe sat back down and needless to say that was the subject\r\nof conversation for the next 20 minutes.  we then noticed\r\nthe same light around us and when we looked up, it was back\r\nin almost the same position.  again it sat there for a\r\nminute and again started to follow the edge of the water.\r\nthis time however, shortly after starting to move it \r\nvery rapidly carved out a star shape, as you would draw\r\na star on paper, but each leg was about 40 feet. on the\r\nlast leg of the star it shot down into the water and\r\ncrashed about 100 feet from where we were standing\r\nand only about 20 feet out in the water.  the star pattern\r\nand the crash all happend in well under a second.\r\n\r\nit went out of site for about 30 seconds under water.\r\ni ran to the edge of the water adjacent to the\r\nobject.  it then popped back up and was floating on\r\nthe surface.  it was broken with about an 18 inch hole\r\nthat was pointing toward me.  it was still glowing\r\nand i could see some of the insides.  it was a hollow\r\nsphere with about a 1/2 inch wall thickness. there was\r\na bundle of what appeared to be fiber optic type cable\r\nhanging over the edge of the hole that were also glowing. that was everything i could see.\r\n\r\ni started to run into the water to grab it but about\r\nthree steps into it i stopped, thinking that might\r\nnot be a smart thing to do since i don't know what\r\nit is, and it's broken.  the thought ran through my\r\nhead \"am i willing to die to have this thing?\" the\r\nanswer was no.  i stood there for about 10 more minutes.\r\nit slowly started to dim and it finally sank right there.\r\n\r\nprior to this incident i never really gave ufo's much\r\nthought beyond entertainment value.  but that was \r\na convincer for me as it was for my friend.\r\n\r\nthanks for letting me share my experience.\r\n\r\nandy\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

shape but couldnt be sure, i recall and oval of dark matter.Also with each pass  there was a low hum or vibration type sound. july 1 . now on the second i seen the same object but much higher up but the flashing of the 2 red lights and one white (like a diamond)then what i thought was a plane appeared to cross my eye sight it had 3 or 4 white flashing lights there was a hum and a vibration sound

the time, stuck her head in the door and said, \"come here, i see a ufo.\"  my first thought was that it would be an airplane.  i went outside and saw a yellowish-white steady light that was about the same intensity and size as a bright star travelling across the night sky going from southwest to northeast and appeared to be approximately 10,000 feet high and going about the same speed as a jet aircraft would.  i first thought \"airplane\" but noticed that it had no strobe lights and no green/red nav lights.  the intensity of the light stayed steady as it passed over and off into the distance which would not typically be the case if it were aircraft landing lights that i saw.  my wife said that the object appeared to be in a lazy zig-zag motion, and i saw this too but only after she mentioned it so this may have just been the power of suggestion.  i took no photos or video of the event, the thought never even crossed my mind to do so.","distance":"Over One

30 red lights all arround the edge of it. it was very big. it moved across the sky slowy. it was not a plane or helicopter, because i love planes and  helicopters,and i know what they look like and sound like. it did not make any sounds. i saw it in the sky for about 15-20 seconds. i was scared so i ran down to my front purch. at first i thought it was a planes but i soon raelized it was not. i told my mom and she did not understand what i was describing to her. i lost sight of it when it started to head towards the woods and then it disappeared into the wood.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
