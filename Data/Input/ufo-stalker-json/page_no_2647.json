me?\"  i was in the middle of no were alone.  i just had this feeling that this was from god so i said \"sure i would like to see you\" but in the back of my mind i considered that it could be something else. nothing else happened right then so i shrug it off and continued to drive to work (i am a security guard) .  i started my shift.  around 2:00 or 3:00 a.M. another thought came in my mind like the first that asked me if i wanted to make up a story about god coming to see me.  i thought for a second yes but i know that that was not my thought, that some how that thought was also put in my head at the same time (this sounds strange but i am telling you the truth i think it was a test to see if i was honest)and i over rode the thought and said \"no i can't do that to god\".  i looked out the window  and noticed a large grasshopper sitting on the fence about 12 feet away from me.  as i looked at the grasshopper an e.T. fadded in between me and the grasshopper only about 6 feet away just outside the window (i got a really good look at him)and gave me a message then fadded back out.  he said the message was from god.  i later gave the message to a local church and tried to get them to help me figure out what had happened but they wouldn't help me.  they said that they thought i was crazy (they referred me to a mental hospital).  that really hurt, here i was going to the only place i thought i could count on for help with something spirit related and they said that.  i would like to add that since this has happened i have never thought more clearer and my memory has imporved five times since.  i have also noticed that i understand bible and am currently figuring out its mysteries.  i believe that i have indeed seen jesus.  i am willing to take a lie detector test and any other test to prove that i am telling the truth about this. while this was happening to me an intence fear overtook my whole body.  the e.T. said that this is a side effect of the way that they comunicate and don't be affraid.  i have noticed that they can give you a long message in a very short amont of time.  since this has happened i have had a couple of these visit mostly at night in my sleep where they have downloaded a bunch of information about the bible in my head. now i know when they are around because of this intence fear when they comunicate, but they have not showed there self since this first visit (i would be able to explain better in person about this fear and what it means).  i would give you the message myself but i was told by them not to give out the message because i messed up and accidently changed it when i keep trying to get help from the church.  i will tell you what churches i gave the message to so you can get a copy of it if you like.  i would like to add that i have no doubt that this was indeed jesus. yeshua. this was an important event and i hope you give me some consideration.  thanks carl","distance":"20 Feet or Less,

brightness. it travelled about the speed and distance of the iridium satellites i have seen, but it was travelling in a different path from the parallel paths i have seen them go. i ran into the house and grabbed some binoculars. it appeared to be circular with lines (rods?) radiating out every 30 degrees each about the same length of the radius of the object itself. it was travelling at variable speed and occasionally curving in its movement. there were no flashing lights as would be seen on an aircraft. i followed it with my binoculars as long as i could until it went out of sight to the

believe me? i am 49 years old, and saw what i know now to be a ufo, when i was about 15 years old. i can still see the disc in my mind's eye, as if it happened only recently.\r\n   i'm guessing that it was close to 9:00 p.M. when it occurred. i was driving home from a church choir rehearsal(i had been driving since i was about 11 years old. this was not uncommon in rural south arkansas), and not really thinking about anything in particular. the road we lived on had several rolling hills. as i topped the first in a series of three of these hills, i screamed as i saw a very, very large luminescent silver disc that filled the sky in front of me. our home could have fit inside of it several times over! it seemed to hang suspended in the air at a 45 degree angle, and made no sound. i kept on driving but my eyes never left this sight. on top of the disc was a smaller dome-like area surrounded by multi-colored lights. the color was like nothing i had ever seen. it is difficult even now to describe. i know that it was silver, but it also had another quality about it. i can only describe it as a \"glow\". even that does not adequately describe it.\r\n   as i continued to drive toward home, the next hill i ascended blocked my view for a moment. when i reached the top of the next hill, the object had disappeared. it had only been a matter of seconds since it left my view! i was terrified, and raced to tell my parents what i had seen. i was truly afraid, and very convinced that this \"flying saucer\" had literally landed in our yard. (we lived on a 7 acre tract) in my haste to get inside the house, i skinned my knee jumping out of the car. the pain of the scrape was nothing compared to the fear i was feeling. \r\n   when i told my mother what i had seen, she laughed at me, and tried to explain it away by telling me that it must have been \"only a weather balloon\"! nothing i described to her even came close to changing her mind.\r\n   i have been a nurse for the last 25 years, and work in a local emergency room. i am a wife, mother and grandmother. for all intents and purposes, i live an ordinary life. \r\n   the memory of that night remains fresh in my mind. i know how insane this would sound to most people, so i have kept it mostly to myself, telling only a few people over the years. \r\n   \r\n      ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":3526,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.20763,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06282005-0013","longitude":-92.6662674,"occurred":28800000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":28800000000,"summary":"Huge luminicent silver disc w/multi-colored lights around upper dome","tags":["lights","disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"El Dorado, Arkansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:566047"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bremerton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":null,"distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3525,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.57,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06282005-0012","longitude":-122.6525,"occurred":-60537600000,"potentialRelations":[3527],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-60537600000,"summary":"Abduction","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Bremerton, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:566048"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Oklahoma City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1.  i was with my pastor, two evangelists, and my pastor's agnostic niece.  we were driving from la to co to visit my pastor's family and celibrate new years.  we were on the highway in oklahoma city (if i remember correctly)  it was between maybe 8 and 10 pm.  \r\n\r\n2.  my pastor and i both saw three orbs moving irratically in front of us in the sky.  i asked, \"what are those?\"  they were opaque yet transparent at the same time, swirling colors, zipping, zig zagging.  i looked to the right, above us, and there was a huge black thing with lots of tiny lights.  it was completely silent.  my first thought was, \"mercy, its as big as a football field!\"  \r\n\r\n3.  the pastor, the two evangelists, and myself were gaping in awe at the orbs and the huge ship on the right, in the sky. in unison we all said, \"are those ufo's???\"\r\n\r\n4.  it appeared to be flying very low, perhaps at the same altitude as the goodyear blimp?  it was hovering, moving foward very slowly.  i looked at the traffic around me and saw others had also seen it and their jaws were dropped as well.  we were travelling nw, and the three orbs were directly in front of us just up of the horizon, and the big black ship was on our right.  the main thing was the three orbs, swirling colors that seemed transparent, but weren't were what got our attention.\r\n\r\n5.  i was in awe.  as a new convert, and fundamentalist, it was perplexing, as i had nothing to relate it to. i wanted the pastor to pull over.  i was drawn to the orbs and the ship.  i wanted to savor the experience. we all were in awe at first, but my pastor insisted that they were demon ships and started praying and stepped on the gas.  when we arrived in colorado springs, the pastor and all of us exclaimed what we had seen, and we all marvelled.  i was very dissappointed that they were perceived as \"demon\" ships.  i didn't sense or feel anything negative whatsoever. on the contrary, i was very drawn to them, without any fear.  \r\n\r\n6.  my pastor kept on driving and wouldn't stop so i have no idea how long those flying things were up there.  it seemed we saw them at least for several minutes, with no indication of them dissappearing.\r\n\r\nfinal note:  both my pastor and myself were both active duty air force at 6the time, stationed at barksdale afb, la.  although i am no longer a part of that religious organization, it was an experience i never forgot.  i apologize about forgetting the exact date, but it was somewhere around dec 27 - 29, 1987.  there was a program about ufos, and i wasn't paying attention until i heard the word, \"football field\" and the memories flooded back. i find it interesting that someone else used that exact same description as i had.  all i know is somewhere out there, there are four people that were in the car with me, that witnessed this event, as well.

located reasonably close to miramar marine corp station.  just before opening my car door, i saw a bright light on the western horizon -- about two to three times as bright as jupiter.  thinking it was a plane, i stopped, and watched as it approached.  usually, f-18s are landing about this time at night.\r\n\r\nas the vehicle started to come into better view, i noticed a few odd things about the vehicle:\r\n\r\n1) both right- and left-hand wing lights were white, and about the same intensity as the front light.  normal airplanes will tend to have a red/green light combination instead.\r\n\r\n2) the right-hand \"wing\" light was strobing more or less once every two seconds.  the red strobe followed, synchronized, approximately half-second after.  typical airplane strobes are located on both wings, and never on the underbelly of a fuselage, and tend to strobe concurrently or in bursts (e.G., three flashes, then no flashes for about a second, etc).\r\n\r\n3) the red strobe was located in the geometric center of the lights, which is quite an unusual location to put any airplane 'red light'.\r\n\r\n4) regardless of the location in the sky, all lights were uniform in brightness, and all strobes could be seen plainly.  that is, the lights this thing produced were omni-directional, not focused forward like in normal aircraft.\r\n\r\nas it got closer, my suspicions were confirmed as it made absolutely, positively, 100% no sound what-so-ever.  the air was still, except for the occasional gentle breeze.  the vehicle also was flying relatively low; its arc-width in the sky appeared to be similar to that of an f-18, but made no attempts to lower its altitude at all.  for this reason, i cannot even begin to guess how far away this object was.\r\n\r\nit was completely silent as traveled by towards the east, in a straight line.  total transit time was approximately 15 to 20 seconds.  i lost sight of it after it went behind some trees.\r\n\r\nvery excited that i saw my first flying triangle, i wanted to get home and write an e-mail to my father about this incident.  after arriving home, at approximately 10:15, i got out of the car, and looked up (i almost always do this anyway, being an amateur astronomy buff).  lo and behold, there were both normal airplanes (which made distinct noises) and *three* flying triangles traveling in the sky over my street.\r\n\r\nthe triangles at home lacked any strobes of any kind.  just three white lights, forming equilateral triangles, gliding noiselessly in the sky.  this was easily confirmed after all normal aircraft had left the area, and all that remained were triads of moving lights without sound.\r\n\r\none was making a course change in the form of a wide, sweeping, graceful arc.  the other two were flying in straight lines, normal to each other in their respective geometric planes.  they were lower in altitude than the normal aircraft flying in the area, as the a plane that went behind one of the triangles was occulted by the flying triangle.  they were also higher in altitude than the first triangle i saw while leaving work, however.  despite this, they were actually moving *faster* in the sky than the first triangle i've seen.  however, their speeds were consistent, and showed no evidence of zigging, zagging, or other characteristically \"ufo\" flight patterns.  i lost sight of each of these triangles as they also disappeared behind trees or approached the horizon.  total display time here was about 1.5 minutes, estimated.\r\n\r\nthe eerie thing about this was that i wasn't frightened at all.  and while i enjoyed the display, i wasn't mesmorized by it.  odd as it may sound, and usually quite contrary to most ufo reportings i've read previously, my life just went on as normal, quite confident that i'll be seeing more of these in the future, and that there is absolutely nothing \"wrong\" or out of place with these things.  they are easily confused for airplanes by people who don't know how to tell the difference, so i suspect that these things are just all over the place, and most people don't realize what they're seeing.\r\n\r\nfrom now on, i will be keeping a digital camera in my car, just in case this happens again.  i would love to snap a few pictures next time i see one.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

moved the entire time but hovered over a power line and street light about 200 feet high. as we got closer became very interested and watched intently. when became very near asked dad to stop car so could observe more closely but he would not although he did see it also. i was 21 at the time and in college. we drove directly under the object which appeared to be the size of a medium size house. i rolled down window and looked straight at bottom of object which was silvery metallic with flashing varicolored lights on one side (the one facing east). the object emitted no detectable sound. there was a line on bottom which was square shaped but with rounded edges. i implored my dad to stop,saying \"what the hell is that?\" had no camera with me. he would not stop--don't know why, maybe scared. he is now 78 and still remembers it clearly as i do. 6. went around curve in road. moonless night but street lamp reflected off bottom of object. object in full clear view for about 7 minutes and still there when we went around curve and proceeded out of sight. i was at the university of alabama in 1972 and stanton friedman came to speak there and i went to the meeting, but did not report the sighting because i was shy of becoming involved. i did not raise my hand when he asked people to indicate if they ever had a sighting--later regretted not reporting so am doing so now. what could it have been? it was close, real, seen by myself and father for about 7 minutes, drove right under it, i could not think of anything terrestrial that it could be unless secret weapon or aircraft of government--doubted this seriously. i treasure the memory in a way but wish i had had a camera there with

the south, south east when i noticed a large bright orange object relativly low in the sky 10-15 miles from me. i first thought the object may have been the planet mars understanding mars position and that at this time mars was supposed to be very large and bright. at first it acted as a planet should and remained in position. the object did appear to twinkle some but i chalked that up to atmospheric conditions. several minutes later (5-10) the object began slowly moving to the north. as it moved to the north it's brighness began to fade changing into a barely visible flashing red and white color then eventually disappearing. the object appeared over again several times almost in the same area repeating the same actions. a few times during this period as the bright object moved away and slowly dissapeared it was replaced by another bright orange object which would again move away in the same direction. at one point in my observation a helicopter with no lights on flew directly over my position and toward the object (n.W to. s.E). i lost track of the helicopter when i went into the house to tell other people what was happening. my initial reaction was of dis-belief.

(actually between two bunches of trees in the distance), a dark grey or black rectangular object hanging in the sky, which seemed to be tapered on its lower end.  it was about the size of a dime, if held at arms-length.  its shape was like a rectangle with its longer measure pointing up and down, but its lower end was more tapered than its top end, as if maybe the lower end was pointed away from me and the top end was pointed towards me, so that the top end appeared bigger and the lower end smaller.  i don't know how far away it was, or how big it was, but i'd estimate, just by the way it looked through the haze, and the fact that it was very low on the horizon, that it was only a few miles away.\r\n\r\nit most definitely was not a plane.  i suppose it could have been the rectangular underside of a dark green huey-type army helicopter, but it sure didn't look like that, and i can't think of any reason why a military helicopter would be in that area (there aren't any military bases nearby), and hovering with its nose pointed up at such an angle, so that i could see its entire undercarriage from several miles away.  i think that such an extreme manuever would have put any helicopter at risk of crashing.  also, huey-type military helicopters make a very loud \"whump-whump-whump\" sound with their rotor blades that can be heard (and sometimes even felt) from miles away, but i didn't hear any sound.  my first thought was that it might be some kind of strange rectangular advertising balloon, or a cluster of balloons in a rectangular formation, even though i'd never seen a rectangular configuration of balloons before.  and, it just didn't didn't look like any balloons i'd ever seen.  it looked like a solid object.  i actually said aloud to myself, \"what the hell is that?\"  i drive east on 166th street every sunday, and i'd never seen anything like that before.  it was very low on the horizon, and i was able to catch only a few glimpses of it between the many trees in that area, as i drove.  when i first saw it on 166th street, it seemed to be stationary, but after i got onto indiana avenue going north, i realized that it must have moved, because i couldn't find it again in the location where i first saw it.  about 3 minutes later (11:03 am), i got another glimpse of it as i drove east on 154th street, near the intersection of 154th street and cottage grove avenue (i drive fast).  at that time, it had definitely moved quite a distance to the northwest, because now it was almost due north of me, behind st. jude church, but still several miles away, and low on the horizon.  after picking up my mom at st. jude church, i told her about it, and then drove further east on 154th street, trying to find it again.\r\n\r\nabout 3 minutes later (11:06 am), i saw it one last time as i drove east on 154th street (also called pulaski road) in calumet city, near the intersection of 154th street and michigan city road.  it was now directly north of me, way off in the distance behind dirksen junior high school, and it now looked like an elongated dark grey or black teardrop, with the larger bulbous end facing down.  it was also obviously much farther away to the north, because it was more obscured by haze at that point, and smaller.\r\n\r\nafter seeing it in the distance behind dirksen junior high school, i turned left onto calhoun street, going north, attempting to get past all the trees in that area and find it again.  but when i got to a relatively clear area near calhoun street and sibley blvd. a few seconds later, it was gone.\r\n\r\nthis was definitely the strangest thing i've ever seen in the sky.  i'm still trying to find a logical explanation for what it was.  i thought maybe there was an air show downtown, and that this object might have been some weird aircraft that was part of the show.  but as far as i know, there was no air show going in downtown chicago on 6/26/2005.  then i thought, maybe it was some type of large advertising display being pulled by a small plane.  but it was just too big and bulky-looking to be that.  usually, such aerial advertising displays are of the long, thin banner variety.  any advertising display which was so big and bulky would have interfered with the aerodynamics of the plane pulling it, and caused the plane to crash.  then i thought, maybe it was just a strange rectangular balloon.  but it was just going too damned fast to be any type of balloon.  i've seen goodyear-type balloons in this area before, so i know what they look like, and how slow they travel.  if it was a balloon, it could not have covered such a distance and disppeared from view so quickly.  and, as i mentioned, it definitely was not a plane, and i don't believe that it was a helicopter, either.\r\n\r\ni would like to know what the hell this thing was.  it's really bugging me now.  i actually called the non-emergency numbers for both the south holland and calumet city police, and asked them if anyone had reported anything strange in the sky at around 11:00 am, but they both said that nothing had been reported.  that doesn't really surprise me, due to the short length of time it was visible.  but i would like to know if anyone else saw anything strange in the sky that morning, or whether it was just a big, dark colored helicopter or something.\r\n","distance":"Over One

cigarettes !! at that time i witnessed an ufo which i reported to you guys upon returning home !! when i also walked over for smokes in the wee hours of wednesday and friday mornings , it was gone !! \r\n\r\ni just came back from buying 3 packs at hess and it's back !! \r\n\r\nthe other time i saw this it moved swiftly south to a direct line with chapel street , in mere seconds , hovered , did a very tight u-turn and returned to where it had been hovering previously just as rapidly and all silently !! \r\n\r\nthis time it expressed no such interest in me, if interest that was , however, it did react to my presence seemingly !! \r\n\r\ni had been watching a 2 hour segment on asteroids , comets ,meteors , meterorites and impact craters on the history channel and ran out of cigarettes !! i might have previously mentioned my interest in this topic !! about 5 minutes before 2:00 am i left to walk down to the local hess station on north main street to pick up 3 packs of smokes !!  i looked over my shoulder and the same ufo , flashing or strobing red and green lights alternating with a bright blue light , in that same repeat pattern was hovering in the same position , at north - north-west and at about the same height !! \r\n\r\nthere was quite a bit of cloud cover in that region of the sky obscuring all else !! i would take this to mean that i had been correct in my assessment that it was at about the height of your typical jetliner and below the cloud cover !! other stars and the moon were visible elsewhere in the sky !! in this particular region of the sky , the ufo was alone as nothing else was visible !!\r\n\r\ni walked down to hess and picked up my smokes , my receipt is time-stamped at 2:06 am . i spoke with the cashier for a few moments and started walking home !! the ufo was still silently hovering at its' former location .\r\n\r\nwhen i got to the rear of my apartment building it still had not moved !! i decided to walk around the side to the front , near i would normally put out the trash for the weekly pickup !! in those few seconds , it silently and speedily moved a few degrees westward to north-west and resumed to hover silently !! the building hid the ufo from my line of sight as i walked around to the front , however that took no longer than a few seconds !! it seemingly reacted to my presence by changing its' station to that new north-west bearing !!\r\n\r\nnothing else was visible in this region as the slight cloud cover was still obscuring all else , ergo , it maintained this altitude and remained below the cloud cover !! \r\n\r\nhaving satisfied myself that it had returned , that it seemed larger than your typical jetliner , hovered silently , moved swifter than anything i have previously encountered in the way of aviation , was at the height of your typical jetliner , that it was not a jet , not a jetliner , had no wings and no tail assembly , was not a blimp , was not a balloon and was not a helicopter , i returned to my apartment as i was missing the gem shows on qvc , i am a gem collector and wanted to see what they were offering !!\r\n\r\nonce again , this seemed to be black in colour , flashed the same lights in the same repeat patterns , and was circular in shape with a slight doming to the bottom and top !! \r\n\r\naccording to our government , what i have now recently witnessed twice does not exist !!!!! \r\n\r\nmy reaction might best be described as picque with our government !! during the 90's these type of objects were visible over manchester , n.H. , the monadnock region and later , a few years ago , over the lakes region !!  \r\n\r\nover manchester, during that time frame i reported viewing the typical \"saucer\" shape hovering silently over the local federal bldg. to dan of sen. gregg's office !! on another night walking back from the east side vista grocery store  , during the fall , i saw 5 glowing orbs in a \"vee\" formation flying towards the north - north - east during a friday night highschool footbal game at gill stadium !! during that time of the year , birds and waterfowl should have been heading south !!\r\n\r\non a third occasion i saw the triangular shaped craft which bore no resemblence to the stealth bomber or the stealth fighter !! i reported these sightings to dan at sen. gregg's office and trusted them to follow up on them as i had no idea to whom such reports should or could be made !! trusting dan , i kept no records individually !! i now rather doubt if they even bothered to follow up on my reports !! as it has been quite some time since those sightings , i thought they were quite done with our part of the country !! \r\n\r\ni say \"they\" because quite obviously some intelligence is behind the design , manufacture , and purpose along with the navigation of these vehicles which bear not even the remotest resemblence to anything built by boeing and lockeed martin etc.!! not even dornier nor airbus can lay claim to credit for these crafts !!\r\n\r\ni have only just realised that this craft in relation to a star , as it was closer, was substanstually larger than a star would appear !! that has only now just occured to me !!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

night sky\r\n2. was a formation of 4-5 luminescent triangular objects traveling silently (no sound)and extremely rapidly northbound, one object was a bit \"wobbly\" - were not airplanes (we see commercial airtrafic at night on regular basis)\r\n3. at first we were not sure what we were seeing, honestly i wondered if it was a flock of bird being lit from underneath gliding over us  - but they moved too fast and were not \"flapping\" and were more triangular than a bird or airplane\r\n4. weird aerial events started at 11:50pm. it was a group of 4-5 objects triangular in shape all luminescent underneath (a hazy lit grey - solid - no blinking lites or anything in terms of coloration one sees on commercial air traffic). my wife and i had no idea what the objects were either but they were flying in formation - no doubt about that, one appeared to wobble badly then corrected itself in flight. both my wife and i agreed they were odd and \"ufo\" like.  we only caught site of them as they flew overhead rapidly heading from the south -northbound and we lost them in trees as they progressed. moments later as we moved to try to see into the distance we saw two more coming from the southeast heading northward. we continued to watch the skys and at 11:20pm i noticed a bright light (thought it was a star at first) rapidly move northbound (appeared to be much, much higher than the \"triangles\") it moved i called my wifes attention to it and we both saw it travel rapidly in a straight line from south to north disappearing from our view as it progressed across the sky. more strange aerial phenomenon continued - at aproximately 11:50am i noticed another star like light (again very high) this time travelling from the western part of the sky east, (much faster than the northbound one)again i called my wifes attention to it and it passed overhead and we lost it (our house obstucted us from viewing further as the object passed over it continuing eastward. the two \"travelling stars\" were traveling at a very high rate of speed - covering too much sky in too litle time to be an airplane (even one traveling near supersonic). from almost directly overhead until i lost it in the trees the northbound \"traveling star\" crossed sky until out of sight in about 20 - 30 seconds max, the other travelling eastbound was out of sight within 10 seconds easily. all objects were silent. the \"traveling stars\" were traveling in precise straight lines. finally at 12:05pm just before going into the house to say goodnight my wife and i both witnessed 2 more luminescent triangles flying in formation from the south east going northbound - this time they seemed to vanish just after we lost sight of them going past some treetops across the road. \r\n5. my wife is more of a skeptic than i am, she admits to seeing ufos but is not sure who/what those ufos were. i was excited and fascinated, she was more reserved and quite quiet about the whole thing.\r\n6. objects passed into the horizon overtop trees and buildings - we lost sight of them then.\r\n\r\nit was amazing to see some things frankly i never thought i would experience with my wife in my lifetime. but to see all the wierd aerial activity in one night was quite bizarre.\r\n\r\ni'm deathly curious what ground radar reported (if you can find out).","distance":"Over One
