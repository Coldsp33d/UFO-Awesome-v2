fast as a high-performance prop aircraft (400 knots plus).  i am reporting this because it seemed unusual to me.  it isn't every day you see a flickering light in the sky and then a craft which seems dark and with only a single light.  i am a little afraid of ufos so i didn't stick around to observe more.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

night sky\r\n2. was a formation of 4-5 luminescent triangular objects traveling silently (no sound)and extremely rapidly northbound, one object was a bit \"wobbly\" - were not airplanes (we see commercial airtrafic at night on regular basis)\r\n3. at first we were not sure what we were seeing, honestly i wondered if it was a flock of bird being lit from underneath gliding over us  - but they moved too fast and were not \"flapping\" and were more triangular than a bird or airplane\r\n4. weird aerial events started at 11:50pm. it was a group of 4-5 objects triangular in shape all luminescent underneath (a hazy lit grey - solid - no blinking lites or anything in terms of coloration one sees on commercial air traffic). my wife and i had no idea what the objects were either but they were flying in formation - no doubt about that, one appeared to wobble badly then corrected itself in flight. both my wife and i agreed they were odd and \"ufo\" like.  we only caught site of them as they flew overhead rapidly heading from the south -northbound and we lost them in trees as they progressed. moments later as we moved to try to see into the distance we saw two more coming from the southeast heading northward. we continued to watch the skys and at 11:20pm i noticed a bright light (thought it was a star at first) rapidly move northbound (appeared to be much, much higher than the \"triangles\") it moved i called my wifes attention to it and we both saw it travel rapidly in a straight line from south to north disappearing from our view as it progressed across the sky. more strange aerial phenomenon continued - at aproximately 11:50am i noticed another star like light (again very high) this time travelling from the western part of the sky east, (much faster than the northbound one)again i called my wifes attention to it and it passed overhead and we lost it (our house obstucted us from viewing further as the object passed over it continuing eastward. the two \"travelling stars\" were traveling at a very high rate of speed - covering too much sky in too litle time to be an airplane (even one traveling near supersonic). from almost directly overhead until i lost it in the trees the northbound \"traveling star\" crossed sky until out of sight in about 20 - 30 seconds max, the other travelling eastbound was out of sight within 10 seconds easily. all objects were silent. the \"traveling stars\" were traveling in precise straight lines. finally at 12:05pm just before going into the house to say goodnight my wife and i both witnessed 2 more luminescent triangles flying in formation from the south east going northbound - this time they seemed to vanish just after we lost sight of them going past some treetops across the road. \r\n5. my wife is more of a skeptic than i am, she admits to seeing ufos but is not sure who/what those ufos were. i was excited and fascinated, she was more reserved and quite quiet about the whole thing.\r\n6. objects passed into the horizon overtop trees and buildings - we lost sight of them then.\r\n\r\nit was amazing to see some things frankly i never thought i would experience with my wife in my lifetime. but to see all the wierd aerial activity in one night was quite bizarre.\r\n\r\ni'm deathly curious what ground radar reported (if you can find out).","distance":"Over One

2004 in cheshire  england near and around tattenhall village.What i describe happened this way and not appear to happen,being a skeptic all of my life has made it more essential for me to report this incident and also has dramatically changed my life for it was not a good sign i am sure.I have sent out over a hundred emails to various groups around the world  and have spoken to jenny randles and steven balon [top ufologists]hoping for some sort of answer but to no evail,ive been met sadly with skepticism but can only say this happened, it is true .We had just left friends and were travelling down the burwardsley road ,a rural part of cheshire when suddenly a cloud or  vapor appeared from the left of our car.It was short  in length but travelling very fast and seemed to wrap itself in front of our car , i naturally braced myself thinking we were hitting some kind of rare thick fog weather condition when suddenly a vortex was spinning ahead of it outside the car,at first i thought it was some kind of tornado but it didnt have a funnel and was close to the ground.I told my wife to slow the car fearing it would damage the car.We entered tattenhall village and it was gone i remember saying to my wife that we had avoided it,we turned right and left the village on to another country lane when suddenly it re-appeared next to the car,spinning in front then behind,and around the car,my wife kept driving trying to escape it but it kept up with our car,the next thing we know our car bonnet lit up white and then suddenly coloured cabbage shapes came on our windscreen[there were hundreds of what looked like to me tiny holes in them],there was no spinning movement at all,it suddenly vanished off our windscreen , the next thing a car overtook us doing about 50 miles per hour soon after the vortex re appeared again and was spinning around our car, but all we could see was colours spinning,[holographic like]it was also alot higher off the ground, soon after i opened my window and looked up to see it about 30 feet over our car moving to the left but could  see 2 vortexes one coloured energy like beads  spinning and inside a plasma or vapor gas in sections ,round at one end and thinner at the other ,spinning aggresively  inside of that in a perfect circle ,it went over to a field to our left and continued to follow the car.We done another right turn on to another country lane and the vortex followed to the ajacent field,just before we got to the motorway it started to slowly ascend right up into the clouds when it disappeared.Once again i can only say this happened the way ive told,although hard to believe ,and have no proof but it is true,it was with our car for about 12 minutes the weather conditions were low storm clouds,we had just had 2 weeks of constant electric storms[which is very unusual for this part of england],this behaved intelligently i am certain,it was moving forwards and backwards without turning,spinning like a catherine wheel and did not seem to be effected by solid objects,this was not anything manmade like lasers, or a rare weather condition,if you would like a more detailed account, email me and i will give you my phone

attached to the traffic\r\ndepartment. one night at approximetely 2 /2.30am, i was in company\r\nwith my sergeant and driving a patrol car along the a 108 tyne\r\ntunnel road, heading towards the a1. at a point just past seaton\r\nburn roundabout,i noted a glow coming from fields to my right - i\r\nwas unable to clarify the cause due to high enbankments either side\r\nof the road. local knowkedge told me this being very much of a rural\r\nlocation vehicular access was not an option. therefore, my intention\r\nwas to come off at the next slip road and double back towards the\r\nilluminted area.\r\nat this point an enormous ball of revolving flame rolled over the\r\ntop of the enbankment and came to rest on the opposite carriageway.\r\nthis  thing  for want of a better word, was revolving at high speed\r\nand the only way i could quantify its appearence was comparing it to\r\ntwo double deck buses tied together and alight.  the heat being\r\ngenerated was unbelievable. even as a police officer panic began to\r\nset in. nowhere in any training manual had i seen a procedure for\r\ndealing with this type of occurrence.\r\naccelerating away from the heat, my colleague attempeted to contact\r\nour control room for assistance - unfortunately the radio was\r\ninoperative due to heavy static.  as i pulled away, the object kept\r\npace with my vehicle, enough was enough, i was driving a\r\ndemonstration volvo 144s, fortunately fitted with air-conditioning,\r\na rarity in those days, and considered i could show a clean pair of\r\nheels to this ball of fire. touching 110mph, i, as aware are that\r\nwhat we were trying to escape had crossed the carriageway and was\r\npositioned directly above our car at a height of 5 /6 feet. even\r\nwith the air-conditioning going full blast, we were starting to fry\r\nand our persuer was edging closer to the roof of the patrol car.\r\nwithin sight of the seaton burn roundbout/flyover, the area becomes\r\nilluminated from the motorway lighting and traffic travelling along\r\nthe main highway which runs from edinburgh to london. we approached\r\nthe flyover at in excess of 80 mph before coming to a halt directly\r\nover the dual carriageway.\r\ngetting out of the vehicle we noted the smell of burnt rubber coming\r\nfrom the window and door seals which had suffered in the exptreme\r\nheat. but what of the thing that had chased us? it was hovering\r\nabove a small copse of trees some 300yards distance, as if unsure\r\nwhether or not to continue. taking advantage of this situation, we\r\nconacted our control room and reported the facts of the previous few\r\nminutes. needless to say the response was one which generated every\r\njoke about little green men and space ships. all very amusing until\r\nthe duty officer took over and told us, in no uncertain terms, that\r\nwe were to remain where we were and not drive the patrol car. his\r\ntone of voice said it all - they thought we had been drinking!\r\njust then, we heard a roar and on turning round say the blazing\r\nobject heading directly for us - we instinctively ducked and it\r\npassed over our heads with inches to spare. it stopped, turned\r\ntowards the north and accelerated at an unbelievable speed,\r\ndisappearing in seconds. dazed and somewhat confused, we became\r\naware of the car radio churning out numerous reports by colleagues\r\nof the object as it travelled across the northern part of the\r\ncounty.\r\nbefore long, the duty officer, rather sheepishly, advised us to\r\nreturn to our base in wallsend and await instructions. this we\r\ngladly did and were eventually told to take the rest of the shift\r\noff.\r\nthe weather conditions were: fine and dry. there was a moon and\r\nvisability good\r\n\r\nearly next morning we and a number of fellow officers were required\r\nto attend police headquarters where a number of senior officers were\r\nalso present. the purpose being for us to be interviewed by two very\r\nhigh ranking air force officers. all very straightforward and\r\ncongenial. \"thank you chaps for the information, very concise and\r\ninformative. might be better not to make too much of or say anything\r\nabout this incident, i sure you understand\"!!!!\r\nthat was the end of things until a few months later when i had a\r\noccasion to talk with one of my officers who had been present on the\r\nevening in question. when asked what had been the outcome of the\r\ninvestigation we understood to have been conducted, his response was\r\nstraightforward - the matter had been recorded as an official ufo\r\nsighting.\r\n\r\ni have two other sighting experiences, one as a police officer,\r\nagain in the northumberland area and the second, as a civillian, in\r\nthe suffolk area.\r\n\r\ni hope this is of use to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3481,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.3831135,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-77.4953963,"occurred":1117917710000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1117917710000,"summary":"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Chesterfield,

line underside. i will submit\r\nan image that i have created as it is difficult to describe.\r\nsecond sighting september 2000\r\nthis was a close encounter the craft passed across a valley and\r\ndirectly over our heads. this craft was illuminated on all edges and\r\nvery large at around eight o clock in the evening with clear skys\r\nand little wind. this craft was cubic and l-shaped as large as a\r\njumbo jet. it had a slight protrusion at the rear with three\r\nbalconies above. within the protrusion at the rear were mesh dishes\r\nwhich were emitting a blue/purple light - this seemed to be\r\npropelling the craft at around 40miles an hour (estimated).\r\nunderside the craft had three large white lights two at its tall end\r\nand one at the other. these were joined by huge pipes. the craft was\r\nso close we could see the bolts on the pipework. the craft emitted\r\nan electrical humming noise which was not loud although it sounded\r\nvery powerfull. it is now five years on and i find myself asking are\r\nthey somewhere on dartmoor? are they still here? were they landing\r\nor leaving? there are plenty of places on dartmoor to hide a craft\r\nthat size. my pictures are made with my computer so do not do\r\njustice to the ufo s we have seen with our own eyes. i beleive we\r\nhave seen the future - imagine a world without the

the object did not move.   from the distance\r\ni was at i would imagine something like an orange would cover up the\r\nobject from view at arms length.\r\n\r\ni was trying to determine whether it was

that.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i thought of was possibly one of those balls you see\r\non telephone lines. i could not see any telephone lines to support\r\nthis theory. at this point i drove around

and iraq in 1991,i was on a roving\r\nguard duty alone within a perimeter.Towards the end of my one hour\r\nshift,i went and sat down.To my left and south i\r\nsaw an irridescent light that appeared to change colors as\r\nrapidly as you can imagine,until it was a blur of colors.\r\nas it approached,and began to pass behind me,i struck my\r\ncigarrette lighter on high and held it up in the

no\r\nrotor wash,which a helicopter would give off.It was archaic\r\nlooking,discoidal in shape,had a cupola on top,a beacon on\r\nthe bottom,which it had instantaneosly turned off when i had\r\nlit my lighter.The sky was completely clear.All aircraft\r\nflying towards iraq were above twenty thousand feet and were\r\nobserving light discipline.The discoidal craft had leading\r\nedges that were flattened out and scored.The craft gave off\r\na field of palpable energy.I had with me a loaded m-16,a\r\nset of night-vision goggles,a pr-77 radio telephone to\r\ncommunicate with the command post,and an unloaded m-60\r\nstrapped to my back.I felt no fear,indeed the opposite was\r\ntrue.All i could do was outstretch my arm strenously.I felt\r\nas if i were hypnotized.The craft began to oscillate faster\r\nand faster like a gyroscope until it came to rest, showing\r\nit s underside.A pattern of lights emerged.First was three\r\npinpoints in the shape of a triangle.Then four pinpoints in\r\nthe shape of a rectangle.Then one point of light that out-\r\nstretched itself into a long line of light.All i can remember next\r\nis the craft moving north and finding myself\r\nwalking towards our gp large(tent).My guard duty was supposed to\r\nhave ended at 12 midnight,but my watch showed it\r\nto be 1:30.I had lost time.I entered the tent and woke up\r\nthe next guard who was

one minute later the entire\r\ntent erupted into chaos.Private first class **** *********\r\nwas being choked in his sleep by specialist ***** ******.The\r\nrest of the personnel were waving m-16 s around and flashlights\r\nwere playing on the walls of the tent.Personnel\r\nwere screaming.It was as if everyone had been suddenly\r\nreleased from suspended hypnotism or something.Weird.I don

but later on in the night after the party\r\nwas over, most of them were to drunk to drive home so they spent the\r\nnight over. at about 4:30-5:00 in the morning, one of his friends\r\ngot thirsty and went to the kitchen to get something to drink. my\r\nbrother had a house that had a big field and a high school football\r\nstadium in his backyard and you could see all this through his\r\nkitchen. and when he turned around he saw something that he knew was\r\nnot a plane. so he woke everyone up and they all ran to the\r\nbackyard. what they saw was a strange egg shaped object that looked\r\nlike it was floating on water. it had windows and bars that ran\r\nacross it like an \"x\". every now and then then object would spin and\r\nwhen it did, it would shine of a light but the light would only go\r\nso far so it looked more like a forcefield. they all watched in\r\namazement as this object hovered and they were all hypnotized by it\r\nand all though there were plenty of cameras in the house, no one\r\nwanted to go inside because they wanted to see what it would do\r\nnext. then out of the right side, they saw what they thought was a\r\nplane but the light dimmed out when it got close to the u.F.O and\r\nreappeared, but when it reappeared it turned from one big light to\r\nalot of little \"globes\" with what looked like mist around it. then\r\nthey saw they \"globes\" go inside the u.F.O and the u.F.O stayed\r\naround for an extra 5 minutes before leaving. the next day when my\r\nbrother told me about it i didn t believe him because i was always\r\nthe one who believed in u.F.O s and he didn t so i figured that he\r\nwas joking me but everyone told me the same story and even the dogs\r\nwere acting \"different\". later that night he threw a cookout and\r\nthis time i got to go and i had a feeling that we were being\r\n\"watched\" and i was \"drawn\" to this one \"star\". i told my brother i\r\nthought it was a u.F.O but since his eyes are not good as mine, he\r\ncouldn t tell. then all of a sudden all saw the \"star\" move slowly\r\nfrom one location to the other them stop. i knew it had to be a\r\nu.F.O. but my brother didn t believe
