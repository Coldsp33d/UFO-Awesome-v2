the process of moving to a\r\n small town 60 miles north, nahunta georgia, to get out of the\r\n big city. i still had 3 months to work and had to drive to\r\n jacksonville fl. every third day to work.The first leg of the\r\n trip was from nahunta to folkston ga. a 30 mile strip of nothing\r\n but pine trees, bur half way was a small crossroad and 6 or 7\r\n houses in a small town called winokour. on the morming of june\r\n 4th or 5 or 6th 1995 5:30 am  ( i am not shur of the date ,but\r\n it was the day that a hurricane was coming ashore at cedar key\r\n fl. ).\r\n but being a firefighter i had to go to work regardless. just as\r\n i passed winokour (a few thousand feet) i saw a row of lights at\r\n the top of the trees on the right. at first i thought, they bult\r\n a factory here,and then then i thought it couln t be, i was here\r\n yeasterday and there was nothing there. then i thought ,i m on\r\n the wrong road,then i thought ,i cant bei just passed the small\r\n town of winokour. then realiazing this was somthing else i\r\n slowed down to a stop.I couln t see it through the right window\r\n and had to lean forward to look up and to the right at the top\r\n of the trees and sitting there at tree top height was this\r\n gigantic thing, sitting there motionless and silent, with all\r\n the lights on. i oped my door to my truck and stepped out with\r\n my left foot and stood up and looked over the top of my truck at\r\n this craft. at this point i was only 60 feet away from it. it\r\n spanned the distance of 3 telephone  polls. the night was pure\r\n black and no moon . i could hardly see the shap of it because it\r\n was so big.And i was almost directly under it.  but there was\r\n what seemed to be a row of lights . from the ground they seemed\r\n to be about 3ft wide and 4 ft high. and about  8 ft. between\r\n them.And maybee 40 of them.They glowed pale orange and i could\r\n not see through them. the skin of the craft  was as black as the\r\n night. this was no blip of light in the night and no metalic\r\n object at 5000 feet it was right there in front of me and it\r\n scared the daylights out of me. i did get a thing that kept\r\n going over and over in my head ( get out of the area) so i did\r\n and went to work.\r\n when i got there and being there was a hurricane coming in and i\r\n was driving fron so far away they said they didn t expect my to\r\n come in today and was making arrangements to call someone in to\r\n work for my ,so i said thats fine with me. knock me off sick and\r\n i ll go home.Being i had a lot of sick days saved.I returned by\r\n 8:00 am and ther was nothing there, it was daylight and they had\r\n left. \r\ndo i consider this to be a ufo ,not really, i consider it to be a\r\n ifo (indentified flying object) and not one of ours. this was\r\n certanly a real craft. it would be hard for someone to stand\r\n beside this ,and look at somthing as large as a battleship and\r\n say ,

1:30-1:45pm and it was a beautiful mostly clear day with some\r\n    very high lines of white clouds on a mostly blue sky. there was some\r\n    breeze, but i don t recall there being much.\r\n    \r\n    i was facing an unobstructed view of the north easterly sky over the\r\n    top of the schering facility and looking at nothing in particular as\r\n    i listened to the radio, when i noticed a dark \"dot\" moving/flying\r\n    in a slightly undulating manner in a very open section of the sky.\r\n    it was moving from almost straight ahead of me towards my left.\r\n    because it wasn t flying in a straight line with a purpose as a\r\n    plane or jet would, i thought at first it was a bird flying up\r\n    pretty high. i kept thinking that at any second i would see wings or\r\n    see it do something bird-like. i could not estimate how high it was\r\n    since i had no real point of reference. although there were plenty\r\n    of planes and jets going by at various altitudes, i can only say\r\n    that this was a dark dot by comparison; it appeared to be round and\r\n    about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\r\n    \r\n    anyway, after observing its gently arcing flight, i noted that it\r\n    suddenly stopped and was standing perfectly still in the sky. i\r\n    think this was due north. i kept watching it, now thinking that\r\n    since i can t see wings and a bird wouldn t hover so long that maybe\r\n    it might be a helicopter. it must have remained perfectly stationary\r\n    for at least 45 seconds to a minute. i kept looking and looking at\r\n    it; i took off my sunglasses, put them back on, looked through my\r\n    open side window, through the windshield and then back through the\r\nopen window again, but couldn t see anything else except an unmoving\r\ndark dot. meanwhile, planes and jets continued to move about in the\r\nsky although none appeared to pass close by the dot. at no time did\r\ni ever see any shine or glint of sunlight reflecting back from this\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nanyway, it finally started to move again and now it is moving back\r\nmore or less in the direction it came from, from my left to the\r\nright but it appears to be rising up \"higher\" before it again stops.\r\ni continue to stare at it, and now it appears that small \"pieces\"\r\nare \"shooting\" from the top of the dot (the dot now appears very\r\nslightly elongated but not much larger). when the \"pieces\" come\r\n\"arcing\" out of it i can t see them anymore, they disappear and the\r\nsky looks a bit fuzzy around the dot. at the time i am thinking to\r\nmyself that maybe it looks fuzzy just because i am staring at it so\r\nintently.\r\n\r\nafter sitting stationary for what i am estimating to be about 10 to\r\n15 seconds the dot moves in yet another direction (more to the\r\nright, but \"down\" and more level now) and i am thinking it is also\r\ngoing \"away\" from me because it appears even smaller. again, it s\r\nflight is not a straight line like a plane or jet, it is more a\r\ngentle arcing motion. it moves quite a distance across the sky (from\r\nleft to right but it s in front of me now rather than to my side)\r\nbefore i see it start to move \"up\" and very suddenly it is gone\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\ni keep looking and looking in the same area thinking that the dot\r\nwill reappear and i will see that it is a shiny plane, a helicopter\r\nor even a bird, dragonfly or bumblebee, but i do not see it again.\r\nthe entire episode lasted for perhaps 5 minutes and i am still\r\nthinking there is a

before we had to drive\r\n away.  my sister wasn t able to get the camera out of the glove\r\n compartment, despite my frantic waving and shouting.  part of\r\n the reason was that she didn t seem able to see it, although she\r\n was looking right at the thing. \r\n

aircraft chasing or following an\r\norange glowing light. it looked like a fireball, and made no\r\ndiscerneable sound. the orange light was not like any aircraft light\r\ni have ever seen in 43 years of living. i was a paratrooper in the\r\narmy, and i was a civil service employee at a military base right\r\nacross the street from the military airport. iv e either flown in,\r\nand or jumped out of every kind of aircraft you can think of. what i\r\nsaw last night, does not fit the description of anything iv e ever\r\nseen before. and like i said, at least five fighter jets were\r\nchasing or folowing this thing. i was home alone last night, so my\r\nwife didn t see it. but two weeks ago, on our way home from playing\r\nbingo, we both saw the same strange light, minus the fighter jets.\r\nnow is there any government agency who could or would tell me what i\r\nsaw? i know they know because they were chasing it! should i report\r\nthis to the fbi? i do not wish for this report to remain\r\nconfidential. i do want it to be known to everyone! i want to know\r\nwhat the hell i saw!!! if they were escorting some new classified\r\nsecret aircraft,...Fine. if they will just tell me that, then i\r\nwon t ask any more questions. if not,... i want the world to wake\r\nup, and pay attention! someone please contact me asap!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3433,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.4994884,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-91.8570984,"occurred":1116606000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1116606000000,"summary":"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Licking,
