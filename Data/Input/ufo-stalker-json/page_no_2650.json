were blinking if i remember\r\n correctly. it was big from what i saw, about the size of a\r\n commercial airliner. it was pretty low down, and as i said\r\n before it was there for only a second. it caught my eyes and i\r\n thought it was a plane or what not, but that thing was not\r\n human. i always laughed at those cooks on tv who reported ufo\r\n sightings, but i saw this with my own eyes. it

calling\r\n the local news but they pretty much called me a qwack and hung\r\n up on me. i know you are a respectable news agency and that\r\n hopefully you will believe my story. this whole fiasco happened\r\n about half an hour ago. hopefully you get other reports or can\r\n confirm that it s just some sort of new air craft, but i am sure\r\n that what i saw was not human. it is cloudless

on westheimer. i was\r\n @1/4 mile from the intersection of highway 6. at this\r\n intersetion is a mall called west oaks mall. looking above and\r\n beyond the mall i saw some lights. one in particular was bright\r\n and and also had a blinking light. it seemed to stay in one spot\r\n and then it moved a little. this is what initially caught my\r\n attention. then, all of a sudden, i saw a black triangular\r\n object which was in the same vicinity but on the side of the\r\n blinking craft that i was on. this black triangular craft or ufo\r\n was many, many times bigger than this other blinking craft.\r\n also, i began to notice a lot of other brightly lit craft with\r\n blinking lights. i believe that these were either planes and or\r\n helicopters. it occurred to me that these lit up and blinking\r\n craft (probably planes and or helicopters were possibly trying\r\n to observe this black triangular craft). the black triangular\r\n craft was moving towards the direction of traffic that i was\r\n caught up in trying to get home. it was moving slowly but\r\n steadily towards my direction. i kept thinking i must be seeing\r\n things and continually tried to open my eyes larger to make sure\r\n i was seeing clearly. this triangular object seemed to\r\n intentionally move right above the low lying clouds. the clouds\r\n were thin enough to be able to clearly see the dark triangle\r\n shape of the object. the rest of the sky was clear. it was in a\r\n perfect form of a triangle and all sides were equal in size.\r\n there were no lights and i heard no noise. the craft eventually\r\n went past my car. this, i believe, was about 3-5 minutes in\r\n total. i was on my cell phone talking to a close friend during\r\n this entire event. i told her that i had to turn my car back in\r\n the other direction so that i could find a parking lot to park\r\n my car and get out and continue to observe this object. she\r\n decided to get off the phone with me. i turned my car around and\r\n found a parking lot. by the time i got out, it had become darker\r\n and i was no longer able to see the object. i was amazed and\r\n frustrated at how quickly it got darker. i reported this to the\r\n harris county sheriff s department and asked them who i could\r\n call to report this other than them. they told me that there\r\n were some life flight helicopters doing practice landings in\r\n that area. i assured them that this was in no way a helicopter\r\n that i was calling them to report. due to the response that they\r\n gave me, i have to wonder if they had already gotten reports\r\n similar to mine. i also wonder if in fact the helicopters that i\r\n was seeing were really practicing life flight landings or if\r\n this was simply what they were telling people. it may be that\r\n they really were practicing and the triangular object was a\r\n separate event. maybe the triangular object was observing the\r\n helicopters practicing life flight landings or maybe not. we\r\n will probably never know. i did notice that after the triangular\r\n object was out of my sight, there were many other crafts within\r\n a 5 mile radius (as i traveled home) flying around the area. one\r\n in particular seemed to be circling close to the path of the\r\n triangular object. my goal was to find out if anyone else saw\r\n this same triangular object in this area and around the same\r\n time. i was given the number of nasa but decided that i didn t\r\n trust contacting the government. i just learned about your site\r\n and hope that someone will contact me to investigate this\r\n further and will also let me know if there have been any other\r\n reports on this.  \r\n

6th floor apartment, it was\r\n very clear, quiet & no wind. something caught my eye at about\r\n a\"10 o clock\" angle, it was a perfect rectangle shape, but\r\n nothing else was visible. at first i thought it was one of those\r\n white styrofoam planes but just a wing, except it wasn t windy.\r\n then i realized it was all white light, moving much faster than\r\n a plane, making no sound. it stayed on a straight course, but\r\n the scariest part was the way it changed angles. staying on a\r\n straight course this rectangle would randomly (and very quickly)\r\n change angles. first left then right, then right again so it was\r\n going backwards!  very deliberate and quick movements, stopping\r\n at a different angle each time, this still disturbs me because i\r\n know a plane cannot make these quick moves, let alone fly\r\n sideways or backwards. in a matter of  about 10 seconds it was\r\n moving so fast that it disappeared into cloudless night sky. but\r\n not towards the

high it must be the length of a football\r\n field. i would love to know if anyone else saw this. please let\r\n me know, thank you.\r\n-kier \r\n

6-8 weeks and as of this date\r\n4/13/05 what appears to be a star. significantly brighter than the\r\nother stars around it. this \"star\" moves and changes colors with a\r\nparticular pattern of movement.  it will hover for a few minutes\r\nthen it will travel straight up and then move to the right and\r\nback to the left in a triangular pattern.  at the same time\r\npatterns of light are changing from red to green appearing amber\r\nmost of the time. when it changes direction and moves it turns\r\nbright green and then when it stops it dims and then becomes\r\nluminous back to amber and then green.  on occasion there have\r\nbeen more than one.  to see them in the sky and to measure is so\r\ndifficult.  the brightest one has been seen \"flashing\" and another\r\n\"star\" will be approximately \"3 feet\" to the right\" when the\r\nbrightest star flashes the other will be luminous in green and red\r\nand on occasion blue. it s as though they are communicating to\r\neach other in some way.  the dimmer one will hover and then move\r\nthe left and then to the right and go back to the top in it s own\r\ntriangular pattern. the brightest one will \"brighten up\" and\r\ntravel to the right and then left and back to the top. i d guess\r\nthat over the last 14 days there has only been one night when it\r\nwasn t visible to us.  i have wondered about national

11pm as i drove south on hwy.\r\n 301 from jacksonville, fl.  as i drove s on 301 i eventually\r\n noticed an object in the sky sw of me far away and hovering. \r\n one small red light on each side - distance was impossible to\r\n guess due to darkness and the small size of the lights, but they\r\n were maybe 2 finger-widths apart from each other at that time. \r\n in the direct center of them at about 1 second intervals a white\r\n light blinked.  alternately, above each red light (solidly lit\r\n at all times) a very small and fast white light would flash\r\n after the center white light would flash.  as i drove towards\r\n ocala, fl on 301 this \"hovering\" object neither deviated in\r\n altitude nor moved from side to side...Also, it never became\r\n smaller or dimmer indicating that it was moving farther from me\r\n as i drove and i was unable to catch up to it...Basically, it\r\n became very conspicuous to me due to this because that meant to\r\n me that it was going the same speed as me and never varied. \r\n twice i stopped at gas stations on 301 to get a drink or hit the\r\n bathroom.  each time i basically forgot about the object until i\r\n got back into my truck and back onto the highway.  both times\r\n this object was still in the exact location of the sky and\r\n neither looking closer or further away from me, yet as i again\r\n would drive towards it at 70mph it still seemed to stay exactly\r\n the same distance from me no matter what.\r\nby now i m very much unsure that this could be a plane,\r\n helicopter or blimp...The lights just weren t right, plus it s\r\n odd way of staying in the same place all that time whether i was\r\n moving or not just seemed impossible and very improbable for a\r\n typical aircraft.  then a second one appeared in the sky just\r\n down and to the w of the first one...Hovering in the same way. \r\n i say appeared because it didn t fly to that position but just\r\n appeared or turned it s lights on...Same configuration of two\r\n solid reds, center white blinker and two blinking whites above\r\n the reds. \r\nthese two objects stayed this way until i turned w on i think hwy\r\n 40 north of ocala to head to i-75.  then instead of viewing them\r\n high up out of my windshield i had to look out my side window\r\n and up.  not long after turning w the object that had appeared\r\n second very noticeably began to move w away from the first\r\n object, still hovering.  it seemed to be heading sw as it was\r\n definitely get smaller in size and much dimmer after a while,\r\n but the rate of it s movement was very slow and deliberate in a\r\n straight direction and i was able to view it for a very long\r\n time even when it was apparent that it was many many miles s of\r\n me.\r\nat the i-75 intersection i again stopped at a gas station.  when\r\n i came back out 5 minutes later the first object was still\r\n hovering and the second though still visible was definitely much\r\n farther to the sw but i could still see it s red lights and\r\n blinking whites.\r\nas i turned s on i-75 still watching these two objects i finally\r\n decided that i needed to tell someone about this because i just\r\n didn t believe now that these were typical aircraft.  so i\r\n called my girlfriend and described to her everything i d seen\r\n and thought up to that point asking her not to think i was\r\n crazy.\r\ni could still easily see the stationary object blinking away, and\r\n i could still see the one that had flown sw away from me.  at\r\n this point things went absolutely crazy and unbelievable and i\r\n kept my girlfriend on the phone as i described every event to\r\n her and i was completely shocked to be seeing what i was\r\n seeing...The next events happened almost directly over i-75 and\r\n also over the fields to either side e and w and all over the sky\r\n s of me as i drove s on i-75...And they happened for over an\r\n hour straight:\r\na very large, bright white object appeared in the sky to the se\r\n of me on the e side of i-75...Kind of far from the original\r\n object...However that object now began to move w and fly\r\n directly over i-75 out over the fields...Still in some way\r\n looking the same size and brightness even though i was traveling\r\n at 65 mph towards it the whole time...Very wierd.  at first i\r\n was thinking the new object was a planet or star...Very large\r\n and bright white and not moving at all even though i was heading\r\n for it, which is was what made it seem like a star.  as i\r\n described to my girlfriend the red lighted object flying left to\r\n right in front of me, directly over the highway in the darkness\r\n straight to my s a very small white object blinked...Then\r\n blinked again but easily 2 hand widths to the right...Not being\r\n sure if it was the same object or a second blinking object at\r\n that time all of a sudden multiple white blinking objects  (i\r\n think maybe from 3 to 6 or so) began blinking all over in a\r\n group form right over i-75.  they weren t bright...Small star\r\n type brightness and flashing very fast then maybe off for a\r\n second or so...But there were definitely more than 2 since i\r\n could see a group of them moving around flashing and then i\r\n guess appearing in other locations in the general area of the\r\n sky, so either very fast moving and in quick turns of direction\r\n or several of them...It was just hard to tell also due to\r\n oncoming headlights and also the intervals of very tall street\r\n lights messing w/ my eyes...Plus it wasn t easy keeping my eyes\r\n on all this as well as the large semi-trucks and other vehicles\r\n that i was trying not to swerve into...I was pretty excited at\r\n this point and describing it all to my g/f at the same time.\r\nit appeared after a couple minutes that i did travel underneath\r\n the location of the fast blinkers and i couldn t see them\r\n anymore...During all of this i could now still see the constant\r\n hovering large white light plus now three of the red lighted\r\n objects moving back and forth to the s and se and sw of\r\n me...Moving in different directions very slowly and deliberately\r\n and not making any turns.\r\none of these flew towards the large white light, and around this\r\n point my g/f said that i should just pull over but i didn t want\r\n to...About 1 minute later i passed a pick up on the shoulder of\r\n the hwy. and the driver was standing next to his truck staring\r\n up at the sky...It definitely looked like he was witnessing what\r\n i was...I just don t see how anyone could have missed the red\r\n objects, but the fast blinkers were very elusive unless you were\r\n paying attention as i had been.\r\nat this time the large white object began to move from e to w\r\n over i-75 (this was after the one red lighted object flew over\r\n near it s vicinity).  this really got me excited because now i\r\n knew it wasn t a star...It moved slowly and deliberately from\r\n left to right over the hwy to over the farm field area that\r\n borders the hwy.  at this point that white object most obviously\r\n turned due n to parallel the hwy. though off to my w. it then\r\n also decreased altitude so rapidly and sped so quickly towards\r\n me that the diameter of the light easily doubled in size and\r\n intesity...It actually shocked the shit out of me and i started\r\n yelling into the phone, i mean it almost looked like it rocketed\r\n down and towards me...It was amazing.  at that point i said\r\n screw it and hit the shoulder of the hwy and slammed on the\r\n breaks.  unfortunately i stopped next to a small grove of pine\r\n trees blocking the view....But...And this is where i began to\r\n believe i wasn t seeing normal aircraft...This bright object had\r\n slowed down very slowly again...The very bright half moon that\r\n was out last night was above the object...The bright white light\r\n then dimmed almost off and at that time i could then see three\r\n tiny green lights in a slim triangular shape as if i was seeing\r\n the bottom of the craft at just a slight angle as if it wasn t\r\n quite perfectly horizontal and maybe angeling away from my point\r\n of view just enough to see underneath it.  even better...Due to\r\n the large bright white light going so dim and the slight\r\n illumination of the three green lights at the points of the\r\n triangle, i could easily make out the edges of the object\r\n connecting the green lights as a triangle...I saw this shape for\r\n about 1 second before the white light in the center turned on\r\n super bright like a beaming spot light towards me so that all i\r\n could see was a large white ball again and it was descending to\r\n the ground going behind the tree line i was parked at.  or else\r\n it turned more w away from me making it look as if descending,\r\n but it was going lower in the sky either way and through the\r\n trees i could see it s bright light very easily.  i m conviced\r\n this was a triangular shaped object just as i ve always heard\r\n described on tv...I couldn t believe my eyes and was still\r\n describing this to my disbelief over the phone.\r\nthe wind was hard that night and temps were probably 40 or less,\r\n so after this 5 or so minutes of exposure i had to jump back in\r\n my truck.  all this time there were still 2 or three red lighted\r\n objects either hovering or flying randomly in the sky to the s\r\n still.  i saw one tilt itself to a 45 degree angle as it hovered\r\n also and then go back horizontally.\r\ni finally got back on the hwy still watching the red objects and\r\n about 200 yards down the road the trees ended and everything\r\n openned up to a vast farm field...I could still see many objects\r\n out there so i pulled over again.  and again the sky went nuts\r\n with activity.  at one point i could easily count up to 6 red\r\n light objects flying in different directions from n to s and e\r\n to w and back again as i looked to the w towards the field. \r\n some flew at angles directly over me but it was impossible to\r\n tell their altitude or size...My hunch though was that they\r\n didn t seem much larger than a commuter plane...Cesna sized or\r\n something.  the triangle object was somewhat easier to tell it s\r\n distance from me at that point when the bright light dimmed\r\n allowing me to make out it s edges, and i bet it was not much\r\n farther than 1 or 1.5 miles...And since the lights seemed fairly\r\n close together i d guess each side was maybe 40/50 feet or so???\r\n  maybe something like that.  anyway, back to the field\r\n action...\r\nalong w/ all the red light objects directly to the w of me i saw\r\n so many fast blinking white lights zooming all over the place in\r\n a group...Again it was just a crazy show.  they reminded me of\r\n when you can see a satellite fly over...That general size of\r\n light, like small star sized and the same whitish-blue color. \r\n only they flashed very quickly and then seemed to re-appear very\r\n quickly in another location...Hard to guess how many due to\r\n their speed and randomness, but they were definitely out there\r\n blinking all over.  while all that was going on almost directly\r\n above me a red-lighted object appeared right up above me...Very\r\n bright in color, so it seemed kinda low and larger since the red\r\n lights were definitely farther apart on this object...Maybe not\r\n even a mile up, but i couldn t tell of it s shape like i could\r\n the triangle.  i don t know if it just materialized in that\r\n location or if it s lights were out and then just turned on, but\r\n it just appeared and then started to fly in a straight line to\r\n the se of me...These things were everywhere and some would fly\r\n away to the s but then some would fly in from the n and they\r\n would criss-cross the hwy.  i can t believe people weren t\r\n seeing this, but i just don t know if they would notice it as\r\n odd like i did since i d been watching them for so long by this\r\n point.  i think this second stop on the hwy lasted about 20\r\n minutes watching all kinds of activity...I was freezing and\r\n shivering almost uncontrolably by then, but refused to get back\r\n in my truck for risk of missing even more activity or something\r\n more spectacular.  but the fast blinkers seemd to disappear\r\n eventually, and the red-light objects decreased down to like 2\r\n and were again hovering to the s of me.  so i got back in my\r\n truck and started s again.\r\ni ll tell you that by this point as exciting as it had been it\r\n started to get a little boring and even my g/f was ready to get\r\n off the phone with me and my descriptions...She just didn t want\r\n me to wreck my truck (i almost did several times though).  so i\r\n hung up with her.  i eventually didn t see anymore objects in\r\n the sky and was getting to around 40 miles or so from tampa on\r\n i-75.  i was still in somewhat of shock or disbelief over all of\r\n this and decided to call one of my best friends to tell him all\r\n about it...I knew he wouldn t think i was lying or crazy.\r\nas i neared finishing my story of everything that happened one of\r\n the red-light objects appeared again very low and just to the sw\r\n of me on the freeway...Just out of no where and bam there it\r\n was, and this was while my friend was still on the phone.  you\r\n could tell it was moving slightly to the w and then it began to\r\n roll into a 45 degree angle to the right and then it rolled back\r\n to horizontal and then to about 45 degrees angle to the left as\r\n it slowly flew w away from me.  i was able to watch it fly very\r\n low to the w until it disappeared from view.\r\nthese things just weren t planes or helicopters...I was able to\r\n view them for such a long time that i m convinced they weren t\r\n airplanes, blimps or helicopters.  my main confusion is just\r\n that if these were secret government craft then why the hell fly\r\n them over a freeway with lights flashing and not in the desert\r\n of nevada.  and if these were alien craft why the hell have all\r\n those lights on and be seen???  and also is there anyway to find\r\n out if they showed up on radar???  i didn t see any news of this\r\n today on the net or tv or radio, so i don t know what to think.\r\ni was even kinda ready to not think they were ufo s up until that\r\n freakin  white ball zoomed like it did and then showed itself as\r\n a triangle for that second or so...That blew my mind to see a\r\n triangle after hearing about them on tv all these years...This\r\n was the most bizarre thing i ve ever witnessed, and as i\r\n searched tonight i found this link and decided to try and write\r\n it all down to you.  that s the whole story though...Even though\r\n so much of it is like burned into my mind and i can still\r\n visualize what i saw and the sequence of events i still think i\r\n left some out because there was just so much activity going on\r\n at once for such a long time.  sure wish i d had a video or\r\n something.\r\nthat s it though.  i m going to copy what i ve written to you and\r\n post it on other sites if i find any worthy ones.  maybe someone\r\n else who saw those things last night will stumble across my\r\n story and corroborate it.  let me know if you have any\r\n questions.  thank you.  ian curran, 33, tampa, fl\r\n \r\n
