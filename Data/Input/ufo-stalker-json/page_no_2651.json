multiple ufo sighting witnessed by myself,\r\n my girlfriend and a friend of ours mid-afternoon saturday 26th\r\n aug 2002. conditions were very bright and clear.\r\n\r\nwe were all out on our roof garden enjoying the great weather and\r\n my girlfriend, who was lying on her back sunbathing, suddenly\r\n pointed straight up and said \"whats that up there?\" \r\n\r\nat first my friend and i couldnt really see anything obvious and\r\n this wasnt helped by the brightness of the sky or the fact that\r\n we didnt know what we were looking for. \r\nhowever within a few seconds of scanning the area my partner was\r\n indicating, we managed to spot what had captured her attention.\r\n\r\nit appeared to be a small shiny silvery-white sphere, just\r\n hanging there above us - it was impossible really to say if they\r\n were very small or very high, but they were probably at least a\r\n few thousand feet high.\r\n\r\nwithin a few seconds of spotting this sphere i noticed another\r\n one, and then another and then more. they were all in the same\r\n area of the sky and i think there were between 7-9 altogether,\r\n either just hanging there or moving very slowly.\r\n\r\nat first we thought they might be birds but their movement was\r\n not consistent with this idea, no circling or anything - just\r\n stationary or drifting very slowly.\r\n\r\nas we stood watching them, over a period of 4-5 mins they\r\n gradually moved into a  v  formation directly above us and\r\n stayed stationary in this position for several minutes - we\r\n realised then for sure that they couldnt have been balloons\r\n either and this was something out of the ordinary. we became\r\n quite excited at this point and i ran indoors to get my camera\r\n and our friend dashed of to his car to get his binoculars.\r\n\r\nhowever, by the time we got back the spheres had begun to break\r\n formation and drift apart. looking through the binoculars didnt\r\n show any further detail,  but we could definitely see that they\r\n were solid objects.\r\n\r\ni put my 70-210mm telephoto lens on my slr and snapped off a few\r\n pictures, one at around 70mm showing 3 of the spheres in the\r\n frame and another at 210mm showing just one. i have enclosed\r\n scans of the prints. \r\n\r\nupon enlarging the scan of the 210mm zoomed picture a little more\r\n detail became evident, showing in fact the object is not a\r\n sphere but more teardrop or shell shaped. it also seems to show\r\n a small trail or maybe a puff of gas venting  ? \r\n\r\nanyway, as we continued watching they all just moved off very\r\n slowly in different directions until they were out of sight. i d\r\n say the total duration of the sighting was approx 10-15 mins.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately after later finishing off the roll of film i\r\n mislaid it and it didnt turn up again until a few weeks ago,\r\n which is why this report is so overdue.\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n\r\n- eric\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n

both baffled.  i don t believe in ufos, but this was\r\n just plain wierd. \r\n

with a street light. after watching this\r\nstrange light for about a minute i noticed 2 more orbs, one on\r\neither side of it. they were in a row, equally spaced but on a\r\nslant. like this:\r\n                                            <\r\n                        <\r\n    <\r\n\r\nthey all three hovered there for about another minute, then the orb\r\nfarthest to the right started slowling moving off in a straight line\r\nto the right. i looked back at the other 2 orbs and noticed they\r\nhave both moved slightly to the right. at this point i have\r\ncompletely lost sight of the first orb that moved. next the orb that\r\nwas originally in the middle started moving slowly to the right the\r\nsame as the last one did. i eventually lose sight of this orb also,\r\nthe last orb followed

the\r\nsouth and heading slightly toward the northeast. it was in the\r\nperfect shape of a v, sharp front point and very sharp tail points.\r\nit had no running lights and was barely visible. it

regarding the pic and the\r\nsighting we all had. on 4-25-05 my family and i moved some of our\r\nfurniture from san mateo ca to tucson az and into our new house. our\r\npermanent move is scheduled for early june. on 042605 myself, my\r\nwife and her friend decided to take a ride around our new\r\nneighborhood. we jumped into a jeep wrangler with the top off and\r\nbegan driving. we noticed a new \"chemtrail\" had just been \"laid\" the\r\ntrail was placed west to east and although new it was beginning to\r\ndissipate. approx 4 blocks from our house, our friend jennifer, who\r\nwas in the back seat said \"you better look up\". looking up, we\r\nspotted an either luminous or self luminous object near the\r\nchemtrail. we stopped the jeep for a better look. with naked eye the\r\nobject appeared to have some sort of protrubrance on it and it was\r\ndifficult to make out the shape. it \"floated\" slowly in and out of\r\nthe chemtrail. the chemtrail itself was moving with the wind, i\r\nbelieve in a north-easterly direction. the object \"followed\" the\r\nchemtrail. having no camera i began phoning my sons who were in our\r\nnew house with the idea of having them take pictures of the object.\r\ngetting no response from them we drove back to the house. as we\r\ndrove in we found our sons were also outside watching the object. i\r\nretrieved a nikon 5.1 digital camera from the house and snapped a\r\nshot toward the object, which was now \"downrange\" of the house and\r\nquite small. i put the camera on zoom for the pic. the entire\r\nsighting lasted approx. 15 minutes. i have read and heard that\r\nchemtrails were \"laid\" at specific heights, so judging by this i\r\nwould say that the object must have been quite large in size\r\nespecially when it was viewed almost directly above us. i spent 4\r\nyears in the air force and 20 years as a san francisco police\r\nofficer. although this makes me no expert, i am perhaps a little\r\nbetter observer of things. my opinion as i watched this object was\r\nthat this was no bird or any other familiar or manmade object that i\r\nhave observed.It appeared to us that this object was \"sampling\" the\r\nchemtrail. i have the photo and can send it to you. the shape of the\r\nobject from the photo is really strange, not your typical ufo shaped\r\nobject. i have read the statement on your page about pictures, but i\r\nam not sure how to send it via e-mail, let me know and i will do so.\r\nmy only regret is not having my camera ready when i needed it,\r\nbecause i believe i could have gotten some outstanding shots when it\r\nwas above us. i was stationed at two bases in arizona, davis-monthan\r\n(tucson), which was a strategic air command base, and luke (phoenix)\r\nwhich was at the time a tactical air command base, i was in the air\r\npolice and i can tell you we saw and heard of very strange things.\r\none of my duties was working the desk where i would field calls from\r\ncitizens reporting ufo s, of course my instructions to them (since\r\nproject blue book had been dismantled) was to call their local pd.\r\nso i \"know\" the deserts and the strange things that go on there. we\r\nwill be back permanently next month with camera ready this time. to\r\ntell you the truth i dont think it will take much effort being in\r\nthis area to get additional pics of more objects.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\ndan baker\r\n\r\nthe above number is only good until 050105\r\nif needed for any reason i can be reached at my business line\r\n(anytime) at

behind\r\nmountians due east from me. motion is slow, floating like a blimp\r\nor balloon. at\r\nfirst i thought it was a large blimp with a mirror-like exterior\r\nreflecting\r\nthe sunlight (sun was below the eastern horizon during the entire\r\nencounter), object was extremely bright, yet had a distinct oval\r\noutline. after\r\nrising a few degrees above mountains object stopped all motion.\r\ntotal time to\r\nrise up was about 2 minutes. second identical object then began to\r\nrise\r\njust to the left of the first object. second object moved\r\nidentically to\r\nfirst, then stopped next to first at equal altitude. third\r\nidentical looking\r\nobject then began to rise just to right of first object, at same\r\nslow rate,\r\nuntil it was at equal altitude with other 2 objects. all three\r\nobjects\r\nremained still for about 2 more minutes. very curious sight at\r\nthis time, but\r\nall witnesses still thought objects were blimps. right-most object\r\nthen\r\nbegins to rise slowly above others, stops completely, then moves\r\nfrom a\r\ncomplete stop to a point slightly above the horizon almost\r\ndirectly due south\r\nof us (visible out the right side of the car) in about 2 or 3\r\nseconds then\r\ncomes to a complete stop again. no acceleration or deceleration\r\nwas apparent.\r\nmiddle object then does exactly the same, stopping next to the\r\nother above\r\nthe southern horizon. third object then repeats the same exact\r\nmanuever.\r\nwhen all 3 were stopped hovering next to each other then all 3\r\nobjects\r\nslowly

fact\r\nthat all of us were under orders to speak of any potential ufo\r\nsightings only\r\nto our commanding officer (to my knowledge all af personnel,\r\nincluding\r\nmyself and the witnesses, at

my window.\r\n i went out on my balcony to get a better look. it s somewhat\r\n cloudy now, and the sun is setting, so my view may have been\r\n distorted, but i believe i saw a rather large flying object in\r\n the sky almost directly above me.\r\n\r\ni can t say how big this object was as i cannot guess how far\r\n away it was from me, but i imagine it to be quite large. i\r\n couldn t see an actual object, but i could clearly see the\r\n lights on it. i will attempt to describe it now. it may sound\r\n confusing, but please bare with me.\r\n\r\nassuming it was circular in a sense will make it easier for me to\r\n describe. at 12 o clock and 6 o clock, roughly, there appeared\r\n to be two rapidly blinking lights, constantly changing colors\r\n from purple to green to blue, etc. the two lights seemed to be\r\n in synch with one another, changing at the same time to the same\r\n colors.\r\n\r\nat 3 o clock and 9 o clock were two steady white (yellow?) lights\r\n that did not blink nor change color.\r\n\r\nthese lights stayed in the same formation at all times, so that s\r\n what lead me to believe that it was a single object instead of\r\n four seperate objects. this is all conjecture, however.\r\n assuming, however, that it is a single object, the location of\r\n these lights make me think it was circular in shape, or even\r\n square. i can t be sure as i didn t see the object itself, only\r\n the lights it emitted.\r\n\r\ni came inside to get my phone so i could call my friend who lives\r\n near by and ask him for his view of it. however, when i came\r\n back outside the object was gone. this is what bugs me the most\r\n about this sighting. my view is pretty clear for a great\r\n distance in all directions and as i said before, this object was\r\n positioned almost directly above me. i was inside for all of 10\r\n seconds at most. for it to be gone when i came outside means it\r\n either turned off its lights, flew into a higher atmosphere, or\r\n flew out past my range of vision. if it did move, it must have\r\n been moving pretty damn fast to have escaped my field of view in\r\n such a short amount of time.\r\n\r\ni realize i live near lax airport, and i m no stranger to seeing\r\n planes flying overhead. but this is unlike anything i ve ever\r\n seen. the size, the shape, the way it just disappeared -\r\n something doesn t add up about this.\r\n\r\n\r\nps. please forgive any typing errors. i m kind of shaken by this\r\n and i m typing fast, trying to get this down before my mind can\r\n obscure the few facts i have. \r\n
