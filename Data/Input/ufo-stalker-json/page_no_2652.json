moving into my new house in\r\nphoenix from california. my boyfriend at the time and myself were\r\ndriving two cars full of personal items from california to phoenix.  \r\nwe were traveling on interstate 10 - near the chuckwalla prison (i\r\nremember do not pick up hitch-hikers signs)between 1:30-2:20 am.  i\r\nremember seeing pretty bright-white lights up ahead, and though a\r\nplane was flying directly at me. they were very low, so i kept my\r\neye on them.  i was a pilot before, and i have an interest in all\r\ntypes of planes. oddly, as i kept driving these lights didn t pass\r\nme - they just slowly got bigger. it probably took me 20 minutes or\r\nso to come up to them and by this point i was very intrigued as to\r\nwhy a plane heading toward me could take so long - i thought it was\r\nflying sooo slow.  as i came right up to it, it was very very close\r\nto the right side of the freeway.  i pulled my car over to the\r\nshoulder and my boyfriend followed behind me.  i didn t see another\r\ncar coming or going for over an hour.  we were parked in the dirt\r\nand i was looking out my windshield at this \"plane\", and it was very\r\nunusual.  it seemed to be a flat or matte black color, and the shape\r\nwas most like a triangle.  it didn t have \"wings\" per se. the lights\r\nwere white - no color.  there were multiple lights, but i don t know\r\nhow many. it was hoovering perfectly at around 200 feet off the\r\nground.  it was the size of a medium to larger jet. except it was\r\nall plane - no wings. i looked for markings, doors or windows and i\r\nsaw none.  i was looking pretty straight up though..So i saw mostly\r\nthe bottom of the craft. i still didn t think anything other than\r\n\"usaf\", but to get a better view i decided to open my \"moonroof\" up.\r\n  then i could really see well.  i was looking some more..Maybe\r\n20-30 seconds when i suddenly realized that i heard a\r\ncricket...Silence greeted my open moonroof. i then immediately\r\nlooked down at the ground to see if there was any displacement of\r\ndirt (like a harrier jet will do)...None.  dead silence and nothing.\r\n  i couldn t wrap my brain arounf this and i think i got scared and\r\ndidn t know what the heck this was.  i think i went into a kind of\r\nshock, as i immediately put my car in gear and raced away from\r\nthere. 10 minutes later i pulled over at the next rest stop, by the\r\nprison so i could ask my boyfriend (who followed me away) what he\r\nthought.  we were both in shock, but he described exactly the same\r\nsighting...And asked me why i drove away?  to this day i wished i\r\nhad been braver, but my brain said run!  what craft can do this??\r\nwish i knew.","distance":"21-100

country town in australia called orange. it was\r\n a cold clear night crisp as i had my window open and the doonar\r\n tight around me. i was laying in bed looking out to the east\r\n through my bedroom window. it was aproximately 10.00 pm. i had\r\n just turned off my television. and i saw a small light about\r\n half the size of my pinky nail at armslength. i thought it was a\r\n star or the moon. but it then started moving which i could tell\r\n against the stars. it began slowly moving, no flashing lights at\r\n that point, towards the north in a fairly level path about 2ft\r\n at armslength. thinking it was a plane i was shocked when the\r\n object stopped moving. i began to get frightenedand pulled the\r\n doonar up higher. i watched it stand still for a good 2-3\r\n minutes. then it began to fade into other colours red and blue\r\n and white yellow green. it then began to move again in an\r\n erratic manner able to move the whole length of my window 6ft in\r\n a half a second it went up to the left then made a 45 degree\r\n sharp fall to theground. it slowly then moved behind my trres in\r\n theback yard and then shot back into my feild of vision. i\r\n watched this arobatic exhibition for a total of 10 mins untill\r\n it stopped hovered and then sped at an intense rateand shot out\r\n of my field of vision in an instant leaving upwards.\r\nthat is not the end of it. waiting in anticipation everynight for\r\n a week, it was not a month later that i saw a similar object out\r\n my window again. this time it was larger and flew alot more\r\n slowly almost purposely over the horison. when it stoppped i\r\n became paranoid that it was watching me. and this was only\r\n heightened when i saw alight grow more intense from the base of\r\n the object it stood in position for a short time 2 mins the\r\n light turned off and then the object zipped into the air and out\r\n of sight as before.\r\nthe story doesnt end there\r\nyears later a friend and myself go to a psychic to get a reading.\r\n both of us skeptical ask for some proof of her fortelling she\r\n tells me about my psudenym \"raoul\" the name i use when i write\r\n any creative works (in honour of the late great hunter s\r\n thompson, raoul duke) but she also tells me of my ufo encounters\r\n and tells me exactly where i saw it and on the dates. she also\r\n tells me that i will have an encounter whilst driving, cant\r\n wait. \r\n\r\nboth encounters happened on clear cold nights. both times the\r\n object moved in erattic patterns at speeds too fast for\r\n conventional aircraft helicopters and jets alike. there is no\r\n airport trafic in that part of the country. and the lack of\r\n blinking lits also points to it not being convetional craft. \r\n

report:   at the time i resided at a house on deauville\r\nclose, yorkeys knob, (near cairns), queensland, australia.  i\r\nremember i was in primary school, but i can t remember the exact\r\ndate of the event, i m pretty sure it happened in 1980, but i m not\r\nsure of the day/month.  it was in the evening, my family was having\r\ndinner, i was late & they were calling me for dinner.  i was looking\r\nout my bedroom window, i liked to look at the stars at night, the\r\nblocks next door were vacant bushland and i had a good view of the\r\nstars.  we lived on the beachfront, there were some dunes covered in\r\nscrub between our house and the beach.  i remember this event so\r\nclearly, it haunts me, at the time i was mesmerised by it.  i called\r\nout to my family - \"mum, dad, come look, there s a ufo!\"  they\r\ndidn t come, they were eating, and laughed at me from the other\r\nroom.  to this day my family still sometimes recall my \"story\" and\r\nstill make fun of me.  if only they had seen what i saw that night.  \r\nthe ufo did not look like any picture of a ufo that i ve seen - it\r\nwas a different shape altogether.  it rose from over the low\r\nbushland near the sea, i first saw it when it was about 10 or 20\r\nmetres above the ground, i watched it come in from the east/sea, and\r\nit moved along a straight path westward, slowly rising.  it seemed\r\nto fly so amazingly low, near my house it seemed to fly above the\r\nblock next door (that i was looking toward from my bedroom window),\r\nmy bedroom was on ground floor, and the ufo seemed only about twice\r\nthe height of the black wattle tree next door - probably only 20 to\r\n40 metres up in the air - i couldn t beleive how close it was.  \r\nsomehow it then continued it s path westward, gliding more towards\r\nthe south west gently, getting higher and higher, it rose over the\r\ntall trees of the swamp at the southern end of the cul-de-sac, and i\r\ncould no longer see it over the horizon of trees/swamp.  it glided\r\nalong a smooth straight path the whole time, and it moved so slowly.\r\n  i don t know exactly how fast it moved, it seemed like the pace of\r\nsomeone pedalling along on a bike, maybe 2 minutes?  it seemed\r\nforever, but i think that was because of the mind bending\r\nexperience.  as for the ufo s appearance - it was not a saucer.  \r\nthere were no little green men.  i did not seen any aliens at all.\r\nbut it had a soft glow around it.  the outer seemed greyish, but my\r\neyes were focused in it s front face - you could see into the front\r\nof it, but all i could see was a light pale soft yellow colour,\r\nthere was no detail. it was cylindrical in shape - the same sort of\r\nshape as a rectangle, but with rounded edges, and not very deep.  it\r\nwas smooth all over, rounded at the corners, and i could only see\r\ninto the front, i don t remember seeing into the back (it was a long\r\ntime ago).  the shape was sort of like this:\r\nside view:\r\n---------\r\n|         |\r\n---------\r\n\r\nfront view:\r\n-----\r\n(     )\r\n-----\r\nthat s the best sort of scale i can get using typed characters!  \r\nremember it was smooth in shape and edges were round, not sharp.  \r\nbut the front view did have notably rounded sides, like the  () \r\ncharacters.  to this day i know i saw it, but i doubt myself all the\r\ntime and it has messed with my self confidence as a result, i was\r\ndouble check things that i do now as a result. but i know what i saw\r\nwas a ufo.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":3354,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-23.3776546,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":150.5099759,"occurred":1117988951000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Queensland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1117988951000,"summary":"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Rockhampton,

then\r\ndisapeared as well we counted seven high orbit starlike spots all\r\nmoving in curving or changing directions all heading to and\r\ndisapearing in the same vacinity near the big dipper. really

5 seconds...I m not good with math but that s fast in my\r\nbook...I watched the object, which was basically straight up over my\r\nhead when i first noticed it, for about 15 to 20 seconds before

just always wondered if\r\n anyone else reported it.\r\n\r\nit occurred over a very busy highway in northwestern wisconsin. \r\n my dad and i both saw it from our truck; my sister saw it\r\n zooming away.  the trucker in front of us must have seen it, as\r\n he pulled over rather hurriedly to the next rest area.  (i\r\n didn t know there was a rest area coming up, or i would have\r\n followed him in to ask.)\r\n\r\ni ve never seen a picture of a ufo, or heard of any report that\r\n describes what we saw.  it was not cigar-shaped, or\r\n saucer-shaped, or anything like that.  the radio did not go out,\r\n although i was expecting it to. ;)\r\n\r\nit was round, but flat on top and bottom.  how to describe the\r\n shape...A cylinder, but wider than tall.  lights completely\r\n covering the curved surface, and seeming to rotate.  no lights\r\n on the bottom.  one red light from the top on a, well, i guess\r\n an antennae.  (it was above the upper surface.)\r\n\r\nit hovered over the highway, maybe 30 feet above the ground\r\n (trying to think -- like a 3rd floor window height).  no sound.\r\n\r\ni was driving, and saw it ahead of us, but thought at first it\r\n was part of the many headlights and taillights.  we approached\r\n it and it wasn t moving apparently, as we got closer to it until\r\n it was rather over the front, driver s side of the truck -- but\r\n maybe 20 feet in front of the truck, as we could still see it\r\n out the windshield.  my dad was riding shotgun and he told me\r\n later he thought it was some sort of billboard and that words\r\n would come around in the lights (don t ask me -- different\r\n generation, i guess).\r\n\r\nthe weird thing was that we came up \"under\" it and then it stayed\r\n even with us for about a minute.  long enough for me to yell at\r\n my sister, lying down in the backseat, to sit up and look. \r\n twice.  (because being younger, she is sometimes a butthead and\r\n won t do what i say.)  she grudgingly sat up just in time to\r\n look out her side window and see it zooming away.  it was on the\r\n horizon in a matter of seconds.  my sister kept watching (could\r\n still see the red light from the top) and she said it appeared\r\n to meet up with another \"red light\" on the horizon.  then both\r\n disappeared.\r\n\r\nother minor details, too, probably.\r\n\r\nokay, so this is the first time i ve \"reported\" this to anyone.\r\n i figure my email addy is enough for you to contact me if

exactly sure of the year or time. it was a colder morning, i\r\n think in early spring maybe in march or april? \r\nbut it follows as this, i use to wake up in the morning extra\r\n early just to watch gi-joe and mario brothers on tv at 5am. i\r\n woke up as the first 5am show was almost ending one morning and\r\n ran to the living room, which looked down into a valley (this\r\n took place in colville, wa where i use to live) and it had huge\r\n windows that spanned the entire room so anything outside you\r\n couldnt have missed. i made it half way to the tv i remember and\r\n just froze. it was nearly pitch black out, no lights in the\r\n house were on yet as i was the only one up still. i felt\r\n compelled to turn to my left and look out the windows where i\r\n saw pulsateing, circluateing lights, they would all be on but\r\n would get brighter and go in a big around in a big circle and\r\n semi reflected off of whatever the lights were on, it was\r\n cicular in s hape with the red lights being near the edges of\r\n the object. i ran to the center window of the house and watched\r\n as it appoarched maybe double treetop level. it moved maybe only\r\n a 40mph pace or so and then i noticed the other 3, which\r\n appeared to be helicopters or something similar to them, they\r\n had fast rotating and human like normal yellow light on the\r\n front and  typical a  faint light at the rear. my first thought\r\n was they were escorting the object in a triangular pattern, all\r\n about the same distance to it. but all very close. i could make\r\n rotations of the blades or something on the 3 \"helicopters\" but\r\n they didnt make any noise. i didnt realize this untill later. it\r\n was totaly silent. as they passed over my house i ran to the\r\n front windows but didnt have a good view because of trees. i saw\r\n them go a possible 1/4 and then all turn left up over the hills\r\n and mountains and disappeared rather quickly at that point. i\r\n was just frozen and i remember my mother waking up and turning\r\n on the kitchen light and asking what i was looking at, i said\r\n nothing and went to get dressed..  \r\n\r\nsimiliar sightings involved i thought a

parents.  as we descended a\r\n hill toward a stop light, heading west, i saw a bright light in\r\n the distance that seemed to be moving very slowly or even\r\n stopped.  as we sat at the stop light i could tell that it was\r\n moving very slowly, and i pointed that fact out to my wife, who\r\n had not noticed the bright light before.  when the light turned\r\n green, we turned left and ascended a long hill that led to our\r\n subdivision.  when we got to the entrance of our subdivision,\r\n the light was almost overhead and we could see that it was some\r\n kind of craft.  as i pulled into the subdivision, i parked the\r\n car at the curb and got out just as the craft was overhead.  it\r\n was very large, maybe 50 or 60 yards long and wide, triangular\r\n in shape with a light on each tip.  it was probably a 100 yards\r\n above the tree tops.  two things that really spooked us was that\r\n for a craft that large, it made not a sound and it moved so\r\n slow.  it just was kind of floated by.  a normal craft that\r\n large, going that slow,would certainly have stalled out and\r\n crashed to earth.  my wife and i watched in amazement as it\r\n moved east toward the city of richmond.  when i called the local\r\n airport to see if they had any strange object on radar, the\r\n reply was negative, and i reasoned later that they wouldn t see\r\n anything on radar because it was flying so low.  both of us will\r\n never forget that night and continue to wonder to this day what\r\n that craft was.-  \r\n

other words i wasn t standing\r\n sill able to make more substanciated observations. with more\r\n time my observations might have had better accuracy. also the\r\n images associated with this document are graphic representations\r\n created in photoshop and illustrator for lack of a camera that\r\n day.\r\n\r\nday 1, 10/02/04: \r\nmy dad and i were driving north outside of waterbury, vt when a\r\n cloud with a very defined and rounded outline along its top came\r\n into view. i being on the passenger side the cloud was very\r\n visable to me for 5 miles or so along our travel route. the\r\n cloud itself looked as if it were heavy vapors streaming\r\n downward form something unseen. then there was the defining\r\n rounded curning shape along the top of the cloud. these\r\n annomalies by themselves brought my attention right to the\r\n cloud. and i continued to observe it for several miles. this\r\n took at least 15 or 20 minutes. and during this time the cloud\r\n never changed shape right up to the point of loosing site of it.\r\n we continued on for several miles more (aprox 10 miles). then\r\n south of richmond, vt (a mile or so) i spotted something flying\r\n very fast at very low altitude (lower than the tops of the\r\n mountains which aren t very high in vt) and silver in color. i\r\n at first thought it was a fighter jet on a practice flight.\r\n which would be unusual because in all the years of driving this\r\n rount north i have rarely seen any kind of air traffic in the\r\n area. but taking a hard look at it only revealed a flying box\r\n (rectangle). much like a tracter trailer box or shipping\r\n container of a highly reflective silver.  even though it was\r\n right out in the open and approx. 1/2 mile away details could\r\n not be seen other than the definite rectangle shape and\r\n reflective silver surface. it was out of sight in a very short\r\n time. \r\nday 2, 10/03/04:\r\nmy mom and i were just entering the east access road of the\r\n berlin mall, berlin, vt. my eyes wandered up to the sky and\r\n there to my supprise was another cloud similar to the one sited\r\n just the day before. but 10 times the size and at approx. the\r\n same altitude it covered a substancial portion of the shy. and\r\n very supprising there were 2 jets coming from east and west. it\r\n looked like they were converging on a point some distance just\r\n to the north of the cloud. keep in mind the invisible point of\r\n intersection for there 2 jets would be almost dead on the\r\n central top area of the cloud. very odd to see an anomilous\r\n cloud and 2 jets headed at each other. at least i don t see\r\n military interest in something i might beleive to a ufo every\r\n day. \r\n \r\n

accidentally\r\n photographing some sort of ufo and hopefully of the\r\n extraterrestrial variety. i am only today 06/07/04 processing\r\n the digital film on my computer so i had no idea what was on the\r\n film. as can be seen in the raw digital photos the objects are\r\n so very distant as to make it hard to see them without being\r\n magnified properly. but even to look at either photo under\r\n normal magnification the small spec is not the shape of any sort\r\n of plane. though the lower object in the second photo under\r\n magnification immediately takes on the aspect of a plane. \r\nthe fist shot shows the rectangular? object just above the\r\n mountain. the second shows the object at a very high altitude\r\n and just below it but above the mountain is what appears to be a\r\n pursuit plane of some kind. maybe this second photo validates\r\n this as et ufo. \r\nkeep in mind it took me 15 seconds or so the reposition the\r\n camera on the tripod so i don t know what happened to make it\r\n take off for the stratosphere. the whole event 3 to 5 minutes\r\n tops. that s pretty much my point of view since the camera is a\r\n silent witness to the event.\r\nusing a

\r\nobject was sighted for, etc. anyway, i keep asking my father to stop the \r\ncar because i had to go to the bathroom ( not many service stations \r\nstayed open all night back then, also the interstate was not yet \r\nconstructed. we were on hyw 231 some where between alabama and florida, \r\ni believe it must have been near florala, alabama. here is what i \r\nremember. my father pulled off the highway onto the shoulder of the \r\nroad, stopped the car got out, opened the back door for me to get out, \r\nand he and i walked to the rear of the car. i am not sure of what time \r\nit was but it must have been very late, we did not see any other \r\ntraffic. i do remember it was very dark, kind of warm weather. i was \r\nabout to do my thing, when i looked over my right shoulder and saw an \r\nobject with red lights around the bottom of it, it appeared to be a disk \r\n(circle) shape with me looking up at it from an angle. the object was at \r\ntree top level, no sound, i asked my father, \" what is that?\". i don t \r\nremember him saying anything, but i watched the object cross over the \r\nroad behind us and get to the trees on the other side. this is all i \r\nremember. both sides of the road had trees about 30 feet tall. i believe \r\nmy father and i were as close as 50 feet to the object. my parents never \r\ntalked about the sighting, perhaps it never happened, then again maybe \r\nmore than this occurred that night somewhere between alabama and florida \r\non that lonely stretch of hi way. if you have any information please \r\nforward it to
