it was around the\r\n middle of march because my husband was at ntc in california and\r\n i was alone.  we lived in these two story apartments off base\r\n (fort hood) and it was evening close to 10:00 at night. it was a\r\n very clear night, no clouds and fairly warm for that time of\r\n year.  my neighbor was visiting with me her name was wendy\r\n hartman ( not sure of last name ) but anyways we were visiting\r\n when her little brother who lived with them came over and said\r\n there were weird lights in the sky.  we went outside to the\r\n balcony and looked out.  the lights appeared to be coming from\r\n over the fort hood air feild area.  at first we told him that\r\n they were just strobe lights because they seemed to be making\r\n some weird pattern in the sky.  but as we watched we started to\r\n get kind of freaked out because the lights were very bright, i\r\n mean as in very very strong not light like an artifical beamed\r\n strobe light would make.  what was really strange was what these\r\n lights were doing.  there appeared to be maybe between 10-15\r\n separate lights or globes becasue they were not small. they were\r\n white globes.  they moved around the sky all scattered up and\r\n down in all directions. then to our amazement they all lined up\r\n in a straight line and moved together, forward, then backward\r\n then up and down, then a few whould shoot away real fast then\r\n come back. some of the globes would shoot straight up into the\r\n sky real fast and disapear and then return slowly back down. \r\n some of them would go diagonally and then appear to hover and\r\n not move.  it was a really fantastic show of some type of\r\n areodynamics because as we watched we could not believe the\r\n positions these lights were acomplishing only to come back\r\n together in a straight line and go up and down and diagonally,\r\n horizontally and every which way.  another neighbor came out at\r\n that time and stood out there and watched with us too for some\r\n time and thought it was really srtange, he ruled out strobe\r\n lights becasue of the globes light intensity and what they were\r\n doing in the air as if each single globe has a mind of its own,\r\n we ruled out helichopters or any type of aircraft because of the\r\n speed and the directions the lights were going.  finally we got\r\n real creeped out and said that something was no right especially\r\n since the lights seemed to be coming from fort hoods air field. \r\n our nieghbor suggested we call iii corps and report it.  i\r\n called iii corps and reported the sighting and i remember the\r\n operator was really egsasperated because she said that she had\r\n been recieving similar phone calls all night long.  i have no\r\n doubt in my mind that what we saw that night was not an airplane\r\n or strobe lights. it has been years now since the incident but i\r\n have seen shows or reports over the years of lights like the\r\n ones we saw and it creeps me out becasue what i saw was so\r\n similar to some of these other accounts.  i dont know if you can\r\n investigate something so old but i am sure that if you call fort\r\n hood, tx and ask iii corps to show you records of the blotter\r\n reports for the month of march 1993 there has to be record of\r\n all those phone calls that were called in on that night.  that\r\n is all i have.  i am writing this because my husband encouraged\r\n me to write to you because it has bothered me all these years\r\n about those lights and i know i am not crazy but i know what i\r\n saw. \r\n

after\r\n seeing a television programme on area 51.  though having grown\r\n up in britain, i was in texas during the late 70s and early 80s\r\n off and on.\r\n\r\ni saw that \"ufo\" that supposedly landed in dayton, texas i\r\n believe.  this was in 1979 or 80, i really don t remember the\r\n exact date.   i was in cleveland, texas which is 25 miles away. \r\n this is a very rural sort of area and there s little else to do\r\n but go for a drive.  i was with a friend (he was driving) when\r\n we came to a stop sign at hwy 321 (which leads to dayton).  he\r\n stayed there at the stop sign and we were watching what appeared\r\n to be a very bright star, i was the first to notice (i believe i\r\n said \"look at that star\").  the star became brighter and\r\n brighter and larger.  very soon, and i don t remember how, the\r\n thing was right on top of us.  the thing was very large indeed\r\n and triangular shaped.  i m a bad judge of distance, but it\r\n seemed only a matter of feet above his pickup truck.  there were\r\n lights of a different colour on each cornor i remember.  but, to\r\n have been so very bright on approach, the underside seemed dark,\r\n and i could see no brightness at all. \r\n\r\nthe thing sort of swirled around the top of us and made for the\r\n direction of dayton. it s leaving gave the very same appearance.\r\n it looked like a very large very bright star and became smaller\r\n the further it got away.  \r\n\r\nreally, at the time, i didn t think \"ufo\" etc. although this was\r\n a very strange event indeed. all  i remember saying to my\r\n friend, \"that s odd, if that were a plane of that size and that\r\n close it would blow us off the road\" (those were my exact\r\n words).  but, it was very different from a plane, there was\r\n absolutely no sound at all.  this is what really gave us \"the\r\n creeps\".\r\n\r\ni thought no more about it.  then a very short while later i read\r\n about an event in dayton, texas in the houston newspaper, where\r\n some family came across some strange object and got radiation\r\n sickness or something.  and they were suing the air force.  i\r\n thought perhaps this is what we d seen, but after reading that\r\n article wanted no part of it.  thinking of it now still gives me\r\n \"the creeps\".  this thing no doubt approached us, and it could\r\n have been us contacted by it.  thinking of it now, probably the\r\n only thing saving us was the fact that we were just on the\r\n outskirts of town, not remote enough.  so the thing made for\r\n some remoter area near dayton. i can t promise you i know what\r\n it was, but i ve never seen anything as strange before or since.\r\n   \r\n

but never knew where to\r\n go to log an \"official\" report that may be of some use to\r\n someone. im now 36, this siting happened when i was 14 (1983). \r\n it was very early in the moring, id estimate the time to be 4:15\r\n am or so, it was pre-dawn or so, with no lightening happening on\r\n the horizon.  i think it was early spring - it was cool - but\r\n not mitten-cold, and it was mostly clear, with just a few\r\n \"scuttle\" clouds around.  i was on my morning paper route.  i\r\n was delivering papers on coe street, in woonsocket ri, near the\r\n intersection of coe and providence street, and was delivering\r\n papers to the houses across the street from the holy family\r\n church rectory.  there is a big parking lot associated with the\r\n church.  i heard a low rumbling, similar to an idling\r\n 18-wheeler.  i was convinced there was an 18-wheeler nearby\r\n idling, and being a cautious young lady, i remember looking at\r\n the parking lot to see the truck and why they might be hanging\r\n around, and not seeing one, glancing up and down the street\r\n looking for it.  this is when i noticed a dull orange glow\r\n hitting the street from where i was standing to about 70 feet\r\n down from me, towards the intersection of providence street. \r\n the glow was similar to that cast by high intensity sodium\r\n lighting, but with a stronger orange hue.  the glow immediately\r\n had me looking up, where to my utter surprise, i found the\r\n source of the low rumbling sound.  a large \"craft\" of some sort\r\n was moving very slowly over the street.  it was rectangular in\r\n shape, and i can only explain it as a massive lumbering barge\r\n kind of thing.  i wouldnt begin to guess on size, because i\r\n couldnt judge how high it was, but it was def. higher than the\r\n rectory building - and it pretty much was obliterating the view\r\n of the sky over the road from my perspective - when i saw it, it\r\n was almost directy overhead.  the bottomside of the ship - the\r\n only portion i could see - had dozens of circular orange lights\r\n - the same color as vehicle parking lights - in a regular grid\r\n pattern along its entire width and length the spaces between the\r\n lights were in dark shadow and i could make no other detail\r\n other than its rectangular shape amongst the dark blue pre-dawn\r\n sky. it was one solid unit. it was moving very slow, and i got\r\n the sickening sense that it was scanning the ground below.  i\r\n was suddenly aware that i was possibly in the orange glow, and\r\n was terrified of the prospect that i might have been seen by any\r\n occupants on that thing.  i remember dropping my bike, and\r\n running to the nearest home, where i stood, hyperventilating, in\r\n thier screened porch, as the thing lumbered over the road in\r\n front of the house.  i remember dogs in the home barking\r\n excitedly.  i remember the glass panes in the house windows and\r\n door begin to audibly vibrate/resonate from the low frequency\r\n rumbling of that thing.  i stood frozen with fear in that porch\r\n for what seemed like an eternity, but was probably more like a\r\n couple of minutes.  i remember wondering if i should start\r\n banging on the door of the house and wake the people inside up. \r\n before i decided upon an action however, the rumbling quickly\r\n faded, the glow on the street vanished.  after a few more\r\n minutes, when i had calmed down, and the dogs stopped barking, i\r\n left the porch and scanned the sky - as much of it as i could\r\n see from the front of my hiding place on the porch.  i could not\r\n see the object anywhere.  i still had the rest of my paper route\r\n to finish, which i did with record-breaking speed, and i was\r\n glad when the sky started to lighten up with early morning\r\n colors!\r\n\r\nim most curious to know, if anyone else has ever reported similar\r\n craft anywhere else, and how often, and if there had been\r\n additional information - any contact with the crew of the craft?\r\n  could this be some kind of military craft?  this does not fit\r\n the description of the usually stealthy quiet white saucers\r\n people report, and i know what transport helicopters look like. \r\n please please respond (rachellandry@cox.Net) - what this thing\r\n might have been has been haunting me for years.\r\n\r\nthank you

years old and i lived on the 17th floor of\r\n an apartment building, facing east.  the first sighting took\r\n place in the afternoon.  i went to alternative school so i was\r\n home when my family was at work or school.  the sky was clear, a\r\n very brilliant blue actually, and there was this one very\r\n strange giant white cloud right smack in the middle of the sky\r\n according to my perspective from my window.  i was sort of\r\n intrigued by the strange cloud, so i looked at it for a long\r\n time.  then these little dark triangular shapes started to \"zip\r\n in and out of the cloud\" [quoting zetatalk, i read that on there\r\n a year or so later which was obviously breath taking ... don t\r\n knock and/or diss zetatalk to me].  anyway, at first i thought\r\n they were birds.  but their movement was so mechanical and in 15\r\n years i almost never saw black birds there, only seagulls.  i\r\n got my binoculars and i saw that they were not birds but black\r\n shiny triangles-type thingies.  it went on for a long time.  but\r\n that was all there was to it.  the second sighting happened\r\n about a week later.  i was lying in bed, and it was after 11 pm.\r\n  i was suddenly compelled to look up at the sky.  it was a\r\n perfectly clear night and i saw this solid round shape that\r\n looked like it was made of light.  it wasn t too far above my\r\n building,

snow.The sky had just\r\n cleared,and it was evening as the sun sets about 6:00 pm.On the\r\n western horizon,i saw a star-like light,very bright,manuevering\r\n around a wispy cloud,very fast.I was stunned at how it moved.My\r\n wife and daughter also saw it,and my daughter and i also saw two\r\n black discs on the horizon,they were flat on the bottom,so they\r\n werent perfectly round.My daughter saw them first,and i only\r\n caught a glimpse of it.I was in the navy,im a skeptical\r\n guy....But what moves like what i saw around that cloud???What\r\n are the black discs???Some years before i also saw a disc in the\r\n evening sky that was a funny mushroom color.I was working at\r\n rent-a- center and i stopped the truck and got out to look at it\r\n it.Other drivers did too,we were on a country road near concord\r\n nc...Our comments were that it has to be a balloon,but it was\r\n bigger than the moon and quite a distance away,it was disc\r\n shaped,but was flat at the bottom,like the black discs,last\r\n february.I also saw one night when i was doing a security job at\r\n a cell tower whose strobe light kept malfunctioning,a funny\r\n light that took off on the horizon----it was 2 flashing gold\r\n lights,not yellow or amber---these lights were gold---and they\r\n fused into one red light and accelerated into the sky at an\r\n anlge faster than i ever thought possible.....Im not going to\r\n say it was extraterrestrial...All im reporting is what i\r\n saw...There are other incidents in my life,but these are the\r\n most recent as well as the ones best etched in my mind.....I\r\n hope that we have craft that move like this,but then i hope we\r\n dont......All i know is that i simply hate seeing things that i\r\n cant explain!!! \r\n

reluctant to report it. the day\r\n the ufo made its appearance was sept 14th 2000, in monroe twp.\r\n n.J., a little before sunset. i, however, did not discover it\r\n had been there until i had had the pictures, which were taken\r\n that day, for at least a few weeks or even a couple of months.\r\n it was my wedding day and i was quite uneasy. i just wed my\r\n foreign, arabic husband in a civil ceremony at the local\r\n courthouse. i was considering all our differences, my\r\n uncertainties and doubts from right after the moment i had said,\r\n 93i do=94. we drove back to my parent=92s house and i was uplifted to\r\n see a rainbow in the sky. at certain angles it gave the visual\r\n effect as if landing directly upon my parents home. my new\r\n husband and myself ran to stand in the front yard as my parents\r\n took a number of pictures. the rainbow slowly faded away and at\r\n this time we all took turns posing for several more shots. the\r\n picture in question is of my mother and myself standing under a\r\n tree in the back yard. a bright egg shaped object is in the\r\n background against a dusk sky of bright orange. i do not know\r\n why i didn=92t notice it straight away; perhaps i was so\r\n distracted by the other photos with the rainbow. currently i\r\n only have one picture of this object from the actual negative\r\n (non-digital camera). i do have copies scanned from it into\r\n digital format. i=92m not certain where the negatives are, though\r\n i=92m pretty certain i have them. i have recently looked into ufo\r\n media and investigations so to find a group who is critical and\r\n will honestly examine what i have, rather then just adding it to\r\n a slew of falsehoods as if it is fact without proper scrutiny. i\r\n truly would like to be certain if it is what it may appear to\r\n be. i do not want to send it off to here and there. i am a\r\n published author of a serious moral; (at least to me) futuristic\r\n fiction work and do not wish for my name to be tainted with an\r\n association to a discreditable group. this is why i have decided\r\n to approach your network, after some research of your work,\r\n dedications and associations, to offer to send you a digital\r\n copy of the picture, and/or meet so the photo itself can be\r\n examined. i guess since i=92m going through with this i will also\r\n now hunt to locate the negatives. upon finding them i will make\r\n copies as well as having it ready for any examinations. the\r\n reason i have been reluctant to report, is because up until\r\n literally this week, my husband has been ever so against the\r\n idea of et=92s and ufo possibilities. we then watched a show on\r\n the matter a couple of days ago and then i showed him some video\r\n clips of ufos on the web. he was shocked at the world trades\r\n center clip, and he now states he believes in the possibility at\r\n 95% degree. i=92m amazed at the turn around because not only is he\r\n entertaining the possibilities himself, but he also is talking\r\n about what i had showed him to his arabic friends and sharing\r\n the video clip site with them and all with some serious\r\n excitement. i now can finally share what could be our own,\r\n special, personal experience with a ufo, with finally his\r\n support rather then fear.       \r\n

visable.  the moon was\r\n in the south east sky, low and very yellow.  as i stood just\r\n outside my patrol car, i had my head on a swivel just to make\r\n sure i was not being watched (i have jailed people for doing\r\n  what i was doing) i was standing by a cell phone tower, about\r\n 100 ft tall.  something caught my eye in the sky.  it was a\r\n milky gray color and moving directly overhead.  it was about\r\n 150-200ft up.  it traveled over me with no sound at all, and no\r\n lights. it was concealed very well as the color of the objest\r\n matched the sky very closely, it was not black, but kind of deep\r\n gray and blended very well with the sky that was sort of white\r\n washed by city lights.  as it traveled north west over head at\r\n about 25mph, it slowly blended with the color of the night sky,\r\n but i could tell it was still there because the stars were\r\n disapearing as it passed.  it was not that big, maybe the size\r\n of a bus, and had an odd shape.  it instantly reminded me of the\r\n galla kite i had when i as a kid.  all i could do was stare at\r\n it, and try to figure it out.  i sat on a long stretch of\r\n highway running radar the rest of the night trying to see it\r\n again, but i never did.  the shape was very odd.  it seemed to\r\n have some sort of cabel or tube dangling from it, similar to the\r\n huge planes that refuel jets in mid air.  it was close enough to\r\n me that it would have been heard if it was a plane.  as i drew\r\n it on paper, it looked more like a snail, with a long tube\r\n dangling underneath.  sorry no photos, and i now understand why\r\n there are not more photos of sightings.  i spent all the time i\r\n could have been taking pictures, trying to filter my brain to\r\n identify the object.  before

it is realized that it is not, it s\r\n too late.  don t know what it was. \r\n \r\n","distance":"101-500
