farm so there was quite a\r\n bit of open space so i could see for good distances. it was a\r\n beautiful day and the sun was just beginning to go down. i\r\n decided to go outside to enjoy the sunset that day. when i\r\n walked outside the sun was going down just to my right.  i\r\n watched for a few minutes then i happened to look off to my\r\n left. about 1000 feet away to my left was the beginning of my\r\n aunt92s property. just across the fence that separated our\r\n property was her feed mill which stood about the height of a two\r\n story house. the closest thing to the feed mill was a tree which\r\n was about 3-400 feet to the left of the feed mill. i don=92t know\r\n why i looked over there but when i did, i saw a beautiful light\r\n orange ball between the feed mill and the tree. my very first\r\n thought was it was the moon, then i quickly realized it could\r\n not been the moon. it was very beautiful, one of the prettiest\r\n oranges i=92ve ever seen. it did not take me long to realize that\r\n the ball was actually hovering between the tree and the feed\r\n mill. i knew that this was something very strange and something\r\n i would remember the rest of my life. i watched it for a few\r\n minutes, then started thinking i may be crazy for thinking it\r\n might be a ufo. i looked back at the sunset just for a moment. i\r\n remember feeling as though i were being watched. when i looked\r\n back at the orange ball, it was gone. i did not tell anyone for\r\n years. i finally told my cousin, who lives in the same area. he\r\n told me about similar experiences. the difference is that the\r\n orange ball chased a man to his truck, in one of the stories.  \r\n

28th of this year. i\r\n apologize for any lack of data or other such shortcomings.  i am\r\n new to investigations.  \r\n\r\nmy sister was driving south on highway 61 in hastings, mn en\r\n route to winona when she spotted a bright, oval shaped white\r\n light southeast of her position.  there were scattered clouds\r\n and the moon was fully visible.  this object appeared at\r\n approximately the 3-4 o clock position relative to the moon and\r\n my sister assumed that it was the light of an oncoming plane\r\n that she was seeing until it began to perfom some very\r\n remarkable movements.  from its stationary position it rapidly\r\n decended vertically to near the horizon level and hovered.  it\r\n seemed either to be wobbling or to be flashing lights, the\r\n clouds made it difficult to tell.  the object then performed a\r\n sharp u-turn and reversed direction to head directly upwards\r\n approximately 1/3 the distance it had initially decended, then\r\n stopped again.  after a second or two the object shot off with\r\n incredible speed to the northeast before disappearing.  \r\n\r\nshe had managed to reach me by cell phone during the sighting and\r\n was obviously excited and seemed certain that she had seen no\r\n ordinary aircraft.  unfortunately the object left the area\r\n before she was able to take pictures with the camera she had\r\n with her in her car (she was too busy giving me information over\r\n the phone).  also of note is the fact that she saw a vehicle\r\n pulled over to the side of the road with a man and his child\r\n watching the object through binoculars.  the lack of star\r\n visibility and absence of any other aircraft in the vicinity\r\n makes it more than likely that the man and his son were\r\n interested in the ufo.\r\n\r\ni plan to

from zionsville towards\r\n my house, located just north of 146th street (cr 300s).  the sky\r\n was clear.  as i approached the stoplight at the intersection of\r\n 146th street and michigan road i noticed up in the sky, just a\r\n bit to my right and at what appeared to be several thousand feet\r\n up, a line of three bright orangy-yellow lights - similar to the\r\n color and intensity of warning lights on highways at night.  the\r\n line of three lights was moving slowly to the north.  at first i\r\n thought i was seeing a large airplane - i momentarily thought it\r\n might be a c5a or a 747 that was flying low - but then\r\n remembered that neither one of these planes would have three\r\n lights of this color in a row (wingtip-center-wingtip), so it\r\n then struck me that this was something i had never seen before. \r\n i thus brought what i saw to the attention of my wife (sitting\r\n next to me) and my son (sitting in the back seat), who both\r\n looked up and said they saw the same thing i described and were\r\n as confused as i was regarding what we were looking at.    after\r\n about three seconds, one of the lights dimmed and then went out,\r\n then it came back on as the others dimmed and went out, and then\r\n the one that had gone out the first time and came back on again\r\n dimmed and went off.  by this time we had turned into our\r\n subdivision, so i parked the car so my sone and i could get out\r\n and try to see the lights again.  we did; this time, though, we\r\n only saw two and they were several miles away, but still headed\r\n in a northerly direction.  as before, after about ten seconds,\r\n the two lights dimmed and then went out.  my son and i continued\r\n to watch the sky for ten more minutes, but never saw the lights\r\n again, so we got back in the car and drove home, getting there\r\n about 9:00 p.M.  my interest piqued, i then went outside to see\r\n if i saw the lights again.  i did.  at about 9:10, i again saw\r\n three lights, of the same color but not the same intensity, as\r\n by now they appeared to be about 15 miles north of where i was,\r\n seemingly over the town of kirklin, in.  what i saw this time\r\n was two lights in a line and one light above the one on the\r\n left.  they stayed on for about 15 seconds, then the leftmost of\r\n the two dimmed and went out and then the other two dimmed and\r\n went out.  about five minutes later, in the same spot, i saw two\r\n of the three lights come one again, for about 10 seconds before\r\n then dimmed and went out.  i stayed outside for about 10 more\r\n minutes but never saw the lights again, so i went inside for the\r\n night.  for the record, i called the exectutive airport near out\r\n house to ask if anyone there knew of anything going on - they\r\n didn t, and hadn t seen the lights - and i called the newsroom\r\n at the indianapolis star to report what i had seen, but was told\r\n i was the only person who had called that evening.  i still\r\n haven t a clue what my son, my wife, and i saw, but after\r\n reading some of the postings from the april 2004 flap over north\r\n central indiana i realized that other people have seen the same\r\n thing i saw, so now i am really interested in learning more. \r\n please feel free to contact me if you need any additional\r\n information.  thank you. \r\n

edt) and we were lighting off\r\n fireworks in her back yard.  the night was overcast as no stars\r\n were visible.  as we were watching our own fireworks as well as\r\n those of the area surrounding, i noticed a round, slow moving\r\n object with an orange glow to it moving in the clouds towards us\r\n from the east.  it was not moving fast, but the speed of a\r\n conventional aircraft.  it was not the shape of a conventional\r\n aircraft, either commercial airliner, private small aircraft,\r\n balloon or blimp.  it made no sound as it passed overhead in a\r\n straight line of flight from due east to due west.  i pointed it\r\n out and others in the party observed it as i did.  it continued\r\n on its westardly path and i went to my wife s van (this is what\r\n makes the exact year of the event hard to pinpoint.  she\r\n purchased it in 1994, it was a 1995 model and it was either 1995\r\n or 1996 as she had had it for some time by then and i can t\r\n remember if it was the year

object as i approached the van while\r\n walking from the east side of the house (rear) to the west side\r\n (front) along the side of the house (north).  by the time i got\r\n to the van and retrieved the binoculars, the object had\r\n disappeared from sight.  i scanned the western sky with the\r\n binoculars but could not see it.  as the object had approached\r\n from the east, it was an oval.  overhead, it was circular and as\r\n it headed off to the west, it was oval again.  this is\r\n attributed to the perspective of seeing a circular object from\r\n below.  it maintained a uniform orange glow throughout the\r\n sighting, never changing in brightness or intensity.  i\r\n apologize for not being able to pinpoint the exact year of this\r\n sighting.  i had always meant to

hobart c. wilcox, and i, jan r.\r\n wilcox, began a return trip to our home in st. petersburg\r\n florida, from my cousin92s home in butler alabama.  we rose early\r\n and started our journey at 5:30 am. we were traveling by car, a\r\n 1994 dodge caravan. i was driving, with my father sitting in the\r\n right front passenger seat. we were heading south on highway 17.\r\n the weather was damp and cold (45 degrees) with a slight mist\r\n but no fog. at about 6:00 am a few miles outside of silas\r\n alabama, while it was still quite dark, i noticed a very bright,\r\n pulsing, bluish white light ahead of me and to the left of the\r\n highway.  the light was pulsing on and off at about one second\r\n intervals. the cadence and color of the light was very much like\r\n microwave tower strobes but was much more powerful, illuminating\r\n a rather large area of the forest tree tops directly beneath it.\r\n the duration of the illuminations was also much longer than the\r\n quick blips the tower strobes make. i asked my father if he\r\n could see this odd phenomenon and he said he could see it\r\n clearly. we were driving at about 55 to 60 mph. after\r\n continually observing and traveling about a mile, my father who\r\n has been a civilian pilot for many years after retiring from the\r\n military with 22 years of search and rescue missions on board\r\n both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, said the object,\r\n appeared to be moving at a pace similar to ours as the angle of\r\n inclination was remaining constant and we could both see the\r\n edge of the approximate 100 yard wide illuminated circle moving\r\n across the tree tops. both my father and i have military\r\n training in the observation of moving objects, night and day, as\r\n well as on the land, water, and sky. neither one of us has ever\r\n personally seen anything exactly like this light display\r\n before.\r\n  after driving on about two more miles with this pulsing light\r\n pacing just ahead of us and to the left keeping a steady\r\n elevation of about 50 feet above the tree tops, we approached\r\n the city limits of silas. at this point the light suddenly\r\n stopped moving with us and fell behind. i then slowed to the 35\r\n mph speed limit as we passed through silas but i watched the\r\n light continue to pulse in my side rear view mirror. then it\r\n just went dark and disappeared from our view.\r\n after driving on through the sleeping town of silas (we did not\r\n see a soul on the streets nor did we meet another car coming or\r\n going during this time), which only took a few minutes, as it is\r\n a very small rural town. my father and i began to discuss the\r\n possibilities of what may have been the source of this strange\r\n light, when i again noticed a pulsing light in front of us but\r\n at a very high altitude. it was hard to tell if this was the\r\n same light as it was now very small, but it had the same cadence\r\n and pulsing pattern and duration as the large light we had\r\n observed some moments before.  then quite suddenly the light\r\n descended, quickly moving back toward the outskirts of silas\r\n which was then a mile or so behind us, grew in size and\r\n intensity for a couple of pulses then disappeared again. \r\n we never saw it again although we did see many radio and\r\n microwave tower lights, which we easily identified as such until\r\n the dawn and early morning sun rose. my father and i discussed\r\n the incident at length as we drove on toward florida and we both\r\n agreed the only craft that we knew of that could mimic the\r\n flight characteristics of the object we saw would be a\r\n helicopter. however, if it was a helicopter, we asked the\r\n question of why its search light was pulsing instead of being a\r\n steady beam of light. also it is pretty hard to determine what\r\n purpose and/or what type of helicopter would be flying around an\r\n hour or so before dawn, buzzing a small rural town and forest in\r\n the middle of nowhere. an interesting footnote to this encounter\r\n is that later that morning as we drove on through the florida\r\n panhandle we saw signs indicating we were close to eglin air\r\n force base. then i remembered that i had seen some videos shot\r\n during a ufo flap in and around the eglin afb area in the late\r\n 1980=92s and some of the objects captured on those videos behaved\r\n and looked remarkably like the one my father and i had just\r\n witnessed. i also remembered that mufon was credited in this\r\n discovery channel ufo program with having investigated many of\r\n these sightings.\r\n unfortunately we did not have any equipment with us to record\r\n what we had seen so we just have our testimony and i realize\r\n that is not

florida ave.\r\narea:  sw area of lakeland. \r\ntime:  5 - 8 minutes.\r\nweather:  cool. 70 s? clear sky w/ 2 patches of puffy clouds to\r\n my left and one to the right.\r\ndescription:  i was traveling in my car heading south on south\r\n florida ave. i noticed two incoming planes to our small local\r\n airport.  the first was a familiar jet, and the second was an\r\n old craft that was perhaps closer to the 40 s. following the\r\n second craft, (stopped at a red light)i noticed a large, round\r\n silver object in the sw sky above where both planes had flown\r\n into lakeland and then on to the airport.  holding up a pencil,\r\n it was approx. the size of a round eraser end at the end of a\r\n pencil.  i first thought it was the sun reflecting on a plane,\r\n but the sun had set.  then i thought it might be a helicopter\r\n with a light on the front, but the light was too large and it\r\n wasn t moving. then, i thought perhaps it might be an\r\n experimental plane such as those that come in to our sun n  fun\r\n in april. (later, i checked with a flight safety man from our\r\n airport, asking a series of questions, and he said experimentals\r\n would not have large lights) here is the sequence:  the light\r\n did not flicker, but remained bright and steady before going out\r\n each time.\r\n1.  a large silver object with relection.\r\n2.  it changed to a large light.\r\n3.  it imploded - disappeared.\r\n4.  next stop light, a smaller light appeared.\r\n5.  it imploded - disappeared.\r\n6.  next stop light, a third and even smaller light appeared.\r\n7. it imploded - disappeared.\r\n8. the ususual military jets that fly overhead on a regular\r\n basis, then appeared and was seen above where the object/light\r\n was seen.\r\n9. two days later, going in the same direction, i saw the same\r\n familiar military jet, which normally flies at an extremely high\r\n altitude, was seen flying towards the area where i had the\r\n sighting.  the jet circled the area, leaving a small round trail\r\n where the object had been seen, and then turned completely\r\n around and went back in the opposite direction.  i see these\r\n jets regularly across our skies, and i ve never seen one down\r\n that low or perfom that kind of maneuver. they normally travel\r\n across the sky in a straight line. \r\nnote:  earlier that day, high frequency to r ear followed by pain\r\n and a nose bleed.  two hours later, sighting.\r\nimportant to note for me:   92 encounter began from that same\r\n area at 5:30, with craft, entities, and followed by an energy\r\n field to room two weeks later.  \r\n*i would appreciate a contact from mufon, as i have been trying\r\n to find a way to report a story to the journal.  \r\n*my journals have stopped arriving at my home and i am trying to\r\n get help from the post office. \r\n* i have filed a report with nuforc as to the extent of the\r\n activities i have been experiencing over the last several years.\r\n thanks to mary margaret, bland pugh and to peter davenport for\r\n their help in the past and for any assistance and followup they\r\n can give. thanks to john schuessler for his leadership. \r\n lakeland does not have a local director, and i look to mufon for\r\n their assistance. \r\n

object with hemispheric ends. no wings, tail,\r\n engines, noise, no metal seams, no rivets, no windows. noticed\r\n when it was several miles away coming from the north along the\r\n river bluffs. \r\n\r\ni was looking west and on the bluffs above riverside. first\r\n noticed due to an intermittent annoying bright blue light\r\n flashing on my right eye, right side. looking to the north the\r\n light quit and i didn t notice anything unusual. looking to the\r\n west the blue strobing, flashing, or glinting returned. i looked\r\n down at the ground to see if anything was in the grass glinting\r\n in the sunlight. nothing. i then stared at the area where it\r\n seemed to be coming from, finally i saw a very small circle with\r\n the internal portion about the same color as the atmosphere, it\r\n was very close to the bluffs. i watched as it approached getting\r\n larger as it got closer. i could see it come past mt lucia in\r\n stone park, it was still a circle.\r\n \r\neventually it was close enough i could see it had a cylinder\r\n shape rather than circular, it was now approximately over the\r\n junction of military road and riverside blvd. my thought was it\r\n may be a commercial airliner in trouble to be this low and close\r\n to the hills, the sioux city airport was to the south several\r\n miles, beyond the missouri river. as it got closer i braced\r\n myself for the sound that was sure to be loud. as it went by\r\n there was nothing. i was close enough that had there been rivets\r\n and seams they would have easily been seen.\r\n\r\ni was about 400 feet above the river basin, it was about 600\r\n feet. in distance it was probably 1000 feet away (est), it was\r\n about the size of a large airliner, moving about thirty miles an\r\n hour. the last i saw it was when it passed over the missouri\r\n river towards the airport. rather than diving down it just\r\n lowered in a flat descent. the color was that of highly polished\r\n bare steel.\r\n\r\ntotal time of the incident was probably twenty or so minutes.\r\n later by the next night up to 8000 people from the riverside\r\n area reported an aircraft crashing near the missouri river. it\r\n was reported by the tower that gen curtis lemay s takeoff was\r\n held while the runway cleared. i understand it was flying\r\n approximately four feet off the ground as it cleared the\r\n runway.\r\n\r\ni have never reported this to anyone, have only told my wife and\r\n children about it. i did not nor do i want any publicity. my\r\n intent is to document and provide the information to someone\r\n that can add it to the list of sightings. i had the opportunity\r\n of witnessing this craft longer than any other person. \r\n\r\nin looking at coordinates and geomagnetic mapping techniques\r\n instrumentation i find it would be similar to our remote\r\n instrumentation of other terrain. \r\n\r\ni have searched and watched for any other sightings of similar\r\n shaped object, so far i have seen none. i wanted to report this\r\n before my memory fades, i am 67 years old, a retired electrical\r\n engineer, and a naval aviation electronics tecnician and flight\r\n crewman veteran (1956 - 1960 vaw 11). i have designed very\r\n complex and sophisticated space science payloads for the naval\r\n research laboratory and the university of groningen among\r\n others. while an engineering student i worked at the u of iowa\r\n physics research center headed by dr james a. van allen.\r\n\r\none other strange incident. several years ago at 12:05 am an\r\n intense bright light (similar color to a standard flourescent\r\n light) lit our bedroom brighter than daylight and lasting for\r\n several seconds. reports the next day had others reporting a\r\n bright light traveling north to south over tampa bay waking\r\n people on both sides of the bay (approximately 17 miles wide).\r\n\r\ni would appreciate feedback on either of the incidents should you\r\n have any. \r\n
