multiple ufo sighting witnessed by myself,\r\n my girlfriend and a friend of ours mid-afternoon saturday 26th\r\n aug 2002. conditions were very bright and clear.\r\n\r\nwe were all out on our roof garden enjoying the great weather and\r\n my girlfriend, who was lying on her back sunbathing, suddenly\r\n pointed straight up and said \"whats that up there?\" \r\n\r\nat first my friend and i couldnt really see anything obvious and\r\n this wasnt helped by the brightness of the sky or the fact that\r\n we didnt know what we were looking for. \r\nhowever within a few seconds of scanning the area my partner was\r\n indicating, we managed to spot what had captured her attention.\r\n\r\nit appeared to be a small shiny silvery-white sphere, just\r\n hanging there above us - it was impossible really to say if they\r\n were very small or very high, but they were probably at least a\r\n few thousand feet high.\r\n\r\nwithin a few seconds of spotting this sphere i noticed another\r\n one, and then another and then more. they were all in the same\r\n area of the sky and i think there were between 7-9 altogether,\r\n either just hanging there or moving very slowly.\r\n\r\nat first we thought they might be birds but their movement was\r\n not consistent with this idea, no circling or anything - just\r\n stationary or drifting very slowly.\r\n\r\nas we stood watching them, over a period of 4-5 mins they\r\n gradually moved into a  v  formation directly above us and\r\n stayed stationary in this position for several minutes - we\r\n realised then for sure that they couldnt have been balloons\r\n either and this was something out of the ordinary. we became\r\n quite excited at this point and i ran indoors to get my camera\r\n and our friend dashed of to his car to get his binoculars.\r\n\r\nhowever, by the time we got back the spheres had begun to break\r\n formation and drift apart. looking through the binoculars didnt\r\n show any further detail,  but we could definitely see that they\r\n were solid objects.\r\n\r\ni put my 70-210mm telephoto lens on my slr and snapped off a few\r\n pictures, one at around 70mm showing 3 of the spheres in the\r\n frame and another at 210mm showing just one. i have enclosed\r\n scans of the prints. \r\n\r\nupon enlarging the scan of the 210mm zoomed picture a little more\r\n detail became evident, showing in fact the object is not a\r\n sphere but more teardrop or shell shaped. it also seems to show\r\n a small trail or maybe a puff of gas venting  ? \r\n\r\nanyway, as we continued watching they all just moved off very\r\n slowly in different directions until they were out of sight. i d\r\n say the total duration of the sighting was approx 10-15 mins.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately after later finishing off the roll of film i\r\n mislaid it and it didnt turn up again until a few weeks ago,\r\n which is why this report is so overdue.\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n\r\n- eric\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n

friday, feb\r\n 3rd(?). it was a bright white object, probably bigger than a jet\r\n but farther away.\r\nthe reason why i looked outside in the first place, was because\r\n there were jets (military aircraft) loud, outside, at\r\n approxamitely 9:30...10:00 pm. it is a weird time for jets in\r\n colorado springs! \r\nso i looked out the window to see them.\r\nat first, i didn t think anything of the round, white object. i\r\n don t know why! but i followed it from my window for five\r\n minutes or so. i told my husband to look ouside, but he said i\r\n was crazy. he wouldn t have been a great witness anyway, since\r\n he had had a few beers. but i do not drink.\r\ni decided to go outside to further track it--it was moving from\r\n the west over the mountains, to the southeast, when it stopped\r\n around the star that i believe is polaris. it did some strange\r\n manuevers, a weird centricity. there was only one.\r\nit seemed to move foward, then back, circle around polaris,\r\n especially to the left of the star.\r\ni went back in because it was cold, to get some gloves.\r\nwhen i went back outside, it was still there. i watched it for\r\n another five minutes.\r\nthe white object was not chased by the jets apparently, because\r\n they were gone before i had even gone back in for gloves. the\r\n sky was clear in the south east, but a little whispy in the\r\n north and north west--typical colorado weather.\r\nthere was no noise. but it moved really fast, it seemed, and did\r\n manuevers like jets and helicopters cannot do! \r\ni went in for cigarette, and when i came back, it seemed to be\r\n somehow following polaris, directly in front of it. i could\r\n still see it, however, when it moved slightly from left to\r\n right.\r\ni don t follow this stuff (until now) but i happened to have an\r\n old map of the sky. i m pretty sure it was polaris.\r\nit seemed to zoom away, toward the star. after staring at it, to\r\n see if it returned, or was just a figment, i noticed that the\r\n stars blink and twinkle, as do airplanes somewhat. this object\r\n did not. it remained a constant white glow the whole time.\r\nthe little dipper (i m somewhat sure) was above it, and to the\r\n right. i live on the east side, by powers, near peterson afb.\r\ni watched airplanes after that, to get a better idea of how large\r\n it was. it was farther away than an airplane. i really cannot\r\n say just how big it was. \r\nit really seemed to be just a figment, as i cannot wrap my brain\r\n around something so strange.\r\ni am 29, a stay-at-home mother, with a bachelors in art. \r\ni would really be interested in hearing from you, or anyone else\r\n who may have seen this cool sighting--because i really cannot\r\n believe that i actually saw something like this! \r\nmy husband says he s going to send me to cedar springs (he s\r\n joking) because i came back in with the whitest face, i m sure!\r\n my jaw was almost to my chest!\r\ni m only the teeniest

a ufo sighting i had\r\n while i was in the marine corps. it was either late 1996 or\r\n early 1997, my infantry unit was training at the pohakuloa\r\n training area. my master sergeant, msgt. tuia typically had a\r\n hard time sleeping and would wake me up around 3-4am to drive\r\n him around so he could get some extra sleep. \r\n\r\none night, i was driving with him asleep in the passenger seat.\r\n since it was a training area, i had to drive with an/pvs-7 night\r\n vision goggles. on a remote road with no other traffic, i was\r\n looking at the night=92s sky and that is when i saw the object.\r\n between mauna kea and mauna loa an object appeared and from left\r\n to right the object moved at an amazing rate and then stopped,\r\n hovered and moved again. the movements that followed were\r\n erratic and darted back and forth across the sky. all of the\r\n movement took place between the sky visible between the\r\n mountains and then took off into the sky, out of sight. i could\r\n draw an approximate path of flight. the movements were very\r\n exact, i liken it to moving a pointer on a pc. if you move the\r\n pointer quickly from left to right and then in various\r\n directions all in straight lines. you would see abrupt stops and\r\n quick acceleration.\r\n\r\nthe object size in relation to the stars could best be described\r\n in the following fashion. if the typical star is about the\r\n diameter of a pin, this object was much brighter and would have\r\n been about three pins. night vision goggles typically produce\r\n light noise. the pixels flash and pop but this object was\r\n definitely not a standard in the equipment. i was also very\r\n awake when this happened and in fact was quite bored so this\r\n took me by surprise.\r\n\r\nthe exclamation point to this event happened right after it\r\n happened. after seeing this, i immediately pulled the hummer to\r\n the side of the road. i reacted so quickly that it woke msgt.\r\n tuia. i was yelling, =93holy s#!@=94 over and over again and got out\r\n of my vehicle to look around for the object. msgt. tuia kept\r\n asking, =93what in the hell is wrong with you?=94  and without\r\n thinking, i told him that i had just seen a ufo. he told me that\r\n he saw tons of them when he was in vietnam and to get back in\r\n the vehicle and drive. i couldn=92t believe that he was so\r\n nonchalant about the event. he acted like it was old news.\r\n regardless, i knew what i saw and have never forgotten it.\r\n \r\n

child, my husband was\r\n outside with our 3 year son. we had been moving into our new\r\n home. my husband was reaching down into the cab of our truck to\r\n retrieve a box when he said it lit up like someone had turned \r\n large flashlight on. when he turned around, he saw a circular\r\n saucer right above tree level almost directly above him. he said\r\n it had square \"ice cube\" type lights circling around it, but no\r\n sound. he immediately ran inside and got me. when we both went\r\n outside, the ufo had moved to the southern sky, and was now a\r\n bright light about the size of a dime in the sky. no more than\r\n 20 seconds could have passed between him running into the house\r\n to get me and us getting outside. as we watched the object, it\r\n appeared to change shape, but i suspect this was because it was\r\n also changing colors, going from white to light blue, to orange\r\n and back. something appeared to drop off of the ufo and trail to\r\n the ground. it was reddish in appearance. during all of this, i\r\n had jumped on top of the cab of the truck. while watching this\r\n ufo, i sensed something above and looked up to see another ufo\r\n directly overhead. it was much higher than tree level, but low\r\n enough to appear massive, about the size of a battleship. it\r\n blocked the lights from the sky, so i could easily make out its\r\n shape, which was like a diamond. it had three large amber lights\r\n (shaped in triangular formation) on the bottom. it was moving\r\n along at a fair rate of speed, but i heard no sound from it. it\r\n continued to coast along going towards boulder, colorado. i\r\n watched it till i could no longer see it. the other ufo we had\r\n initially seen also took off towards boulder, colorado at a very\r\n rapid speed. it hung over the area of boulder for about a\r\n minute, then shot straight up and disappeared. we were not the\r\n only people to see this. neighbors of ours had just arrived home\r\n and also witnessed this. about 10 minutes after these sightings\r\n we heard helicopters and jets around our area. i could not say\r\n if these were military, but it was unusualfor the area. we

told by our father, who was in to\r\n air force,, to look up to the sky,, when we were just little\r\n kids,, so we did,, and my dad, knowing about satalites, and\r\n falling stars, pointed these things out to us boys,, and we were\r\n fastenated by looking up to the night sky,, and identifying\r\n these objects, ,, he then worked for howard hughes aircraft,\r\n then locheed, then martin marieta, worked on the 2nd spacecraft\r\n that went to mars,, the vicking 2, my father went on to i.B.M,\r\n and finally retired from i.B.M. it was my fathers having us boys\r\n looking up into the night sky that led me to the sighting, that\r\n i wish i did nt ever see,, myself and my brother studyed the\r\n night sky during the early 1970 s colorado sky,,and we saw a lot\r\n of things we had never seen before, even though we had stuydied\r\n the skys back in california, and even out in the desert. but\r\n here in the mountains of colorado, we began seeing all sorts of\r\n things,, much more than the usual narural things like falling\r\n stars, and things like satalites, were much more obvious than in\r\n the city, but i remember this very clearly, i was waching a very\r\n distant,, dim pin point type of light,, moving across the sky,\r\n at a very slow, steady speed, and i said to my brother,\" there s\r\n another satalite\" i am not sure if my brother ever even found\r\n this one,, it was allways very hard,, because of the vastness of\r\n the sky,, for either one of us to be able to find what each\r\n other were looking at,, sometimes, we would find the moving\r\n object

we have never seen anything\r\n else since.\r\n\r\n190 description: it was,, i believe, the summer of 1973,, my\r\n brother and i,, were born in california, my brother was born in\r\n 1959,,, i was born in 1060. we were told by our father, who was\r\n in the air force,, to look up to the sky,, when we were just\r\n little kids,, so we did,, and my dad, knowing about satalites,\r\n and falling stars, pointed these things out to us boys,, and we\r\n were fastenated by looking up to the night sky,, and identifying\r\n these objects, ,, he then worked for howard hughes aircraft,\r\n then locheed, then martin marieta, worked on the 2nd spacecraft\r\n that went to mars,, the vicking 2, my father went on to i.B.M,\r\n and finally retired from i.B.M. it was my fathers having us boys\r\n looking up into the night sky that led me to the sighting, that\r\n i wish i did nt ever see,, myself and my brother studyed the\r\n night sky during the early 1970 s colorado sky,,and we saw a lot\r\n of things we had never seen before, even though we had stuydied\r\n the skys back in california, and even out in the desert. but\r\n here in the mountains of colorado, we began seeing all sorts of\r\n things,, much more than the usual narural things like falling\r\n stars, and things like satalites, were much more obvious than in\r\n the city, but i remember this very clearly, i was waching a very\r\n distant,, dim pin point type of light,, moving across the sky,\r\n at a very slow, steady speed, and i said to my brother,\" there s\r\n another satalite\" i am not sure if my brother ever even found\r\n this one,, it was allways very hard,, because of the vastness of\r\n the sky,, for either one of us to be able to find what each\r\n other were looking at,, sometimes, we would find the moving\r\n object that the other was looking at, sometimes,, not. this was\r\n the 1st one i saw,, that blew me away.. it was just a very\r\n distant piont of light, i mean, way up there, i thought it was a\r\n satalight, but it just changed direction, sharply,, like off\r\n maybe 40 degrees, no speed change, it was way ,, i mean way up\r\n there, moving very slowly across the

in the sky for i do like to do a little star gazing when i am out that late.  but what i saw wasnt any star at all.\r\nas i looked oover towards the mountains, that are so prevelent here, and are close to the ft hucachuca military base, i noticed some green, red and blue lights traveling around in no particular order.  i thought that maybe it was a plane coming in for landing at the military base, but it wasnt doing such a thing. i guess the best way that i could descrbie it is like a ball of fire but with different colors, and the colors were changing constantly from red, green, blue .  \r\nit kind of shocked me, cuz it was something that i have never seeen before, so i just stood there watching these obljects. i wanted to go around the apt bld and get my camera but i was just frozen there just watching it.\r\none of the color balls, headed towards me, and as it came closer, it was high in the sky, but there was no noise and it was traveling at a very low speed. at one point i thought and felt like i could just reach out and touch it, but it was a little high up. around this time, it was above me, but was around tree height.  my dog was starting to growl but she didnt bark. she was just as stunned as i was.  i saw this colored ball stop, and then it turned around slowly and headed back to where the others were and then they just shot up in the air.\r\ni didnt feel scared, just kind of trying to believe what i was seeing.   i have heard rumors around town, that there are some really strange aircraft flying into the base at night, and things that one doesnt want to see.\r\nso i am really not too what i saw, but i know that i have never seen anything like it.\r\ni am a little startled now that i have thought about it, and i dont want people to think i am off my rocker, but i know what i saw.\r\nwhen i came back in the house, i just kind of sat down in my chair, trying to make sense of the sighting.  it did take me a while to calm down, and go to bed. but now that i think about it, my dog growled for a long time after that, and she was staying right near me, the whole night. \r\nthis morning, when i went ot take her outside both her and i were a little hestiate cuz i really wasnt sure if it was still out there or not. but it wasnt.","distance":"101-500

recept is time stamped 2:45:28 am . the cashier and i spoke for a few minutes about gemstones , here son had given her a nice ring with an oval cabuchon of cherry amber , i'm a collector . i started walking home via chapel street . \r\n\r\ni had gotten to the top of the rise , near the intersection of north state street , when something caught my attention . i suddenly noticed that a star was not a star . it hovered silently and was too low on the horizon , at about the height of a regular jetliner . it strobed red and green , then blue , red and green , then blue repeatedly , it seemed to be a repetitive pattern . it hovered . jetliners do not have blue strobes and do not hover and do generate quite a bit of noise . \r\n\r\nthen it headed south , i was not aware of any noise . it came to a stop , hovered briefly , performed a very tight \"u-turn\" and returned to its' original position north by north west over the northern end of concord .\r\n\r\nit seemed much larger than a jetliner as it continued to hover at its' original position . it seemed to be circular in shape with a domed or curved top and bottom . it had no wings , no tail assembly , nothing one would associate with aircraft .\r\n\r\ni arrived back home at 3:06 am and it was still hovering in its' original position . i tried to call \"the concord monitor\" newsroom , there was no one at that hour , however , i did leave a message .\r\n\r\ni then remembered that i had to take out the trash ; it was still there hovering in its' original position strobing red and green then blue . \r\n\r\ni still heard no noise , yet i could hear the traffic on the interstate which is down the hill . usually one ignores that constant drone of trucks and vehicles , one just automatically tunes them out , that's most probably a trick one learns subconsciously , that traffic noise was noticeable as i was probably listening for noise from that ufo and it generated no noise .    \r\n\r\ni am aware that a number of years ago there were a number of \"sightings\" here in new hampshire , i was not aware that these were continuing .\r\n\r\ni really don't know how i feel about this . at the moment i realised that this was an ufo , i did feel a certain sense of excitement , one of those rare \"eureka !!\" moments . but , quite frankly , reports of this nature are rather commonplace and my \"sighting\" and $ 1.50 will still get me a cup of coffee . i don't mean to sound blassee , but i am still the exact same person i was when i left to pick up some packs of smokes . \r\n\r\ni will report this to bass & gregg's offices tomorrow , not that there is anything they can do about an ufo that has probably returned to its' place of origin . i can't for the life of me imagine why they would be interested on the crazy people on this planet in the first place . really , given a choice , there must be must nicer vacation spots in the cosmos !!!!!\r\n\r\nyours truly,\r\nbrian napier \r\n\r\nps ..... i have

reporter. it was my habit to walk late at night in the school yard for exercise. often i walked until well after midnight. i saw this same formation of interstellar objects twice a year apart, going in opposite directions each time, but across the same stretch of space. on both occasions, it was bitterly cold and the night sky was perfectly clear. no clouds or moisture in the air. i could see far into space. i was also in the habit of watching the stars, just for enjoyment. on both cccasions, i saw a formation of white dots, almost identical to the size and shape of stars, moving rapidly through the star field. this group of objects was not in our atmosphere. it, or they, moved from one side of the horizon to the other side in less than two seconds. the formation of starships, as i call them, seemed to \"float\" or \"skip\" from side to side ever so slightly. it was the same formation a year later. the first time the formation was headed from the south-southeast to the north-northwest. it was headed south-southeast from the north-northwest the following year. there is absolutely no doubt what i saw. i have never seen a \"flying saucer\" in the earth's atmosphere. i had begun to think they were someone's imagination. not until i saw these interstellar vehicles did i realize the possibility of ufo's might actually be real. i told my story to a number of friends. they listened as though i was talking in a foreign language. they politely said...Okay and changed subjects. i covered stanton friedman while a college newspaperreporter, probably in 1971 or 1972. mr. friedman spoke at the university of wisconsin stevens point. he probably won't remember me. in any case, i haven't said anything about the two sightings publicly and very little privately for fear of being called a nut. given the reception i received when i mentioned it to friends, i felt it was best to keep a secret. the sightings probably occurred in the late  1980's or early 1990's. i felt i was quite fortunate to see this. i now laugh when i hear people debunk ufo's. i now know, without any doubt, that a much more advanced civilization exists somewhere in the universe, a civililzation capable of the same type of interstellar travel we saw in the fictional star trek series.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
