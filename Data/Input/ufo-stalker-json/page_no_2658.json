about 720am,iheard what i thought was an airplane taking off from jfk intl i live nearjfk,but the sound only lasted 3 seconds,so i thought that was strange,but didntthink much about it,then about 4 seconds after i heard the sound stop,i say 4objects flying in the sky,they were a little of in the distance,not too far atall,they were closer to where i was than the airplanes are when they takeoff,and they were somewhat low to the ground. what made me notice the objectswas their shine,when the first appeared the sun was just glistening off ofthem,so they look like silver balloons,they were flying together pretty slow,andat the same exact speed,and thats what i thought they were at first,balloons.Soi searched to see if i could see a balloon string that held them together soclose,but within 1 secong of that search,i already saw that there was no stringat all,my heart started to race a bit,all of this happened within 4 seconds ofthem appearing to my vision.Then right after that 4 second time periodfinished,the crafts started to fly in a twisty, and varied orbit aroundeachother,they cut eachother off as they orbited,thats when my heart began toreally pump,they did all of this flying foward at their slow pace,on a steadyhorizontal path.They continued to orbit around eachother for about 4seconds,then they all flew into a formation, the formation was a slantedvertical formation,they were still flying foward slowly,1 under the other.Theyflew like that for 2 seconds,then they went right back to the cut off,twistyorbit around eachother,and by that time they were closer than they were whenthey had appeared,but still flying away,and still flying along the samehorizontal path.This was when i could better see their backs,and i made out whati had thought to be

am submitting this report from the third night of our sightings.  iviewed them the 1st night alone discovered when i went out on the backdeck for a smoke at 2355 cst.  my eyes were immediately drawn to the northsky, as a vessel larger than an airplane flew n to s - entire horizon inabout 10 seconds.  i then saw a star-like object in the ne sky that wasflying in broken patterns, small circles, similar to a small bug.  it flickeredout after 6 minutes of movement.The next night i viewed the exact same thing with a flight attendant aswitness, at 2255.  she confirmed the object flying n to s was not an airplane,or a satellite.The next 2 nights were cloudy.Night 3 of viewing july 2304 was done from a field outside saskatoon,where we discovered these same objects flying all over the sky.  we sawa total of 12 in the skies over a 2 hour period.  we viewed these objectsthrough binoculars, we could clearly see they are an artificial light, avery intense halogenflourescent white, and much lower than the stars,even though they could pass as stars if they didnt move around so much.I viewed them with witness 3 on july 2404, from 2230 - 0030.  there arrearsto be 2 of the same, larger objects that travel to a position approx. at a 70and 80 degree angle.  they remain constant, hovering only slightly.  some of thesmaller objects fly in the vicinity of the larger objects, and very occasionallyflash a pink or white light as they go by.  with binoculars, the 2 largerobjects appear to be emanating light from one side, appearing smooth on thatside.  the other side of the objects appears jagged and almost transluscent.The smaller objects appear cylindrical and somewhat transparent.We have seen them the last 2 nights as well.  i viewed them tonite... there issome low cloud

commented that he was taking a month and a halfoff, because otherwise he would lose money.When i first called the witness on 2-9-03, he said he had seen a light in thesky, and he felt energetics from it.  the witness said he had read davidmorehouse, and that he was interested in communicating with ets.  he also felthe had received a message that two other people had seen the object and that heshould report it, so he did.  he may have received the impression that therewere two witnesses in the two airplanes that he thought passed near the object. there is no way for me to judge how close the two planes passed to the object,and we received no other reports for that date.  in his attempts to report thisobject, he called the university of minnesota.  he also called the [minneapolis]planetarium but got no answer.  he didnt want to fill out a form, but after isaid i would fill out the form with his answers, he agreed to review and signit.No on-site investigation was carried out.  the witness lives in clinton, ohio. at the time of the sighting, the witness was driving a truck on interstate 94heading west.  initially he said he was near st. paul, minnesota.  he said hewas between mile 47 and 52.  under later questioning he seemed to be saying thathe was 50 miles east of the intersection of 494/694, which would place him inwisconsin.  the witness was very difficult to question, going off on tangents. but he signed the form 1, which said he was in washington county near st. paul. he said he was tired when he saw the object.  it was near the end of his shift,which had started when he left ohio.  he had been driving for 11 hours, andnoted his sighting in his truck log.  at the time he saw the object, he wasntthinking of ets, he said.  he then commented that ets have enough power to doanything that they want to, to you.  but, he said, the greys are trying tohelp us heal ourselves.  he said he was aware of satellites that monitorthoughts for the government.He is a student of the martial arts and can feel chi (chinese term for a formof mental energy, i believe) and he seemed to be saying that he felt a similarenergy from the ufo.  he said that they use human energy to make their craftappear.  he said the energy from the ufo is still ingrained in his head, thatthe ets can project energy.  then he seemed to perhaps slip into a state like atrance and he said, the craft is going black; can see the craft is white now there is antimatter around the craft  no longer in the truck  i did notfollow up this strange interlude, which could suggest that he was abducted,because he then described (presumably) the motions of the ufo:  it went higher,to the right [so it was] straight ahead at a 30o or 40 o elevation .  when lastseen it was at a 60 o or 70 o elevation.  the ufo went between two airplanes butthere was no blockage of view.  the shape was that of two balls or spheres, onesmaller than the other, put together (partially coalesced), smaller than amarble at arms length, perhaps aspirin size, perhaps the size of amuzzle-loader ball.  color was clear white with a tinge of blue.  he said thatthe reptilians have cloaked vessels (i.E., invisible).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":3158,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.9627067,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-93.1084189,"occurred":1041242400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1041242400000,"summary":"Truck

see if it was maybe a plane, and ithen i could explain what i saw but i was not able to view anything in the sky.Another wierd aspect is the direction in which it was traveling, it traveledfrom east

anything ive ever seen - 2or 3 seconds, at most.5. what i saw of it consisted of three dim rather than blinding or bright whitelights that were cool in character, like florescent lights rather thanincandescent, arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle.  the lights had kindof a poached-egg appearance, in that the center of each circular light wasslightly different in brilliance than the rest of the cirle.  i saw it as itpassed from the northwest, directly overhead, and moved toward the southwest.  icould not make out a surface or structure between the lights, but they did notmove in position with respect to one another, so they gave the appearance ofbeing parts of a single structure.  the object required only 2 or 3 seconds atmost to traverse an arc of about 45 degrees of open,

it was a beautiful, clear, moonless night. as i lookedtoward the north i saw a string of lights-about the brightness of a mediumstar-heading toward me, moving south. at first i thought it might be a string ofballoons reflecting street lights broken loose from somewhere, but almostimmediately i realized that these were not rising, but moving in a straight linetoward me.When i first spotted the lights, they were about 200 yards north andabout 200 feet high. it was not directly overhead but over the street in frontof my mothers house, app.60 ft. in front of where i was standing. it was movingabout the same speed as a car would , app. 15-20 mph. it was a string of about10 lights, evenly spaced app. 10-15 ft. apart. just as it was almost to me, 3 or4 lights in the center of the string went out. as it passed , i noticed thatthere was absolutely no sound, as it is very quiet where my mother lives.Immediately after it passed where i was standing, the lights came back on again.It proceeded south and i watched it for about another 20-25 seconds, about aquarter mile, and was just going to run to my car to follow it, when instantlyall lights vanished as if someone had hit the off switch. i stared in thedirection it had been heading, but saw nothing more. it was such a dark night, inever did see any shape, but thought that a cylinder or cigar shape wouldprobably be the most likely.                    as soon as i realized i was mostlikely looking at a ufo, i felt almost shocked. in fact i remember my jawdropping about the time it was directly over me. immediately after i ran insideand called several of my friends and family to tell them what i saw. at thistime i was a long haul truck driver i now own a business here on maui and hadbeen experiencing an interesting nighttime phenomena for 11 years. since 1987when i was a taxi driver, i noticed that many streetlights went out immediatelyas i was passing them, never in front or behind me. some nights this happened7-8 times. it never mattered what vehicle i was driving, or how many cars infront or back of me there were. i often wonder if that had any connection to thelights going out when it passed by me. being a truck driver, i saw many strangethings, but nothing has ever come close to what i saw that night that i cantexplain.Every night when i look at the stars, i still look for a string of
