were sitting on my porch in hopewell va.. which at that    time i lived behind hardees off of miles ave. well, while we were sitting    there we noticed  a bright white light in the sky. so, we didnt really think    much of it. we just thought it was probly a search and rescue light from a    police helicopter because, it was moving slowly across the sky like a    helicopter would. about a min. goes by and then we were thinking maybe its    headlights on a plane but, the plane was travling pretty slow. about another    min. goes by then, we noticed something really odd as, it was getting    closer. the white light seemed to give off a shine to the ships underbelly.    it was then when we noticed that the ship was not a helicopter or a plane.    it was round just like a saucer. then the ship stoped. then white light on    the bottom of the ship started to change colors. from a white light to blue    ,then red, then white again. the light was changin these 3 colors and they    were picking up speed. then from a dead standstill the the ship darted off    in an up rightward slanted postion in the sky. it was one of the most    amazing things i have even seen in my life. the ship was gone in the blink    of an eye..Literally. my friend and i were in shock by what we had seen. we    discussed the event and realized we had just seen a flying saucer. it was a    few yr.S later that i realized somthing really even more odd about the whole    event. 1st 0ff the ship looked terran made man made. 2nd the lights were    changing to red, white, and blue. just like you would see as if an airplane    was flying through the sky at night. if you ask me in my opinion it was not    alien but, the us airforce and that when the ship darted off it left at,    what appeard to be some form of light travel or close to it. i would just be    happy to find out wether or not any airports in the surronding area had seen    anything on radar or not. if anyone feels free to investigate this for me i    would be really, really gratefull thank you for letting me get this off of    my chest. p.S. synful2u@hotmail.Com is my e-mail address for any questions    or ans","distance":"501

northwest and happened to notice a circular objectfar above the small plane. it seemed to be larger or the same size as the smallplane, but i forget really. it appeared, at first thought, to be a hot airballoon, that was dull gray or dull silver, without the basket at the bottom. it appeared to be dime sized in the sky using your extended arm technique.  iasked my wife if she thought it was unusual, she said yes. im a privateinvestigator specializing in video surveillance on land, since 1992, but i haveno sky viewing experience.I got my digital camera within 30 seconds and was videotaping. my first frame isthe largest, after that, things are smaller. the video lasts for approx. 10minutes, i guess. my first frame is bright whitish-silver, which seemed like thesun reflecting off the ufo.   after about 20 minutes, 2 planes, several minutesapart, came from the nw, passing under the ufos, by my house and circled backtoward the nw and out of view.  the planes were detected as planes very quicklyby my camera.  the circular balls would get larger when zoomed in, but neverappeared anything like the planes.  there was not trail to the planes. the ufosvideotaped, were much larger and closer, when i first saw them without thecamera and the sun did not seem to be reflecting off the object.When i videotaped, they were no longer close.  i knew i couldnt tell how largethey really were or how far away. i tried to put telephone lines in theforeground for comparison, hoping that someone could figure out size anddistance and movement from my position and the position of the wires, andfactoring in that i was apparently swaying while recording.I was constantly trying to zoom in on them, but most times they disappeared uponzoom and the outline of a classical sauser spaceship, much larger than the ballwas videotaped.  this was probably just a  trick of light, i know.  since i wasconstantly zooming, i cant swear that the objects were moving or not.  my wifesays they moved from a triangle to a straight line and back again.  the photos ihave, were made by inputing the digital camera into a capture card on mycomputer and saving the film to an avi at 6 frames

nobody around at that time of the morning people were still sleeping. i went to the internet and looked up ufo and found this web page.Before this i didnt believe in ufos and im having a hard time

it was about the size of a car headlight, but i couldnt judge how faraway it was. i watched until it disappeared behind some trees. since lake huronwas directly north, about 1 mile from our house, i dont know if it disappearedover land or water. i was convinced at the time that it was an extraterrestrialcraft, but since then have been telling myself it couldnt have been, because idnever heard of

in the quietvillage subdivision on the eastern end of nevada street just below helmanelementary school in ashland, oregon.  since this event occurred in the daysbefore the internet, i did not know how to report it, though i tried, and hadvery little information available to me about ufo sightings and reports.  mymemory of the event is somewhat sketchy now, with regard to date and time.  i amnot sketchy about what i saw.Ashland is a small town, with a population around 15,000 back then.  we were inthe ne area of town.  the two friends and i were teenagers at the time 17-19years old.  as we left the house heading to our car, one of the two friends andi glimpsed a brilliant blue ball of light traveling across the sky above us inthe distance to the east, low enough that it was below the horizon line of themountains.  we both saw it because i wasnt looking down at that moment andcalled out when i glimpsed it, and one friend looked in the correct directionwhile the other did not.  the ball itself was brilliant, even at that time ofday during the clear daylight.  at arms length, its size was about that of apenny, and it was between us and the mountain range, perhaps a mile away orless, but maybe a little more.  even at that time, i wasnt really sure exactlywhere it was in the sky with reference to us, because of the nature of its form,i guess.  it seemed close and low.  not far away like a plane in the sky - evena small one flying low - but also not so near as to worry us. it was travelingsw at a downward and slightly-arced angle, and at a moderate speed not ashooting star speed, not that of an airplane, either - slower, but not such thati perceived its movement as slow, either.  it was a moderate speed at first, andabout the time that it registered to me what i was seeing something not likeanything id seen or heard about as fact ever before, it immediately shot up atabout a 65-degree angle still sw very quickly - at a very high rate of speed -and disappeared from my view.  i remember being confused as to whether my viewof it was obscured behind a very large tree in the yard, or  whether the object93blinked out94 just before it passed behind the tree.  it didn92t reemerge in my view on the other side of the tree.The friend who saw stopped in amazement with me.  we both were incredulous andtrying to understand with each other what we92d seen, and the

nothing.  then i observed a low magnitudeobject  at that very point and then i noticed it moving south from that spot.I guesstimated that i was observing a satellite passing over head,
