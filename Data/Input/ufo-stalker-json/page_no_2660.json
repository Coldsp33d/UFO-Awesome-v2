enough to see through the light cloud cover. thebrilliance of the light was equal to that of a bright star but it was unlike astar in that it was steady and unblinkinguntwinkling more like a planet.

cross the sky. i looked for strobinglights or redwhite flashing lights that are usually noticed on a plane but i didnot see any. i lost sight of the object when it flew over denser cloud cover andi

my friend out to come look at this... he had no idea what it was either.We were just curious. so we were both out there when we called for his olderbrother to come out... he just blamed it on the government and went back insideafter getting a glance at it. this vertical line in the sky kind of seemed to begetting smaller as time passed... the object stayed in the exact same place. thesky was pretty blue just a few cloud formations here and there. then we bothnoticed a cloud passed the object. the object was obviously much higher than thecloud... but the whiteness of this object was so intense you could still clearlysee it through the clouds.. eventually the cloud moved and dissappeared andthats when the object started turning into a dot. the dot sat there and anothercloud formation

theyemerged from the tree line -- in a se absolutely straight as an arrow formation. all three visibly equidistant to each other in formation and speed, their tailsstraight and narrow like pencil lines drawn behind them and not dissipating. weestimate the tails to be at least two to three fingers span.  the middle objectshead was brighter and larger than the two others each flanking the larger oneand a bit back.  overall altitude and speed indeterminate but we were surprisedto see them emerge from the tree line once we found a clear area.  we lost sightof them again as they passed into

was what wethought a very large and bright star. it was twinkling very fast compared toother stars in the sky. it looked as though it was slightly moving. we figuredthat our eyes where not focusing and that was causing it to appear to be moving.We then took our focus off that one bigger star and was looking west of thereand there were star like objects that appeared to be fading in and out. twospecifically that were obvious. approximately 30 minutes later i again lookedback to the original star that was so bright and it had moved significantly tothe east of were it was originally. when i first saw the light i had my headrested upwards hanging outside the car door to see it and it was west of myposition. it now was in view of my sitting up straight and looking to my rightout the window more east of our vehicle.  i sensed a feeling of fear because itwas so evident that this star like object had moved. over the next hour we bothfocused our attention to this one star like object. it made random movements andwas blinking different colors. the color we were clear about were white, greenand red. it mainly stayed white but did randomly flash in a non specificpattern. it did however seem to blink spastically when an airplane had gone by,almost like it was trying to mimic the red blinking lights we see on air planes.It also appeared to have become bigger then when we originally saw it. we arenot sure if it came closer to our view or whatnot. it also seemed to hover in azig zag motion but very slightly. it would go from left to right or up a littleand then back down. as time went on it was eventually making its way furthereast and downward towards the treeline. we hear no noise, except noticed a dogbarking coming from the direction of the trees.  the last 5 minutes in our viewseemed to have the most significant motion as it moved downward past thetreeline and out of view pretty fast. we got out of the car to see if we couldstill see it. it was just lower than the tree

assignment for the date in questionwas to observe the local high school as some students, late in the evening, havevandalized the school-pranks etc. i was given a pair of night-vision equipmentfor darkness observation. these were not night-vision goggles but rather like apair of binoculars. while sitting in my patrol car at one point, i was lookingat the stars through these.  if you are familiar with night-vision equipment itaccentuates any light and casts a rather  greenish  hue to the area you areobserving.  when looking at a clear night sky the brightness amplification ofthe stars is amazing-even in our hazy part of the country. i would say that youcan see 3 times as many stars as with the naked eye.  in any event, at a pointwhere i was in the vehicle looking up out of the driver-side open window, iobserved a dark object moving from west to east, absolutely silently. although ionly observed it for a few sconds, i could clearly make out its shape, althoughit is hard to describe verbally. i will try this dark shape had 90 degree anglesexclusively i.E., take an envelope business size layed on a table and then placeanother similar sized envelope across it, and slightly forward of center,perpendicular to one another.  if this can be comprehended,this approximateswhat i observed.  there are several points i need to clarify for you.  thisnight vision equipment does not magnify as binoculars would so it cannot makesomething look larger. secondly, the passing of the object was absolutelysilent. thirdly, the object had no lights as the night vision would have shownthis clearly. remember the stars in the background were very bright through thenight-vision. as a footnote, i do not believe in extraterrestrials, alienabductions and the like.  i spent 25 years as a professional pilot, mainly incalifornia, and have never seen anything i could not immediately explain.Something to keep in mind about this though. since the night-vision equipmentwas not magnifying and the object appeared about the size of an aspirin held atarms length, i would say that in comparison of size the size of this objectwould approximate the size of say a dc-9 or b-737 at maybe 10,000 ft. altitude. i hope this info will be of assistance to you.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

whatsoever. just an orange diamond sitting up inthe sky. however the edges of the diamond were not sharp points but slightlyrounded so it had a smooth symmetrical shape to it. it wasnt small either so iknow other people had to see it. it was easily bigger than venus on its biggestnight. i submitted that it was the size of an aspirin held at arms length, butit may have been a little bigger. no matter the size it was the perfect orangediamond shape that attracted my attention to it, and how big it was in the sky.3 at first i thought it might be the afterburner of some type of jet aircraftbut with the diamond shape and the size i thought to myself it would have to bethe back end of the space shuttle to be that size as this looked more like 4engines inside a diamond configuration as compared to a fighter jet with justthe one exhaust port in the rear for the afterburner. remember, at the angle onthe horizon, this thing wasnt very high up in altitude at all. it wasnt like itwas directly over my head at 35,000 feet, it was on an angle on the horizon sothe altitude wasnt all that high i guess. also, no flame yellow indication, nojagged edges, no pulsing, just an deep orange diamond sitting in the sky. inever felt like it was an aircraft.4actually i was rather calm and was just watching it as there was no othertraffic on the road. i watched it for about 2 minutes straight, maybe more as icovered a couple of miles while observing the object. i still have a strongmental picture of everything that happened because i was able to watch itwithout distraction for so long. after the sighting i was a little blown awayand thought maybe i had witnessed a super nova since that what seemed to occurwhich ill get to in the next part.5the object was a deep orange colored diamond sitting in the sky. i watched itfor a couple of minutes and if it was moving at all i couldnt pick up on it as iwas traveling about 50 mph in my car. ok, so im watching this big orange diamondin the sky for several minutes the suddenly it pulses yellow and collapses intonothing...Poof...Gone. it was awesome. i say pulsed because there","distance":"Over One
