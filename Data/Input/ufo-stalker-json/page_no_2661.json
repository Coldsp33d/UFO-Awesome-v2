me,travelling east, and another object comming from the south of me, travellingnorth crafts 1, 2  3, respectfully.  all three objectscraft were very differentfrom each other.  the first craft from the northwest, travelling east was aboutdouble the size of a normal star, and about 2 to 3 times as bright.  the brightwhite light it gave off never waivered once, staying constant.  it wastravelling east, as i said, at an accelerated speed compared to the other twoobjects.  it appeared as if it had a definate route, but zigged and zagged atcertain intervals.  i guess you could say it sort of hopped to its destination. the other craft that was comming in from the northwest, craft 2 was on craft 1stail, but was a bit behind it.  almost like someone tailing a car, but notwanting to be seen.  craft 2 looked like a domestic craft, and had the standardblinking bluewhitish lights that most airliners, helicopters, etc.. have. craft3 was comming in from the south and heading in a path that would haveintersected craft 1s path.  the only light on craft 3 was a blinking deep redlight that occured every second or so.  compared to the other two craft it movedthe slowest.  craft 3 did get close to the ufo craft 1, but then changed coursesuddenly, and started heading west.  by the time craft 3 had reached rightoverhead of me, the other two craft were gone.  i heard no sounds during thiswhole experiance.  it looked like all three craft were pretty high up there,although i have no guess as to how high exactly.  maybe as high or a bit higherthan your every day jets go.  i observed this whole scenario in the time it tookme to smoke 1 cigarette. roughly 5 minutes.","distance":"Over One

watching television in bed.  at approximately 1030 pm, anelectrical storm began to develop.I was beginning to get sleepy and was considering turning the television off andgoing to sleep.  when there were two very rare bursts of static on thetelevision about a minute apart both at 1042, according to my tivo clock,  mydecision to go to sleep was made since i also feared that it might not be safeto leave the television on any longer.  i pressed the record button on my tivoso that i could finish watching the program at another time, very likely made aquick trip to the bathroom though im not sure, took off my glasses im very nearsighted, and got back into bed.I lay down on my left side facing the large panoramic windows in my bedroom. even with my very impaired vision, i immediately became aware of some lightsmoving in the sky in a way id never seen before.  i immediately sat up,retrieved my glasses from the night table, and put them on.  outside my windowand over rock creek park and a large residential building across the street,balls of light were moving rapidly and a bit jerkily in an oval-shapedcounterclockwise pattern.Its difficult to say exactly how many there were, but i believe that fourindividual lights  would be a good estimate.  after watching them for a stunnedminute or two, i got out of bed, and went next door to get my sister.  togetherwe stood at the window and watched this light show for approximately fiveminutes.  towards the end, the lights seemed to simply fade away through theheavy cloud cover until there was only one left.  that light eventually faded aswell.  i did not look at the clock again until after my sister left.  the timewas 1058.Though ive called them balls of light, they werent perfectly spherical.  therewas no hard edge to them, though i do believe there was a brighter intensity atthe center of each.  during the entire event, they kept moving in the samecircular pattern96 very, very rapidly and very, very erratically,  though pinpointing preciselywhere they were is tough, i recall that my sister and i both stooped a bit toget a full view of the show.  i usually have the blinds in my bedroom about 13of the way down.I forgot

my sister and my wife were at charing park in the craig henryneighbourhood of ottawa, ontario, canada. the time was 2352 on june 5th, 2004.We were observing jupiter with our telescope. jupiter was almost exactly duewest of us at the time. at the moment that the object appeared, none of us werelooking through the telescope, all three of us were looking directly at jupiterand the sky around it.The entire event lasted less than 2.5 seconds.Even though we immediately tried to talk through all of the details, later wehad a few discprepancies, which i will detail here.For measurement purposes i will refer to finger-widths and handspans when heldagainst the sky at arms length.The object appeared one finger-width below and a handspan to the left south ofjupiter. we all agreed that the object did not materialize but rather itaccumulated colour quickly. it streaked in going very fast, in a slight downwardarc, started out black invisible and gained a combined colour of redorange andbluegreen very quickly 0.5 seconds. it left no visible contrail. it flashed verybrightly three times during its progress. it seemed to slow down a little bit,and it seemed to angle downward a little more with each flash - though these twoeffects could have been illusory, resultant of the bright flashes. no debriscould be seen breaking off as it flashed. each flash lit up only a small portionof the sparse clouds below it, suggesting that it was a high-altitude object. ifit were at a lower altitude it should have lit a greater area of clouds. it didnot vanish with its last flash. rather, after the third flash it continued alittle bit farther before winking out. in total it travelled a little less thana handspan across the sky, vanishing two finger-widths below and onefinger-width left south of jupiter.I have already checked heavens-above.Com and i know that it was not an iridiumsatellite flare. it didnt do anything to suggest that it was intelligentlycontrolled. it moved much slower than a shooting star.Here are the discrepancies between wheat the three of us remember.1 i remember only redorange colours, they both remember bluegreen

west of me. i left at approximately 950p.M. to go get some pepsi and ciggiesfor me and dip for my husband. i got to the end of our driveway and was about tomake a left and saw a strange light formation in front of me. i thought it wasmaybe a motorized hang glider we have many in town or maybe a blimpthe formation of lights was diamond shaped.I turned around very quickly in adriveway and headed to 245 to get a clear view . i stopped at the stop sign andwas freaked out at this thing.I am an ex-military wife and upss hub is about 30miles north so i have heavy air traffic all night long. i am also familiar withall kinds of aircraft and helicopters just from living near army and air forcebases.I took off heading east towards bardstown when the object crossed right infront of the full moon. i locked up my brakes and slid off side of road andjumped out to look at this thing. i was amazed that people just drove on by. themoon was extremely bright and centered on the road. it was black and shaped likea square but with the top not perfectly square, kinda shorter than the bottom.Locally we have a meat company called fishers and it was shaped like their logo.It had a light on either side just like a plane and a light on top and one onbottom.As it started to move out of the moonlight i jumped in the car and tookoff eastbound to the handy mart about 1 mile away. i ran in and hollered comeoutside theres the weirdest thing ive ever seen out here.The female cashier anda guy and an older man came outside and at this point it was moving slowly tothe north and out of the moon light. they said it was the damndest thing theyhad ever sen and the older man said he was going home as it was headed towardshis residence to get a better look. as it was moving away the top and bottomlights looked as if a plane were banked in your face like one wing to the skythe other to the ground if that makes sense. it just kept drifting off and imade a purchase and continued to watch it on the way back home but it was almostgone by the time i got home. i ran in the front door and right out the back tosee if i could see it any more but we live in a depression and are surrounded byvery old tall trees. i do not know the folks who saw this with me and my viewingvantage was different than theirs hence my answers above.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

outside my residence.  the noise sounded similar tothe noise an inflated balloon makes when you stretch the opening tight andrestrict the airflow coming out of itkind of a high pitched squeal. after hearing the sound off and on for 15 or 20minutes i decided to step out to my back deck to investigate and have acigarette.  i lived in south ogden, on the bluff overlooking the town of uintahand hill afb beyond that.  my back yard was heavily forrested all the way downthe bluff. the deck i was standing on was a second story deck, covered with analuminum awning.  after lighting my cigarette, i leaned against the handrailfacing south and heard the sound again.  it was to my right west and soundedrelatively close.  i looked to the right and saw three lights that formed atriangle just above the treetops in a small valley that is just behind myneighbors house.  i then moved to the west side of the deck to get a betterlook.  the lights were partially obscured by the tree branches of the large treenext to the deck, but i had a relatively good view of the object.  at this timei would say the object was approximately 100 ft west of me, and maybe 10 or 20feet higher than myself.  i remember thinking to myself, what is that andrunning through all the different objects it could be in my mind.  nothingconventional fit.  i thought perhaps it was some sort of stealth helicopter,afterall i lived very close to hill afb and could actually see part of the basefrom my deck.  i ruled out the possibility of a helicopter due to the fact thatwhen the object would move forward or back it never tipped forward or back, butalways was perfectly horizontal.  the object was hovering and completely silentexcept for the intemittant sound i described before.  the sound would last forbetween about 5 and 15 seconds at a time,  and the object appeared to bedifficult to control during the time it was making the sound, turning left orright and raising and lowering slightly.  the object moved very slow under allconditions.  after a few minutes of it hovering over the treetops in the valleynext to me and making these sounds from time to time, it rose vertically toabout thirty feet higher than my position, turned clockwise and slowly moved ina southeasterly direction to a position just a few feet away and just above me.It no longer made any sound at all for the rest of the sighting. as itapproached where i was at, i became very frightened and  extinguished mycigarette and went inside the house to turn off the light.","distance":"21-100

wereseveral of them and they were moving about this way and that, in circles, instraight lines. i watched them for a while because i wanted to know what theywere. i didnt see a beam of light coming from the ground like you usually seewhen there are spotlights. i called to my husband inside the house. he came outand observed the lights also. then shortly after my son came outside also. meand my son stood there amazed at the dancing lights. my husband continued tobring in the groceries and stopped to watch them once in a while. he wasnt ascurious as we were. every once in a while when we were watching them we wouldsee a flash of lightning off in the distance. at least we think it waslightning. me and my husband were looking off to the east and i saw a flash outof the corner of my eye. later when we went inside my son told me he saw a beamof light flash. he said its color was rainbow. me and my husband didnt see itbut he did. while we were watching the spotlights dance on the clouds somethingelse caught our attention. then it appeared that five or six stars were movingto the west. then a few of them stopped moving and the other few kept moving tothe west. my husband thinks that maybe they just appeared to be moving becauseof the movement of the clouds. but i think they were moving themselves. later iasked him and he isnt sure if they were or not. we stood outside watching themfor what seemed to be about 7 minutes. i was so amazed that i ran inside andcalled my mother on the cordless to tell her about it. i was talking to her onthe phone when the spotlights slowly disappeared. the spotlights disappeared asthe clouds disappeared and moved off to the northeast. i also wanted to say thatthis isnt the first time i have witnessed ufos. when i was a teenager i had

green glowing lights on it, the monitor andthe speakers. all of the devices are plugged into the wall through a surgeprotector. anyhow, the monitor started to fade in and out, and the little lightsfaded in and out. i was trying to ignore what was going on so that i couldfinish my interview, but then my cell phone started breaking up and fading inand out. the person with whom i was talking noticed this as well. this went onfor almost a full minute. meanwhile the lamp which is also plugged into thesurge protector also faded in and out and made a really weird noise as it did,kinda of a hum. after the event, and after my interview ended, and probablypoorly at that since i was kind of freaked out about the power issue, i wentaround the house to check on appliances and no clocks needed to be reset oranything, even though the power was weird long enough for my computer to shutdown and have to be rebooted. while the event was happening, i felt a weird kindof field or something come over me as well. i really dont know what to make ofit.  feel free to contact me if needed. i am trying to find out if any one elsein my neighborhood experienced this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":3043,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4087993,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-121.3716178,"occurred":1085415300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1085415300000,"summary":"Experienced

it to disappear, butinstead when it got to about a 15 degree elevation it made a right angle turntoward the east and continued on until i could no longer see it. i then realizedthat it could not be a
