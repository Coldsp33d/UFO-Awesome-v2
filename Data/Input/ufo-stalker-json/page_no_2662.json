looked in the direction of the movement.  what i firstsaw appeared to be a batch of baloons arranged in a triangular pattern. unfortunately i didnt have my binoculars with me and i didnt want to take thetime to go get them.  the baloons were moving rapidly ene and i didnt want tolose sight of them.  then i noticed a point light source traveling along infront of them.  the point of light appeared to be dull orange to yellow and wasapproximately 15-17 arc minutes ahead of the baloons, and that distance wasconstant as best as i could tell.  the triangular arrangement of the baloonsappeared to be about 20 arc minutes on a side equilateral.  the reason i thoughtthem to be baloons was that the colors, though muted, appeared to be red, white,and blue-gray.  they were first seen by me crossing my meridian about 802b degrees above the horizon looking south.There was no sound or other associated phenomena.  the time was almost exactly2120 hours, perhaps a few seconds later.  the objects traversed the sky in about8 to 10 seconds.  the problem with that is that the local surface wind at mylocation was almost calm.  i checked with the local weather and winds werereported at 4 mph and steady out of the ssw, while the objects were moving ene,or nearly perpendicular to the local wind.I have been involved in amateur astronomy since 1947 and am good observer.  i amslightly reluctant to report this because i also write science fiction and ithing there could be an unfortunate association drawn between the two.  at anyrate, i have never seen anything quite like this and i am at a loss to explain.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

december of 2000 with a ma degree in sociology. i am a senior chiefpetty officer in the u.S. navy reserve, and i work as a screening managersecurity for the transportation security administration at dfw internationalairport. i would like to tell you about a recent ufo sighting that i observed.On april 9, 2004 at approximately 10 pm i was lying in my back yard deck swing.I like to do this because it is relaxing, and i enjoy observing the universe andits falling stars. it was a completely clear night so i was able to see starsall across the sky.Suddenly, as i was looking west, i was baffled by the sight of what i figured tobe about 9 to 12 bright round lights bearing down on me from the sky. at first ithought, what kind of birds are those, because i was use to seeing flocks ofbirds flying overhead during the day.At first these lights appeared to be moving slow. then it became an incrediblesight because i realized that these lights were coming directly at me as theyswept down from the sky. suddenly i realized that these were not birds becausebirds do not give off light at night and because the lights started acceleratingat a high speed - much faster than any bird could fly. the lights passed directly over my head. i noted that these flying objects didnot have any blinking colored wing tip lights or landing lights as required bythe faa. due to the high speed at which they passed over and my visualobservation, i estimated that the lights were flying at a very low altitude.The lights were traveling in a left to right formation. three of the lights onthe left seemed to be slightly separated from the others. below is a drawing ofwhat the formation looked like0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0i duly noted that the formation was flying in perfect harmony - the exact samespeed with no updown or leftright variations. but the most amazing thing that iobserved as the formation of lights passed overhead was the fact that they didnot make the slightest noise or vibration. they were not producing any force orthrust. these objects were cutting through the air with the greatest of ease asif they were not subject to any of our aerodynamic laws.I was not able to observe the lights after they passed overhead because of hightrees directly behind my deck. i immediately concluded that i had observed ufos.The route that the ufos was flyi","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sky when i got on the freeway. last year, mars wasvery close to earth, so i at first thought this must be a planet and i have notbeen keeping track on the ones that might be close right now. when i realizedthat it wasnt a planet i had this here we go again kind of feeling. i couldntstop staring at the thing. i kept swerving in my lane, i could not keep track ofthe slow moving trucks in the right lane. i was a bit dangerous on the road andfeeling very overheated. after it was gone and i got home i just sat in my jeepfor a while wondering what happened and getting really cold. i tried to call mymom at work because i was a little shook up, but my cell phone would not workfor about 20 minutes. i first saw it as a very bright looking star in thesouthern sky. i noticed that this planet was not only changing bightness andcolor, but it was also moving. it was white most of the time, but it would getreally dim and then brighten up with a different color. it was moving in anorthwest direction as far as i could tell. it soon started to head more northand towards me. as it got closer i saw that the bright light from the object wascoming from the surface of it being covered in flames. the flames were notstreaming out behind as with a fast moving object, but moving over the surfaceand coming up from the top as you might expect from a stationary ball of fire inthis environment. it was not moving very fast so the flames could be going up. iremember thinking why is the wind not blowing the flames around because it waswindy tonight. under neath the fire it looked like a perfect sphere. thinkingback on it i would guess the thing was about four and a half meters accross, butvery high up. i kept moving towards me until it disappeared above me. i watchedout the windows and in the mirror to see it come out behind me but i never sawit. it was just gone.","distance":"101-500

try to see if we could see comet neat with the nakedeye. we could just make out a fuzzy spot that is the comet.Then i was looking around at the stars directly over head and my eye caughtmovement. it was a light way up there that looked like a dim satellite movingslowly. much slower than the usual satellites you would observe crossing thenight sky. anyway, as i watched it i noticed that it wasnt one but three lightsin a triangular formation. an elongated triangle, narrow at the back and long onthe sides. made me think of the battle cruisers in star wars, with a light oneach corner. black in its body like a black hole might be. at first i thought itwas three lights moving in tandem, but as it moved it blocked out stars itpassed over. clare could see it at first, but her contacts had been in all dayand she was having difficulty as she was having blurred vision from her dry eyesdistorting her night vision. but she did see it so it wasnt only me.I ran in and grabbed the video cam and tried to shoot it in infrared nightshot,but the damned viewfinder was brighter than the sky and i couldnt acquire it. ijust filmed away in hopes that it might show, but with a damned auto focus thatcouldnt grab on to anything, it kept focusing in and pixeling out and thenfocusing back out. i should have just turned the auto focus off, looked for abright star and focused and then tried to shoot. there are moments when thepicture is focused and you can just make out the stars, and i bet if i hadaccess to video editing software that could clean up the video, i would have thething in there. live and learn, ill be better prepared for this if it happensagain. but how can you really be prepared for something like thisit was way the hell up there, between a mile and i would guess

watched from my perspective, and if it was a mileor more up that would be one big mother. it took approximately 10 minutes to gofrom where i spotted it at zenith directly above me till it disappeared

outside. i went to the front door, which facesnorthwest, and looked out. through the trees, slightly towards the west, i saw abright, yellowish light flickering through the tree branches that were movingquite vigorously in the wind. i watched for a few seconds trying to determine ifi might be seeing venus. i then realized that this was something different,because it was getting bigger and brighter.I thought it might be the landing light of an airliner traveling southeast. iturned and quickly put on a cap and jacket hanging by the door and i stepped outonto the front deck to get a better look. it was raining hard and the wind wasgusting. i had to crouch down to get a view of the light without the obstructionof the tree branches. i squatted down by the deck rail with its top board justbelow my eye line and steadied myself against it. it was from this vantage pointthat i had the best view of the light. i felt very calm as i observed thisphenomenon, and at the same time felt a slight thrill of excitement that i wasseeing something quite extraordinary. as i watched, i grew more certain this wasa remarkable occurrence. the light grew in size and brightness and changed to aruddy color. at its largest, it was twice the size of venus. it then began todrop what looked like blobs of red light toward the ground, as though it wereshedding parts of itself. it did this for about ten seconds at which time itsintensity dwindled down to a pinpoint and the color went back towards yellow.After a few seconds, it again grew larger and very bright red and again raineddown several large blobs of red for a few seconds. i observed it glowing brightred for another couple of minutes, then it just winked out completely. by thetime the light disappeared, it had stopped raining and the wind had died down.The light remained relatively stationary in the sky during the sighting. theonly sounds i heard were from a jet flying over in another part of the sky.Somewhere in the neighborhood, i could hear a dog barking furiously, although mytwo dogs who were sitting just inside the storm door were silent.This is not just another mistaken sighting of venus. i am quite

about 5 minutes and then diappeared by implodingor shutting off all at once. in describing movement it would be best to say it was like something that hadbeen moving very fast and suddenly stopping. it had a hanging sense to it as ifan unstable slight spin. the turning was slow and it gave an appearance ofadjusting the actual lights. the lights appeared to have a sequencing effect. tosay they went from odd positions to a more uniform alignment. after they cameinto straight line, forming a v with an odd nose. a w, type of nose. then theyjust faded down and a quick white/blue flash and it was gone. i do not know what direction it came from. i can only say it materialised, inthe western sky. with the exception of maneuvering the lights it made no drasticmoves. i do not know which way it went because it seemed to implode or leave inthe manner in which it appeared. flash and gone. the sky was clear. all other natural and satellite features were in normalplacement. the temperature was in the 20,sf. slight breeze. to take a wild guess as to elevation of object i would say just above smallcraft path. the placement was toward the lake. i think it was above the lake.The lake is 7 blocks west downhill from my home.To describe structure i would call it a very interesting bit of piecework,. imean to say it was not in alignment when it first appeared,. it performed somekind of structuring act. it may be best to call it w shaped. i say that because though it was v inoverall shape, at least by the manipulating of the lights it also formed anindent like the w or a ^ at the v center. i did not detect any sound other than a humming sensation at the top of my head.Myself and my dog and cat were the witnesses for this that i am aware of. thecata huge orange tom tabby went to the west in the bit of thicket to hunt. the doga miniature schnauzer/lhasa (benji) was mildly distressed. he could hearsomething and wanted to go into the house. he growled for sometime but thatcould be because he does not like his cat to be hunting in the dark! we havesighted strange black dogs; they look like hyenas in stature, they stalk thedeer trail through the west hillside.
