my father on my right side and my uncleon my left. my uncle had a clear space on his left, but my father had a largetree oak on his right. it was leaning out over the water as river-bank trees arewont to do. as a result of this every so often, my fathers line would snag inthe overhanging tree branches. he would curse and reel the line back in.Although there were trees to the sides of our spot, there were none directlyover head.My father had just cast his line and it must have snagged a tree branch, becausesomething made him look up. i felt him go very still. he nudged me and said k.,look up. i looked up and directly over our heads was a very large flying saucer.It looked as big as a house....Bigger. i could see that it was bigger than therelative size of the large tree beside my father...Even at the height it was at.Which seemed to be not much higher than the tree top.The sky was black and there was no moon that i recall or could see, but i couldsee this object very clearly. obviously it was round. it had 6 round whitelights on the bottom. 5 surrounding one, all the same size, and the 5 rotatedcounter-clockwise. it was dead silent. it was a silvery pewter color. not shiny,and as i recall with....Seams in the metal. in other words, it was not aperfectly smooth skin. i knew i was seeing something extrodinary, but i wasntthe least bit frightened. we watched it as it crossed the river. as it got abouthalf way across, i saw that it was a shallow dome, like a lens. but instead of asmooth top, it had a little bump on top. a true dome that sat in the center ofthe ship. one the right upper side of the dome was a white light. the color ofan incandescent light bulb. in contrast to the lights on the bottom which lookedmore bluish and did not shine like a light.It crossed the river slowly and moved on a little further. then it hovered forjust a moment. then it just dropped slowly into the woods. i looked at myfather. he was still looking across the river. i

goes. . .If you havent seen it for yourself,live, then you can never truely, truely 100 per cent believe. lets see, adescription of how the ufo behaved last night - you know how the bugs you seethat hover over your lawn and are lit up in the summer sunlight move the ufoflew in a more lazy version of that.Zipping, speeding up and slowing down whilemoving in any one direction. long, sudden, shallowdownward arc movements to theright heading north seemed to be a favorite with this object and did it at least5 different times.Both sharper and smoother abrupt turns. dips and ascensions,etc. yet all was liquid smooth flight - totally defying the laws of gravity -very exciting so exciting that we both got tension headaches from experiencingthe event. bakersfield was very windy from early evening on and picked up somefarm dust into the atmosphere. the sighting lasted so long that the only reasonwe went in was becasue the ufo eventually made its way further and further fromus and the dusty atmosphere eventually blocked most of the object and it becamea dim pin point. but when we went back inside the end of a 45 minute duration,you could still barely see it and it was still doing its thing. i went backoutside a half hour later and both the ufo and oddly enough the mighty winds wewere having were gone. please, dont take my word for it. if you decide to sendsomeone to investigat

the miltary families stationed in the area lived in a housing complexcalled kanto mura located a few miles from fuchu afb. it was late afternoon inthe summer of 1967. myself and 2 friends were standing talking outside the 4plex in which my family resided. it was that time of day when the sun is gettinglow on the hoizon, bathing everything in bright golden light.I was facing north toward mt. fujiyama. some movement to my right east caught myeye. looking in that direction, i saw a saucer shaped craft slowly risingstraight up into the air. it appeared to be rising from the fields and openareas outside the base in that direction. there was no apparent means ofpropulsion. after rising to i would estimate to be about 100-500 feet, it cameto a complete stop. at this point, i had called it to the attention of myfriends.As we watched, the saucer suddenly moved west in a straight line at a high, evenrate of speed and at the same altitude. it suddenly stopped nearly directly infront of us still with no change in altitude. it looked much bigger than a golfball but not as large as a basketball. regarding its angle to the horizon, itwas not directly above us, but about 34 of the way from the horizon to directlyoverhead.The surface was highly reflective like aluminum. the craft appeared to be goldenbecause of the strong late afternoon light. as the saucer remained stationary,it could be seen rotating due to the strong light on it. in appearance, theshape was like 2 deep saucers or round-bottomed bowls put together with a domeon the top. in dimensions, it was wider than it was tall.After watching the object for what seemed like a couple of minutes, it suddenlyshot to the north at a high rate of speed and was soon out of sight. regardingmy emotions, i was just excited about it-during and after the event. there wereno peculiar emotions connected to the event.I remember the names of the other 2 witnesses but am hesitant to include them inthis report. they may not want to be contacted about it after all these years.One of them later joined the military and i dont know happened to the other.","distance":"101-500

andcontinued for about 30- 40 minutes. the sky was partly cloudy w scatteredcumulus clouds and it was an otherwise bright and sunny spring day. i had takena tire to be fixed at the wood and fullerton goodyear tire store at 2465 townlake parkway in woodstock ga.  this is near my home and is in an area with lotsof  businesses. as they worked on my tire, i went outside to enjoy the springweather.  i was looking up at the sky and happened to see the object. what iobserved, to the north and east, was a slient, metallic, spherical objecthovering, seemingly at an altitude slightly above the cloud tops in the distant.It is difficult to estimate its distance and size as there were no easyreference points. the object was silent and motionless. i observed it forseveral minutes and it may have drifted slightly.  it was finally covered by alarge cloud. as i tried to observe it again, and after about 5-10 minutes sinceit had disapppeared behind the cloud, i observed another, identical object tothe east but still nearby to where i had seen the first object.  it took had thesame characteristics as the first object, and might even have been the firstobject.  i observed it too for several minutes with clouds occasionally andtemporarily covering it as they passed.  this entire observation was a half houror more.  the objects were metallic and silent.  the closest conventional objecti could relate them to would be a ballon.  unlike ballons ive seen, theseobjects seemed to be almost motionless, possibly drifting very slightly. thefact that clouds drifted by made it difficult for me to discern if the objectsever really moved very much.  this motionlessness seemed odd to me. no othersseemed to notice the objects,  though in fairness, to do so one would have tohave looked at that particular part of the sky to see the objects.  i haveexcellent distant vision and happened to first notice the first object when iwas looking up at the beautiful spring sky. during the observation i noticed 3-4jet aircraft at much higher altitudes than the object, and one small privateplan travelling to the east at about the same apparent altitude as the secondobject, but not near the object.

lospaseos in cupey, puerto rico. i was about 17 years old at the time.When i saw the saucer from my terrace, the saucer was above the shoppingmalllittle shopping mall of los paseos. it was about 150 feet above in the air.I immediately identified the object as a saucer because of the extreme lowaltitude, it was so close, so low. the object at that time was hovering, quietin the sky. it was gorgeous, the exact coloryellow goldlike 24 karat gold, therewere windows with colored lights, one different light per window, in all like arainbow.The saucer had a dome. some feets above and around the dome,the sky was orange,almost like a painting. i dont know if that was radiation or some light orwhatever it was, but was like that. i dont think it was a hologram. in thebottom of the craft i saw two louversblackones from my viewpoint so i dont knowif there were more. i looked at the saucer for about 1 to 2 minutes, then iwalked some steps back  toward the house to call my mom, to tell her to come tothe terrace to watch the saucer, but she didnt hear me so i came back to look atthe saucer again but it was gone.P.S3e in those days in that area i saw 3 ufos. one very high in the sky that cametwo or three consecutive days around 515 pm or something like that, hovered, ithide itself between the clouds, made backward movements like it knew that wemyfather,mother,and me were watching him, like playing with us.Some days or weeks later i was again in the terrace and looked at the horizonand saw a saucer ascent from the ground i think and move to the right. thedistant i would say some miles my house is in hills, so i have a good view.The color of the saucer from that distance was orange, or a reddish-orange.And my third and last view of a saucer those days was the first one that

afterthat a solid straight line of 3 dim lights went racing overhead while spinningon it60s axis. all these lights were heading in the same direction which was north.But about 5 minutes later 3 dim lights in a triangular formation went flyingoverhead at an amazing speed and then proceeded to break apartspread out andseperate but then quickly regroup into a triangle and then disappear from

the lights on each craft were verydim. they all blended in with the stars and did not flash or blink. in each casethere was no sound at all. the oakland airport is close by and airplane noise isvery
