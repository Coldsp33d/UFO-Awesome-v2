get my cell phone serviced.   it was raining on andoff and there were large patches of storm clouds intermixed with clearings andbreaks in the clouds.  sometimes everything was soft and greyish and sometimesparts of the landscape and sky were in full light.Somewhere between espanola and velarde, nm and just south of the los lucerosexit, i noticed a very steady solid white shape moving swiftly and smoothly in asouthern direction parallel to the highway in the opposite direction of mytravel.  its altitude and speed at this time did not fluctuate.  it made its wayfrom my northwest at roughly 20 degrees to slighty south of my due westperpendicular to the highway in a fairly short period of time.  if i had toguess id say it covered between 12 and 1 mile in no more than 20 seconds.  itraded between watching the object and watching the road, trying to determine ashape and wether it would be worth stopping the car.   i was looking for thetell-tale signs of a small engine plane or large bird and could distinguish nofeatures, other than an ellipse seen at a subtle angle.    then it sloweddramatically, almost to a stop, and started dropping in altitude,  it was atthis time that my curiosity was high enough to stop the car.  this is only thesecond time i have ever done something like this.  the first time i was able toquickly determine that what i was seeing was a large shaped balloon on a tether. this sighting lasted almost an hour with no satisfying explaination.I crossed the 4-lane highway 2 lanes in each direction separated by a landdivider somewhat excitedly because its shape was still elusive, and now itsmovement quickly ruled out a lot of possibilities. it was about 1145am when istarted watching it.It stayed in the same general area for a very very long time, changing altitudein a range as high as 20 degrees no higher than the high mountain line in thisarea and as low as possibly landing.  in fact, i never saw it leave.   i leftonly when i became convinced that it was not going to come close enough to me toget a good photo.During the 55 minutes i observed it, it exhibited the following behaviors firstit behaved like a bee hovering over flowers, except with less erratic motion anda bit slower.  it would dip down low enough","distance":"501 Feet - 1

agenda to accomplish.  i am preparing a website, now atetcode.Com e.T. code, which explains that agenda, and is already showing aquantity of unrefutable trace evidence there, to prove it is the real article. if you really want to know what the ufo visits are all about, you can start toread about it at that website, or you can talk to me. quite frankly, you areotherwise looking in the wrong place, for any of the answers to the real issue,as to why there are ufo sightings. if, however, you just want to load your filewith another glimpse of a ufo report, then you neednt investigate the study ofthe e.T. code message of their government, to this earth, at that site.Ill state here for the record i had alerted mufon, in case later, the publiclooks for someone to blame, about why it wasnt alerted on such an importantmatter, as is being revealed at the etcode.Com website.Also, i would like to link to a source of information on the reported ufologicaldata on ufo capacity to change sizes, for instance, where a small craft appearedto be very much larger on inside. a ufo was reported to suck up a large pond ofwater, into a small craft, for instance, it was reported.Also data on ufo stealth is of some great significance - dissapearing fromradar, and occupants or craft as to suddenly vanish from sight.Also, the prevelance of occupant mental telepathy.  these fields all have somebearing on understanding the role of the extraterrestrial government, with earthhumanity, at this time.At the etcode.Com, the foremost articles are linked from dedication of on homepage, and chapters 1  2 in facend. at world plaque linked from homepage, is anexposure of as yet unlabeled diagrams and images discovered in the shape ofearth geography, that will prove earth had been

frequent often for campfires, boating, and hikes.  assoon as the sun was about 50 per cent set i was standing outside of my car inthe parking lot when out of the south came a soundless amber glowing orb thatcame to the edge of the parking lot.My jaw dropped open with astonishment and i just stood there too stupified to doanything.  for about 30 seconds to a minute, the object came to a stop at theedge of the parking lot and hovered there.  i felt like i was being watched.I grew afraid and started to think about getting into my car to try to escapewhen the orb started moving againnot towards me but perpendicular at a 90 degree angle.  it flew along the edgeof the lot and turned into the trees just out of site all the while not making asound.  all the wildlife was completely silent all this time.By now the shock had worn off enough for me to get into my car and go home.  ireturned the next night with a very close friend at about the same time and asif right on cue about ten minutes after we arrived, another craft made the sameflight path and dissapeared into the trees.   now my friend had seen it but didnot want to talk about ithe dismissed it as them probably wanting nothing to do with us primitives and weproceeded to have a campfire. easy to be brave when your not alone.That is one event that happened in this area that i wanted to pass on to you.  ihave seen a different type of craft in the same area holding rock solid in theair in 70 kmhr winds while cesnas were wiggling around like paper planes.   infact i have even seen a third type of craft in the area too.  these last twocraft i have mentioned could be reported with more detail upon request.  eversince i have seen these things i have been obsessed with them.  either i need tojoin the military to be able to fly these cool new craft theyre designing andkeeping secret.   either way it is not illegal in canada to have contact with aufo so there ive said it.Please excuse my poor writing form as i am very excited to maybe hear more onthis and maybe even get more involved with your organization.Ps i have also played guitar one night out there to a little blue orb the sizeof an aspirin at arms length

wasnice outside and i was looking out over the military base when i first noticedthe object.  i was interested in it because it looked so big and i assumed itwas some military craft.  there were no planes that i am aware of that would beas big as the object so i kept my attention on the object as i drove. casuallylooking at the object to try to pick out any features, i continued on my wayhome. the drive home is about 13 miles so the drive was about 20 minutes ormore.  as i changed my perspective on the object as i drove past the airforcebase i began to realize that the object wasnt near the base anymore. the natureof the lights i saw told my logical self that it must have been an illusion andit was simply a tower. as i kept driving i realized that the object was muchfurther than i has previously assumed. since i was driving around 45 miles anhour i thought that it was only appearing to move. so i didnt think it was acraft for most of the drive. well then i began to realize that the object mightbe moving, if only very slowly.  maybe a blimp i kept my eyes on the object asmuch as i could while i was driving and tried to drive toward the object.  notgoing out of my way i ended up at home as planned.  i had to show my girlfriendthe object so i got her to get out of the house and walk out to the main road tosee the u.F.O herself.  i am a fan of sci-fi so i wanted a more criticalopinion.  she saw it and it was still where it was when i turned off the roadmaybe 5 minutes before. i watched the object for maybe 5 minutes with her and wediscussed what it possibly could be. she said that it was just tower lights fromthe mountain. i said it was a blimp. she said it couldnt be a blimp because itwasnt moving.  i told her it couldnt be a tower because from our perspective thelights were too large and the mountain wasnt that high.  we finally agreed thatit definitely was unusual and we couldnt figure out what it was. jokingly wesaid it was a u.F.O. with the usual connotations and both went back home. thenext night i realized that the mysterious lights were not anywhere in the sky.Leading me to report the sighting.There was no viewable body or shape or

went to a near by school field to meet my girlfriend at the time. i cannot besure of the time, but it was dark so im geussing about 22 hours it was a clearsky and we were just lying in the middle of the field staring at the stars andon occasion stop and make-out for awhile.You know how it was back then since ihad just taken astrology in science class that year i was trying to reconize thedifferent constilations. well i looked to a cornor of the sky and noticed whatseemed to be 3 stars in a perfect triangle. i immediatly pointed and saidout-loud to my girlfriend, i know that constilation and just as i said that, asif they had herd me, the 3 stars begain slowly moving across the sky, at 1sttogether, then they begain to alternate and switch around as they moved alongthe sky. about the speed of a satilite i have no idea what made me look to thatspot at that time and see that, because they looked exactly like stars. not evenan astrolager could have seen the difference. however, as they danced across thesky both me and my girlfriend stayed pretty quiet, there was the odd oh my godor holy crap but we both stayed very calm and quiet. we watched the objectsuntil the finially dissapeared into the night...I cannot remember weather theydissapeared behind the aprtments behind us, or just vanished into the night,however, i remember the night was so clear that it was very difficult to keepfixated on them because of all the stars out. afterwards we both we prettyshocked, but never really got too excited because we knew that we were probiblythe only ones who saw it and we had no proof of it, other then our memories.However, i do know it was not a plane or helicopter or balloon for the simplereasons that, they hovered and then all of the sudden begain moving. they madeabsolutly no noise, and the patterns they flew would make even an f-15 dizzy.Impossible from the decelleration and the exceleration and the foreward movementthen lateral movement they flew thanks for reading my encounter, supernaturalstuff scares the crap out of me, so i hope thats the closest i ever come to aclose encounter. sorry i could not have gotten it on tape or any hard evidence,however, there is 2 of us that saw it, so my story can be justified.","distance":"Over One

theshore of irondequoit bay, just east of rochester, ny.  he was at the landing atthe bottom of the hill at the end of orchard park blvd.On the west side of thebay.  he was carrying his small 35mm automatic camera.  it was a clear day about6 pm with a layer of high clouds.  he was looking east out over the water at akid on a skidoo.  in the sky above the jet ski, ted saw a strange air objectwith unusual movements  in a head on view the object92s outline looked like the drawing below. the angular width was about  5degrees of arc, at its closest approach.  the aspect ratio of width of wing tipsto height of central dome was approximately 11 to 1. it was brown in color, seethe photo. the texture of the central dome, as seen at its closest approach wasabout 30 vertical bars side by side, stockade style.  the object appeared tocome straight head on towards ted, growing larger in size, stopping at about 45degrees of elevation over the water, then retreating straight backwards. thewidth of the bay is approximately 12 mile at the sight. this head on thenreverse motion was repeated once more. ted was surprised and took a photo.  theobject then reversed straight backwards into the clouds and disappeared.Estimating the distance to the sky object wasbc mile 1,320 ft..  trig calculations give a width of about 150 ft. and a domeheight of about 15 ft.  other friends have also claimed to have seen strangearial objects in the vicinity of the bay.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned
