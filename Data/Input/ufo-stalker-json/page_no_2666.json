loop around houston. it was small and hard todetermine the altitude. it seemed to drift slowly to the south then to thesoutheast. the object appeared to be small and round. it seemed to wobble orspin. it flashed a fiery red light at an irregular interval. sometimes the lightwas quick and dim. other times it seemed to flare up. i thought it might be alarge balloon reflecting the setting sun in the west but the flashing had amechanical quality and seemed too red for reflected sunlight. as it slowlypassed over the building i lost sight of it and so left my office to godownstairs to see if i could catch it on the other side of the building. when icame outside and looked around it was gone. however at the same time i lookedsouth and saw a single military aircraft f-16 moving untypically fast from thedirection of ellington field and moving wnw. it seemed to be 3-5 miles to thesouth. the plane then went west and i think did a u-turn back toward the east. iwould note however that president bush is in town tonight for a fund raiser. thenews reported scrambeling an f-16 to intercept a private pilot in the same areabut no name or other details were given. it would be interesting to know if thiscould be confirmed with details. thats it. i dont know what it was. it was not aplane or helicopter. it seems like it could possibly have been a balloon of somekind but the flashing was weird - unless it has an irregular surface that wasspinning and possibly reflecting light from the sunset in the west. plausible -but i just cant say. it was certainly unusual enough to get and hold myattention. i took 3 digital photos of the small object which showed more detailthen i expected when enlarged. balloon you tell me. if you email me i will sendyou the photos.","distance":"501 Feet -

area in the town i live. i was driving home from gettinggas and observed the two objects glowing red, green, and white they werehovering and very slowly heading in a westward direction. at first i thoughtthey might be helicopters or small planes. i lost sight of them for a couple ofseconds behind some trees and when i was able to see again only one of them wasthere. i pulled off onto a side road and turned the vehicle off and rolled downmy window. at this time and for the duration of the sighting no sound wasapparent. i watched for about a minute. i looked around to see if there were anymore and did not see any. when i looked back the second object had reappeared. iobserved both objects hovering for about five more minutes. suddenly the firstobject dissapeared followed a couple of seconds later by the second. i waitedfor about five more minutes and they did not reappear. they seemed to behovering like fireflys as best as i can describe it. they would go slowly up anddown and side to side in no set pattern. i did not observe any sudden movementsor anything else.I live in nw pennsylvania in a very rural area about a mile south of lake erie.I did a little research and found similar objects being seen in this areabefore. i am about 30 miles east of the perry nuclear power plant and objects ofthis or similar nature have been observed there since the 80s.On a side note, about a week ago i saw what appeared to me to be one of thosesmall airplanes they were using in iraq. the un piloted white ones. i onlycaught a glimpse of it but what i did notice was that it was white with novisable markings. it was also flying very low in an area about a half mile fromthe 2 objects i saw today.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

object because a large, black crow sitting atop alight pole started crowing really loud.  i was waiting for my co-worker to exithis vehicle so we could walk in together, and i heard the crow and thought itodd that it would be there making such a loud noise. i had never noticed a crowin the parking lot before so it kind of stood out.  i saw the crow, felt somehowdisconnected to my surroundings, as though i were experiencing a dream in someway.  when the co-worker came up alongside me, i pointed the crow out to him andmade a comment about how strange it seemed.  thats when i first noticed theobject in the sky.  my first thought was a large mylar balloon drifting in thewind. but the shape of the object was so odd that i couldnt quite fathom justwhat type of mylar balloon it could be.  i felt a moment of quiet come over meas the thought struck that i may be seeing something that is different thananything id ever seen before. the object moved slowly, as though drifting on thewind, so we watched it for some time, maybe five minutes, discussing what it maybe.  my friend commented that it was certainly strange, but that it must have agood explanation, even though he couldnt think of one himself.  he refuses tobelieve that it could have been anything other than of terresterial origin, ashe is not a believer in ufos i was simply stunned to be seeing this object.  iwanted to chase it to see where it went, but i had to got to work so once theobject was out of sight, we left.Im not good with distance, but the object seemed to be roughly 10-15 in size. it was silver in color though not really as reflective as a true silver colormay be.  possibly lead colored, would be a better description.  its appearencewas that of a bundle of cylinders bunched together.  maybe as many as 8, butcertainly no less than six.  its appearence gave the impression of looking likea six pack of coors light beer, only without the lettering on the cans and,obviously, much larger. there were no windows or doors or lights that i couldsee, only the six to eight lead colored cylinders moving to the northwest.  theobject moved from a generally southern to northwestern direction, moving slowlybut steady.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

and i were in bed, in the middle of intercourse, when we both apparently blacked out at the exact same time.  the following morning, we were awakened by my mother, who was knocking on the screen door.  it was raining outside, and the main entry door was unlocked and wide open. the lights inside the house were all on.  we had locked the doors and shut off all of the lights before going to bed the night before.  my mother said she heard metal clanging sounds when she came to the door. we had new stove pipe lying on the living room floor, as we were preparing to install a new furnace.  she also heard what sounded to her like an old man coughing in a deep tone. when we finally came to, we were both naked and lying in two different directions on the bed. both of us had tremendous headaches and a feeling that something strange had happened to us, but did not talk about it.  for the next two days, when we each tried to think about what had happened, our minds couldn't focus on the event. after some time had passed, we both realized that we could both remember right up to the exact moment that we both blacked out it had happened right in the middle of sex, and we had blacked out at the exact same time. two months later, i found out i was pregnant, and would have conceived at around this same date. also, i was on birth control pills at the time. a few months later, in feb. 1988, we were asleep when i was awakened at 2:48 am, by a small, gray, wrinkled-looking being. he had large eyes, no nose, and just a slit where his mouth should've been. he was standing about four feet from the bed, just staring at me.  he had a solid, dark-colored outfit on - it looked like a one-piece jumpsuit.  i tried to wake darren, but was unable to move. i tried to scream for him, but was only able to make a wimpering sound.  at that time, darren rolled over towards me, and the being just faded out of existence. i told darren what i had seen, and we finally got back to sleep. at exactly 4:48am 2 hours later, i was again awakened by the same small, gray being.  i laid there looking at him for probably 3-4
