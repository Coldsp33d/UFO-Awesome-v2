connecticut. i glanced back through the rear window of  the car and saw a large, white ball, about the size of a half dollar, descend  straight down from above, like a spider i drew pictures of all i will  describe. it had two smaller red lights on either side at the top, and  resembled mickey mouse. it was due east, at about 45 degrees in the sky.We watched it as it hovered, then darted north-east. the red lights disappeared,but the white ball remained constant. we followed it in the car as it moved overthe next town, orange, connecticut. i dont know if it may making any noise ornot.As we got into orange, and were headed north on the post road, it moved acrossthe sky, from east to west in seconds, then disappeared in the west. we werejust about to give up when it reappeared behind us, moving east towards thecoast. there were many cars on the post road, and people were pointing, as ifthey saw it, too.From 630 to 645 pm., it changed shaped againlike a gray pie pan on the bottom, but with the white light on top. it madenumerous stops in the sky, and 90 degree turns. finally, about 645 pm, it movedeast, over west haven beach, and disappeared below the horizon. but we stoppedat home, in west haven, because my fiancee wanted to get the cam-corder in casewe saw it again.While he was in the house, for only about five minutes, it reappeared again,this time from the west. it was again the big white ball, but with only one redlight this time. it stopped completely in the sky for about 10 seconds, thendarted east, heading again for the coast.We followed it, but couldnt keep up - it was moving very fast. finally, overthe water, it moved east again, headed towards new haven harbor, and we didntsee it again.We pulled over on kelsey avenue, and suddenly, two large triangles, about thesize of a nickel appeared. they were coming from the east, moving southwest, butthen began circling and followed the same paths the large white ball had taken.The triangles were only about an inch apart in the sky, one in front of theother. they were charcoal gray, and had small white lights all over the edges,that blinked in rapid successi","distance":"501 Feet - 1

near the alpinetrail head. we were climbing up a steep slope near the hwy to return to myvehical when we noticed the craft behind us.  startled, by the silent closenessof such an obviously scary thing, we immediately returned to my vehical at thetop of the cliffside and watched the craft. it was approx. 503e feet wide by 30 feet tall with a turrent of bluered lights below than seemedto circle around and stationary white lights above. it made absoultely no sound.It wobbled and seemed to be having difficulty leaving. it jumped or hoppedincredibly high into the sky several times and came back each time nearby, allin a brief second or so. i wanted to leave right then but it was mesmorizing towatch.  i wasnt as afraid of aliens as i was of my own government having asecret craft that we shouldnt be seeing. anyway, it finally got up and stayedup.  there, it shot off two distinct red headlights-like beams into thesky..Three times.  other aircraft that seemed and sounded like regular planes,flew above the craft, while the craft shot off those red lights. when the craftwas near to the ground it actually seemed to fade out or hide, but with your eyeon it, one could still kinda-sorta see it. please forgive this...I am not sureexactly the date.  but this i remember...About three or four days later, an odd,wide-spread pink bright light lit up the entire night cloudy sky in montrose,

interactingwith each other as if in a dog-fight. it reminded me of those old war filmswhere the planes would fly in formation and then breakaway and engage with theenemy...I am a skeptic at heart and

intoxicated in any way.2 the sky was totally unobstructed by clouds or moonlight.3 they were not birds or bats due to the velocity of travel across a hugeportion of the sky and the way in which they could stand completely stillthey could veer off in any direction without breaking speed, either.4 i woke up my roommate and had her come and see this orbs also.5 last, but not least, at 6am they all returned to the star just beforedaybreak.I might add also that this occurred just days before hurricane isabelle beganits journey towards our shore. i live one mile from the atlantic coast andisabelle

anything id ever seen before. i dont even really know how todescribe what i saw. i can only explain what it was like, not what it was,because there arent any words to fit what it was.Me and four friends were standing outside of a restaurant in columbus arenadistrict waiting for the valet to bring our car around. it was after sundown,and i remember the exact time because we were concerned about missing the playwe were going to. i was 750 pm, so the sun had been down for almost two hours.It was a perfectly clear night.One of the people in my group said, hey, whats that  and pointed almost straightup. i looked up. in the sky were two beams of light.  it looked like someone hada really, really powerful flashlight and was shooting it through a fog bank. butnone of the fog was outside of the shafts of light. they were pretty closetogether, and not perfectly parallel. each of the beams were probably only about15 times as long as it was wide. they were not incredibly bright, but to see thelights at such an altitude, it would have to have been bright.They stood there motionless for several minutes. no movement of any kind. wealso noticed two other beams, of exactly the same size, dimensions andarrangement, but quite a bit higher above the first two much dimmer, off to theside a bit, and rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  these two stayed in placejust like the first ones.My first thought was that an airplane with its headlights on was coming in for alanding at the columbus airport, and was just happening to come through a tinycloud that you couldnt really see. except that the airplane would have had to bestuck in the exact same spot for all that time. when i say that there was nomovement, i mean there was absolutely zero movement.We stood there staring at this phenomenon for what seemed to be 5 minutes untileveryone else got bored and cold. note that we were watching it this long eventhough we had plans to see a play. i wanted to stay and keep looking. it seemedodd to me that the other three witnesses seemed to lose their interest in thebeams.So we got in the car and drove to our destination about 5 minutes away. i kepttrying to see the lights through the windshield, but since they were straightabove us, i could not. when we got out of the car perhaps five minutes later, ilooked up, and they were gone.So there you go, four beams of
