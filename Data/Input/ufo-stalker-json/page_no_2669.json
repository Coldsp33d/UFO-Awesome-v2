international radar ohio, i got permission to vector over to a huge sphere about the diameter of half a football field that was not showing on their radar. it was only about 5 miles from them and hovering behind a cloud at 5,000 feet. i collided with the sphere and sustained damage to the outer third of my left wing. what i saw breaking across the leading edge of my wing were perfectly shaped 5 or 6 sided crystals about 4 to 5 inches long that were pointed on both ends. there were millions of them all spaced equally from each other and not moving in any fashion. as i approached the sphere it looked incredibly bright like a second sun but then as i collided with it the light went instantly out and i realized that the light was a reflection of the sun above deflecting through the crystals. these crystals were not ice. the collision caused so much drag on my left wing that it caused my plane to flip counter-clockwise and almost cartwheel. to this day i am the only pilot that i know of that has intentionally collided with a ufo and lived. also to this day, i havent found any way that the sun could possibly have deflected off those crystals at the angle they were all positioned given the sun was almost directly overhead and i was approaching from above. i landed immediately to asses the damage to my wing.","distance":"20 Feet or

saw a bright light shining through a crack in the closedblinds, through the bedroom window. both my wife and myself went to the bedroomwindow to open the blinds and get a better look at the light in the western sky.Once i realized that i was, occasionally, witnessing yellow and blue lights, andmy wife was viewing orange-yellow, white and blue lights, in some type ofirregular pattern, along with the primary colored light, which was red, i videotaped the lights through the bedroom window, which has an unmatchable screen onits outside.After a couple of minutes of attempting to video tape the unidentified lightsthrough the veil of the screen, i dressed for the outside weather, ran down fourstories of stairs and went to a street corner, a short distance to the north andvideo-taped the only lights in the entire night sky.At first, i thought that the red light might be the planet, mars. then, i sawother lights shining in the area adjacent to the light, and i realized that itcouldnt be the planet, mars. then, i questioned myself as to whether it could bea plane. but, beside the fact that my wife and i, in four years of living in thevery same apartment, have never seen a plane follow that kind of flight patternat night, the lights were glowing much too brilliantly at the distance, between1.000 and 1600 meters from our position, the lights were positioned in the couldcovered sky. in fact, even when a plane has flown directly overhead, at analtitude of 1,000 feet, at night, i have never witnessed any plane light thatwas as bright as the lights i videotaped in that western sky.At times, the lights seemed to hover for a minute or so. then, it would, veryslowly, continue on in its westward journey, once more.After about ten or eleven minutes of the light show, i went back into theapartment. then, after a minute of conversing with my wife, i looked out thebedroom window, and the lights had vanished and did not reappear.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at the street lights and i saw the bottom of thishuge oval shaped craft. it was quiet and floating about 200 feet above ground. i asked my dad what it was.  he said he didnt know.  i looked at the undersideof it for any airforce or military markings.  i commented to dad that i hope itsnot a russian spy blimp.  there werent any markings like a tail number.  wediscussed that it could be a ufo, and laughed about the odds of us seeing a ufo. lights were shining down from the bottom of it, almost like  search lights, butthey illuminated the entire area under it.  when it passed over our car,

community. beforewe got out of linville we seen what appeared to be lighting towards the parkway.So i said to my girlfriend lets see if we can see the lighting from a littlecloser. the closer we got the more we noticed it was not lighting,and started uptowards it. the closer i got to it i noticed that it appeard to be resting veryclose to a radio tower. anyway i pulled over on a pull off and put my truck inpark and watched for a few seconds and then got a strange filling that i wantedto get out for a second,and told my girlfriend and by then she was prettyfreaked out already,because we could both tell it was closer to the road thanthe tower that sits there.So when i go to get out she gets terriorfied andstarts to pull my so i couldnt get out,and starts insisting we leave so eventhough i wanted to explore around for more evidence i pulled out with her aboutto start crying from fear. we passed a black van that stoped where we wereat,and we made it home fine. the reason we seen the flashes like lighting wasbecause it was very foggy the lights on the object never flashed in the samepattern. and was flashing purple. the next day as i drove though the same area inoticed a big heathly tree had been twisted around like i have never seen beforesplinters were sticking out every where. you dont have to believe me but i knowwhat i have seen with my own eyes. and i believe theres

always interested in unknow things so i always keep lookingaround specially up in the sky, so i looked up to a airplane flying from northto south, which is odd, since they usually fly east and west, so as i looked atthis airplane i noticed something else about 100 feet higher than the airplaneflying from the se to the nw above the airplane, at first i tought it wasanother airplane, but then i noticed that it had no wings, tail or tail wings,it was silver just like a airplane, but it was shinning in an unusual manner,since it was around 5.30pm, the sun was almost down on the horizon at the west,now the airplane flying from north to south was reflecting the sun on the rightside perfectly, but this object was flying from se to nw, so it will not be ableto reflect the sun as if the sun was 90 degrees from it, like it did, it seemedlike glowing brightly with a silver color, like i have stated at the beggining,i also carry a camera and binoculars with me at all times, so i decide i had topull over for good look, so as i drove for about 4 minutes, i keep looking atthis object hover right on top of the road, but it was getting behind me as ikeep going south, so i looked for a place to stop, since this is a one line roadyou can not just stop, so i got to the cement factory entrance, pulled over andgot out of my car with my binoculars..., it was gone, with no sign of itanywhere in the sky, it took less than 30 seconds since i saw it for the lasttime until i got out of the car and looked again, the object was a cigar-shapedbrightly glowing metallic silver, no noise, no windows, no apparent propulsionsystem, just floating there about 90 degrees from the horizon right on top ofthe road, it could not have been a airplane, or i will have seen it fly away,and not dissapear into

coming from several crevices located in atleast two places on either side toward the upper edge.  when i use the termcrevice, i mean an area with a deep indentation like a trench with areas oferosion or less-deep indentations raying out almost like the rays from a starbut not as random, since the center indentation was longer than the ones comingout from the sides.  whether these lights pulsed or not, i could not tell butthey seemed to be muffled or glowing in a nebulous way as though there wereclouds  that covered the sources of light.  the object seemed almost transparentor translucent,

exited my house via a southward facing door.  as soon as i steppedoutside, i saw a very bright light in the distance above the treeline in theneighboring field.  the light was very bright white and seemed to pulse.  atfirst i thought it might be a dirt bike headlight or some such thing on the hilltop.  so i stopped to see what might be going on, since it is usually quiet atnight.  after my eyes had a few minutes to adjust to the darkness, it becomeclear that the light was quite a bit above the treeline and definately not onthe hill top.  you could see the night sky clearly underneath it.  the hill topis about 500-600 feet in the distance, with trees at the top that are abour 30feet tall.  the hill top is about a 50-75 foot increase in elevation from thelocation of my house.  after realizing that it wasnt a bike, i thought it mightbe a hovering helicopter.I watched the light for two or three minutes.  every once in a while, it wouldwobble from side to side very quickly if it were a penny in my hand at armslength, it would be a 12 movement in each direction and return to its originalposition.  also, it would occasionally flare.  it would go from a dime sizedcircle of light and then flare to the size of something slightly larger than apenny.  when it flared, the light got brighter and whiter.  then immediatelyafter a flare, the light would become a blue-white color.  i watched for about3-4 minutes, but it got very cold, so i went inside to put more clothes on.I went back outside about 1-2 minutes later and it was still in the exact sameplace doing the exact same thing.  i went into the garage and came back out afew minutes later because i was curious as what the light might be.  afterstudying it, i put its distance from me at about 2-3 miles.This is also when i became aware that something out of the ordinary was goingon.  on a normal day, if i stood around outside all day and all night, i mightsee two planes pass overhead.  well when i came out of the
