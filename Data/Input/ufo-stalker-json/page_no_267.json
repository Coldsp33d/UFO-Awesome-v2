(there was no color choice of brown in your form, so i listed it as unknown.)\r\n\r\ni saw the head, shoulders, upper arms and upper torso of two beings in the window.  i saw no detail as the were backlit by a yellowish light. the light was not bright so i could distinctly see  them, but not their clothing (if any) or their faces.  the light shone uniformly for the length of the window. their heads were abnormally long and smoothly thinned to their neck which flowed evenly to their shoulders.  their necks were not abnormally thin like the images of large-headed, skinny necked aliens i saw drawn by witnesses later in documentaries. i suspected that this was indeed an alien space ship.  since then, i've decided it had to be a shuttle from a larger craft.\r\n\r\nfrom my vantage point, the craft appeared to be cigar-shaped, but i realized i was seeing it side-on, so i couldn't see the rest of it.  it was not directly over my head.  it was over the dorm, and i was in the parking lot to the north (see attached map). it appeared to be tilted down so that the persons inside could look straight out of the window at me.  i yelled for my dorm-mate to get out of the car and look at the ufo over the dorm. she ducked her head onto the steering wheel and yelled, \"no! no!\". i looked back at the object and it was still there and the persons were still at the window watching me.  i begged her to get out and look because no one else was around.  she refused. i glanced around the sky and saw nothing else. \r\n\r\nthe craft stayed vey still in the air.  it did not waver or wriggle.\r\n\r\nthen it abruptly shot straight up, and within 3 seconds it disappeared into the blue distance. still no sound at all. as it rose, i could see that it was not cylindrical like a cigar, but that it was disc shaped. there were no markings, lights or protuberances on the underside.  this thing was really plain. \r\n\r\ni knew about gravitational forces astronauts endure upon blast off.  it wasn't until later when i took physics that i learned about inertia. those beings in that object went from being at rest about four stories above my head to zooming out of my sight in 3 seconds. they should have endured tremendous g-forces and be squished quite flat unless the craft could negate inertial forces. i now live in florida and have watched the shuttle take off many times, and the actual shuttle body stays within sight for several minutes while the exhaust is visible much longer. that gives the astronauts 3 g's.\r\n\r\ni've frequently heard shuttles' sonic booms over my house (upon landing). this craft over my dorm not only made no sound at all, there was no sonic boom when they accelerated faster than the speed of sound.  \r\n\r\nwe did not then (and do not now i believe) have the technology to do what this craft did, so i concluded it was extraterrestrial. \r\n\r\nmy dorm-mate never picked up her head to look. there was no one else in the parking lot.  i would be surprised if other students did not see this, but i never heard anyone say so.  i got tired of being called crazy, so i stopped talking about it on campus.\r\n\r\nyes it was the 60's-70's psychedelic age of aquarius, but i had never taken any recreational drugs, and i had not been drinking.  i was between classes and just took opportunity of some free time to pick up something i'd left in a friend's apartment.\r\n\r\nthis was, in retrospect, a very dull, unexciting ufo encounter, but it was amazing to me, and seems to be burned into my memory. i never have trouble recalling it in full visual detail. i see it as if it was yesterday. this might be because over the years i've told others about it. it also helps that i have always been detail oriented.  it wasn't until now that i found out there was a place to record my experience with others who have seen ufos. i eventually got my ms (elsewhere) and had a 35-year long career as a scientist.  i am now retired.\r\n\r\nthere were numerous sightings of unidentified flying objects in this area for about 7 years when i was at the university of mississippi.  if there are still sightings over this part of mississippi, i don't know.  many ufos were seen over sardis reservoir, and some friends of mine saw one of those, including beings outside of the craft.  one friend was interviewed by the air force for project blue book (she claimed - i thought they had closed that down by the end of the 60's), but their experience was not the same as mine.  however, they were partying \"hard\" at the time, so i took their observations with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\ni did not have a camera with me.  i am attempting to attach maps of the univ. of miss. campus showing brown hall and showing the campus' proximity to sardis reservoir.  i hope that it worked. if so, i was in the parking lot to the north of the building.  i came out the back door of the east-southeast to west-northwest prong of the three-pronged dorm. the back door was at the northeast end of the hall.\r\n\r\nmy \"ride\" was just a girl from the dorm rather than a friend with whom i would have stayed in touch.  i have no idea what became of her.\r\n\r\nthis is the only time i saw a ufo.  i've seen unusual lights in the night sky, but have never thought them to be ufos of the alien type. i don't think you have to assign anyone to investigate this because there isn't much evidence to look at.  i just wanted to add my experience to your database.","distance":"101-500

edison, nj. here's the story...\r\n\r\nwith the wash out of the perseid meteor shower, gave it another chance so set up lawn chairs and waited, saw few streaks but nothing spectacular.....\r\n\r\nbut at approx 4:10 am edt observed a craft that was directly overhead traveling from south to north, it was shaped like an acute triangle with long sides/thin and had a blue white light on front of it and two rectangular type lights on each side. the lights were a diff color than the stars and when the craft would go in front of star it would blot it out ….....I would say this craft was orbital, for it traveled my field of view in 15-20 secs and was very high in night sky. also, it did not shimmer like the stars did, just solid blue/white lights …........\r\n\r\nthen to my surprise, spotted another craft of this type a few mins later (17) but it was to east on a south east to north west track, appox 70 degrees and moving at same clip as prior one.............. \r\n\r\nand then, another lighted triangle appeared but it was about 6 secs behind this one, having follow same track but as it drew near it acted in herky jerky manner, slowing down and speeding up at times....\r\n\r\nobjects observed were about size of three pencil erasers held at arms length , and way up in the sky........... temp was 80 deg hazy hot and humid with a broken cloud cover that would dissipate at times ….........Sure looked strange and seeing the iss station at times these craft looked nothing like that or any other terrestrial craft …......Weird!","distance":"Over One

most end of rawlings rd in conway wa, when out of nowhere, a light appeared just above the horizon, over camano island. after a minute or so, another bright light appeared next to it. it was the same pattern as our previous sightings in the same area, so we instantly knew what we were seeing. we had brought along a camera, as the ufos had previously shown up as soon as we arrived at the area. we took multiple long exposure shots of the crafts in flight, and it was revealed that whilst travelling at faster speeds, the ufo would cloak itself, and could only be seen on camera. we photographed the flight path of both objects departing the area, and it was truly amazing. about 10 minutes after they had left, they returned in the same spot, or another 2 lights with similar characteristics appeared there. they did relatively the same things, hovering and pulsating in odd fashions. they would dissappear for minutes at a time, then suddenly reappear, then dart away after some time in the area. the 3rd time we saw this, one of us decided to flash a phone flashlight at it. upon doing this, to our surprise, the craft abrubtly turned towards us, in a frantic manner. it had 3 lights in the front that appeared to scan us. after that, it quickly darted in another direction and assumed a southwest bound flight path. it was during its departure of the area that we noticed a saucer shape to it. the entire craft was lit up with a large number of lights, pulsating in an intelligent manner. during the departure, we flashed lights again, and this time, it began to fly in a manner similar to an insect, going up and down, and left to right. the  we realized that we had just communicated with a potential extra terrestrial, and that our lives would be forever changed. the event lasted 3 hours.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

solid reflective structure. i quickly ran inside the house and retrieved my wife's tablet, turned the camera on and zoomed in on the object, managing to take three digital photos and one short video. my wife suggested the object might be a glider, but no person was seen and it did not have the shape one would expect to see. this was definitely cylindrical or rectangular in shape. it was also quite high, at least 400-500 feet or more above us, and made no sound or noise we could hear. the object appeared to be quite big, possibly 10-20 feet in length or longer, and was moving in a straight-line. we live in a sparsely populated area with thick rainforest, so this was a strange sight to see. this object was witnessed by me, my wife and son. the entire event lasted not more than 5 minutes before

pretty the moon looked out of my kitchen window.I decided to try to get a couple of nice pictures of it on my cannon digital camera,it was either a full moon or near enough & it had a beautiful halo around it.I went out on the patio & managed to get a few decent shots or semi decent anyway! when i down loaded them on to my laptop computer i noticed a couple of rather odd looking ones,i decided to put some on facebook...Within a couple of seconds i got a phone call from my daughter asking me what the odd golden glowing sausage shaped thing was?Thats when i really looked at it & realised it was indeed very strange looking,everything else in the picture was in sharp focus so it seemed unlikely that whatever this thing was,would not be in focus.I took these pictures in the dark & as my garden is quite long & i was stood next to the back door i did not see this thing as i took the picture.Then myself & my daughter noticed another very odd looking photo that was taken quite soon after this first one,it appears to be an apparition of some kind that kind of goes through the rotary washing line in my garden,it appears to have arms & legs! there is nothing growing just there in the garden & when you home in on it,it appears to be made up of orbs,it gives me the creeps to be honest! i have no idea what these things are & as i say i did not see them with my eyes in the garden,only on the pictures afterwards.I have sent this to you because of the glowing,golden object mainly...I did not see or hear any aeroplanes whilst i was in the garden & i think it was approximately about 8.30 pm in the evening.Many thanks for taking the time to read this.I have included a couple of photos.","distance":"20 Feet or

my apt. is in the approach flight path and i was watching with binoculars to identify various flights. i looked straight up and saw white dots and thought they were sky divers but only one descended part way down and then just hung in the sky not moving. i looked for the others to descend but they remained in place. then i saw a little larger white dot and it also just hung in place. using my binoculars i looked back over to the one that descended and it was still in place. through the glasses the object looked a little like a parachute with something white attached below it but i could not quite define what it was. looking back up at the larger object with my glasses i could see a wide bright neon-like red light and above the red was a bright white light, but both were under the body of the object. nothing was moving. as i continued to watch the other smaller objects formed a circle and then disappeared. i looked back again for the descended object but it was gone also. back to watching the larger object again it began to slowly move in a straight line until it moved over the roof of my building and i lost sight of it. i must stress the objects were very high in the sky so i think they must have been very large for me to pick out such detail with my binoculars.The glasses specs are 7x35, wide angle, field 10 degrees, 525 ft at 1000 yds.\r\n\r\ni have been interested

because they joined together, when the flucuating streached about 10 feet long and came to about 10 feet from the top of the left side of the building it stopp-ed as if it ran out of air, but then it broke up again as it shiftted left can for fifteen minutes the thing became larger and when it was half way between me and the building it was an oval and transperant, with a thin black line, tappered from that line from a dark grey to a ligher grey, very distint. it moved like an amebia fluttering on both sides as if it were a jelly fish. when it came over the top of me i was wowed, it had two inner lights, small rectangles; one red and one green. as the lights moved from right to left slowly from the underneath section about two thirds from the center, back and forth, the motion was slow and the movment was about five minutes if you were comparing it to the hands on a clock, just before the light moved they brightened, when they stopped the lights got dimmer, and with each shift the two lights would have more rounded corners, as it brightened its corners were more distinct. i could still see the stars through it and the two lights seemed to leave tiny comet trails that would soon disappear just before the light changed direction. i heard a voice saying they've been watching me, i didn't say anything out loud and in one second i was in side a white ship, there were five people there, two tall, one short and ugly and two that had the big eyes, greys, i said if you are in charge below, i think your doing a bad job, they said the time here was short and the rules for non interference no longer apply. i said explain, they said i was calling them because i had been with them before but i couldn't remember. they said i was to take one of their craft, they called it a project, upon their return so long as i increased my vibration, i hadn't any idea how but now i do. i am to show the world their technology once i can use it and simply ask others if they wish to leave earth for a short period. i agreed and i was like a beam of light right back sitting on the bench. i was excited and tried to grab the attention of two girls chatting away in italian but it was 2:40 am and they would not look up to where i was pointing. the ship moved gradually away and speed off, i stood facing in the oposite direction and in about five minutes five obects came from the south however these objects were rappidly rotating wobbling each in an irregualr pattern, as a high energy object, it had no distict color pattern, it was smaller about 10 feet in diameter round but had spikes all over it with yellow; it had some other colors but fluckuated so fast it was hard to make out whichcolors, perhaps organge, light purple?, each five spheres were in a prefect zig-zag formation and when the five from the  left raced in over the footpath behind me the first obect that had taken me aboard was now just like the others and orb yellow sparkling ball of irregualar light, the five cam from my left and the leader came in more from a twenty degree angle from my right. they began to move slowly and pick up speed then speed off like  a bolt of light. i have a burn on my right hand from them and i was a bit shook up over it because i was followed by humans in pairs at first then in groups and they too were communicating telepathically it was scary because they were discribing me and i could hear them, they were comanding people, avergage train workers to pick up the phone to dicuss me and they all were a man and women team, the women was the translator. i have been contacted again but it was in my sleep and they said prepare for a shift in my dna and that i was special. i wait to report it becaus i had to take it all in. the photo was taken the day after my dream contact and the image in the center was no water drop, in fact i took many pictures and no other objects apeared in the other photos.
