bright lights in the sky, hovering and moving slowlyabout 300 feet above the ground.  as an avid sky watcher, i am familiar with allof the planets and constellations and i know i did not mistake these objects for93venus94 or anything.  the moon was full, high in the sky and the sky was crystalclear.  i thought at first that they might be helicopters, but they were movingin a way that i have never seen a helicopter move...Hovering slowly in a sort ofcircular motion  one of the objects started moving away and i lost sight of it,so i focused on the other.  i had to turn my car around and follow it and itturned from one bright object into a triangular shaped form with three whitelights on each corner of the triangle and a few blinking red lights on it.  ipulled my car over to the side of the road, as did a bunch of other people totry to get a better look.  i rolled my window down to see if i could hearanything, but it was completely silent.  if it was a plane or helicopter, it wasclose enough where i would have definitely heard something.  at this point itwas much lower, probably 75-100 feet off the ground.  it hovered and movedslowly and i continued to watch it for another couple minutes until itdisappeared behind the tree line and i lost sight of it.  because of thelighting on the ground, i had a bit of a difficult time trying to decipher thedimensions, but i would have to guess that it was about 20 to 25 feet in lengthand about 10 feet in height.  it looked like it was black, but being dark, i92m not completely sure.","distance":"101-500

by.  it happened soquickly that it caught me off guard.  when i realized that the object attachedto the white lights was triangular, and large, i watched it for a few secondsand quickly turned onto my street.  at first i thought a big stealth (craft), itjustlooked really big and those lights were bright and had a circular ring aroundthe large round light in the middle of the suction cup.  at that point we weretravelling parallel to each other. it was ahead of me and a little above thetrees.  i sped up and realized it was going faster than it seemed.  at one pointthe trees blocked it and then it reappeared.  by the time i reached the end ofthe street, it started to ascend and bank ever so slightly and easily to theleft.  all the time i could see the four huge suction-cup-like lights underneathit.  one at each point of the triangle and one sort of in the middle.And then it was gone.During all this i was trying to get my cell phone out of my purse to call myfriend to hurry and run into the street, but it fell out of my hands onto thefloorboard.My windows were up and the radio on, so i dont know about the noise.  when ireached the end of the street, there were two neighbors standing on the cornerwith their dogs.  i didnt ask them if they just saw what i saw, i just keptgoing around the block.  i may go down and ask them tonight.That is pretty much it.When i got home, i called my friend, the police, channel 11 (local nbc) and thefernbankscience center.  nobody had any other calls about the object.  my friend saidwhat i described sounded like other sightings in the past three years.I saw a ufo in the late 60s, but it was very different shaped.....Round, with adome on top of it with a bank of windows.  this object was very different, verylarge.

and  regular star gazing.  we live about a half an hour north of toronto, ontario.   it was during my friends 19th birthday party that we were outside of the house  staring at the sky, my fiancee was looking in a westerly direction when she  exclaimed you guys will probably not beleive this but i just saw something  really weird.  well we did beleive her, she said it was roughly triangular  with 2 or 3 running lights.  that got our interest as she also said it was  flying very low, perhaps only a couple of hundred feet up  we began watching  the sky with a renewed interest, and it wasnt very long before we all 6 or 7  of us saw amazing things.  for about the next hour or so we saw what appeared  to be moving starsnot satelites, i know the difference, however they did not  behave like stars.  there were probably about 8 sightings that night, each one  different from the others.  there were single crafts, as well as formation  flying of 3 to 10 different craft at a time.  they were mostly visible as  points of light, but depending on the angle at which they passed us the shape  of the ship was more apparent.  sometimes they appeared to be fling completely  straight, other times they would jink about and wobble.  when they were in  formation, one would be in the lead while 2 or 3 would fly behind the first  swapping positions with each other in almost the same way that canada geese  fly.  occasionally there would be clusters of several individual lights moving  togethersometimes steady points of light other times they would fade in and  out.  except the first sighting of my fianceewhich was very low to the ground,  all the rest were at an altitude that small cessna planes might fly at.  they  were completely silent as we watched them come from the southfrom the toronto  area and pass over the house and continue in a roughly northern direction.   the objects vanished when they got close to the northern horizon.  there was  no vapour trail or any emissions visible.  i must say that for myself i felt  completely elated and overjoyed, feelings that warmed me inside as i watched  open mouthed.Our first sightingsthe one described above happened in march of

very clear and easy to see.  the starwas steady and almost a flourescent white.  it had a red pulsating light in theupper left hand side and a blue pulsating light in the center below the star. these red and blue lights pulsated alternately very quickly.  it seemed likeabout two cyclesl of alternating pulses per second.  also, as i stated in myfirst report, these stars do not move across the

the evening. while coming out our door i noticed a tightcluster of lights with a strobe in the western sky. i went inside to get my 8x35binoculars to have a closer look because this didn92t look like normal aircraft running lights.While looking at the object i realized it was actually two tight clusters oflighta larger one on the left and a smaller one immediately to the right. the one onthe right had the strobe. initially i thought it was a military aircraft with achase plane, but after watching it move, it appeared to be he same object, justilluminated on two different areas of the object.The general direction of flight was north to south from my viewing position atapproximately 20 - 30 degrees above the western horizon. there was very lighthaze outside, but not enough to obscure the stars and the moon. the object madeno sound.Because this aircraft was flying, it changed its position relative to my viewingposition, therefore what i saw also changed. as it flew, the configuration oftwo clusters of lights changed to a triangular configuration, then to a straightline of three lights. a few minutes later it appeared to fly to the southwestand i am assuming directly away from me. the view of the lights at this time was4 or 5 white to yellow-white lights forming a low angle arc. the lights strobedflashed from left to right. there was a haze or aura around it, but i dismissedthis haze due to the general haze in the area. still no sound was heard. novapor trails were left. i observed it until the tree lined obscured viewing. theentire duration was ca.10 minutes. the temperature was 32 f, the barometer was29.783, and the winds were ene at 3 mph.Our location is directly under the path for commercial aircraft flying to andfrom european destinations, these commercial flights are generally directlyoverhead flying at altitude. most of these aircraft can be heard and most leavevapor trails. occasionally we have helicopter traffic performing border patrolduty. the uscanadian border is one mile away. the four nearest airports areedmundston, new brunswick, frenchville, maine, st. leonard, new brunswick, andcaribou, maine. all are for private aircraft. the last aurora activity we hadwas november 2003. loring air force base is closed.Rough sketches will be forthcoming.Thank you.","distance":"Over One
