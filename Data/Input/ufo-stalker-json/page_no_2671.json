fellow citizen.09i thought i was writing him a private letter, but i learned there is no suchthing as a nine-page, private letter written to the president.  the number-10envelope was about an inch thick.  i92m certain the envelope raised eyebrows when it reached the white house - andpossibly, before it got there.09i had serious doubts as to whether i should mail it.  i wanted to be certain iwas doing the right thing by expressing my thoughts.  the letter sat on my deskfor a few days before i finally decided to mail it.09on the way to the post office, a man in an old car with an american flag

letter, avery.9409i wondered, how does he know it92s a good letter  there92s no way he could have read it.09after i mailed the letter, i didn92t think much about it until the following day.  i was on

looked out the front window to the north and noticed what shethought was the aurora borealis. so, she returned to the bedroom to get herglasses and came back, stunned by how beautiful they were she once againreturned to the bedroom, only this time to wake my grandfather. they decided toget a better view and go outside. they were viewing the north from our deckoutside with the cottage behind them

mygrandfather described it to me as more umbrella shaped. it was very large and tothe southeast just over the rear of the camp and the very tall about 50 feetspruce trees behind the camp. they described colourful streams of light floatingdown from the object as how a neon light blub has bubbles through it when itsstarting to burn out. my grandmother and grandfather both saw the

roadway andi just happened to look up at the shy through the rear window of the car and sawthe object.  it was a clear night sky and the object blocked out directly abovestars. it was black and perfectly triangular.  it was maybe 20-30 feet above ourvehicle.  immediately i became excited and started telling my parents to look atthe aliens ship.  they however didnt and were involved in telling me it was aplane from the nearby air national guard.  i remember trying to tell them itwasnt but being unable to explain.  however something told me t was not a plane. it was very slowly moving, just faster than a hovering craft, and it wassilent.  i heard nothing or saw no lights or anything else, just the triangularobject that was jet black against the sky and clearly oultined as a triangle andblocking out my vision of otherwise clearly visible stars.  my father thenpulled onto the main road and i lost sight as we drove away and just felt verycalm about what i had seen.  i just always thought this was wild and alwaysthought about the object, because until the past few years i had never heard oftriangular shaped ufos, only saucer shaped.","distance":"21-100

childwhen i had seen those 3 bright red lights. to start off with i had a telescope,cheap little tasco but it was good enough to view the moon. i had set it upknowing the cold air would allow me to get a clearer view of the moon. whilelooking into the scope i noticed it went dark and then the moon re-appeared.Thinking a leaf or something was blocking my view i pulled away to have a look.I saw it then. please understand i was an air force brat, usaf planes were mylife, and i used to be able to tell you every known aircraft we had. what i sawwas not a usaf plane by no means. i saw this thing pass in front of the fullmoon, it was black and shaped like a triangle, and on all three corners it hadbright red lights. they moved to and fro from the dark object. i called for myfather. he and my sister came out to see what the fuss was about. i pointedupward, matter of fact almost directly above our house. we stood there lookingat this thing, the lights danced around ityou could make out the back triangle shape. my father yelled at us to getinside, now he was very upset at what he was looking at. he called someone onthe phoneat the time i assumed it to be the military police. my sister and i glued ourfaces to the sliding glass door watching the object. we could here siren fromthe sp92s coming, about that time the object shot up and vanished. people came to ourhouse asking questions about what we had seen. i was very adamant about what wehad all seen, i was told i had only seen a plane doing test. i was sent to myroom, being a noisy i listened to the adults speak. i heard them talking aboutothers seeing the object, and to assure us the kids it was only a plane and theywould handle it from there on. my father agreed with them. i know something waswrong with what my father had seen with us, appeared to have recognized what hehad seenthere is a lot more about this thing we had seen - i found out later in life.My father told me things i have dared not tell anyone

road and bearing left onto mobile highway.Shortly after getting through the intersection which only had a couple carswaiting for the light to change sitting perpendicular to us we saw a small lightbehind trees that were a few hundred feet behind the lights rise up straightwith no wobble. i immediately thought it was a helicopter and was not notworried but within seconds literally it rose up above the trees maybe as littleas 50 feet and an intense whitish-blue light that was large in diameter shoneinto our mirrors. we never actually looked back but were very aware this wasnt acar as it isnt near a highway or close to an airport and there werent any carsbehind us going through the intersection. it was obvious to me that i hadnt seenanything like it before. the light was only visible for 5 seconds id say. thenit disappeared and at that point my brother and i both acknowledged seeing itand wondering what the hell it was. this is all in a short amount of time and weare still quite close to the intersection. i have no idea if my brother was evenwatching the road or if the radio was on or if the headlights dimmed. but, theoddest part about this is that almost immediately after we confirmed seeing thelight to eachother, i saw the traffic lights blinking red to green to yellow, onand on. not necessarily in that order but it was only for about 10 seconds andit went back to normal like nothing had happened. we opened the windows andheard nothing. i did notice a car at the light that did not move during thisperiod. we didnt want to just forget about it so we turned around and went backthe way we came watching for anything mysterious. we saw and heard nothing. weare not sci-fi buffs and are not going to be fooled into thinking it was a veryquiet helicopter, if it were we would have heard something. i dont know if thismatters but i mentioned it to a friend online and he said that he has seenlights many times at night and he has been in fl his whole life. he
