jet, there arelights running from nose to tail under the fuselage. same thing with wing tips.Lights all the way across. so i was seeing a cross formation of lights. theceiling was low that evening, im guessing around 500 feet. and this jet wasright at the ceiling. kind of flying in a fog up there. i distinguished no bodyshape at all. just the light pattern.What really got my attention was the factthat i didnt hear the scream of jet engines. just a swoosh sound. like if youwere to shush someone.Shhhhhhhhhhvery quiet indeed. the reason i am reportingthis is because two nights later i hear from a friend at work the wjw tv, foxaffiliate in cleveland, reported on their news channel that there were uforeports out of akron.I didnt see the reports and i dont want to talk to the newschannel but i am curious if what i saw is what was reported. it flew southacross interstate 76 and bypassed akron muninciple airport. to sum it up, youcould say i seen a low flying jet that was going very slow, very quiet, and hadlights galore. there were was one light lower than the rest, like the landinggear was down and there was a light only on one landing gear. as the set oflights approached my position, this is what i seen                      as it got beside my location for a sideview, this is what i seen           then it simply flew out of my view perspective....Total viewing time 3-4

    consistantly spaced as i said to the north for about 1.5 miles.  to the     west there a few houses, the nearest being 1 mile away.  to the south there     is nothing but open pasture or praire with many revenes, gradual hills and     dry creeks.  i guess the nearest house to the south is probably 8 miles as     the crow flies, and not at all visible, with the hilly countour of the     land, from my house. in esscence it is desolate back there and dark at     night.I was home alone the night that we are speaking of and i had eaten some dinnerand layed down on the couch to watch some t.V., as my dogs, all four of them,crashed out on the floor next to me. i dozed off at about 1030 p.M. or so, andawoke shortly after and turned the t.V. off and fell right back to sleep. allfour dogs were sound asleep on the floor in the living room beside me.Some time later, around 130 a.M., i was awakened by my dogs making a few whinysounding short barks and scurrying around the living room.  i thought that theymight need to go outside to relieve their bladders, so i got up and put on myshoes to take them outside.  i stood up and before i could even take one step,all of the dogs ran around

my family were on holidays at the gold coastaustralia and standing in a take away food store waiting for our order.  beingfrom a country town, i was amazed by jumbo jets that would frequently fly overhead.  every time i would hear a jet flying over, i would run out onto thefootpath and look at it flying over.I did this for a while, hearing the jet sound and running out to look at it. then after about the 3rd jet, i heard what i assumed was to be another jet, butwas amazed to see a disc floating just above the road while traffic still drovepast.  this was on a very busy road, so i am sure there must have been otherwitnesses.  what amazed me was that it was just hovering right there over theroad no more than 20ft and almost directly above me.  i was in shock and didntthink to yell out to everyone in the shop to come out and look.One thing i noticed that, even at that young age struck me as peculiar was themulti-coloured lights all around the craft.  they appeared to be standard screwin type incandescent globes we are all familiar with.  i remember thinking wow,they use the same types of lights as us.This very fact has led many to tell me that i must have been mistaken that itwasnt a ufo, that it was a helicopter or something similar.  i know what i sawand it wasnt a helicopter or anything similar.I could see inside through the windows in the top of the craft and it was verybright white.  like it may be lit by flourescent lighting in a perfect whiteroom.  i could not see any inhabitants in the craft.Perhaps it was because i was so young, i dont know, but i did not feel any fear. i was in awe and shocked, but very calm.Probably the strangest thing that i remember about the whole incident, andsometimes disturbs me, is that it made absolutely no sound whatsoever as itgently drifted out of sight over the pacific ocean.  it is odd because it madethe sound of a jet on its arrival, and no sound leaving.  it was like theywanted me to come out and see them.  it is

bluffs and sioux city, i saw a network of high voltagepower lines that crossed the interstate up ahead.  above the power line network,i saw an object that i first assumed was a dark, tobaccobronzebrown jet planethat had just taken off and was climbing to gain altitude. since i was, atleast, thirty or forty miles north of council bluffs and eppley field in omaha,and out in the middle of flat, farm country, i was surprised to see the planeand wondered where it had come from.After driving under the power line network, i began watching the object throughthe front windshield of my car. i was waiting for it to continue climbing andorbank right or left, so that i could see its wing structure and identify theaircraft. it appeared to be less than a mile from my car.  but, as i continuedto drive and watch the object, it remained stationary -- tilted at about a 40degree angle in the sky.  the craft was narrow and elongated, with no wings,props, landing gear, windows, jet wash, or other distinquishing marks, exceptfor a slight bump on each end.I had driven quite a way, watching this object and wondering what it was, when acar passed me at a very high speed on my left.  i immediately looked over at thecar, and checked my position on the highway.  when the car was safely past me,and i looked back up at the object in the sky, i was amazed to see nothing but alarge, intensely-black circle, where the original craft had been.  to myastonishment, the circle quickly diminished in size to approximately one half ofits original diameter, and then completely disappeared   in the few seconds thati glanced away from the craft, it apparently turned up on its side i. e., towhere i was actually seeing the circular bottom of the craft before it eithercloaked itself, or took off at a velocity that apparently exceeded the speed oflight.Needless to say, i was and remain stunned and dumbfounded by what i witnessed. iam a rational 60-year-old, scientifically trained, and not subject tohallucinations.  but i can offer no reasonable explanation for the craft that isaw.  please let me know if there were other reports of a similar craft inwestern iowa on that day, or if other observers have ever seen similar objectsthat simply disappeared.  i would be pleased to talk with any of yourresearchers about this matter.  thank you for your consideration.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

we were about to nail down the last piece of the roof,when i saw a briliant white light behind us from the corner of my eye. i turnedaround saw this object,then grabed my friend and turned him around and showedhim. he instantly became transfixed on the oject and became unresponsive. i didnot know what it was, but it flew like nothing i ever saw before or since.  myreaction was intrigue and fear.  my partner did not have any reaction until itleft, then he was overcome by fear.  our final reaction was to run away.  itshull blended perfectly with the nights sky. it had a brilliant white lightcoming from its entire bottom.  the light coming from the bottom, lit up theimmediate surroundings like if it was daylight. when the object was moving itseemed like it had a long green light on the back of it. the green light wasglowing but not as bright as the white light under it.  the object came down ata steady pace until it came to a hover approximately 18-20 feet from the ground,40-50 feet directly in front of us.  it stayed in that exact position for approx30 seconds. it did not make any sound or stir up any dirt or debris.  then itstarted to rise and move toward the tree line to our right. it moved over thetree line into the woods and did what i would call a u-turn and headed backtowards us again. approximately 30 seconds after going over the tree line itcame back to a hover at the exact place it hovered before.  then after hoveringfor about 15-20 seconds it started to rise and move towards our left which wassouth. it continued to rise until its white light blended with the stars, thenwent out of sight. it maintained a slow steady pace during all these movements.Maybe 5 miles per hour when maneuvering in front of us increasing the speedduring its departure. this is not a joke","distance":"21-100
