i walked about 70 yards up agravel drive to a clearing that over looks the river and into ky.Ther were noboats or anything that i could see or hear.Thats when i could see a faint glowacross the river into ky.My first thought was that it was some mil aircraft thati have seen now and then flying along the river and the surounding area.Butthere was no sound and it really dident look like any kind of

tocome closer but never seemed to get out above the river.I watched them for aabout 30min or so then they started to move east in and out of the trees when ilost sight of them.I know that it sure

pulled over in a church parking lot to the left side of the hwy and the object turned from vertically up and down to horizontally. i was going to get my binoculars from my bag and noticed children playing in the parking lot so i went on down the hwy and turned into the old orba plant driveway, as i was getting out of my jeep to get my binoculars the pointed end of the object turned our direction, altho it was moving the redish glow which i thought was a reflection of the sun never moved the glow stayed constant as i was digging thru my telescope bag for the binoculars my fiancee yelled it's moving i looked and the object appeared to be moving in reverse away from us slowly i got my binoculars out and was removing them from the pouch and walking around to drivers side to avoid being hit by cars, i had just got to the side ofthe car and it vanished. it didn't fly off or move it just vanished right in front of my eyes...Me and my fiancee were breathing heavy the kids wanted

looked west at the sound. i saw this luminious cloud with the aircraft flying by it. my first thought was ha, someone called in a ufo report on a lenticular cloud. then i was puzzled because the cloud was too low and too bright to be a lenticular cloud in a beautiful, clear blue sky. one of the planes i could tell it was a jet fighter by the radically swept back wings then seemed to fly straight at the cloud and it surprised me as the cloud was bright and seemed like a form of energy or something. as the fighter got close, the angles changed, and the plane went 150 to 200 ft. below the cloud. the clouds edges were very defined, not fuzzy, and it was about 4 1/2 times as long as it was thick, and almost horizontal when first witnessed. the color was something i have never seen, possibly best described as a silver blue. the color was perfectly even throughout, not lighter or brighter along the edges, nor darker in the center. it was bright in the daytime sky. no additional lights were seen. after the close flyby of the plane, the cloud began a slow rotation from the horizontalto a vertical position, taking 30 sec. to a minute, and began moving in a straight line to the west, on its edge or end. i assumed it to be disk shaped while looking at it, but realized later it could have been a disk or triangle seen edge on, or even a cigar shape. the lines along the length were very straight and the ends were curved. it was at least six times as long as the fighters flying close by. one of the planes left the site and flew near my house at about 1500 ft. altitude. i looked closely at the plane and identified it as a dark charcoal-gray colored f-16. the f-16s heading was e-se. there were still two f-16s flying back and forth from north to south between me and the cloud while the cloud continued moving west. the air was calm, at least at ground level. the other two f-16s never flew towards the cloud, always back and forth behind it, seemingly checking the atmosphere the cloud passed through, staying14 to 12 mile behind it. the event lasted at least 15 to 20 minutes. i watched the cloud until it was very small, bb sized, and the f-16s were still flying back and forth behind it. i could no longer make out the planes, but could still see their exhaust highlighted by the setting sun, appearing orange-yellow. the cloud remained a silver-blue like color, with no hint of orange. it was by then very low above","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

flown past the object, or birds seeming to pop out of nowhere from the blurry area-field of somekind around this thing.  the birds that seem to me to interact with these objects are either large hawk

theplanet mars  this was way different in appearance","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

was flying overhead above the house. the object wasvery enormous, football feild size, and jennifer was standing outside with herbrother jesse and his girlfriend nicole. i was a police officer then and ireported the object to the local police department.  the object moved from thekeams canyon direction toward the bittersprings area in a matter of 15-20 min.Very quiet moving and this was a daylight sighting around 5 pm in the evening intown with a population of about 8000 people. as soon as i reported it we saw 2military jets follow the object and later 2 helicopters flying from theflagstaff, arizona area toward the page, arizona area after the oject.  i knewit was a ufo because nothing in the world is rectangular and can fly.  i andeveryone around were stunned with silence, unfortunately no videocamera orcamera at the time, i was too excited too se my very first ufo we watched theobject fade away into the distance.  the bottom of the object had what lookedlike mechanical parts, pipes, conduits, boxes, etc.  i can only describe it aslooking at the undercarriage of a car.  the heighth of the object seemed toappear to be 2 stories high, very rectangular, with sharp corners.  no wings orpropellers. i am randy.  i have a grandmother whom does not speak a word ofenglish, she is a novajo elder whom lives in the woods alone with mygrandfather. she stated that she has seen the new people who live in the heavenson several occassions. she was asked during a family gathering, by my uncle,what she does alone the woods to pass her time each day, to everyones shockingsurprise she said she waves to the star people that land in the woods sometimesduring the day while she tends the folk.  she stated that they only wave to herfrom the distance and they appear to look like children, she was given a sheetof paper and asked to draw the beings and she drew a grey. she asked us whatthey were and who they are, our only explaination to her is that they live faraway beyond the stars and that she is lucky to be choosen to see one up close.Some of our family members have seen many  silvery flying disks in the navajomountain area, especially near the canyon

sunset boulevard in los angeles at about 9pm.  we werefacing south looking out at the city when my friend pointed to his right andsaid jokingly, here comes a ufo.  i looked to the west and there was an objectapproaching on the horizon.It was lights in a v-formation heading directly toward the bar.  the lights werenot bright but muted.  the formation looked like a flock of geese.At first i thought is was some sort of plane heading to us.  then as itapproached i noticed that the rear lights in the formation were in constantmotion switching positions.  this caused me to think that maybe the lights fromthe city were simply reflecting off the underside of a flock of birds in flight.The lights approached and then flew directly over the bar.  whatever theobjectswaswere completely silent and the rear lights appeared to be in constantmotion swithching positions.  the air was slightly hazy so it was impossible totell if the lights were a part of single object or each an independent aircraft. whatever it was relatively large and the open end of the v appeared to be thewidth of a normal aircraft wingspan.  i have no idea on the height of the objectbut would guess 5,000-7,000 feet.I stood to follow the object over the bar as it continued northwest and thenlost sight of it as it passed over the hotel and beyond.My initial reaction was to look for a logical explanation but none could befound.  i live in texas and have seen flocks of birds in v formation millions oftimes and these were not birds.  also the motion of the rear lights was almostmechanical not the motion of birds.It was not a normal plane because it was completely silent and the lights werein motion, something that doesnt even happen with the v shaped stealth aircraft. my friend and i went through various scenarios but none fit, it was trulyunexplainable.Its my opinion that what we saw was not from outerspace but some new technologyfrom our government.  the direction of the craft was from the pacific headingnorthwest toward nevada.  this may seem far fetched but i think the governmenthas created some new means of moving aircraft without noise and without normalaircraft parts.  i think the moving lights were somehow being used to stablizethe aircraft as it flew.I am at a loss and am wondering if anyone else saw something in the air over losangeles on the night of october 14th.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

minutes.  itappeared to get larger and was moving in my direction.I got very excited and ran out of the room and went outside.  this was ratherodd behavior so my husband followed me.  it flew right over our heads.  therewas no sound and you could almost walk under it and keep pace. this seemedamazing because of the sheer mass of it.  then from the about the same directiona small fast jet appeared out of nowhere and flew on a parallel path,at a much higher altitude and flew out of sight.  you could heat the jet.  thelarge uap just floated slowly and silently along. then it disappeared behind amountain.We live in a major flight corridor so i am familiar with all types of aircraftflying overhead. military and civilian  especially at night because i am astargazer.Strange thing, almost a year later, new years day, about 3am, our neighbors leftour house after spending the night watching movies.  we watched them across thestreet as they walked home and all of a sudden they were pointing to the sky. myhusband and i went outside and watched the same type of uap, on almost the sametrajectory, floating overhead.  strangely i said it is just our resident alien. no, we had not had any alcohol or anything else that night and the movie wewatched was casper.  our neighbors were two adults and a ten year old child.The flight path is more accurately ese going nnw. both times.  my
