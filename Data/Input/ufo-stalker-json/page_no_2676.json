i have to find out what is stored, if anything, inmy mind.91lkean@ix.Netcom.Com92 and paufo@westol.Com were the two e-mails that were sent 10-14-2003. they areas followsplease help me with the suspected trajectory. if the path is where i suspect,then i can offer a very interesting account. there were six of us kids campingin a tent in our backyard. then it slowly became high noon. it was approaching1130 pm. i was sent from the tent to get a power cable to watch a localcleveland tv program. as i unzipped the tent, i saw the back of the house getbrighter and brighter. i stepped out and looked behind us. what happened nexthas changed my life. ever since then, i have asked only my brother about it. heseems to shrug it off. he was with the remaining four that only saw it pass thehouse tops and chased it to the front yard only to see what appeared to be ameteor. i was the first and stared right into it. my cousin kenny followed meand just caught it before it passed over the house. anyway, if the eventcoincides with the trajectory, time of year and time of night, then maybe i holdsomething for you. i am an artist. ever since then, i have excelled. my visualmemory of how it looked has not faded. it is almost as if something is waiting.I have really never told anyone, except an occasional girlfriend or buddy. but ifeel that there is a very strange point to this that might surprise anyone whowill not ridicule me. i am a professional designer and account representativeand would not want to put my job in jeopardy. i will secretly go under. there ismore. afterwards, at night, lights would appear in the field behind the house. ithought that they were flash lights looking for something until they penetratedthe bedroom wall and that is where i wake up every time. i was around five orsix. maybe i can helpthen again maybe you can help me get rid of this haunting memory that hassecretly consumed me for well over 37 years.I just looked at the sight after i wrote my first letter to you and saw thedate. it was dated december if my event took place in our backyard in a tent, itwas warm and maybe later. the lights that kept coming back were what please helpme find out. the object i witnessed was heading due east. the address that ispoke of when it was seen was 3522 clarks mill road, norton, ohio 44203. i donot live there now. some of my relatives

house is on the east side of terre haute, indiana and the airport is on the far east side of terre haute. i got out of my car and started looking at the stars becasue i am very interested in space and ufology. i thought to my self that it would be interesting if i saw a ufo. to my surprise i noticed a bright whirling object coming slowly from the east it was moving in a westerly direction. my girlfriend walked next to me and asked what is that i said i think it's a ufo then the object stopped and hovered directly in front of us at tree top level. the object was about 30 to 50 feet away from us. for some strange reason we felt like the object was studying us as well as we were studying it. the object hovered for about 45 seconds and them started moving slowly to the west. then all of a sudden it shot out of sight in about 2 seconds. the object was white in color, but it was whirling and made no noise at all unlike a heliocopter. i have been around planes all my life, but i have never observed a craft like this. when we saw the craft, my girlfriend and i both had goose bumps on our arms and had a feeling of helplessness, but elation that we had seen this object. i have always wanted to see a ufo and i got my chance. i must say that it has changed my life in some ways. i have alwaysbelieved that there wer other beings in the universe, but this confirmed my belief. i must say that i believe sightings may run in families. my father was flying his beechcraft bonanza near hulman airport the same airport that i was in close proximity to when i sighted  my ufo, about 40 years ago and he came home stating the a bright object almost collided with his plane. he reported it to the tower, but i do not know what happened after that i did not report my sighting becuase i was afraid there would be repercussions if i reported it to the authorities. if i had to do it over again i would have reported it. my fathers brother was a farmer in hume, il and he was driving his tractor out in his field in the same year i encountered my ufo, in 1982, which i feel is strange. he told me tha","distance":"21-100

shape with five lights that picked out atriangular chevron pointed towards the direction of travel, and a sixth light inthe middle of the configuration. all lights were steady and didnt blink orflash.  the object was moving very fast - faster than a helicopter or passengerjet but looked big - larger than a low altitude helicopter or small jet. twostriking things about it aside from the completely unfamiliar lightconfiguration when compared to civil or military aviation lights was the speedat which it travelled without producing any audible sound - comparable to a lowfighter jet perhaps. however, the apparent size of the object when consideredwith its speed makes this unlikely. it then travelled into the cloud base which,while thin, was enough to conceal it. the whole time of the sighting was about 8seconds. the craft did not seem to change direction at all.Although gauging distancesize in the night sky is very hard to do, it leaves twohard questions that cannot apparently be explained by known craft. the speed ofits travel was so fast and so noiseless that it defies standard explanation whenconsidered with the apparent size of the craft. it was one of the biggest thingswe have ever seen in the night sky.I am surprised that anyone would be flying such a craft in largely clearconditions so low over a town. hardly very secretive, although likely to settongues wagging.I

but noticed that theobject was not moving. it had no wings or protusions and it appeared that thesun was able to reflect off of it.This lasted for some minutes until the object slowly drifted northwest acrossthe sky. i was still unable to figure out what it was.Once again, my sons friend pointed out two other similar objects stationedfurther out on the horizon. at this point, all three objects were distanced fromeach other by miles of skyline. one of the objects out on the horizon driftedslowly towards our direction, but still not close to the first one.My attention eventually turned back to our backyard activities and by 600 p.M.,the objects were nowhere to be seen.In viewing the national ufo reporting center website, i noticed that two reportsfiled by other witnesses describe similar objects that we saw. a report on 81603from chandler, ar describes similar activities we were doing and reports thattheir objects were seen at almost the exact same time we saw ours another reportgiving an event date as 92003 describes exactly the same objects we saw.Perhaps someone can give us an explanation as to what we saw that day.","distance":"Over One
