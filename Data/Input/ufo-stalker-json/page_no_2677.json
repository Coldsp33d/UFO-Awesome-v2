a jobsite when a bright silvery light caught my attentionas it rose over a tree line about 300 away. it rose slowly but steadily until iteither went behind a cloud or through it. i estimate the clouds were 1 to 2thousand feet...It came thru the clouds and continued to a point that would beabout 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. i thought it may have been a planelanding light...But i was too close to hartsfield airport for a plane to be onthat north to south route. as the object reached the peak it stopped and justsat there. i told my mother on the phone that i think im having my first ufoexperienceand became very interested in the object. i took out mybinoculars,switched off the engine and steadied them on my open door. the binoc.Are a 16x50 bushnell...I brace and focused on the object. it was clearly aspherical object, cream colored and hovering..The perimeter of the object seemedto shimmy a little but i think that may have been the binoculars. i told my callwhat was happening and out of nowhere a second object appeared at a 50 or 60degree above and to the east of 1. 2 moved downward....Stopped..Accended to itsoriginal elevation then stopped...Then 1slowly approached 2..At arms lenght i would say they were about two fingersapart...They moved in unison to the east, stopped,then very slowly moved to thes.W. thats when i realized i needed a witness..I saw a heavy equipment operatornorth of me..I got into my vehicle...Drove about 200 watching all the time. justas i got near the operator the objects winked out of sight..","distance":"Over One

noclouds.  the star attracted my attention due to a pronounced twinkling effect,and what i saw as a rapidly changing colors red, green, white, blue, purple. the light was located over the top of a local mountain, and appeared to be athigh altitude.  when i first saw the star, i noticed briefly a similar flashinglight on the plain in front of the mountain the view from the window is quiteextensive for many miles. this ground light disappeared.  after watching thelight in the sky for 10 minutes through low-power binoculars, i videotaped theobject for some time on a hitachi ntsc 8mm video camera with x400 digital zoom.I have a video of over ten minutes. it remained in the sky for at least onehour, when i tired of watching it.  i suspected it was a star, high altitudeballoon, or satellite reflection that was being colored by an atmosphericphenomenon such as ice crystals.   however, when i viewed the tape the next day,i am not certain this is the explanation. the colors and

that i realised the significance.  theweather was very clear and the moon very bright, and, i have to admit, quiteblue itself, so my heartfelt belief is that it was a shooting star, and a trickof the light made it appear to be oval-shaped and blue.  it could not have beenany terrestrial object as it was very far away and covered such a distance inthe sky it would have had to be either travelling at abnormal speeds, or indeeda meteor travelling outside the atmosphere.  however, should it have turned outto be something else, i did not want to report this after such a discovery  ithink you know

moved in perfect triangular formation very, veryslow no noise, like a dead calm. they circled right over head staying in a perfect formation,scott ran home to get a telescope. i watched them move slowly torwards s. mountain then picking up speed. once over s. mountain one shot off to the left torwards space the other two shot right in a flash torwards space at an unbeliveable speed. by the time scott got back they were gone. i have only told this to family. i try to watch every program that stanton friedman is on this ismy first time for telling this to any one outside the family. i believe 3 days after this their was an article in the paper that somewhere in the middle east some people saw the exact same thing we saw. this happend a long time ago but i remember it like yesterday. till this day i have not seen any thing on earth like i saw that night. thank you tony sasso","distance":"501 Feet - 1

calm, with little to no wind.While in my backyard stargazing with my telescope iwe observed a very brightapprox. magnitude2b1.093double-flashing94 pulse of light. this was observed 7 times in total over a 25min period in anarea of the sky covering approx. 10deg n to s and 5deg e tow and more or lesscentered on the star altair, in the constellation aquila.While targeting an area of sky near altair through my telescopes telrad finderin order to start sweeping the sky to visualize the dumbbell nebula m27 i firstobserved the93double-flashing94 pulse of light approx. 1-2deg n of altair. i initially dismissed thisobservation as being the effect of some sort of visual aberration or otherinconsequential anomaly. approx. 1-2min later i observed the93double-flashing94 pulse of light again. this time it was located 1-2deg sw of locate were itwas first observed. at that time i went to the house to get my significant otherin hopes that she would also be able to witness this light  confirm my previousobservations. almost immediately upon returning to my telescope we both observedthe93double-flashing94 pulse of light, and it was observed again by both of us 2-3min later. mysignificant other witnessed a third93double-flashing94 pulse of light, but i missed this one as i was looking elsewhere.Additionally, i witnessed 2 more93double-flashing94 pulses of light the last coming at 925pm pdt. these were seen alone as mysignificant other had returned to the house.Again, all of the observations were made in 10deg x 5deg area of the sky, over a25-30min period. the light itself was more or less pinpoint like that of a star,bright white to slightly bluish-white in color, and pulsed 2 times every time itwas observed. the best way that i can describe it is how we have been taught apulsar would look like. it did not appear to have any movement, either constantor random, but rather just pulsed in a different location of the aforementioned10deg x 5deg93box94. there was no sound associated with the light whatsoever, as it was anexceptionally quiet that evening.Of note both myself and my significant other also observed 2 separate satellitesthat evening one tracking w to e  the

i wassurprised by a bright white light, shining down at the tree-top level.  it wasapprox. 10 feet in diameter, a disk, with solid light shining down from itsentire bottom.  it made no sound, but moved a foot or two from side to side. its light made many shadows through the trees and they, the shadows all moved,hence movement by the craft.  it was about 250 feet away from me, and my friendswere behind me some 300 feet.  as they were all new engineers, too theoryminded, i wasted no time going back to tell them to see.  i walked slowlytowards the craft, through the woods.  i was going to walk right into and underthe light.  i never got closer than 100 feet.  the light was so bright that inever could actually see the craft itself.  also i was looking through trees,although thin.  at about 100 feet away the craft stopped moving and simplydisappeared!  the light went out and there was no evidence of it.  when iexamined the ground moments later.  i watched this light for

location: marina del rey, caonly a few minutes prior to my neighbors call, id gone to bed in the forwardv-berth of my 30 catalina sailboat on which i live aboard. when leslie scottogalbreath called me by phone with alarm in his voice, i was surprised to findhim reporting a ufo to me (i voiced my doubt as to his sincerity because scottois a comedian who constantly uses my interest in ufos as material for routine comedic assassinations of my character). he reiterated that he was not kidding and that i should come topsideimmediately for a look. i popped the hatch over my head and moved upward on deckto see something which made absolutely no sense whatsoever:above me nearly 90 degrees but slightly north and heading directly overhead tothe south-southwest was a brightly lit array of lights which looked like theywere configured to an invisible structure which all connected to what appearedto be a central jet aircraft. flying at about 15 to 18 thousand feet, theatmospheric bounce seemed to illuminate the bottom of what looked like a typicaljet, but that is where typical ended.There is always jet noise from being very close to lax.. this was the case asthis object went over.  there were other jets in the area. what sound i mighthave attributed to this object would not be accurate based on���our proximity to los angeles airport.  to the right and left side of this central craft was a formation of whatlooked like rotating red navigational beacons.  to the right were a series ofthree outboard beacons, the first one being the only one that was not rotating,constant, and red. each beacon was equally spaced on either side of this craft.The distance from each beacon to one another was at least three full wingspansof the central crafts main wingspan. that wingspan was approximately mythumbnail width at arms length. relative to the central craft, none of theserotating red lights moved independently of one another as if to be fixed to somesuperstructure and connected somehow to the central craft.  to the left of this craft and starting outboard at the same distance as theright side were approximately six of these beacons making the left wing appear much longer.  at the farthest outboard end of the left side formation wasa smaller white light trailing behind its respective leader as if it were beingdragged by this leading edge beacon.  this gave the impression that this wingwas squared off at the left end.  the distance from these two lights whichformed this termination was about four fuselage lengths of the central craft. there did not appear to be any visible structure to the larger wing formed bythese outer beacons, though, there was absolutely no variation in spacingvisible which might have been caused by independent buffeting from windturbulence or speed differences. these beacons and lights seemed fixed to arigid but invisible framework.Each red rotating beacon seemed larger than what it should have appeared to havebeen for its distance and did not seem to be attached to the bottom ofanything like individual fighter aircraft or the like.  they looked like they were just oversizedflying red beacons, clear and bright.  i dont remember anything significantabout what should have been normal sized navigational lighting on the centralcraft.If there was a \"superstructure\" to this formation, the sweep angle of the mainwing from the central crafts leading edge was the source for any \"attachment\". this formations angle might have been pitched slightly forward of the angle ofthe central craft wings leading edge.The reasoning for such a configuration made no sense.  any superstructurenecessary to keep such a formation fully fixed in place as it appeared, wouldhave been ripped apart by air turbulence from the speed this craft traveled at. on the other hand, if there was a much larger main craft partially \"cloaked\",then this would explain such an odd sighting.The duration of our sighting was approximately a minute and a half until this configuration of lights and craft movedout of sight to our south southwest.  that path would have taken it directlyacross the western end of the lax active runways. we watched these lights from our different positions in the marina about 30yards from each other. scotto was watching through binoculars with our mutualfriend larry hansen.Since that night mufonla has received at least two additional reports fromdifferent cities within la county. these are hawthorne and silverlake. thewitness in silverlake took several seconds of videotape. our director ofinvestigations will assign an independent investigator to these reports and,because im an artist, i will also illustrate what i witnessed.Mark hunzikerstate section director, mufonlawilliam h casey wrote: this is the other report of apparently the same object over silverlake afew minutes after the fist sighting. mark also saw the same object fly over hissailboat in the same time frame, but i dont have the details of his sighting.I talked to the witness (jesus guzman) last night and he would be happyto show us the few seconds of video that he took. i left a message with ralph tocall jesus (what a thought...Lol) as soon as possible. i will be out of town for a week beginning tomorrow, so ann, if you areavailable, please coordinate this. since steve has volunteered for the hawthornesighting, maybe he

airplane at first. we were all pretty impressed with its massive size and we kept the object insight.  it traveled north to south, appearing to follow the coastline, and wekept sight of it until it was too far away to see in the southern horizon.  it was totally silent and seemed to glide slowly across the sky.  this occurred at about 10:15 p.M.
