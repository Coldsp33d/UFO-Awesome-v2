it had happened only yesterday.  since the sightingincident, i have spent twenty years in the air force working at variousassignments involving operations and command and control of aircraft andsatellites.  after my retirement in 1979, i worked with lockheed corporations,ford aerospace, and martin marietta as an engineer, or in a management capacityon various satellite programs and the space shuttle program.  after all theyears that have passed since the sighting and all my experience in the aerospaceindustry96 nothing has happened that would make my wife and i change my mind about thenature of what we saw that day.It was 1959 and in the month of march.  my wife pat and i had been married forthree months and both of us were barely over the age of eighteen.  it was almostdusk and we were returning from a visit to a friends house to see the couple92s newly born baby.  we were in south el monte california.  el monte, at thetime was a small town of less than twenty thousand people located aboutseventeen miles east of the los angeles civic center  along what is now i10. south el monte was an area on the outskirts of el monte proper that consisted ofmostly open fields, older homes and a few small farms.  we were driving up peckroad with almost no other traffic around us.  it was a clear day with verylittle cloud cover and the area street lights had not yet come on for the night. we  first saw the vehicle  moving slowly parallel to the road we were on andmoving in the same direction.  it was very low, less than two hundred feet offthe ground and  traveling over the power lines along the side of the road.  itwas circular in shape and about the size of a boeing 707.  the surface of thecraft was made of a dark metal that seemed to absorb all light and appeared tobe the flattest black imaginable.  around the saucer shape92s edge where white lights that flashed like sequential strobe lights.  at thetop and center of the craft was a red light and in the same position on theunderside was a green light that remained constantly on.  the lights, whilebright, did not reflect on the surface of the vehicle.  at this time, we wereapproximately 50 yards from it and could hear no sound coming from it.  let meemphasize this was not just a strange light high in the sky, nor was it ablurred ball of light, or in any way organic.  this was an actual, physicallyapparent vehicle obvious","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

with the binoculars i saw that they all were flashing dimmer than the one larger one that changed color and position on the sphere. the dimmer lights seemed to be pulsating in different colors all over the sphere. i asked my wife for our video camera and believe that i have a tape of a segment of it. the 8mm camera that i have is old so it only has a 8 zoom. we watched the sphere for about 15

ahead of me  above the road - the bright lights and sizeof the object were impossible to miss.  i slowed down  tried to determine if theobject was moving, but it was hovering in one place above the road.  iconsidered calling 911, but could not take my eyes off of the aircraft. it was acylinder shaped object hovering in a vertical position and  was as large orlarger than a commercial airliner.  it had one large round white light at thetop and one large round red light at the bottom.  the lights were so bright thatit was difficult to see any other details about the craft.  it hovered over theroad and then rotated clockwise until the red light was on top.  it then movedto one side of the road and hovered again  rotated to a horizontal position andthen back to a vertical position.  it moved again to the opposite side of theroad and what appeared to be an arm or wing came out from the side of the craft. this had a red light on the end and smaller red lights pulsating in a circularmotion around it so that now the craft looked sort of l shaped.  a white beam oflight shot out of the end of the arm and i could see it moving around on theground.  the craft moved always in a horizontal fashion around and the beam wasshining around on the ground.During this time, traffic was slowed to 25-30 mph because it appeared that wewere all watching.  some vehicles pulled over and some people were getting outof their vehicles.  i kept driving slowly southbound and watched the entire way. as i traveled southward, the craft moved west out over mountainview lake.I lost sight of

lookedover to my left about 9pm est and saw two red orange lights bigger then i haveever seen that quickly spread outwards into about 10 lights in each directionand then converged into two lights as if lining up and it got extremely brightin the sky and then there was a flash of sparklers that cannot be compared tofireworks and then disappeared. it looked very much like a calculated formation.I grew up on military installations most my life and understand seeingformations, but i have never seen anything like this ever. the lights were toobright to be planes and do not look like anything i have ever seen in the skybefore. they werent flares because i have seen every type of flare with myfather in the military and it was too high to be a flare and there was no trail.The lights were about about 8 times brighter then mars. shortly after theformation, the lights would show up singular or with three in formation neareach other and then blink out. on one occassion the light stayed on for a
