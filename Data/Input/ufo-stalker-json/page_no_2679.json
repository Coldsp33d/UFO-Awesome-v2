a friend whose parents had just built a nice newhouse in a canyonnorth facing side west of rapid city some 10-15 miles. we weresitting outside on the back porch enjoying the cool of the evening and had justcracked open our beers. jordan, our host, got up to visit the restroom and onhis way, the power went out. we laughed as he stumbled in the dark and cursedout loud.I now wonder how he managed to hit his mark, but perhaps he sat thatone out my wife and i were listening to the porcupines grumbling at each otherwhen i commented that the wind was coming up. she asked how i knew, and i saidthat i could hear it in the treetops. i did find it odd that i could not see thetreetops moving, yet the wind sounded to be drawing closer. i got up and movedaway from the house, my curiosity piqued. the noise of wind was definitelygetting closer and louder. i cast my gaze upwards and to the east, the apparentdirection of the noise. in that instant i saw a large black triangle movingtowards us over the treetops. it was entirely unlit except for the reflectedglow of a partial moon. it appeared to be turning to the south-west and my wifeand i observed it until it vanished over the roofline of the house. its apparentspeed was in the 250-350 knot range, not terribly fast, and just as a guess ithad a 180-200ft wingspan. my jaw gaped in astonishment, and my wife wasfrantically asking what that was. i had no reply for her, and was standing inwonderment when jordan came out of the house. i related what had just occurredto him and he was at first incredulous, then miffed that he had missed out onseeing it. some minutes latermaybe 3 or 4the lights came back on. some minuteslater, lights further up the canyon were observed coming back on. just as aninteresting side-note, the next morning, i was extensively questioned by jordansfather about the event. he seemed very interested in my account, which is nottoo surprising when one understands that he is a lifelong pilot and a colonel inthe air national guard, special assistant to the adjutant general of southdakota, stationed at ellsworth afb, a sac b-1 bomber base. he also consultedregularly at the pentagon as part of his regular duties. knowing all this, andhe having finished questioning me, i asked him directly if he had any knowledgeof what i had seen. his only reply was a small laugh and a big smile.","distance":"101-500

aroundfor it. i spotted what looked like two puffs of white smoke towards the east, ithought it might be a couple of clouds but one of them was wobbling, i thoughtmy eyes were playing tricks on me, since i was asleep a few minutes ago, so istared a little longer, the second cloud wobbled too, i must be nuts, becauseboth were stationary, i decided to go to the front of my house to get adifferent angle away from the citrus trees. still in the same spot, both objectsbegan to move upwards together, wobbling and circling around each other at anamazing speed, they would stop shortly and begin to move again in the samemanner.  i called my neighbor art, screaming for him to come out, by the time hecame out the objects were still climbing at about 80 degrees, but he could stillsee them wobbling and changing direction and circling each other, he was asexcited as i was. art wears glasses so he couldnt see the objects once theyreached 90 degrees, but i have 2020 vision and i observed them for

movedabout the speed a satellite would in the sky. after a moment, it stopped andchanged directions again, this time back south. at least, i took that to besouth. in reality, because it was so high up, it looked like it was moving downand up with up being south. then it stopped again and moved in a comparativelyvery slow circle in the sky. it did a similar pattern in terms of movementanother one or two times that is, changing directions and then doing a smallcircle. eventually, it was too faded for us to see, though erhan thought he sawit much closer to the north horizon about 30 seconds

where we came out, faced south.  a road ran east-west infront of the building.My friend and i had just closed up the restaurant and were walking to my car. it was about 1130 at night.  the car was parked right next to the building onthe east side.  a light in the sky, directly above and slightly north, caught myeye and i looked up, thought it was a street light, and continued walking.  theni realized that it couldnt be a street light.  the closest street lights were atleast 200 feet east and 75 feet west  of us, both lights being on our right sideas we faced east.  everything behind the retaurant, going north should have beendark and unlit.When i looked up again, i could make out a big 100-125 feet triangular shapedobject, with three white lights, hoovering in the sky, slightly above treetoplevel, and i called to my friend to look up.  i could see its silhouette againstthe clear sky, and could make out that it was a dark color.  i dont remember ifit was dull or shiny.The object faced east, i guess.  there was one light on this end, and one lightat each of the other two corners.  all of the lights were white and bigger thana fifty-cent piece but not as big as a folded dollar bill.  i remember thinkingthat i could see why i thought it was a street light.  it was the same color andbrightness, and it took a few seconds for me to realize what i was looking at. i dont remember what kind of light they cast, but it was enough for me to seethe object pretty clearly.My friend and i watched it hoover for a couple or three minutes, then it startedmoving east, toward the intercoastal waterway, which was about 1 mile from us. we stopped at the railroad tracks 100 feet from the restaurant, watched itapproach, then began following it.We followed it all the way to the water, driving about 10-15 mph.  we beat it tothe water by 4 or 5 minutes, then watched it approach.  it kept a steady speedand height from the time it first started moving to when we lost sight of it. we watched it go out over the water on its way to topsail beach, directly east.There were no boats or barges on the water.  there was a trailer park near wherewe parked, but we didnt see or hear anyone else.  we didnt see any other trafficeither, but it was late at night, and it was a rural area.My friend and i went home afterwards, thinking it was a pretty cool thing wedseen, but, for some reason, not feeling like it was a big deal.  strange,because we w","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

looking over sprague lake at the glacier creekstables in estes park colorado.  i always looked at the night sky because it isso clear in the mountains you can see everything but, that night i noticed alarger, brighter star right above the treeline that kinda glowed in a white-ish,yellow light.  because of the unusual coloring i kept checking the skyline inbetween conversations when i noticed another identical light right next to thefirst and they both continued hovering over the treeline.  when i saw the secondlight, i did not take my eyes off them at that point. it was almost as if theycould tell i was watching them because after watching them both for only a fewseconds more that at the same time they flew straight up into the night sky likeshooting stars only they went straight up instead of accross or down  like ashooting star and then they disappeared into the atmosphere.  i was filled witha feeling of nervousness and excitement because i live for experiences like thatand feel that i was very lucky to have witnessed a rare sight like that and nomatter if people belive me or not, i love to tell that story.  oh, by the way, ialso have a picture taken through my telescope

canyon idaho on friday night just before 1200midnight just after setting up camp at oxbow reservoir on the snake river innorthwestern idaho.Ib4ve always watched the night sky just like others on this forum looking forcomets and craft and have seen many single bright objects that have performedodd things such as move across the sky and then stop and sit there and twinklelike a star as if to fool anyone or anything looking up.This time is different and has profoundly changed me forever.On friday night on august 1st, 2003 at just before midnight, my girlfriend, herdaughter and myself rolled in to oxbow idaho and set up camp at the copperfieldrv park which is donated and cared for by idaho power for touristb4s and local folk to enjoy and use for fishing and various other summer timeactivities for a small over-night fee. i know this area extremely well. it hassuperb viewing for astronomers as well as itb4s elevation is at 3500 feet and there are no city lights near this remotelocation.I specifically went there to relax, fish and enjoy the stars as it is a favoriteplace of mine to go and do just that.On this night, the skies were clear and dark and perfect for looking up as themilky way was highly visible and the stars numbered into the trillions itseemed.We had just sat down and were facing east from this location which is located atprecisely the 45th parallel and were looking up and saying wow, look at all thestars.There was a small amount of icewater left in my water bottle as i fixed my eyeson a point of light at about 65-70 degrees up and to the east that caught myeyes immedeately.My full attention was on it as it grew brighter from its first pin-prick ofbrighter and whiter than normal appearance. i watched in shock as it grew andfell out of the sky at us and then exploded into a flower of 3 triangles and 1diamond on its side, all the while, i was now screaming do you see that oh mygodat this point, i had stood up and walked around the picnic table andapprehensively walked towards it as if to try to change my view while in shockto make sure it was really what we were seeing.It was real.Now, as these things reached an altitude of what

skies and humidity arriving at kern cattle and landcampground due south of soda lake at 1800 hours while several thunderstormsystems tracked east toward fresno.Weather system did not produce lightening however thunder was noted untilsundown.Throughout the evening until estimated 2210 hours, we tracked air traffic alongthe los angeles to san francisco north to south corridor, noting distinct andfamilar engine noise and strobing. likewise, we watched the northwestern sectorof our sky noting 3 metoroid entries. my colleague then called my attention tothe west on our visual horizon.I noted an object unrelated to current air traffic patterns flying due east downthe center of california valley at an altitude estimated between 18,000 to25,000 feet. object velocity was not relative to any above airborne traffic andacoustical signature sounded a few decibels under a normal aircraft engine.Likewise, object continued due east at an unusual velocity without typicallynoted strobing safety lights. object was estimated yellow in continous colorthroughout flight path to the east. neither did object jerk or weave.Moreover, at first glance, object presumption was military. however, object didnot sound like an aircraft on military afterburner. its acoustical signature eg.Doppler effect did not match, ie. short sound like tail as object moved acrossline of sight track.Initial reaction was calm due to 20 years of seeing and hearing various militaryaircraft. however, as visual tracking continued, reaction changed to excitementand apprehension. object behavior did not meet normal operating aircraftcriteria ie. safety strobing and acoustical signature.Object simply faded from visual due east tracking.Moreover, approximately 10 to 15 minutes later around 2235 hours, anotheranomalous event occured at 70 to 80 degrees off the horizon. we were trackingsatellites throughout the evening then observed an unusual geometeric pattern of3 objects tracking again west to east.Formation geometry was triangular moving half the speed of observed object.Geometric object lights were steady white much like earlier observed satellites.Again, emotional response ranged from calm to excited and apprehensive due toproximity of earlier event. eventually, object faded from visual tracking dueeast of california valley.","distance":"Over One

the radiowas getting static.  i looked around in the ski for an approaching storm when inoticed a bright disc shaped object to the se side of the roadway. it was overthe woods that i intended on going in when it got closer to sun up. the objectwas moving from the se to the sw at a very slow speed. the object looked morelike a giant mirror reflecting the images from below.  i thought to myself whatan excellent camoflage. i didnt notice any light flashing or any colored lights,it just reflected the lights from the nearby mine and the few streetlights downthe road i was parked on when it
