i live in a condominium complex with many tall redwoods around, but i also have an unobstructed view of a pretty good sized portion open sky. i was watching birds in the trees around me. \r\n     i live near the flight path to san jose airport (sjc) and am about 5 miles away, so it is common to see airplanes approaching for landing. during the time i was outside, maybe 20-30 minutes, i'd say i saw 5-7 aircraft approaching, i would guess the aircraft are about 1500-2500 feet high  on approach. the bay area has three international airports, so air space is busy. i also saw other aircraft at higher altitude probably coming and going to and from sfo and oak.\r\n     i was watching a crow high up in a redwood tree when i noticed an object, at what appeared to be high altitude, moving in a east to west direction. i was curious but could not get a good look because it was partially blocked by the tree. based on the objects trajectory and direction of travel i assumed it would reappear from behind the tree at a certain point. i waited but it did not reappear. i searched the sky but could not find it again.\r\n     several minutes passed and then an object, about the size of a sesame seed, caught my eye high overhead slightly to the east. i assumed it was a bird but could make out no avian features. it appeared round and solid, colored grey and white. it was moving north at what i perceived to be a high rate of speed. at least 200-300 mph when compared to other aircraft in the sky overhead at the same time. i also got the impression for a moment that it might be an escaped party balloon. however, the flight path it took was not straight line but instead a gentle back and forth almost like it was doing a slalom course. it continued north until i lost sight of it behind the roof of my garage.\r\n     not long after this, maybe 5 minutes at most, i spotted 8-10 objects almost 90 degrees overhead. my impression was that it was a flock of birds. but again, there was no motion of wings flapping, and they appeared to be the same size and color as the first object. they appeared to be following each other in two different circles, about 4-5 in each circle. several of the objects seemed to be interacting playfully with each other. they circled briefly then formed into 2 loose v's and headed north in the same direction as the first object. these objects also seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed and traveled in a straight line. at this time my impression was they were flying as fast as a jet at 30,000ft.\r\n     normally i would have written this off as birds. but i couldn't shake what seemed odd to me. the appearance of the objects, their motion, their rate speed.\r\n

with a beginner snowboarder so i anticipated this being my last run. slowly making our way down the trail i sat down to wait for my friend. we were the last ones heading down the trail on such icy conditions and so close to closing. we were only a quarter of a mile into the trail so i gave my friend sometime to catch up. while waiting i enjoyed watching the planes go by in the sky and looking out onto the town. but then i moved my eyes slightly above the residential area and noticed a green light. it automatically caught my attention i yelled out to my friend \"did you see that?\" and then i yelled to my boyfriend who was further down the trail \"did you see that?\" yet no one answered; i couldn't remove my eyes from the green glowing orb in the sky. then as soon as i spotted it, the orb made a path that look liked it was turning around or a \"u\" shaped path into space or the upper atmosphere. there were no clouds in the sky completely clear however i felt as if i imagined the whole thing. i asked my friend if she had seen anything when she finally reached me but she said no. then i asked my boyfriend \"did you see a green thing in the sky?\" he said no. by the time we were all together the rescue team had came up the mountain checking to see if anyone needed help because the trails were closing. i held in any reaction i had and helped my friend snowboard down the mountain. i have always been aware that other people have spotted ufos but i never expected to be one of those individuals. to be completely honest i was afraid of the stigma of ufo reporters so i didn't look much into it until i realized that i turned my gopro hero 4 on in the beginning of trail. when looking over the footage i noticed that it had shut off on the mountain right before i saw the ufo. this was the first time using it so i do not correlate the two variables, the ufo and the disfunction of the gopro because it was below freezing on the mountain. nonetheless, this did keep me up last night and created a yearning curiosity to understand what i saw that night on the mountain.

around on a blacktop a very bright light caught my attention. at first i just thought that it was venus being magnified by the atmosphere as it was so low on the horizon and it was not obviously moving, so i did not think much of it. \r\n\r\ni dont like to look stupid by saying, hey look a ufo and then have it not be unidentifiable so i was skeptical at first. at the same time i was actually wanting to see a ufo because my dad brought an object to my attention a couple nights before that i was confident was just venus. i am a believer and a witness to handful of other extremely convincing sightings, this will be my first reported to mufon, so my dad doing that made me eager to see a ufo again and inspired a conversation about the whole topic earlier in the night with my friends who saw the object with me, which is particularly why i think that this is interesting. back to the story-\r\n\r\n  after a minute of me continuing to skate i looked at it again and i realized it was not in the same place that it was and then it became obvious that it was moving. it had no blinking lights and was much, much brighter than a plane or helicopter, with no sound what so ever. i brought my two other friends attention to to the object as well, at this point and they were in as much astonishment as i. we continued to watch the object in awe as it slowly moved across the sky then at the point in which it seemed to bee centered in our view it slowed significantly. this happened within seconds of me asking, in my mind, for the object to do something to make it even more obvious that it was of otherworldly origin. this made be under the impression that this object was aware of me and my friends observing it. so we continued to watch it as continued its average speed continued again and then its path seemed to change from a perpendicular one to a diagonal path away from us. as the object was moving away and were still watching one of my friends was describing another ufo sighting that he had. he said something along the lines of i was watching it and it dropped... and literally immediately after he said that word dropped that object that we were currently watching dropped a twinkling light straight down from it that seemed to fall very quickly and disappeared before getting 3/4 the way to the ground. right as this happened we all reacted in astonishment and almost out of instinct from the intrigue in start walking towards it, even though it was not close at all really, just a psychological observation i guess. as we continued to watch it dropped another one of these objects shortly before it disappeared by collapsing into itself within a matter of seconds. there were no low clouds that could have covered it where it was it simply disappeared.\r\n\r\nmy friends and i were so interested after it disappeared we decided to go to where we thought it may have dropped whatever it dropped. we theorized that it went over houses and then eventually was going over annadel state park. so we decided to go on a night hike up in annadel in search of any possible evidence, unfortunately we did not find anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe emotional response that this sighting inspired was extremely euphoric, exciting, and interesting. i was not fearful what so ever. my friend and i both admitted to the experience being so breath taking that it brought tears to our eyes. i was honestly extremely grateful to whatever being(s) that fulfilled my wish of seeing another ufo. during and after the experience i thanked these beings thoroughly for showing themselves to me again and to my friends. i feel as though i am connected with these beings in some way because of the personal nature that my sightings seem to have. it is in my belief that my friends and i were a part of a small handful of people that also saw this object, if not the only people who witnessed this object. i am lead to believe this because it was a thursday night and it was too late at night for any people who had to work the next day to have still been awake and outside or within view of this object. i would love to know if anybody else witness this same object but i am very doubtful.\r\n\r\nthank you for doing what you do,\r\nwill leonhardt\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

making way for progress and as we got over the shitty barbed wire fence, we saw a disc shaped craft. but only just,due 2 the light from the road and the traffic silhouette off the sides,so you could see it was round. it wasn't even on the ground, it was suspended 10mtrs off the ground, at a 45 degree angle. i was pinching myself. noo this ain't real. but it was and as we approached (we were 30mrts away by this time) it went from 45 degree to horizontal 3 times. then a disc on the outside started to oscillate and like a leaf in the wind,saying from side to side it slowly started to rise till all we could see was the blue and red light. not a sound by the way. then in the blink of an eye a white light came on and it traveled 60+kms approx and like a ball hitting a wall came back again almost instantly. the  while light would go off and the blue and red would come on. observed it doing this for 40+mins. till  this day all i can put it down is magnetic levitation and that's after

about 5 or so seconds. then it started to move upward and then changed directions going south then changed directions again moving north. so i kept watching it for probly 2 more minutes after i was done taken a leak and during that time it was moving all difrent drirections up down side to side pauseing at times and kinda zig zaging. but not going very far when changing directions. so i went and got my buddy i was working in the garage with to come check it out ( cus one of our other freinds who lives maby about 2 miles away had seen the same thing a few weeks ago in the same direction in the sky and has been seeing it and other lights moving in the same way for the past 2 or 3 weeks and has shown us videos of them he has recored on his phone). my buddy i was working with in the garage stood out and watched it with me for about 5 mins and confermed that it was moving in difrent directions and pauseing for briff moments before moving again. he then retured back into the garage because it was preaty cold out about 15 degries f out. i continued to watch it for about another 10 mins or so after that untel my buddy came out and said i needed to come back in and countine to work so i did. i worked for probly another 30 to 40 mins finishing what i was working on so i went back out to see if it was still there and it was and still moving erratically. but was harder to see cus the sun was coming up. well he needed my help working so i wasiny able to watch it but for maby anthoer minute or so. i helpd him for another 20 mins or so and went back out to see if i could see it agian cus by then the sun was up so i was hoping to see it in the daylight but it had
