the west of the storms in the southern sky caughtmy eye.  it was red in color, and i thought it was mars at first, because i hadcaught something on the news about it being out.  however, i soon realized thiswas not the case.First, the lightning should have overcome the light from the object for a splitsecond.  it did not.Second, the sky was totally overcast.  no stars or other celestial bodies werevisibile.Third, the lightning illuminated the sky enough to clearly show that the objectwas below the cloud base.The two kickers really made me think it was a ufo1.  the object was usually a pretty steady red in terms of color and theintensity of its light.  however, on two occasions, after watching it for acouple minutes, its light dimmed to nothing for about two or three seconds, thenreturned to its original brightness.  after about five or six minutes, theobject dimmed to no light, and the light did not return.  the dimming and comingback of light was not in a regular pattern whatsoever.2.  the object did not move at all.  it appeared to just stay put in onelocation.  aircraft moves and has some sort of lights that blink or faderegularlythis most certainly did not.During the sighting, i became somewhat scared as noted in the survey above,mostly because i had never seen anything like it and quickly realized that itwasnt what i thought it originally was.  something so unfamiliar is unnerving. after the object disappeared i watched for about 30 more seconds, and it didntreturn, i went to bed, still feeling a bit frightened.  i did get a restfulnights sleep, however.If you wish to contact me, please use my email address, rather than my phonenumber.  thanks","distance":"Over One

station.There was no slowing down , just a sudden stop. the object hovered over thenaval air staion for about 15 seconds. it then either shot straight out or justdisappeared. i think it shot straight up or out. while it was hovering you couldsee a dark spearhead in front of a dim yellow light. i could indentify everyaircraft on the airstaion at that time and this was unlike any thing i had everseen. two navy phantom jets   the old vintage were scrambled at the same time ofthe appearance. there was a feeling that the base was being probed in the 15seconds it hovered. if i were to guess at the speed before a dead stop , i wouldsay it was traveling at least 6000 miles an hour. just a guess but the altitudewas about 10000 feet. i do not get excited over anything , which allowed me toobserve without emotions. i know now there is somethin beside us in thewonderful universe. i would not believe ufo reportsif i had not seen this with my own eyes. this incident was reported to

business when i noticed a bright star-like object in the  nw sky that seemed like it was moving.  i watched for about twenty minutes  before taking my dog inside. it moved closer during that time. i got a pair of  binoculars and continued to watch from my back deck. i steadied the binoculars  by leaning against a deck pillar. the object was in the nw sky and looked  crescent shaped and indeed was moving in a random pattern with a trail of  rainbow colors. it moved extremely fast and with bizzare whips and turns,   very similar to a child with asparkle action.  it was probably more than  30,000 feet up as we live in a rural area on top of a mile high mountain in  western pa. it was higher than most of the airplane flight paths.  after i had  watched it for more than half an hour, i noticed another ufo in the northern  sky, lower than the first, more northly direction.  it was fainter, but with  deffinent movement and a round white shape. i couldnt tell if it was one small  ufo moving rapidly from right to left or a large ufo with pulsating white  lights along its center.  i observed both ufos together, but they didnt seem  to be communicating together. the one in the nw sky was moving about  erratically, while the one in the north sky seemed more stable a hovering. i  oberved them for a total of about 45 minutes.  i came in the house and went to  bed, hoping that whatever they were that they would stay aloft and away. the  next morning i didnt feel well for a few hours and i am very healthy and  rarely feel sick. i did feel better by the afternoon, but wondered if anything  had happened that i didnt remember.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

guess it was january or february because it wascold out, but it was a beautiful sunny day - not a cloud in the sky.  i wassitting on my bedroom windowsill on the ground floor of an apartment buildingand was just basically just sitting looking out the window toward woods whichlead down to the hudson river and across from that the palisades are visible. soi was across the street from the woods. all of a sudden i saw an object appearin the distance...At first i thought it was a kite because it had the same shapefrom far away, and the strange thing was that from the moment i saw it, eventhough it was relatively far away, i felt like everything was moving in slowmotion - kind of like when you are in a dream and are being chased but findyourself unable to run...It was a strange feeling...As the object got closerwhich it did rapidly i saw it as clear as day above the building across thestreet - it was huge and white and diamond-shaped and had a large red insigniaof a bird on it - the birds head was turned to the left and the wings werefacing down.  there was no detailing on the insignia at all, it was just in thesilhouette of a bird.  as soon as it disappeared from my view because it movedpast my line of vision from the window i snapped out of it and was startled tosay the least although surprisingly i was not scared at all, just excited.  iran into the living where my parents were having guests over and announced muchto their dismay i had seen a ufo which of course no one believed...And it wasstrange because i remembered everything with crystal clarity after it happenedbut as the day went on the memory faded, like when you wake up from a dream andyou remember it perfectly but later on the memory is clouded.  my first thoughtwas to dismiss it as a hallucination, but a few months later i saw an article inthe national enquirer,of all places, i believe, about a couple in indiana whohad seen the exact same thing - they even drew it, which scared the hell out ofme because there was no mistakign what i had seen.  so if people hundreds ofmiles away had seen it too i knew i wasnt crazy.  not long after, my family wasdriving to chicago to visit relatives.  we were on a stretch of route 80 inpennsylvania at about 330 am when my sister and i were awakened by my parentsshouting...It seems a saucer shaped craft had been hovering in front of

treeline oneither side of the main asphalt roadway.  occassionally. i passed farms and openfields on either side of the road.  the road also rose and dipped in the shallowhills in this area.  i was looking down the road, straight ahead, when a silveryobject came from behind the treeline to my right and flew straight across theroad, about 100 to 150 ft. above it.  the object was cigar-shaped, with a bulletshaped point on the front.  the back top 13 of it was shaped like a long fin,although it had no moving parts on it.  i got the impression this area couldhave been a crew area, or possibly for propulsion, although there was none.  itwas smooth, silvery, with no markings, no windows, or other external metalfittings or marks.  it did not make any noise, and did not exhibit any

dissappeared behind the treeline to my right.  itried to speed up and see if i could get to an open field which might give me abetter sight line on the object, but there were only trees ahead on my

a cigarette at my parents house.  i looked up over the roofand there were orange streaks going across the sky.  i was immediately in shockbecause this was just unbelievable.  i never imagined it would happen to me.  sothese lights which are hard to describe were orange and looked pretty much likemeteors.  but they werent because i saw like 100 in 1 minute or two.  they weregoing in all directions, very fast.  the trails looked almost like a tracer. they were going so fast i could not focus on them.  they were all the same sizeand shape.  as i said they looked like orange shooting stars going in alldifferent directions kind of like a spider web but not quite.As i said ive written this before and i dont even know if it will work this timeso im not writing as much.  this is nothing that can be explained if i coulddraw it i would.Any way i stood in shock for about what seemed five minutes and ran in and gotthe phone.  i called my sister because she would probably be up.  she was but idont remeber what we discussed i think it went like mei see ufos herwow.  theywere still going so i decided to run in and wake up whomever was going to comedown the fastest.  my dad did and i said come fast.  he kinda did, but when wegot out there there was nothing.  then a white light went from the bottom to thetop of the viewing area.  then another.  i asked him if he saw it he said yes,but after talking to him im not so sure.  he said they were birds.  but he didntsee the orange light show so i would have to disagree.I probably forgot a bunch but i still remember quite vividly what

appeared to have gained height, asif to remain subtly in the background as dawn broke. even with the lighter skyit was still difficult to make out what shape it may have been, but it didappear to have

there for a while when all of asudden it shot over the highway to the north and when it did this it was so fastthat all we could see was a light trial and then shot back over our car it didthis approx five times shooting around the sky leaving light trails and alwaysreturning back above our car we both just sat there amazed at what was happeningwe could not beleive it.We sat there for approx 10-15 min observing this strangelight in the sky then it shot out and became five lights if you pictured a staron the american flag with its five points there  was a light at every point ifyou can picture this with the car in the center. then all of a sudden it becameon light and shot straight up as fast as ever and was gone just leaving a trailof lights as it shot away. well we both decided to get out

friend on the phone at the time.  isaw a satellite traveling northward across the sky.  later, i thought i wasanother satellite.  this observation was reached by the luminosity of the objectand it rate and direction of its travel.  the object appeared as one bright,whiteyellow ball of light.  having lived under busy commercial air routes for myentire life, and being an amateur aircraft expert, i readily identified theobject as not being commercial air traffic.  the object was traveling in aneastern direction, coming from the west.  suddenly the object stopped.  itstarted to move again, but on a different course.  the object was soon almostdirectly overhead.   as the object was overhead, it rapidly flew in circles,zigzag patterns, and hovered.  during the aerobatics, i noticed that the objecthad a hazy halo surrounding it and it left a short, hazy trail behind it as itmaneuvered.  after a few minutes of said displays, the object started movingrapidly north.  suddenly reversing directions, the object began travelingsouthward.  it was at this time that i noticed the object was not one whitelight, but three distinct lights composing one object, or very tight formation. the lights were colored green, red, and white.  these are the colors used oncommercial aircraft, but the did not appear in the correct configuration to besuch an aircraft.  as the object sped southward toward the horizon, it stoppedbriefly.  at this time, the object split into three different white lights in atriangle formation.  as soon as the object had completed this transformation, itdisappeared at incredible speed to the southeast.  from the high altitude andspeed the object was traveling, i knew that it was not a helicopter orcommercial airplane.  by the aerobatics that i saw, i also knew that it was nota fighter jet, or either of the previously mentioned types of aircraft.  i amconfident in this conclusion because i have been an aviation enthusiast for mostof my life.  i have observed all type of aircraft, military and civilian.  ihave lived under major air routes for my entire life and i consider myself agifted aircraft spotter.","distance":"Over One

satellites, the iss, shooting stars and etc. and arefamiliar with our night sky.On sunday evening, july 21st, 2003, we observed 3 different cellestialphenomenon that we could not readily explain.  the first was initiallystationary to the west, about 80 - 85 degrees above the horizon, and seemed tobe simply another star in the sky.  it started moving toward the southwest,getting dimmer, and dissapearing into the starlit sky, not to the horizon, mindyou, but seemingly into deeper space.A few minutes later, we noticed what i first thought was a satellite, movingfrom west to east at a rapid pace, traversing the sky from horizon to horizon inabout 45 seconds, and i would have disregarded it as such, but an aircraft withstrobes redgreen moved below it to give us a better reference, intersected thepath and obscured it for a brief moment...The altitude seemed to me to be toolow for a satellite but too high for an aircraft.  i spent 14 years of my navycareer as an aviator, and have a pretty good idea of what is normal behavior forairborne objects and what is not.  i believe the speed to have been much slowerthan a satellite but much faster than an aircraft.The third object hovered for a considerable period of time, in about the samearea of the sky as the first object, was visible for about 10 minutes, thensimply disappeared.I was intrigued by our observations, as we have spent many a night looking atthe stars, and havent seen anything at all like what we observed last night.  iwill continue to report as we observe other phenomenon.Note  we own 5 dogs, and they were all unusually disturbednervous during thetime we were viewing the objects.  it may have been the excited tone of ourvoices as we discussed what we were seeing.","distance":"Over One

translucent,and it was moving in a straight linefrom south to north at a great speed maybe 4times as fast as any jet ive seen. when i say translucent, that is hard todescribe. it was glowing, and there were parts that were completely see through,and parts that seemed half there, and these areas moved and swirled.Maybe lookedsimilar to some sort of gasses flowing and glowing. as it moved it seemed as ifyou could see the air around it moving in this fashion also, but maybe at adifferent density. it was triangular shaped, but the corners were slightlyrounded not sharp corners. it seemed to glide using the two points of thetriangle almost as if they were wings of a bird gliding through the sky. and itdid glide quite gracefully. the third point of the triangle was in the back. theobject

nj in the sky above 3 executive campus.  i work thenight shift and had just finished eating a quick ramen meal.  i usually bring myown bowlutensils for my meal since theyre not provided at the work place.  afteri was done i brought the bowl out to my car and put it inside since i couldntfit it in with the other items in my bag. as i was leaving the car i just stoodtransfixed for a moment admiring the stars on a fairly clear night and thinkingof how massive and amazing the universe really is.  immediately after thinkingthat, i had a sudden instinct to look directly at a northeast area of the sky. at first i hadnt noticed much, but then a moment later i noticed what lookedlike a dim blueish star, moving across the sky at a slow speed. at first ithought it could be a plane maybe, but there were no flashing lights and thisobject had a steady blue glow, was very very high up, silent, and apeared to bedisguising itself to appear as a star. im not sure what gave the blueish glow,or if it was simly a reflection of moonlight off this object.  it was quitesmall in size from where i was standing, so i estimated it to be between 11-30feet, possibly larger and was possibly many miles into the atmosphere it lookedto be about the same size a small star appears  as i watched the object, itmoved across the sky about a hundred feet at a slow steady speed.  in my head atthat moment i thought to myself is this really a ufo im seeing  at the verymoment that thought came into my head the object stopped, then instantlypulsatedexpanded into a spherical ball of pure brilliant white light roughtly 20times the size it was before. it held that form for about 1 second, duringwhich, i heard myself say  whoaa it then returned to its previous color andshape small blueish star.  it continued to travel along at the same rate asbefore for about 3 seconds more, then accelerated to incredible speed in thesame direction and vanished into space","distance":"Over One

were just listening to music and talking about theconcert and just being loud when all of a sudden we just stopped talking andthen i saw something in the air. at first i didnt know what to make of it. ididnt say anything about it until about 15 seconds later. i asked brian if hehad seen that and he said that he did. i wanted to stop the car so we can see itbetter but i decided to just keep going because there was no place to pull over.This is what i saw i saw this spider-like type of aircraft. thats the best wayto describe it. it had just a little body on the top like a spider has and ithad what looked like thin legs coming down and each leg had some lightsconnected to the leg. i can draw it out for you if youd like. brian saw the samething too. i just called him earlier to verify what he saw and he said exactlywhat i wrote. he also added something that i didnt see. he saw what looked likea kite top. i guess i was a little to excited to see it that i didnt pay muchattention. i was just in shock that i saw this. feel free to get in touch withme through e-mail and me and brian will try to answer any of your questions.Thank you,raul felician
