after lighting a bright orangecandle and seeing a light blinking exactly the same colour over on the suiehill. we at first thought it was a mast, or car lights, but it soon becameevident that the movements and flashing pattern were too erratic for either ofthese, also too big to have been car lights at that distant. we both feltintense fear, and a sense of being watched and not welcomed. it was a veryuncomfortable feeling. the lights moved all over the hill, in front of both theforest and above the tree line, occasionally appearing in the sky above thehill. to the naked eye they appeared to flash on and off, then again in anotherposition, but through binoculars were observed to move while flashing. theyappeared in random sequence, and would remain lit for several seconds beforeflashing off. the colours changed between red and yellow although size remaineduniform and the number of objects increased from 1 to 4. the feeling of beingwatched and the sense of hostility increased, and as the number increased therewas a sensation of being closed in on, so we left the area as quickly andquietly as we could. when we returned to the car, the headlights seemed verydull and the night extremely dark with the moon low above the horizon. when weleft the vicinity of the suie hill, the lights brightened immediately, the skybecame lighter and more like a summers night, and the moon rose almostinstantly. on calm reflection, we realised that there are no masts on that hill,and no habitation.","distance":"Over One

night skiingwith his friends.2.It was getting late and i wanted to know if the park was closed yet.  theywould turn the lights off on the slope when they were done for the night, butthey were still on when i looked out over the trees i could see the glow in thesky overhead.....3.  i didnt know what i was seeing.  i kept looking, thinking, what the heck isthat and what the heck are those lights

been an expensive lark, but you never know, right4.When i couldnt figure out what they were i went inside and got my mom.  isaid, youve gotta come and see this, mommy.  you arent gonna believe it

least three of them, in my recollection.  we never saw a shape,they were at least two miles away.  we only saw the blue-white lights of them. and they appeared to be playing in the lights from the

listen for any sounds like helicopters orairplanes since there is an usaf refueling base within 25 miles south oflocation of sighting. there is also an airport in old town for local flyersnorth about a couple of miles. the three of us observed there was no sound atall, not even the sound of insects or wind. the object then started to move awayand up in to the sky, starting very slow, and then to an extreme accelerationleaving a somewhat transparent vapor trail that quickly diminished behind it. itwas no more then a second or two before it was completely out of sight. thewhole occurence was maybe a minute long. my son expressed an urgency for us toleave as it sped off and out of sight. i unknowingly felt the same urgency.Since that night, my son has aquired an obsession to know what it

the porch were     turned off.  the ambient lighting outside was dim.  after lighting my     cigarette i looked up at the stars in the direction of the big dipper.      thats when i saw a dull yelloworangish light moving across the sky.  it was     the size of a medium brightness star and was already in motion when i     looked up at it.  at the time i first saw it it was just above the four     stars that make the dipper portion and was moving leftwards.  it passed     between the two lower stars that make the handle.  once it passed between     those two stars it vanished completely.  the entire time that i saw the     object in motion before it vanished was about 3 seconds.I thought it was a plane or helicopter flying at a high altitude maybe10,000-15,000 ft.  but it didnt seem right.  first the object was movingperpendicular to my line of vision.  i shouldnt see the landing lights that wellfrom the side.  besides, the light singular that i saw was a dullyellowishorange, not the yellowishwhite lights that ive seen on landing planes. and secondly, there were no bluered indicator lights on the object.After the light vanished i continued watching in that general directionwondering what it was.  about a minute later, while scanning the big dipper, isaw a flash of light a little bit to the left but i didnt see the exact locationof the flash.  it was as bright as a bolt of lightning far away, but of coursethere was no bolt, just the flash.  i couldnt pinpoint the exact location of theflash but it seemed to come from a little to the left of the

were no wings and the objects were glowingor shimmering and they had a shape like a propane tank.The light from theobjects was a very pure white, and was unlike any we had ever seen. the objectscontinued to stay parallel to each other moving north at a steady speed. wewatched the objects travel due north untill they were lost in the distance, atotal of aprox.Two minutes. we were totally amazed at the sighting andimediately began to inquire among the people in the area. it appears that mostpeople were watching the skydivers. hopefully some other people witnessed thephenomenom. we noticed how we were recieved when we said we saw a ufo, so we didnot make a big deal about it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
