noticed to off to my left a shiny metallic object.The irony leading to this event is that i had spent two years studding thissubject do to the reason that i had very memorable experience at the age oftwelve which would fall under the category of an encounter of the second kind.Anyway, as an added note, this was an extremely clear day, i mean you could readthe licenses  off an airplane if you know what i mean. honestly, i had beenpreparing myself for this so i was pretty calculated in recording the event.It was 402 p. m on february 1998, i observed a shiny metallic craft proceedingin a ne direction, from which time i had pulled into the middle turning lane inorder to track the craft more accurately. almost immediately after this time thecraft became obscured in the trees, so i turned east in order not to lose sitethe craft. i came to the end of the street to find the craft had made a rightangle turn and headed back in a southern direction and it had slowed down andstarted to just putt around.This lasted to 404 and 50 seconds and then it went up at a 35 degree angle anddisappeared. the craft was oval shaped with a red beacon type light on top. themost amusing part of this sighting was thiswas one the most clearest days i canremember and there was plenty of people outside walking around but no one waslooking up, and this thing was only about a 800 to 1000 feet

hwy.21,a wooded road with alot of wildlife to be on the watch for..It was about 904 pm,the sun was still very well up and it was bright-i happened to glance up over the treeline,as i often do,and to the east-northeast saw what appeared at first to be a large jet airliner.What caught my attention was its size,shape,and colorbrightness.It was a flattened rectangle,like a cigar box viewed from the side,and very bright and reflective,not at all the dull aluminum tone of a plane.It was much too large to be a small plane,and it was hovering in place.We both were struck by the reflective nature of the craft,and its flight path-watched it for several minutes and slowed our own progress down alot on the road in order to get a betttter look-i was sayingdo you think we are seeing a ufo here,or is this something explainable we felt curious,but calm,not frightened.Tried to disceern if it was an old bi-plane,because of that rectangular appearance-but this thing was large,and truly hovering.Just when i told bob to pull over so i could find my binoculars beneath the front seat,the thing shot off and out of view,toward the ne,gone in an instant-we both mentioned the feeling that it somehowknewwe were trying to get a closer look,because of how it dissapeared immediately upon my reaching for binoculars.It was gone,and we drove the rest of the way homeits a 14 mile trip from ely to babbitt-this happened about 8 mi.Out of elyfeeling calm and even tired,didnt talk much.My 18 yr old daughter then reported seeing something very similar several days later,to me,which made me wonder all the more just what was this bright,reflective and hovering object-from what we could tell it must have easily been about the size of two 747s laid end to end.","distance":"Over One

father worked on the farm at the time of the sighting. the physical location of this site is adjacent to the naval weapons station,earle road and rail that runs from the main location in colts neck to belford.At the time of the sighting, my sister, myself, father and mother along withseveral other people were sitting outside enjoying the pleasant summer eveningfrom the front yard of the house that we were living in.  it was at this timethat we all simultaneously noticed what appeared to be a large shiney, silversphere due east of our location.  the sphere was roughly following the directionof the navy road, heading towards the main ammunition storage facility located acouple of miles to the south of our location.  the object was moving in a slowbut deliberate manner at an altitude must have been from 300 to 500 feet.  itsspeed was probably 40 to 50 mph.  the object was also displaying about 10 to 15randomly blinking red and white lights.  the majority of these lights seem toconcentrate rougly around the longitudinal plane of the sphere and appeared tobe separate from the craft itself.  each light seemed to blink at a rate ofmaybe once per second.  it should be noted that the location of this farm now acounty park is within 4 miles of fort monmouth army communications andelectronics command where radar was developed along with a number of otherinitiatives critical to the national defense.  right after our sighting, myfather ran to a phone and attempted to call fort monmouth however, he could notget through at that time.  he did not try again therefore, our sighting was notreported to the best of my knowledge.The sighting lasted only a few minutes as the sphere disappeared behind sometrees however, it can be safely assumed that its path did take it over theammunition depot itself.  of course there have been rumors for years that thefacility was used to store nuclear devices.  in closing, years later i cameacross another witness observed what appears to be the same object however, heviewed it from the navesink river on the river plaza side.  this location isalso on a direct line towards belford sight of the pier where the ammunitionships are loaded and is approximately 4 miles2b- from the farm where we observed the object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

some feet off the ground.  then it wasjust gone.  there was no tail like with a meteor or comet.  for a split second,i thought it was a falling star. then i realized it wasnt and i remember fear. bone chilling fear.  the noise was like a whoosh as it went over head.  myfamily in the house didnt hear it, or at least wont admit to hearing it.  icouldnt move, which could have been the fear.  since this, i have weirdheadaches occasionally. just an uncomfortable feeling, not really a pain, overmy left temple that sometimes shoots to the right.  sometimes its at the base ofmy skull.  id describe it as a feeling of fullness or pressure. on the back ofmy left hand i now have a circular gouge-like scar, about the size of one ofthose old josephs childrens aspirins.I also had an odd in experience in puerto rico while my husband and i werestationed there.  i was being questioned about the name of my god.  there wereother questions but i only remember definately that one.  the entity questioningme was not like the typical alien.  the head was outsized but not grotesquely,the eyes were dark and slanted, but not huge.  the area lighting was dim, likeat a romantic restaurant.  i was not restrained, i was lying down, things seemedgreyish.  i was not in my bedroom.  no fear, just an urgency to answer thequestions.  since the first experience, i have empathic episodes that i try toignore, but they usually turn out to be correct and its hard to ignore that.This may all be nothing, but i feel compelled to tell someone now.  i have alsorecently had this longing to move from
