the internet, but i finally found the crop circletrilling noise that cseti uses in their ufo attracting protocol.  i recordedthat onto minidisk and brought it with me.  i was planning on playing it over a2 way radio, but i had forgotten the rest of the cseti protocol.  lucky for mewhile talking with judy, the ufo watchtower owner, a cseti member arrived.  weall discussed for hours.  eventually i mentioned i had brought the sound and thecseti member knew the consciousness phase of the protocol, so we went up thetower and played the sounds over the radio, then with the cseti member, herhusband, and my sister went through the consciousness phase.  it was about 9 pm,at the end of a lovely sunset.  nothing happened immediately, and we ended up inthe store.I knew we should be watching, but most of us were really into our discussions. luckily some children and my sister were watching the skies outside.  thechildren belonged to a spanish speaking mexican family.  my sister92s boyfriend speaks spanish, so we were able to communicate.  btw, they, livingin the valley, had their own host of stories.  my family camped a lot when i wasyoung and my sister and i loved staying up and spotting satellites, so i knewshe was a pro.  not too long after, between 925 and 930 pm, my sister called us,saying she saw a satellite.   when i saw it, my first comment was that was waytoo bright to be a satellite  it was directly out of the watchtower92s back door, which faced east over the rock garden.  the object was at 10 o92clock, about 30-35 degrees off the horizon, above a mountain range.  i am abit color blind, so i am not sure of the exact color, but the color did seem tochange.  others reported it being yellow and turning blue when it dimmed.  itwas over the mountains, but seemed nearer, heading south, moving faster than asatellite, but not as fast as a shooting star.  i would describe a satellite astypically dimmer than the brighter stars, and moving at a steady pace.

somethingunusual, they were flying above the cloud cover at 13,000 feet altitude, lookingdown on a cloud cover at only 10,000 feet altitude.What they saw was a light illuminating the clouds below them, and - because thelight seemed to move in a somewhat see-saw motion from side to side - theyspeculated that it might be a searchlight.Suddenly the light/object came up through the cloud cover \"very fast\" and as itpassed by their aircraft and shot up into space they saw that it was atriangular shaped object (estimated to be about the size of a \"truck,\" with redlights at each corner of

i was at a barn in merced looking at the stars.Very high up in the se sky i saw something that looked like some random smallmeteor or piece of debris burning up in the atmosphere. i didnt pay any moreattention to the sky for a couple of hours. later that night i was driving homefrom merced to chowchilla on hwy 99, the time was approximately 22 30. i noticedthat, whatever the object was, it hadnt burned up yet. in fact it was brighterand it had moved a couple of inches closer to the horizon. since i was drivingsouth i had a fairly good view of the object. it looked like a bright star witha small tail on it. as i watched i could see that it was moving, andaccelerating as well. the object started with a fairly shallow descent and as itsped up it abruptly changed direction and began moving very rapidly straightdown towards the ground. just as i was sure that i was about to watch somethingcrash into the earth, it pulled up and hovered just above the horizon for ashort amount of time. at this time the short tail disappeared and the objectlooked like a very bright star. as it hovered i saw a red light appear on oneside of the star and a blue light on the other. just outside the red and bluelights another small white light appeared. now i had no idea what this thingwas, and i was getting a little scared. the object started to move nw towardsme. the red, blue, and white lights around the outside rotated as the objectmoved towards me, like when you throw a frisbee and it spins but keeps going inthe same direction, but it only rotated a total of 180 degrees. as it rotatedand moved in my general direction i broke out in a cold sweat, i felt apreassure in my head, not pain just preassure, i got goosebumps and tingles allover my body, and now i was terrified. i dont know how i mannaged to keep myjeep on the road. i did not notice any mechanical or electrical disturbances inmy jeep. i was, however, a little distracted at the time and not payingattention to the performance quality in my vehicle. while i was watching inoticed that this thing was only about 100 ft above the ground. it was stillspeeding up as it passed over me. i felt a tightening in my

godhad turned off a light switch. i looked out of the rear window of the car thought i saw lightning bugs fire flys. being a child i was surprised at thenumber of them. they first appeared in the

gone. it was as if they only wanted me to see them. i know this soundsodd, but its the way i felt  also the only explaination for the disappearingact. the orbs of lights moved onto the road behind us. they were hovering, everso closely to the road. the closer they got to us, the more fear i had. as soonas the lights first appeared my mother had difficulty getting the car to go anyfaster than 10 mph. everyone was frightened in the car, even though they didntsee the lights. i remember my great-aunt trying to turn her head around to look,but she seemed to move in slow motion  turned her head only slightly as if shewas being held back. i will never forget her face  how she screamed at my mom todrive faster. the lights made their way onto the back of the car. at this pointmy mom told me to lay down in the floor, so i wouldnt see them. after whatseemed like a few minutes, i calmed down some  sat back up. big mistake as i satup, i turned  looked out of my window. there right in my face
