submarines did you serve oni served onboard the uss  ssn- a fast attack  class nuclearsubmarine.3ealso, i am intrigued by your interpretation of the events that you witnessedback in 1980.  what is your line of reasoning, please, regarding 1 the3eendothermic reaction, and 1 that it must have involved the combination ofwater and air molecules.  if such combinations were to occur, and it gave3eoff sparks, would that not be an exothermic reactioni apologize for my poor explanation of the chemical reactions, which i reasoned,might have been occurring around the object. i will elaborate.It appeared to me that there was some form of spherically shaped force fieldentirely surrounding the object. imagine two concentric spheres the innersphere, being the glowing object, and the outer sphere two feet larger indiameter defining the surface of an invisible force field surrounding the objectlike one beach ball inside of another larger beach ball. now, i couldnt actuallysee the surface of the force fieldbut i could infer that it was located there, because it was along that invisiblesurface the apparent force field surface upon which the threads which i couldsee were being formed, wiggled around, and moved about.I believed that the sparkling lights floating downward - below the object wereactually the threads breaking down exothermically after they had fallen awayfrom the intense force field, which i assumed had created them. the sparklinglights, if they were indeed the falling threads, indicated an exothermicprocess. in that case, it would have required an endothermic process to createthe threads... i reasoned that the objects force field had literally crushed theair molecules and possibly water vapor molecules as well - due to atmospherichumidity levels around it into a solid compound, which i observed as thethreads. such a chemical reaction would require the input of energy anendothermic process.0","distance":"501 Feet - 1

intersection with lake elmo aven., she noticed a bright light directly ahead in the distance (low the easternsky).  she often sees aircraft in this direction and initially felt that the lightmight have been an approaching airplane.  as she watched, she noted that thelight was getting brighter, and at this point she felt that it no longerresembled an aircraft.  at a point about  of the way between hwy 19 and lake elmo ave n. she noted thatthe light was accompanied by a second light.  she theorized that this might be ahelicopter.  she rolled down the drivers side window to listen for any sound,but did not hear anything unusual.She came to a stop at the stop sign at the intersection of 10th st. and lakeelmo ave n.  at this point, she noticed that the light had brightened stillfurther, and now appeared to be more of a chevron shape.  she felt at thispoint, that the object was considerably larger than an aircraft.  she also notedthat it appeared to be descending, and moving to the right. as she accelerated east from the stop sign at the intersection with lake elmoave n. her view of the object was briefly obscured by some trees.  a momentlater, when she had moved past the trees, she observed a large chevron shapedrow of lights (see object description, below) at the tree line, to the right ofthe road.  the object appeared to be atop, or behind, the hill to the south ofthe road, and seemed to be hovering at treetop level.She slowed the car to a speed less than 20 mph (typical speeds on this stretchof road are about 60mph), and rolled down the right window.  she observed thatthe object lit up the tree tops, and appeared to have a length of about sixtree-widths.  she describes feeling a sense that this was not normal, andseemed menacing.  she arrived at the stop sign at the corner of 10th st. and manning ave. andturned left onto manning ave.  she observed in her rear view mirror, that thetrees were lit up, apparently from the object, but was unable to see the objectat that point.She noted that there were several qwest (telephone company) workers at theintersection, apparently working on a telephone utility box at the corner.  sheobserved that they did not seem to notice the nearby lights.Object description (as she observed it just over the tree line):  ==================horizontal/chevron shaped array of six brilliant lights - the length of thelight formation was equivalent to approximately four to six tree-widths. although a structure associated with the lights is implied, she indicates thatshe was not able to discern any platform or structure, and that the lights wereas bright as those of an athletic field.She describes the lights as being extremely bright, lighting up the tree tops. they were white, and did not vary in position, form or intensity.  they appearedto be circular in shape, although the brightness made it difficult to discernactual shape.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ariving at the location, we decided to grab a couple of beers and take a walk down to our dock on the mississippi river.  while enjoying the evening and discussing what we were going to do that night, my friend got my attention and pointed to a red glowing object that was hovering above the river.  i began to rationalize and looked upstream and recognized the radio tower in savanna,  and tried to justify what i was seeing,,,the radio tower was a couple of miles away and tiny at best compared to the object we were fixated on.  i started realizing that i wasnt sure of what i was witnessing,,and began telling my friend that no radio tower or bright light like we were seeing is natural to the area...The large object hovered silently in the air while i told my friend that the area that light was above was a man made island that was made when the river channels were widened..This man made island is about quarter to a half mile from our dock, and is so overgrown that no one except duck hunters will venture on the outskirts of the island.  after rationalizing that this light wasnt a helicopter, wasnt the moon, and wasnt the light that acompanies barges and riverboats, the object began to rise about 100 to 200 feet no noise, just a steady glow...After a minute,,the object lowered behind or below the islands treeline, when it lowered beyond sight,,the glow in and around the area was completly gone, like a light bulb had shut of.  my friend and i had the impression that what ever the object was,, was probably still there, but with its light turned off..It was to dark, and we werent about to chase it at night, and decided to go back in the morning to see whats back ther absolutly nothing but overgrown trees,,and lilly pads when we took our waverunners behind the island on the way to the main channel no place to land except a patch off water behind the island.  after the sighting my friend and i walked up to our trailer and got ready to go out that evening.  i told my dad what we had seen,,and was ready to tell others about my story.  my friend and i went out and came back around 130a.M.,not really thinking about the ufo incident, and ready to have fun at the beach in the morning.Upon falling asleep that i night,, i was awaken by my dad who was in my smallsingle bedroom in my trailer.  he was calming me down..All that i remember wasthat i was screaming get

wasconvinced that what i was looking at was not something you commonly see inpakistani sky92s or any sky in the world for that matter.The footage is not very long i believe its like 6 to 7 minutes the most. my dadtook the footage in a hurry becuase they my parents were about to go shoppingand my mother was getting impatient. its taken in the evening and taped on avideo camera. it shows a bright object in the sky over the roof of our house youcan see the roof of the house the light in the shed of our garage and a creepernext to the shed. then the camera zooms in to capture a bright white object witha ring of different hues changing quite rapidly, i am not sure if its because ofthe distance of the object or changes in the atmosphere but the most interestingthing i noticed as the camera is zooming in you can see a smaller orb flashingas it leaves the object to the right of the screen. you can hear my dad say thatthe object is unusually bright and that it92s going in and out on its own and that he sees some lights around it. then ashe zooms out again you can see the same smaller flashing orb make its way backtowards the bigger orb. the ufo goes in and out a couple of times going from abright point to a burst of fuzzy light like in the christoffer walther footage,even the markings are similar with a nucleus center and a brighter outer ring,like a bright chandelier. one other thing that i noticed in my dads footage isthat the object seems to have a flat base at certain times like its not aperfect sphere and it does not seem to be grain in the footage but quite adeliberate
