pocket and looked up at the sky. it had rained hard lastnight so i was admiring how nice it was with light clouds spotting the sky andhow pretty the stars were. there wasnt a breeze or any noice other than the dogscollar from walking around.It smelled very fresh out.I noticed out of the corner of my eye what i thought was a bird flying overhead.I looked directly at the object and thought thats not a bird...How the heck isthat guy hang-gliding around here i thought it was a hangglider because of itsaltitude, shape, and lack of noise.Then i said, oh my god, what the heck is thati watched the object, perfectly focused for about 6 seconds before it flew intosome sparse clouds. i was dumbfounded.I followed the path of the object hoping it would hold its course and come outthe other end. it didnt...I thought i saw it circle tightly and turn towards theeast.When then all heck broke loose. 4 planes came out of no where and converged onsome mountains east of my housewhere the object headed. not sure what kind of planes they were. then what ithought were two jets f-16 off in the north headed over towrds my direction in asort of glide speed. they made very little noise, but i could still hear thejets.I ran in to tell my wife what had just happened. grabbed the binoculars and ranback outside, she came outside for a second to look, but went back in because itwas cold for her.I watched the sky intensly for awhile 1 to 2 minutes and watched for the craft., ran into the garage, grabbed the ladder and climbed onto the roof. there werealot of aircraft over new the mountain range.Two passenger jets went over head slightly west of me their flight for sfoanother jet f-16 came into view, southwest of where the object first glided overhead. he headed into the clouds the object went into which had now blowed overthe mountain range and disappeared. i then head a helicopter over in thearea...It held its course thorugh the clouds heading north toward the oaklandairport.All of this was amazing i still cannot believe it, but i swear i saw this objectand i have never seen anything like it in all of the military programs i haveseen on cable stations.I had one beer while i

basketball shaped object several miles distantand approximatley two to four thousand feet up at a 50 60 60 degree angle. as aformer army officer paratropper i used to jump at 1200 feet so i believe myhight and distance estimate is fairly accurate. it seemed like it appearedsuddenly as i had been facing that direction for a few minutes and noticed itall of a sudden, like it appeared out of no-where.3. at first i thought it was a hot air ballon which is common in this areaduring the festival season, but as i studied it i observed it was perfectlyround and did not have any lines and basket hanging below it, and the color wasjet black, not colored like most hot air ballons.4. i was intrigued as i observed it because i knew it was not any convedntionalflying object based on its appearance and movement . i did make a report severalweeks later to a now defunct ufo website, as i recall, ufos, new mexico and theworld.  i also related my sighing to family and friends whose reaction was thetypical skepticism and disbelief. i decided to make this report again to yourcredible organization as i cannot forget this sighting and belive it isimportant information even though it happened almost three years ago.5. the round black ball shaped object appeared to be decending at a very slowrate of speed and as it got closer i could begin to observe that it had massbehind the circle.  i estimate that it was several miles distant to the northwhen it finally stopped after approximatley 10 minutes or less into its decentand foreward movement to the south in my direction. the black round object afterstopping and hovering for a few seconds, began turning slowly to the west, andas it turned the shape revealed itsself as a long cigar shaped, shinny metalic,silver fuselage, anywhere from 100 to 300 feet long, with small portals alongthe bottom half of the fusleage.After a 90 degree turn to the west, it continuedto hover a few seconds, then ii could see an aura of energy

3 o 4 dull lights running evenly down thewings.  my initial reaction was that it was not like anything that i had everseen before, except that it looked kind of like a flying wing, so i was tryingto convince myself it was probably a b2 stealth bomber out of offutt.But the more i thought about it i didnt think b2s had lights under the wingslike this did, nor are they shaped like a boomerang.

this was around 1038 am.My husband was in the passenger seat, my three children were in the back.My son cuts their lawn on sundays. i was traveling north and saw two objectsstrait ahead up in the sky, one was clearly a passenger jet, the other appearedsimply to be a ball, a sphere. it was behind a fair distance and above thepassenger jet. i began to slow down, cause i was very curious as to what thiswas. i kept my eye on it, and pointed it out to my husband, who glimpsed it.I looked down for a second to steer the car, and looked back up and it was gone.The airline jet was traveling on its way, but the shiny sphere was just gone. iwas able to observe it for at least 10 seconds.It just couldnt have been any aircraft we are aware of.. it was just so simplyand firmly what i saw.. a shiny sphere. would like to know if any one else hadseen anything in the same areastate as i did on that daythanks,sandra vargas","distance":"Over One

bright object hovering in the sky.I thought it was the sun illuminating a cloud at first. but the object had form.It appeared to be saucer shaped with domes to the top and to the bottom of theobject. the domes didnt protrude very much from the body. the object was alsotilting downward. it started to propel itself at a slow rate, from left to rightacross the sky. at times it seemed to hover or stop and them it preceded itsslow movement again. i followed it until it went behind a tree. by the time ihad a better vantage point, without the tree obstucting my view, the object wasgone. i had caught this entire sequence on videotape. when i went home to viewthe tape again, i noticed another object come into view. this was a smallerobject and it was flying toward the 1st object. it appears to be
