no stars yet in the sky, and it was not very dark yet. i don't know whether or not it had anything to do with the plane, but it happened just as the plane had flown out of the area that the light came from. it almost looked like something had tried to hit the plane and had missed not literally, but that was the sequence of things. i dont know what to think of

was but we both know it was nothing we haveever seen before. so now that we are all excited about what we saw, we continueddriving down the road. i was continously watching the sky out my window and thefront window as we drove along. we got about 10 miles or so down the road andsuddenly this light thing appeared in the sky. it was extremely low to theground and headed right towards our truck, well over it anyway. so we jumped outonce again to see what this was. thinking it may have been a plane or somethingflying really low. but as it came closer to us we noticed the light pattern onit was weird. it had 3 bright white lights in the front, in a straight line fromleft to right, and 3 bright lights in the back, in a straight line from left toright. also it had red and green lights on the sides. it was nothing i have everseen before. it just flew over top our truck quickly and really low, but made nosound. my husband stated he could see right through it, as it was transparent. ididnt take notice though as i was too intrigued with the lighting system on theobject. it just dissapeared into the night. i would really like some input onthis if you can offer any as i stated before, my

moving too fast to be one.  it was glowing whiteand was an orb or sphere shape.  this light was about the entire size of theplane.  as we watched both the plane and the white glowing sphere, we noticedthat it looked as though both were at the same altitude.  both came close tomeeting each other and we thought that they were going to hit each other at onepoint.  upon approaching the plane, the orb zig zagged off to the east a littledistance and then remained heading north bound.  they barely missed each other. once they crossed paths, the orb started heading northeast as though to turnaround, but then started zig zagging back and forth from east to west in a sharpalmost 90 degree angel turns.  then it appeared to ascend and disappeared in theclear night sky.  my friend and i were worried at first that plane and orb wouldhit each other.  as the event went on however, we realized that the orb was acraft that we could not reconginize.  both of us were excited about thesighting.  in my opionion, whatever was in the sky with the plane at that timewas under intelligent control and was not an air craft of any type that i amaware of.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in the house and i thought i should go outside, summerevening, not too late, nice weather and as a kid i just wandered outside,nothing unusual.  i went to the back yard and this caught my eye.  right above aneighbors street lamp was a moon.  honestly, a moon, revolving and it wasshowing the street light on it like the moon does the sun.  it was revolvingfairly fast and it even had crater marks.  i was amazed and for a second thoughtthe moon was crashing but then thought it was an asteroid or meteor but thenwondered why it was hovering above the street lamp.  i felt very calm duringthis and fascinated.  i went to get my parents and yelled for them to comeoutside and ran back to the back yard, the thing was just a small speck aboutthe size of a raisin in the sky and disappeared.  it was fairly large when itwas above the street light, my folks just shrugged when it was not there.Later, i had some very unusual awake dreams where the munsters, yes the munsterswere touching me and talking to me and raising me up to sitting position andlaying me back down in my bed, nothing scary but i could feel them even though icould see right through them.I have always wanted to relay this to see if this sounds like anything anyonemay relate to.  i swear it did occur and i do not believe it was hallucinationbut i dont know.Rodney beason2100 wilson road apt 122knoxville, tn 37912i will

because sometimes when youre fishing, you get bored,and i was just gazing at the sky.  i noticed a starlike object moving very highin the atmosphere, north to south, in a slow fashion.3.  i pointed it out to dan and he noticed it-he said looks like a satellite tome.  that seemed sensible to me but i continued to watch it move across the sky.I wasnt afraid but curious.4.  dan started watching it with me. we first noticed something was wrong when asmall plane flew by,and the object stopped in its tracks and was completelystill in the sky. when the plane had passed, it resumed its northsouth movement.This got our riveted attention. the plane seemed to cause it to stop.Throughout the entire incident, we did not move from our location.5.  as i said, it stopped when the small plane went by, and then resumedmovement. it appeared that it was hiding because when it was stopped it lookedjust like another star. after the plane went by we watched it move around. itstarted doing strange, abrupt turns-also it would stop, start, turn on an angle.It did not seem to gain or drop in altitude. there was no sound-i assumedbecause it was so high we couldnt hear it-yet the small plane that passed andcaused it to stop was at about 1000 feet.We watched it for some minutes as it changed direction, stopping, starting. thenall at once it just-from a stop-sped off upwards at an incredible speed-i cannoteven estimate the speed-perhaps 700 mph and out of sight immediately.6.  as i said, it sped off and was out of sight within 1
