in newark before going home. i was only about 1 milefrom my house, traveling ne on county highway 17 reynolds road at approximatly220 am on friday, march 7, 2003. the road is fairly deserted with only a coupleof farms along its length and the point i noticed the object was in between twoof the farms where there is only empty fields. as i topped a hill i noticed whati at first assumed to be a plane very low in the sky approching me following theroadway. it was traveling nw and was just to the north side of the road. as icontinued moving, i realized it was only barely moving, almost hovering but sortof drifting only a couple of miles per hour. i then thought it was a helicopterand was wondering what one would be doing at that place and time so i stopped myvehicle and pulled to the side of the road to check it out.After looking closer, i was pretty sure it was not a helicopteri used to volunteer on a local emergency squad and had seen medical helicopterscomming in at accident scenes and this did not resemble those at all. i turnedoff the radio and rolled down the window to hear what it sounded like andrealized that it was totally silent outside. i then turned of the engine so icould hear better and still heard nothing. this is what really piqued my intrestbecause in that area at 220 a.M. you should be able to hear anything that was asclose as this was. i can usually hear dogs barking that are three quarters of amile away or more in conditions like there was at that time.I could see the siloet of the object aginst the sky and it appeared very clearlytriangular, with a white light at each point of the triangle and blinking redlights in a circular pattern within the triangle. the only thing triangle shapedthat could fly with no sound, that i know of, is a hang-glider and this was 2 to3 times that in size and considering the temperature as my thermometer in mytruck showed was 12 deg f., it would have had to have been a very hardy personto be flying one of those.I have never seen anything i would call a ufo before and dont beleive in alienvisitations or things like that, but i have no idea what this thing could havebeen and figured that it couldnt hurt to report it.Thank you,james landis","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

off to the left of us just over the factories by theborder of the town. we walked down the block and observed the craft zig-zaggingleft and right and behind the trees to above the trees and at that moment weboth concluded that this wasnt an airplane. i myself have seen about 3 sightingsin the past 4-5 months, and this is the second time someone has been with me. iwas ofcourse happy that someone witnessed this with me. we then started to loosesight of it and i know where i have seen them before so i went to the spot,which is a wooded area by the local highschool. we ran up the hill got in my carand drove about 2 min to the school. my witness the pointed out in a kind offear, oh my god there it is whats it doin it started to get very close to theground and then was at about the tops of the trees about 300 feet away, i couldsee it as plain as day, it was dumbell shaped, unlike any i have seen before,and it had glowing orangeyellow wings and a red light spining underneath it.Best i could relate it to was one of those tie-fighter things offa star wars icouldnt beleve my eyes. she was scared to go home and begged me not to follow itafter we lost sight of it behind the tree line. so i took her home and as i washeading down the hill, i saw it again i couldnt belive it i have seen thsesbefore, once with my sister and then it was a bunch about 4-7 glowing balls oflight that were pulsating and actually making a very loud puslsating sound, andthey were in the same area, over the highschool i then have seen another closeup, around the same area i saw yesterday, it wasent the

less wide than the triangular lightson top. could not see any connection between the three collections of lightsblackness but they all moved in unison -as if they were part of the same object- west on hyw 98, pretty much matching our speed the rest of the way down thehighway. only lost sight of it periodically as it went behind clumps of trees,remaining just below tree line height until itwe got into the city proper. wethen viewed it in the open at a slightly higher altitude 200-300 ft off theground. and it continued to appear in the same configuration describedabove-same lights, shape etc. never able to see anything connecting the lightsbut they moved as if attached together. didnt think to roll down windows in thecar so no sound was heard.The object continued to move nw approx. and was thenobscured by some trees off and on and then strangely, it seemd alot fartheraway, in a few seconds, to the nw out over pensacola bay. at last sight weturned left into gulf breeze suburb and it appeared to be a small light off inthe distance over the bay. lost sight of it altogether when we fully turned downshoreline blvd. maybe not connected, about ten minutes after we got home about1-2 minutes after the sighting my wife, daughter and self heard loud jet noisescontinuously, for over an hour in the direction of pensacola. to me and mydaughter, we thought it looked like the top of a cell-phone tower sort of, butof course it moved also to me it seemed taller than wide and resembled ajapanese lantern. stangely, while we watched it, we were impressed that itseemed to float quite gently as it traveled down the highway. the winds wereunusually strong that night. we also tried to convince ourselves it was ahelicopter but it just was so strange and didnt look or act like

smoke break.  it was about 6pm, bright and sunny.  i had backed awayfrom the line where other golfers were still hitting balls.  i looked up at theeastern sky and noticed two cylindrical objects due east of me flying information heading due south.  at first i thought they were just airplanes, astampa int airport is about 5 miles south and 3 miles east of where i was.  infact, these objects had to have been in the restricted airspace of tia.  iwatched for several minutes, thinking a change of viewing angle would make theexpected wings visible to verify they were planes, but i never saw any wings,nor tail for that matter.  what was strange was 1 the height, as they were toolow to be aircraft heading further south, like miami.  i see those all the time,and even at cruising altitude one can make out the wings.  2 the speedthey were moving too slow to be normal airplanes like 727 or something and toofast and narrow to be blimps.  3 the locationthere should not have been aircraft at that altitude apprx 5000 ft that were notin a landing pattern for tia.  these craft did not change altitude, nor circlethe airport as would normal aircraft.  they maintained a straight path the wholetime they were in sight.  4 there are never two aircraft that close to eachother in a normal landing pattern.  if i guessed their size correctly, they werecomparable to something like a wingless 737, and they were about 200 yardsapart.  5 they made no sound whatsoever, no jet engine, no prop, no exhaust. other golfers may have noticed the craft, but i said nothing as people werehitting balls and it is real rude to shout out hey, look at that.  by the time irealized the strangeness of the craft and their behavior, they had already moveda couple of miles farther south and more difficult to distinguish from a regularairplane.These objects may turn out to be blimps, but ive seen lots of blimps and thesewere higher than ive ever seen a blimp, and narrower that any blimp ive seen. they were dangerously close to the air traffic if they were blimps.  as far asim concerned, they were unidentified, they were flying, and they were objects. i would be delighted if someone confirmed they were blimps.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line
