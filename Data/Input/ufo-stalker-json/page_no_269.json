in the back of a s-10 pick-up truck.  we weren't under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  we weren't really watching the movie just looking up into the stars.  we both suddenly noticed a circular pattern of lights above our head.  i couldn't see the outline of the object just the lights shining.  at first the lights were a combination of yellow, orange and red.  we were both amazed and confused.  after viewing the lights for about 10 seconds the lights began to change color to the other end of the spectrum.  the lights changed to blue, green and violet.  in an instant these lights moved about 10 degrees to the south and back to the original position in less than a second.  i thought to myself there is no way a human body can take that amount of g force and still be living.  the next movement was even more spectacular the lights didn't disappear but shot of at such an amazing rate.  it was if someone flicked the lights into deep space.  my girlfriend at the time flipped out and ran to a pay phone to call her parents.  she was so distraught that i had to take her home.  an amazing moment that changed my life

the approximately 160 yard dirt driveway. the next morning everything had refroze after a kind of slushy day on 2/9/2017. the reason that is important is because this helps to pin down the approximate time this impression was made. i left the house to get in the car and go to work. when i approached my car (which is not garaged), i noticed a strange, perfectly round imprint on the mostly cleared ice about five feet in front of my car lined up with the driver side. this is now 2/10/2017, 7:15 am. the circle was so perfectly symmetrical that i was astounded. this circle was about 20\" in diameter, which if multiplied by pie would yield a circumference of 62.8 inches. upon a closer look, i could see many other concentric circles withinnthe outer circumference. some of these had louvered connection lines between concentric circles. there were also some dots that were situated on the outer or next inner circle. the entire impression was created due to a perfectly symmetric heat source. it was very cold out and the last thing i wanted to do was hang around and take pictures in lieu of getting in the car and warming up. by the way i don't have a remote car starter and the car was as cold as the ambient temperature. i took four or five cell phone pics of this impression. i refer to it as an impression because it was more than an image, it was an impression. i tried to show these pics to my wife and coworkers. they all thought i was nuts and making something out of nothing, but i defy anyone to explain the cause of this! you will have expand or view the pics under a magnifying glass to see the incredible details, again , which are symmetrical beyond belief, i cannot explain the cause and i feel it is more than likely what it is, a ufo landing. i live on the edge of a marsh and winds are usually present. there was some snow that had obscured some portions of the images i took. one of my co workers said it was simply a garbage can! wrong haven't seen a metal garbage can since 1980, and not a hot one either. and again the symmetry. please view the images and tell me im not crazy. there is a common belief that aliens would be approximately our size, but this would point to another school of thought!","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Louvres, Other,

going to stay for a week, around sunset approximately 8 pm, i noticed a light coming down the canyon. i called my friend over to watch what was coming down the canyon towards us, right about when he got over to me, it came out from behind the trees and into our field of vision.\r\n\r\nit was a blindingly bright orb of light,but it didn't hurt your eyes to look at it. the object was fifty feet above us and about the same distance away from us. we stared to try and figure out what it was as we watched it move across the open area in front of us, it seemed to be following the river. we estimated the size of the object to be around 12 to 18 feet across,and even though it was blindingly bright it didn't seem to be shining light on anything else, then we moved over a bit so we like continue to watch it. my friend said he was scared, i was calm and told him i thought we would be ok since it was going downstream from us.\r\n\r\nwe kept questioning each other what the other saw, trying to estimate how high it was, if we could see the light shine on anything, how fast it was going and if we could hear any noise coming from it. neither of us could hear it make any noise, we both thought it was going about 25 or 35 miles per hour, as it got down river it came close to a cliff face and we could see it light up the cliff some, but not brightly, it was in the canyon about fifty to  one hundred feet off the ground. and definitely under intelligent control. it turned following the river and continued to travel at the same speed then turned again and went be hind a small hill, we could still see the glow of it as it went behind a second hill then we couldn't see it any more.\r\n\r\nmy friend was quite upset about the whole experience, i calmed him down and after awhile we went to bed. the next morning my friend wanted to go home so we packed up and went.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

inside and made my girlfriend come outside. we both observed the lights and for approximately another minute or two before the top light became so intensely bright that it revealed the shape of the object and then it completely disappeared. i work within 500 yards of a large airport lovell field in chattanooga tn. i know what landing lights look like, and this was not an airplane. the minimal

behind the line of sight that it was going to take next. so i quickly dashed around that tree taking less than a second or so,  and just as i did i saw whatever it was dissolve into the night sky .

wife.\r\nafter picking up his wife, both of them saw another 2 or 3 lights near route 207 and route 22. they both saw the lights appear again near egypt road.\r\na shape of the object could not be seen... just the lights. the lights were bright but did not emit a beam.\r\nthe object (lights) would just appear and disappear and not just visually go out of sight as something traveling away.  the witness spoke of when it appeared as one light at a distance and said it reminded him of the moon when it is orange in color, but small.\r\nthe witness spoke of previous sightings with one where he saw an object with 6 or 7 amber-colored lights that appeared to be massive and described movement uncommon to normal aircraft.\r\nthe witness reports that when he sees the object, when it appeared close with numerous lights, the lights appeared to be on one object or craft.\r\nthis sighting was reported to roundtown ufo society (rufos) at the time as the witness found their website online.\r\nrufos is who is reporting this to you (mufon) now.\r\nthe witness who spends a lot of time in the woods, reported an inordinate amount of deer and other animals moving in the area as they were driving.\r\nnote: when the witness speaks of seeing it previously in the woods, it was completely silent. on this sighting, he said he was in the car and couldn't tell if there was any sound.  \r\nhis other family members have seen anomalous lights as well. \r\nat the time the witness was reporting this to rufos, there was some chatter online on facebook about others seeing lights in a similar fashion in areas both to the east and south. \r\nthe witness wants to remain

a perfect blue no clouds and about a half an hour from sun set, and i noticed two large twin engine jet air craft about the size of an airbus 300. what caught my attention was how close these jets were flying in proximity to each other, they were both flying around 18000 to 24000ft in altitude and roughly around 1/2 of each other, no further than that! both jets were gave off a heavy contrails and you could clearly make out the shape of the jets and their wing shape and their engines , what was very odd was this objet that was pacing both jets and flying in a direct path due south their was a lead plane followed by the objected and than the second jet directly behind the object. the object appeared to be about a 1/4 of the size of the jets and gave off no contrail what so ever, which struck me as odd being they were all flying at the same speed same altitude and the same direction, the object and the trailing plane all appeared to be following the lead plane, when first spotted the object between the planes seemed to be like a light lead colored as it moved along with the planes it seemed to change to a bright light pulsating at uneven intervals, again no contrails from this object, it perfectly paced the jets and i watched the two jets and the object for about 4 minutes were i estimate that they were around 15 miles+  away from me flying due south form my location and around 10 to 20 miles west of nyc at that time. just to be clear each jet gave off a reflection of the sunlight but the object that was following them was at least 3 times brighter than the jets at it's demist point and about 7 to 10 times brighter at it's brightest point when pulsating. i have to say it was very odd i've seen a lot of plane but have never seen anything like this before . i observe this from directly below to watching it move off into the horizon with both jets.","distance":"Over One
