i was getting near home. it was projecting a search light in a neighborhood just off of scott road near the end of shingle oak pointe. the craft had three white lights near each flattened point and one in the middle. i thought it might be some kind of helicopter because it had red lights as well. i like helicopters i will alway drive close to see one if i can. as i got closer it started to move toward the intersection of scott and 14 it stopped about half way over the do it best store and started moving slowly north the bright center light was dimmer at this point then it moved toward the direction of the fort wayne international airport it was traveling about fifty miles per hour and i could only follow at about thirty five mph i cannot afford any type of speeding ticket. i followed it about 1.75 miles. it flew overcopperhill addition and i lost sight of it and went home. of course my wife thought i was nuts and i did not think much about it till i saw a picture of the same type of craft on the history channel saturday feb 1 when they where talking about this type of craft that was flying around france. i think the show was called ufo hot spots. i have only seen two other ufos in my life and one was reported to be a very large asteroid that broke up over indiana when i was in high school. i would estimate it flew about 150 feet above the ground to 220 feet and was maybe 28 to thirty 35 feet between lights. i only saw a very very dim outline that may have been an illusion of the crafts true shape. i heard no sound minus the rain and my car. i saw no indication of lights dimming in houses or any means of thrust for this craft. i know that this craft looked very much like the triangle shaped craft on tv. i get out of school anywhere from 900 to1000. i am pretty sure it was very close to 1100 when i saw it but it may have been as early as 1030 pm.","distance":"101-500

on the year, it could have been 1994. but i wasstanding in the heb parking lot at i-35 and wells branch pkwy. i was thereearlier than usual waiting for the capital metro bus. i lived in round rock atthe time and rode the bus in to my government clerk job with the usda in austin,tx. it must have been winter because i was cold with my coat on and it wasfoggy. that spot in the parking lot is now where the fuel island is, but at thattime that heb did not have a fuel island. i was leaning against my car facingnorth. heard a small jet sound on my right. turned to look and saw and objectlifting almost straight up. the object had oscillating lights flashing insequence indicating a circular structure. i could not see the craft in part dueto the fog, but oddly because it seemed shrouded in a haze of its own. at thetime i saw it, i noticed its ascent was so straight up, that it appeared to havelifted off from almost behind the store. there is a little house there, but inever had the nerve to go to that house and ask if they knew of anything likethis. i rationalized since then that there is a small airport very nearby. butit went straight up like a helicopter, made the sound of a jet, lifted veryslowly. what bothers me the most is my numb reaction to the whole thing ithappened about 10 years ago, yet facing this and accepting this as a realitymakes me nervous and i dont know why. i try to laugh it off and tell myself thateven aliens like to shop at heb. i have only told my husband about this a fewtimes, he is very supportive but doesnt know what to make of it either. i know iam not crazy. i dont mind talking to you people about this. but please keep mesafe from having my personal life disrupted. thank you.","distance":"21-100

co-workers, hey, ya wanna see a ufo after a few minutes ofyoure high, my co-worker came out to see for himself. the object was stillthere, in the same position, and it had not moved. after 5 or so more minutes ofgawking, we went back inside. just to make sure that it wasnt a star, a balloonor something else, i went back outside about 10 minutes later and the object wasgone.Now, i say that this is the second time, as a few years earlier, during anothersmoke break at our old store some 5 miles south, i saw an identical object. itwas during a summer rain, it had just started to sprinkle. i had anotherco-worker with me then. he was the one that said, whats that, a ufo i thenlooked up and concurred.My past history with these sorts of things has a long history. i can remembernocturnal visitors as far back as 1965, when my family was stationed at fthuachuca, az. from conversations with arizona natives since then, they assuredme that theres some mighty strange things happening out that way.Between these recent sightings and 1965, the most memorable close-up sightingwas during a junior high school camping trip out in lost park, colorado. i musthave been about 14 at the time. the most memorable thing was that as anear-field sighting, it was crystal clear. it was a classic saucer, no domes, nolights, just glowing. i turned to my tent-mate and said do you see what i see hereplied, yeah, i do. is that proof enoughi must emphasize that ive been a long-time student of the phenomenon, and untilnow, have had no real reason to report any of these sightings for fear ofridicule. my observations are, in my opinion, as objective as i can make them tobe. im not prone to sensationalism, and have again in my opinion a healthyattitude and a keen eye for hoaxes and mis-identifications.

polarizing filter since the lighting conditions werevery pleasant. aiming at the eastern horizon of a small mountain imitos that isa few miles from my house, i noticed a bright silvery object gliding through theeyepiece frame. at first, i assumed it was an airplane, though midway throughthe eyepiece frame it started making loops and circles. intrigued by this, i putthe camera down and looked to see what it was. to my surprise i could seenothing with my bare eyes. picking back up the camera and adjusting the linearpolarizer to the point where the sky seemed darkest i was again able to clearlysee it. this was not due to the zoom of my lens since it has a maximum of 70mmzoom, very close to the human eye equivalent of 50mm and seemed to be solely dueto the polarizing filter, since by turning the polarization plane away from thedarkest sky point the object disappeared. i repeatedly tried to see the objectwith my bare eyes by marking its position while seeing it through the polarizerthough was unable to do so with the exception of one instance where i think isaw a faint gleam where the object should have been. this was very surprising tome since it was very vivid through the camera.Quite intrigued, i took pictures while it swirled in the sky. at that point iwas rationalizing that it maybe was a large remote control model plane orcopter, though some things still didnt fitit seemed to be flying higher than i would expect it to and it was veryreflective, no hint of color paint, to mention my first observations.Unfortunately, because i could only see it through my camera i was unable toassess its distance and, thus, size. beside these facts, such items remote modelplanes are very scarce and luxurious in this part of the world.After about 5 minutes of observation i was surprised seeing four more of theseobjects couldnt discern any differences between the five entering the view paneof my camera when they started an elegant skydanceeach one orbiting each other weaving in and out of an imaginary sphere. somewould occasionally stroll off upwards or towards the south and come back again.After about 3 minutes of this they dispersed to the south and what seemed frommy viewpoint as up and were too far for me to observe, something made harder bythe fact that they were going closer to the sun so the polarizer had no effectat that angle.At some point
