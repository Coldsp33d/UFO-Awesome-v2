-4, about as bright as venus. the small light that was dropped was as bright as magnitude 1. the object moved quite slowly but seemed to accelerate slightly as the colour changed from green to red. after that the object stood still en hovered for some moments, when the brightness decreased. the decrease in brightness stood still for a moment or so before it diminished completely. all the time the object moved stood the same height above the horizon. during the hovering of the object i managed to run  into my house and fetched a binocular. the object didn't really show up different through the bino, just a blob of light, but i had the impression that the light of the object was reflected by some background structure. as i am scientifically trained and a keep a strong interest in

was about 10:45 or maybe even closer to 11pm.  i was driving my car onto i-95 from okeechobee (in west palm beach).  you have to drive up the ramp and then back down to get on 95.  as i was approaching the top of the ramp, i saw lights out at the corner of my eyes to the left.  i didnt pay attention to it (probably just thought an airplane or something).  anyway, the lights were angled in the sky and as the turned again i looked up to the left and whoa!!  it was a line of lights in a row (connected like this: ***********) a straight line of lights.  thats all i could get a glimpse of.  the lights then shut off suddenly. i slowed my car to  a stop on the top of the ramp.  looked out of my car and saw a dark object. no lights at all. i couldnt tell the shape because it all happend kind of fast.  all i know is that the object was darker than the sky and it was moving.  it was really moving fast, but when i got out to look more...........The thing was gone.  i saw it moving southeast but only for a matter of seconds.  i couldnt see it anymore...........Like it vanished.  i know this must sound pretty weird, but thats what i saw.  the hole sighting was only about a minute or two if that.  wish i payed more attention initially because i probably would have seen more.  i was near the airport and i could see other planes in the sky, but this thing was definitely something else.  strange.  i even felt a little strange about it after.  if i think about it now.........It almost seems as if i dont believe myself..........Like i was daydreaming...............Weird.  please let me know if anyone else or if there was anything in the news that day about anything like i described.  thanks.  i have enclosed a drawing of what it sort of looked like using adobe photoshop.  very similar to what i saw.  but when the lights went out............Im not really sure what it looked like............Just like a dark black
