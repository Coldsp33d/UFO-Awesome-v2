remember the experience as vividly aspossible. i was pretty calm through the whole thing. after it took off i raninside and told my dad and brother that i just saw a ufo above the garrage.I felt elated because this was the closest ive ever been to a ufo.Me and a close friend had seen something very similar about a year ago.It was on a trip to clarksdale, ms about 3000 ft in the sky and silver,sphere shaped and it took off at about the same speed as this one.It was daytime and we didnt notice any trails or sound.","distance":"101-500

icontinued reading, i realized that the jet roar was getting louder andsustaining itself, seemingly overhead.  i glanced out the west window of theroom and saw three strobing lights, like aircraft lights, in the west sky atabout 40 degrees.  the were arranged in a flat triangular shape, two of theclose and the third some distance away.  at arms length, that distance was abouteight inches.  the close lights would strob together, the third strobing afterthe others had cycled off.  the cycle took one second, but the interval betweenthe strobing was about one fifth of a second.  in other words, the three lightswould strob, first the two, then the one, leaving a blank spot for four fifthsof a second.I watched for about one minute, opening the window to listen to the roaringsound, which was comming from the direction of the lights and filled the area. it was a cold night, and i closed the window.  i realized that the lights werenot moving.  i called my wife, who thought they were aircraft, but she soonrealized that they were different, due to the lack of motion.  at that point,she became disturbed, saying i dont want to know what that is and left the room. i picked up a pair of 7 x 35 binoculars at this point and looked for anyoutline of a craft, but could see none.  the space between the lights was thesame as the surrounding sky, flat, gray and overcast.  the lights did

descending into st. louis under partly cloudyconditions and i was seated on the right side of the plane a boeing 757 in anexit row seat 10f. i was looking out the window, watching the ice crystalswithin a cloud as they were illuminated by the planes strobe light, when twobright white lights came out from underneath our aircraft at a distance of7e50 meters approximate since i find it hard to estimate distance when lookingout of a plane under normal conditions, let alone at night in a cloud.The two lights were identical to those found on the tips of aircraft wings,spaced approximately as a wingspan, which led to my initial thought that we hadhad a close call with another aircraft. the lights continued to rise whilemoving away from our plane for about 20 seconds. i mentioned to my seat matethat i thought wed nearly been hit and he looked out and saw the lights as theymoved away.I continued to watch the lights, for about 20 seconds, as they rose to ouraltitude and at an unknown distance but still visible within the cloud. from theframe work of lights on the tips of an aircrafts wings, the lights then rolledto the right 180 degrees, before coming back towards our plane. when firstnoticed, the midpoint of the two lights was centered forward of my seat, and asthey returned they were further back towards the tail of the plane.At that point, i assumed they were the lights of another plane due to theirresemblance with the wingtips lights of aircraft and their behaviour as ifconnected by a rigid body. as they neared our plane, they gained a litlealtitude and disappeared just before they would have passed over our plane.As mentioned, i first assumed the lights to be connected with another aircraft.But, as i thought about it further, i realized that another aircraft would havehad other lights on under those conditions the red and green lights on the topand bottom of the fuselage, the strobe lights, and the headlights. none of thesewere observed. also, with the lights performing a 180 degree roll assuming theywere connected the other craft would have been inverted either when passingunder or over our plane.I havent been

commercialmall area of bangor, me.  on the long stretch ofstillwater there is very little light pollution, and with a clear sky there wasa lot to look at.  since i was travelling south the whole time, i had a clearview of the object for a good 10-15 minutes, without interruption.2. the object was very noticable in that it was where no other pusling redlights typically are, and it behaved differently.  while there are towers in thearea with flashing red lights, this object was intense in a different fashion,appearing to be much higher aircraft height rather than tower height, movingvery slowly.3.  my first thought was that it was a tower light, as they also pulse red...But it appeared to be too distant and far too high.  my second thought was thatit had to be a plane, except that it moved so slowly you really had toconcentrate on the object to realize that it was moving, and that it bore noother of your typical aircraft lighting... no white, no headlight, just solidand intense red.4.  my reaction was interest, primarily... once i had identified it as a pointof interest, i kept my eyes on it the whole 10-15 minutes it took me totravelling from the top of the hill obvious when travelling along stillwaterdown towards and through bangor to the bestbuy near the mall.  aside form havingto pay attention to traffic, i never let the object out of my sight, and evenstood outside my car, in the bestbuy parking lot, observing it 2-5 minutes.5. the object got my attention via its actions... it was quite obviously notattached to a tower as it did move, but it seemed to be far too slow to be aplane, even a helicopter of which there are few to spare in this rural area. though this is only a guess, id think that had i been standing in one spot thewhole time of observation, the object may have only moved a few degrees acrossthe southern sky the whole time observed.  of particular note was theoscillation of the object... there was a definite but changing pattern to itspulsing... it went from staying a solid red for a good 30 seconds towards itsfirst off state and then sequentially speeding up to about 1hz before beginningto slow back towards another 30 second solid red.6. i finally walked into bestbuy, spent about 10 minutes inside, and came outand almost immediately reacquired the object... but at that point it was soclose to the artificial

was under construction andthe complex was quite dark.  as i turned in, i noticed the lights were still tomy left - hovering.  still no sound.  i had to make an immediate right turn, andtraveled about

orion, in south sky.  below orion, saw dull orangelight slowly moving northnorthwest, towards pacific grove and pacific ocean.Moving at speed slightly slower than a satellite, slightly larger in size than asatellite, and the color definitely different than a satellite.  seemed to betravelling low enough to be in earths atmosphere, not high enough to be inspace.  kept observing to see if it were an airplane.  no flashing aircraftlights, just the dull orange light.  from start of observation, craft moved inone line of direction, fairly straightahead but with a gentle curve westward,and pace was slow and steady.  a barely visible vapor trail was being leftbehind the moving craft.  craft travelled this path for approximately 3 to 5minutes.  then craft slowed, hovered for a moment, then moved forward.  duringthis change in motion, a smaller dull orange light, approx. 14 to 18 the size oforiginal light, moved from the back of original light, moving south, away fromoriginal light, for a small distance, then disappeared.  original light movednorthnorthwest for a bit longer with slower, unsteady pace.  then light dimmed,brightened briefly, then disappeared.  total time approx. 6-7 minutes.Thoughts, feelings  when i first looked up toward orion and saw the light,  thepath and speed of the light seemed like a satellite.  but the light was larger,with a different color, and moving slower, than a satellite.  then i noticed thevapor trail behind the light.  the trail remained in the sky after the light haddisappeared, slowly dispersing.  when the light slowed, and hoveredwavered, thenmoved forward at varying speed, that took away the possibility of an airplane orsatellite.  the smaller light coming out of the back of the original light wasdefinitely different.  while observing, was enjoying the experience, even wavedhello to the light, though it was way up there.There was a missile test from vandenberg afb sometime in the night, so hope thiswas not part of that.

and i looked outside and into the sky where i saw adistant object that at the time looked to be floating around, resembling abird,which is what i thought it was to begin with. i was staring at the birdpondering what it must be like to be able to fly to such amazing heights when irealized that the objects structure did not resemble a bird at all. it seemedmore block-like or cylinder-like if the cylinder were lying horizontal, orpossibly even saucer shaped. i then got up and went to stand at the window totry to get a closer look when the object began to descend in a way totallyunlike that of any bird or plane that i have ever seen. it began descendingdownward in what appeared to be a straight line. the object was movingrelatively slowly and appeared quite distant. distance in height if not length.It seemed to be black in color though that could be due to the distance i wasfrom the object. i watched to see if it would disappeared behind an approachingcloud but it remained in view as it moved over the cloud, still moving slowlydown toward the horizon. it eventually did disappear behind a cloud effectivelyleaving my frame of view. i did however seem to lose the object for briefseconds on a couple of occasions before finding it again as it descended,superimposed over the clouds, but i contribute that to my own eyes.The only reason i am reporting this sighting at all is  because of its shapedistinguishing it from any bird or plane i have ever witnessed, and the way itdescended. outside of vtol craft i have never heard of any other craft to tothis. it also seemed smaller than a commercial airliner though again, it couldbe the distance causing a distortion of my perception. i know there have beenmany reported sightings all across the world recently and i am also curious toknow if there have been any other sightings in my area. any information as tothe possiblity of the object being extra-terrestrial would be appreciated and ifthere is anymore information i can givethough it would be limited if anything atalli would be more than happy to share.Regards,josh bjerke","distance":"501 Feet - 1

west and you couldnt notice these two lights in thesky. i already new what they were, because i had seen it before one night. i askmy wife did she see them she said yes. i told her that  is what i seen onenight. i couldnt beleive it, i am actually seeing it again. i went into town andasked people that were standing out did they see them no one seemed to notice.The first time i seen it was a few years earlier. i was laying out early onemorning3am-4amin my girlfriends driveway. at first, i thought it was a shootingstar, but it didnt burn out. then i thought it was a plane, maybe a jet. it wasmoving quickly. but i know that planes have red  blue lights on the wings and ithink a red light on the tail. this object had no other colored lights. i didntthink anything strange untill it started glowing really bright. it went fromwhat looked like a star to a street light in the sky. at that point i sat up, iwas laying on my back. i asked my girlfriend did she see that plane go into acloud and started glowing. i probably sat another hour starring into the skywaiting for it to come out the clouds. it never did.It kinda scared me. ithought it may have been a space shuttle blowing up. the light in the sky was sointense, it put you in mind of the beams you hear people joking about comingfrom spaceships. the one that comes down and picks you up but only it was in thesky. that made me wonder if i had been abducted. but i know that i didnt feelany different or feel like i had been anywhere. my girlfriend didnt seeanything. the 2nd time i seen it me and my now wife was traveling a back road.We were taking the long way into town. about 3 mile out of town i seen them inthe sky. i touched my wife and told her ther they are, thats what i seen thatnight. i had been telling her about it for years. there were 2 softball sizefromwhere we was bright light in the sky. we both seen them. they zig zag a littlebit in front of us, just out of sight to tell what they really were. then onewent into a cloud then glowed and dissapeared. the other just glowed in the openand dissapeared. we both made sure we really saw what we did, or storiesmatched. i didnt tell, her but again i wondered had we been abducted. but ithink they were just letting me know that i really seen what i had seen thatnight. i had tears in","distance":"Over One

several years ago.  it was most likely like 10 or 11 atnight.I was on highway 46.  i was somewhere between where 59 intersects with 46 andriley.  i believe that i was near the cory area or approaching riley.It was a clear night and there was some moonlight as i remember.  so visibilityin the night sky was good.  as i looked ahead on the left hand side of the roadin the distance i saw a dark object in the night sky.  i thought it was a lowflying airplane.  but, it seemed pretty low to the ground and i couldnt yet makeout any lights.  i was curious about this dark spot and kept my eye on it as iwent down the highway.  the dark spot remainded stationary and became larger thecloser i got to it.  i could see the dark object wasnt far from the road on theleft hand side.  as i got closer, i began to slow down so i could better see theobject.  there were two cars in front of me and they also slowed down.As i got closer to the object, i could make out the form - triangular.  i couldeven see white lights coming from what i thought were cockpit lights.  as i goteven closer, i could see that these were recentangular windows at one end of thetriangular object.  as i came right up on the object, i pulled off onto theright hand side shoulder of the road.  so did the two cars ahead of me.  irolled down my driver side window and looked squarely at the object.It was 300-500 yards away.  it was triangular.  it was dark.  it had white lightcoming out of the rectangular windows.  i seem to vaguely remember it had someother lights.  the object was hovering.  actually, i dont think the object movedfrom the first moment that i spotted it.  it was only a few hundred feet up inthe air.  it was large.  ive seen the stealth bomber at the indy 500.  i wouldsay it was in that size range.Up to this point, i was curious.  as i got closer, i became more and moreinquisitive - i wanted to know what this strange thing was.  as i began toexamine the object in a fairly close proximity, i became distrubed.  first offall, it was hovering.  that didnt seem right.  then i realized that i didnt hearit making any noise.  at that point in time, i became afraid.  the two cars thathad pulled over in front of me were quickly pulling back onto the road and sodid i.  we all proceeded away at a high rate of speed.  i distinctly rememberinga feeling that what i was seeing - wasnt right.  i felt it

star, but it moved very slowly and was closer thanit first appeared.  it got closer, but no sound, and no colored flashing lightslike an airplane has.  it got fairly close.  it looked like an egg shapedobject, with an aura around it of whiteblue-white light that got brighter as itgot closer, but never flashed, and never had a sound. it was heading up thecoast northwards and sort of inland, stopped, and reversed direction withoutturning.  it came very close, within 1000 feel i think, but was hard to tellcause the light was so bright i couldnt tell.  the object didnt appear to haveany windows or doors, but the light ring around it was so bright it was hard totell.  nothing seemed reflective.  during this time, i tried to use my cellphone to call a friend, but it just said it was searching for service, and iusually have great signal there.  when the object got closest, it stopped andhovered for like 45 seconds, without a sound.  it then went almost straight up,stopped and dissapeared so fast, i couldnt beleive it  i felt very mezmerizedwhile watching it, and then afterwards i felt very uneasy about it.  i didnttell anyone about it until now, cause i guess people would think i was strangeor something.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
