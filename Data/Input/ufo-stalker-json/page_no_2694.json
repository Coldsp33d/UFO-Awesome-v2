11pm or so, because the t.V. had went off the air. i wasin the second story bedroom of my grandmothers farmhouse in leavenworth kansas. i was the only person in the house that was still awake.  i wasnt real tired butthere wasnt anything to do so i layed down in bed next to the window.  watchingthe storm through the window i noticed that in the field next to my grandmothershouse were several balls of light darting all through this field.  they movedwithin the paremeters of this field like pin balls.  i was looking downward froman angle but from what i noticed they were fairly large, bright, and very fast.The lights were easy to see through the rain, but i cannot say whether theyhovered or were touching the ground. i would have to say that they were at least3ft by 3ft. my first reaction was that i was witnessing some sort of electricalstorm or maybe somekind of ball lightning. it was truly an amazing sight to see.I tryed to wake my brother and my uncle but had no luck, so,i watched them for along while then eventually i fell asleep.  that monday i asked my scienceteacher about them and he did not respond. he only looked at me as if i werelying about what i had seen.  honestly, i did see this. one thing that sticks inmy mind the most was the fact that these things did not leave the boundries ofthis field.  when they reached the end of the field they would bounce like apinball as if there were something it was bouncing off of. there was no fencethat i can remember and if there were, i dont think it was completly fenced. andit wasnt just one that i saw, there were several of them.  alot of time haspassed and i have never met anyone who has seen the same thing.  nor has thereever been anyone who could tell me what it might have been that i seen thatnight in the field.","distance":"21-100

into a bedroom. the garage was located appx. 20yards from the house in our backyard.  i was walking from the house to thegarage with my head down just looking at the ground. about half way between thetwo structures i stopped dead in my tracks. i had an overwhelming feeling that iwas being watched.  never before or since this incident have i ever had such astrong feeling of dread.  i lifted my head and looked out the corner of my eyesnot wanting to turn my head and look directly toward who or what was watchingme.  i was frozen with fear.  i saw a large house size orange sphere hoveringover a large tree in my neighbors backyard. the instant i looked up at it, theobject emmitted a large plume of steam. the object was totaly silent and beganto ascend in a north east direction. even at this young age of 13 i feltimmediatly that this craft was under the control of intelligent beings. becauseof the strong feeling that i was being watched and also the feeling that i hadscared them away.  just as the object began to rise i ran as fast as i couldfrom my backyard, through the house, yelling to my family to come outside. i ranout the front door and onto the lawn.  this dash through the house could nothave taken more than six seconds. but in that short time the object had risen toseveral thousand feet high. and now appeared to be more oval on shape and hadwhat appeared to be windows across the middle of the object.  the objectcontinued to rise as several members of my family and some neighbors watched. my brother and i looked at the object through a pair of binoculars and could seethe windows in more detail. they seemed to be black indentations in the body ofthe object that ran from end to end and parallel to the ground.   we observedthe object for appx. 6-8 minutes until it seemed to enter the upper atmosphereif not outer space. it finally just became to faint to see even with thebinoculars.  today i am 40 years old, and can still recall the overwhelmingfeelings of fear, dread and excitement of that night. this incident did not seemto effect the other wittnesses as severely as it has me. they did not have theclose one on one encounter that i had. if the object was a balloon as some havesuggested to me. then why did i have such a strong feeling of being watched    idont know what this was but i will never forget that night.","distance":"21-100

i had spent more time out in the woods than i hadplanned on, and the sun had already set as i made my way back to my jeep, when inoticed a bright light in the sky moving in my direction.At first i thought it was just an airplane and thought nothing of it. but thenit suddenly stopped moving and began to pulsate, getting brighter and thenfainter. i noticed at this time that there appeared to be a slight hazesurrounding the object. the pulsating increased in tempo until the object wasflickering at a very rapid rate, when suddenly, a bright beam of light shot downfrom the bottom of the object to the ground below. this was no searchlight. evena well focused searchlight tends to diffuse with distance, but this light was atight, bright beam from top to bottom.As suddenly as the pulsating began, it stopped, and the beam also turned off.The object just sat there motionless in the sky. my jeep was only about 100yards away when all this happened, so i ran to it to get my camera. i took apicture of the object as it hovered, and as i got ready to take another picturethe object it began moving around slowly in a tight circle. i took anotherpicture, but before i could take a third, it suddenly shot straight up in theair at fantastic speed and was gone from sight ill attach the two pictures i gotto an email message and send them in. i cropped them down a bit to reduce thefile size. i dont

went off, i popped up, sprung forward, then fell backwards.  icouldnt move, couldnt do anything but think.  i finally managed to move myfoot, then my leg, then sat up on the edge of the bed.  things felt like theywere out of sync, like a wave moving.  [i got up], put my hand on the door,walked toward the bathroom, put my hand on the wall, looked to the right intothe dining room, and saw this black figure [it was if it reflected no light atall]. then i went into the bathroom.  i got the toothpaste, started to brush myteeth, then thought about the figure.  i peeked out of the bathroom, didnt seeanything [in the dining room any more].  the figure had been so black that i sawno features.  there is lots of light in our house from streetlights, etc. [so ishould have been able to see more than i did.]the head was rounder than ours.  it also seemed bigger but not grossly.  it wasnot my nephew [who was living with us at the time], [he is] too tall.  theheight of the black figure was about 4 feet 8 inches to 5 feet tall, it was alittle shorter than my mom, who is 5 feet 1-1/2 inches tall.Other experiencesmy experiences go back to 1988; the first time was probably in july.  it was atnight, i heard a sound like thousands of blowtorches.  i couldnt move. [she wassleeping on the sofa on the porch at home.] i dont know how long it lasted, itseemed like forever.  then it cut off, and i ran to my parents room.  i calledthe police, they informed me that they had just received a call from someonejust a couple of blocks from me regarding an unusual sound.  another person iknow who lives in the camden area about a mile from the nsp generator plant,says they may have been letting off steam, but no way should i have heard it,since i live over 6 miles from the plant.  i called nsp and they informed methat they only let off steam about every ten years, and they said no way could ihave heard it from where i live.Three weeks later my parents were on the porch, around midnight, [theyapparently heard the same sound i had heard,] my dad wanted to go out, but thesound cut off suddenly.  a month later [after the entity experience], [approx. december 1988] dad washome, i had the same out-of-sync experience, with the wave thing.  [i wasstarting into the bathroom], dad said to me what are you doing?  you just wentinto the bathroom half an hour ago!  he said i was wearing a white night gown. i didnt have a white night gown!Years later, my nephew told me of hearing about abductions.  [i hadnt heard ofthem.]my most recent experience was at the end of march this year (2000).  has anyoneever had the experience of coming back into their body?  it felt like somethingbeing thrown at me; it bounced off my bed, into me.  our dog was still alive andjumped up, because she heard it.  it felt like it hit my chest area, but it hiton the left [side of my bed] first.  it was about early morning, i have it in myjournal.[from notes taken during telephone interviews on 9-18-00 and 10-19-02, andwritten testimony from the witness in october, 2002. william i.

approximately 1:15 p. m. in the afternoon.  i wasgetting a sun tan and starting to do setup exercises in my backyard, i waslooking up towards the sky.  beautiful sunny day, to sunny, my eyes weresquinting, i couldnt see clearly.  all the sudden i i see a sparkle up in thesky, way, way, up high.  i mean really high.  and as i looked, kept looking, isaw it was like a stick, so i figured it was a satellite, or a space station orsomething way up above in space.  as i kept looking at it i saw the it kind ofmoved or twisted or curved and that drew my attention to several other littleobjects that were around it, then i thought, hmmmm, maybe its a bunch of loosekites or something strange.  and as i kept looking i noticed it was way to highto be kites and they were more or less stationary with clouds moving underneaththem and through them.  so that made me freak out; i jumped into my house and i,for some stranger reason had a video camera with half the battery left in it,rushed outside, could not find the object with my plain eye, i looked in theviewfinder and i started finding it through the viewfinder of the camera.  andthats when i started noticing the details like all the other objects and lateri saw a triangle shape and i think some of the objects were jetting around,moving around, it seemed others were \"morphing\".  i saw the candy cane-cane turninto a \"t\" into a \"j\", into a weirs \"s\"and  i saw one of the objects underneathturn into a delta configuration by itself and um, i could not believe what i wasseeing; i lost it in a cloud.  i put my camera away and thought \"wow\". that wasincredible that will never happen again and about five minutes later i looked upand saw the same sparkle!  so once again i got my camera; this time i rememberedto put the date and time program into the camera.  i got a lot of referencepoints between my roof and other little birds that were flying around.\"\"to me, the most incredible thing was that although it was very high up in thesky it seemed to be over the flight path of incoming jets to miami internationalairport, since i live there i see that all the time.  of course the jets aremuch, much lower.  sometimes they are up high, but believe me, not even half ashigh as well as what i saw.  and i just thought it was pretty strange.  this allhappened at about 1:30 pm on tuesday, oct. 22nd, 2002.  my
