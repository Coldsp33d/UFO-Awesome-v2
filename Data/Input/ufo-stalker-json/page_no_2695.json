shiny disk shaped objects, hovering above the road in frontof us, approx 100 yd.My grandfather came to a complete stop, and we watched as they hovered for abouta minute, or so, then slowly proceeded to the left, west, skimming over the topsof a crop, i believe maize, but not positive.  the tops of the crop werent beingdeflected, and the two objects were just inches above them.The objects proceeded to the end of the field, approx 300 yd, then flipped to averticle,and were clearly round, then shot straight up and out of sight within3-5 seconds.  there was no sound.","distance":"101-500

jacinto river, i was drawn to a reflection in the sky and some distance away. i first assumed that it was the underbelly reflection of a high altitude commercial jet leaving or coming into bush intercontinental airport. no sooner than that thought entered my head, that the reflection seemed to disappear as though an invisible vaccum cleaner sucked it away toward the west. i looked for the jet thinking it had just turned away from the sunsreflection, but there was nothing in the sky period, not even a cloudin that portion of the sky. i do not know if anyone else saw this or not traffic was light and i did not stop, but i did slow down trying to see a jet in the sky around where that bright reflection had been. i am still trying to decide if i really saw what i saw or making something out of nothing. i thought by reporting to you, you could tell me if anyone else has reported any ufo activity around houston lately i would really appreciate some kind of reply please.","distance":"Over One

high-pitched, oscillating sound coming fromthe west. we heard the sound for about 30 seconds and got up from our campsiteout from under some trees to investigate. the sound was making area coyotesdogshowl like crazy. the object had a red light on one side and a green light on theother, and white lights on the front and back. the red and green lights wereabout a third of the way between the white lights-- if you connected the lights,it would look like a kite. so basically, not terribly unlike a small prop planeif it had lights at its extremities, but it sounded nothing like one.  the red green lights were flashing and the white ones at he front and back stayed litconstantly.It was traveling relatively slow and low and went directly over us. as it did,due to the doppler effect, the sound became lower and the oscillations slower.We followed it until it disappeared into the horizon.  we couldnt actually seethe object, only the lights, so we have no idea about the actual shape, color orsize.We suspected it might be a b-2, but saw one the flying the next day outside ofalamogordo and it did not sound the same at all. based on subsequent internetresearch, were pretty sure it wasnt one. actually, when we logged onto thispage, the sound of opening pop up window is very simnilar.  it sounded somewhatjet-like, but it oscilated unlike any jet i have ever heard.We reported this on the nuforc site when we got back from our trip, but haventgotten any kind of response, so i thought i would report it here as well.  somefeedback would be much appreciated, even if it is just to tell us it was someplane we are unfamiliar with.Thanks in advance.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

shock theobject came into view, stayed in one spot for about 2-3 minutes, then startedheading twords our position. as the object got closer we were able to determine that as opposed to being one large pulsing light, the object seemed to have a triangular shape to it with 3 smaller lights in the triangle corners and one large clearly pulsing light in the center. the center light seemed to be suspended inside the object.The center light pulsed from red-orange-violet-blue-green- and yellow.The center light seemed to be really fluid, where as the 3 outside lights hadthe same rainbow colors, but were less fluid looking they seemed to be timed.The object made no sound. it was the silence of the object that caused the mostdiscomfort for myself and the 2nd witness. we couldnt believe something that bigcould be completly silent.The object appeared looking like an artificially bright planet or star from thenorth west. it approched, passed over our position and headed south east. theobject stopped in the approximate location of eglin afb. the object decendedslowly, as it decended, the object became obscured by trees in our line of view.This craft is almost impossible to see in the night sky unless it moves.I can recall many occasions seeing similer bright artifical planet like objectsin the skythe combination of timed and pulsing colored lights seems to fool yourvisual
