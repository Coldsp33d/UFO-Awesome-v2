appeared to me to be a orb type ufo that was almost directlyover my house here in elk city, oklahoma. (100 miles west of oklahoma city oni-40).I noticed the object was perfectly round, and it was extremely bright-almost too bright to look at directly at first. i also noted a unusual whiteflorescence to it. on closer examination with my 10 x 50 binoculars, it appearedto have 2-3 internal lights of some kind that were clearly visible, similar to ahot air balloon would have. however, it was not a balloon. no other details werenoted. it flew in a westerly direction roughly following i-40 toward amarillo.After it flew from overhead, and at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon, itstarted to rapidly change colors to a yellow, then a bright red and finally to adeep blu!E-purple internal glow that it maintained until it disappeared.I was able toestimate the object to be at about 5,000 feet, and moving at about 25-30 milesper hour, and it was moving steadily to the west.At the time of the sighting wehad a se wind at 5-7 mph.   the object was in sight until about 8:15 pm when itwinked out as i was watching it through binoculars. it went from about a 80degree overhead angle to about 20 degrees above the horizon in that time. atits closest it was about 1/2 the size of the full moon, or about the size ofyour thumb at arms length.I have eliminated weather balloons, planets, stars,aircraft and blimps as a possible explanation. i did notice venus in thesouthwest sky about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. the object did not resemblevenus or a star. there were no aircraft in the area at the time of thesighting.If anyone else saw this object contact me at:jim@thehickmanreport.Comjim hickmanmufon- research specialist- media operations","distance":"501 Feet -
