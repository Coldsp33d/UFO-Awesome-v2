westof us.We watched it for ahour or so until it too fell below the trees. both ofthese objects moved very quickly both up and down as well as from side toside.When we frist saw the object, we thought it was a helicoptor,but i was atone time a pilot and it flew way too fast and no noise.","distance":"Over One

came to slight stop. we were both stunned, unable to talk. we just kind oflooked at each other26 then back to this craft. all of sudden, it was as if someone just flipped aswitch26 this thing disappeared right in front of our eyes. there was another car thatcame past26 it was if they did not see anything! afterwards, on the way home, we wereboth dead silent the rest of the way home. as i pulled into our carport, istopped the truck, turned it off26 just staired ahead for 5 - 10 minutes. i was then able to simply ask my sonif he saw what i did? he was adamant about seeing this too.

moved like a fly), but my wife was saying it was toohigh to be a fly, and after some observation it seemed as high as a normalplane. then it was flying like a frisbee on a 45-degree tilt, or like
