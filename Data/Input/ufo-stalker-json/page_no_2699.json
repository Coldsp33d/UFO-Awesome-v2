whathappened.It was around 9:25-30pm on the evening of may 6th. i was in my(upstairs) bedroom and i just happened to get up and look out the window. it wasdark so i cant give a totally clear description of what i saw, but i did see anobject. and at first it looked like a plane, but as i watched i saw a red lightthat went around it in a clockwise motion. i actually stood there and watched asthe light traveled around it which makes me think it was a saucer or somethinground. i dont know how long i watched itanywhere from a minute or more, but it just hovered and didnt move. thenfinally it just floated away. during the whole time i couldt move. i reallycouldnt believe what i was looking at. to me it looked like a ufo, orsomething, but like i said it was dark and im not sure if it was military orwhat. you see i live 40 minutes away from carswell air force base. i guess i wasin shock, but i just stared at it and my mind was telling my to get my camera,but my feet wouldnt move. and then later i kicked myself for not taking apicture. thats part of the reason i waited so long, because i didnt get apicture. and i dont want people to think i am some kind of nut who alwaysreports these kind of things. you see i reported something last winter under afalse name of michelle muller. well the last name was false. but like i said thepossiblity that i saw something has been bothering

the peruvian airforcemirage jet follow the same path of the triangular shape objects.  we have hadjets flown over the area many times, but this one was shortly after those 3objects passed over the area.  i had told this to my mother at that time, andthen my dad, since he was in the military.  the local tv did not mentionedanything, nor any other one of the neighbors kids saw anything.  i thougth youmight want to record this event for your research.  i dont recall any soundcoming out when the 3 objects hover over the house, only the juet engine rightafter they passed.","distance":"501

when they noticed astar shaped object shimmering in the sky.  a telescope was then set up to get abetter view of this object and allowed the witnesses to determine that therewere actually 8 disk shaped objects arranged in a geometric pattern rather thanone single object.  the objects were stationary and hovering and seemed to bereflecting light rather than being self illuminated.  they described them aspopping in and out of sight and the objects changed the shape of the geometricpattern they were in.Female witness described them as being in a zig zag pattern and they changedpatterns 3 times.  she also stated that previous to seeing them through thetelescope she believed it to be only one object rather than 8 seperate objects. she stated that she had severe headaches 22 hrs after the event which havebecome quite bothersome and will be seeking medical assistance for thiscondition and is currently on migraine medication.  the second male witness described the object as a bright light which was movingand stopping which had a fainter light following it or circling it.  thiswitness watched it for about 5-10 minutes but didnt observe the objects throughthe
