the 2017 solar eclipse ,i attended near i35 and 116 highway near lathrop  mo. on aug 21 /17? \r\n \r\ni live in the 64134 zip , seeing the best track to have a complete eclipse was, there i went. i saw many cars there (i35 & 116 hwy)\r\n\r\ni turned e on 116 hwy ,not long before the start of the eclipse, looking for a place to stop/ park, i see a business that had cars and people there , but a strange flouresant  white vehicle also caught my eye mostly , it was only  35-55 ft away from 116 hwy.\r\n\r\ni am fixated on this bright white minivan shaped vehicle with no wheels or wheel wells it is 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall 20 feet long and near 9 ft wide , but no glass it is all white . the people at the business are  members of the amatuer astronomy society of kc or askc\r\n\r\n(i know this because i saw, 3-4 months ago a kcpt program, eclipse over the heartland  they filmed about them ,there at that time ) the long gray haired woman most interviewed was talking to a elderly man that had approached the ufo to 10 feet ,to ask them to leave , she was telling him to leave it alone.\r\n\r\n\r\ni wanted to see this ufo close up ,but with the traffic behind me honking i continued to brown ave and parked for the eclipse . \r\n?\r\nafter it started getting light again , as i left, nearing brown ave and 116 hwy 2 silver spheres grapefruit sized and about 4' apart came oncoming on the other side of the road , 6\" above the gravel rd. as it neared my car , a 10 year old boy saw it , his mom? and his grandfather too\r\n\r\n wanting to get another view of the  strange craft, just 200-300 ft from where it was traffic blocked me . then multiple police cars code 3 where coming ,then this craft came out of the lot heading e on 116 hwy, \r\n\r\nit hovers, make little noise ,it accelerated so fast and was over the white line on a collision course with me ,to fast for me to move ,i tried to jump to the right side of the car \r\n\r\nwe did not collide ,it passed by  at 60mph ? 1 cop car chasing , i spun around slowly, there were 5-10 people on the s side with cameras ,cell phones that witnessed it.\r\n\r\ni sped on heading east on 116 hwy ,at brown ave the cop pulled of on the side and was confiskating the photography equipment from 8-10 people on a slope there, i passed by \r\n\r\njust down the road i can see the white van like ufo 1/4 mile ahead , i'm the 1st car behind it , it's doing 50-60 mph in the road ,but soon it has slowed ,i am gaining on it \r\n\r\nso i slow to 40 mph but somehow i am doing 70 to 80 mph with out accelerating as i close to 500 ft, the engine reving high because my car is being pulled toward the white craft \r\n\r\ni saw for a moment a orange neon fog or light around the front of my 96 chevy. but then the white  craft takes off at high speed, 120  mph or more,i am watching it intently \r\n\r\nafter 4 or 5 hundred feet it vanishes ,but then reappears some 300 feet ahead of where it had been ,again going even faster, then the same disappears then reappears way ahead of where it had been \r\n\r\nthe last time it going 150 mph? then it disappeared and a snap of  blue electricity, like a coil wire went straight up 300 feet .\r\n\r\nwhen i arrive at 116 hwy and 69 hwy a group of eclipse watchers ( 10 - 15) are starring at my car , looking at me/my car in disbelief ,some holding cameras.  the cop is coming code 3  and took a cut off road \r\n\r\ntrying to stop me but i speed past ,he stops to take the cameras imo, i had stopped just 50 ft ahead for traffic. the cop confronted the bystanders wanting their cameras  \r\n\r\nmy point is many ,many people there  can verify this strange white craft and i'd bet took pictures . \r\n\r\n the police involved seemed to be from kearny/ lathrop or county cops in older pre 92 crownvics or impalas\r\n   \r\ni made a drawing of the dimensions of this white craft .\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

history of paranormal activity. father worked for osi, and brother works for nasa. i, however, lack credibility in societies eyes'. as child, my brother and i always had intense allure with the universe and the existence of other beings. the evening i'm reporting is one of the most perplexing. i have military grade thermal/night vision equipment, and i noticed high activity at the aforementioned address between 2011 and 2015. on this specific evening, i was walking my dog, when i stopped to observe what i perceived as the moon. it was calm quiet country night and i decided to video the moon from the undeveloped back of my neighborhood, which was only accessible on foot. earlier that evening, i observed some regular, but irregular to most, activity in the skies. i didn't have my normal equipment, so i used my cellphone to video the moon. as i am looking at the moon, i see a light appear approximately 50 feet in front of me. then i see more lights, spherical and pulsating a variety of colors. my dog was acting peculiar but i kept recording what was apparently in front of me, although invisible to the naked eye. it was just a few days ago when i decided to look at the video using new software. i adjusted some of the specular options and that's when part of the experience became clear. i still dont know what they were trying to convey to me, thus, i am hoping mufon can help desipher the msg, if any. i have many videos of the same area at day and night but in this video, a being(s) are very close to me. the area is pitch black, which is why i normally use the infra or thermal, but bc i had the dog with me, i left them at home. many unusual experiences, seemingly generationally linked/tied to ancestry in hawaii, and have had contact with military aka \"men in black\" on few occasions. i want to remain anonomous, but anonimity doesn't truly exist anymore. my phone number & cities are accurate. i have other videos, but majority were confiscated. please contact me via text if you are interested in analyzing the video. text the address of where to send video to, and i will ensure it gets there. also, include the name of contact,

(yeah, that's a long time, but this was my first test.) apparently i only ran the test for about 12 minutes, since i had gotten a late start and dawn was already in progress. once the sun was up, i walked out and shut down the gopro. \r\ni downloaded the files onto my computer and really didn't think any more about it. i captured more sunrises, on other days and around the middle of february i finally got a piece of software that i could stitch the individual frames together with into a movie. so, around the 13th of february, while i was rendering the first video, i saw something in the sky that wasn't moving in the clip. watching it again i noticed it was a very windy day in the upper atmosphere and the cloud ceiling was probably right around 11,000 feet. and there is this \"object\" in the clouds...The clouds are going around it and it is stationary right at the level of the clouds. \r\ni only captured 46 frames of video. the camera has an 8k pixel count. this object was less than a mile from my house. i have no idea what it was or how long it was hovering there. i did not actually ever see it live... only on my video.","distance":"501 Feet -

7 as i was walking out of the supermarket holding groceries in both my hands.I was walking along the pavement on it heading towards a nearby cafe.I always look up the sky since i have always believed in their existence.So when while walking i looked straight ahead up the sky at first i thought it was a plane but at second glance i saw it was like a piece of gold oblong and its width was as wide as the width of the road so i was at the same time walking and looking at it for about8 minutes till i reached the cafe.There many people were and i asked one to come see whati wasseeing.By the time he stood up because he was laughing when he heard the word ufo the object had gone far away but it was stiil seen by me but very small as it now was far.The second time i saw a ufo was if i recall the same summer but later at night between 9 and 11\r\ni was sitting alone at a taberna eating .I was in front of a big avenue and i was looking across the street where a private school was at the first floor when suddenly i see a round ufo in a matter of second appearing with 6 or 7 lights lit standing vertically so i had full view of its round size and lights.I was stunned as i never thought i would see such a thing so bery near my house .It was less than 10 minutes the whole thing cause it apeared while i was lookking the first floor of the building and since the ufo stood next to the first floor i could easily compare sizes.It was as wide as the first floor of the building.As i saw it i thought well it will pass behind the buildin and continue its course when i suddenly saw it go the othet way.I thought it seemed as if it wanted to locate me...It stood where i had full view of it and then turned back instead of continuing.Now let me say about the third time i saw 2 round and big ufos around 3 months ago from the balcony of my kitchen but i cant recall exact time.It was dark and cloudy as it had rained eatlier\r\nit must have been after 7 and earlier than 11 at night.I went out on the balcony when while looking at the cloudy sky i saw some light coming through the clouds.I looked to see where it was coming from and i saw 2 round big disks luminating behind the clouds making circles in the sky as is playing together and and light was coming out one of them and was direvted towards the earth down .It seemed as if the ufo was looking to spot something which was down and used the light for this reason.I was stunned....\r\nthats my experience the 3 times in

(i'm 29 now, so we're talking around '96-'97), so i can't give a specific date or time and of course my testimony is not reliable. i witnessed this with my sister who is 6 years older than me, although when i've asked her about it recently, she told she's seen so many ufo's in her life they all kind of blend together, and while confirming the event seemed hazy on the details i offered her.\r\n\r\nas best as i can remember it was after dinner and i was playing with my sister in the front yard. i distinctly remember calling my sister over to show her a spider i found in a shrub that was hurriedly spinning up a captured bug in it's web. this was in san jose, california where the winters are pretty mild, but i feel like seeing the spider outside probably means it wasn't winter. i was kind of transfixed for a bit watching the spider work, and it had gotten dark. that was when we hear a loud noise from the sky. in my child's memory it sounded like a giant laser, like a sonic boom, but... higher pitched? the sound was accompanied by an object that seems to fly across the entire sky in only a second. it was a triangle rapidly spinning. i couldn't tell if it was a flat triangle or a triangular prism, as it seemed to be spinning on multiple axes, like a gyroscope. but the most distinctive thing was the light it created, it was bright red- or it could have been more orangish, or pinkish, but for the brief moment this thing was careening across the sky, it seemed to light up the whole world in a red hue which lasted for split-second after the object had flown out of sight, then faded away. i have no idea how high up it was but it seemed to me to be around the same height as airplanes fly. \r\n\r\ni remember going inside and being surprised our parents didn't hear it, because it was loud! i remember not registering what we saw as a \"ufo, like on the x files\" until my sister told me that's what it was, and then being terrified. i remember us describing it to our parents and them suggesting that because we described it as coming from the west or north-west that it might have come from moffett field air base, just to the northwest of us in the blossom hill neighborhood of south san jose. i remember asking classmates about it the next day and getting blank stares. it's always bothered me that what i saw was so loud and so bright and over such a densely populated area that it seems impossible that this could have been an experience limited to only me and my sister. whatever this was, it's not something you would miss if you didn't happen to be looking up at the sky at the right moment. it was the kind of thing you'd think would be more likely to draw neighbors out of their homes saying \"what the hell was that?\"\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

of seeing an egg shaped ufo and the feeling of calmness and no need to do anything. my story is much the same as his and the main reason i'm reporting it is because of how rare the egg shaped is said to be according to anther guy who was on the podcast (director of something in mufon). \r\nin the summer of 2007 i was outside playing volleyball with a group of guys. at some point i took a break and let someone play my position for a while and i laid down in the grass to rest. that's when i saw an odd looking airplane flying overhead. it stood out as odd to be because it had a strange egg like shape and flew \"sideways\" to the way i'd expect an egg shape to move. neither the narrow end or the wide end was the nose of the craft as it flew but instead the wide and narrow ends were like the wings so that it was flying broadside that really doesn't look aerodynamic at all. the craft looked flat black to me although i wonder if it was just a dark silhouette. it flew basically overhead from one horizon to the opposite horizon. i think it flew east to west. it looked like it was as high up in elevation as most airliners and it seemed to fly approximately the same speed as a regular airliner. overall it was no different from seeing a regular jet fly overhead except the shape was so strange looking like an egg and looking black. \r\nthe other thing i've never shared with others i've told about it is how calm i felt and just didn't want to do anything more than watch it just like the guy on the podcast spoke about. i remember thinking at the time i was seeing it that i should tell at the other guys playing volleyball to look at it. i would look at them and just didn't want to do anything. i thought it was odd then and still do and never really wanted to talk about it because o felt like others would critize me with something along the lines of \"how convienent, you saw a ufo with a dozens guys around and you don't say a word to anyone?\". seemed dumb to me then but now hearing someone else with the same story really makes me wonder if somehow i was being affected at a distance somehow. no clue how that would work but it's one heck of a passive defensive ability to pacify observers if true.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

clock just struck 3am, i was walking back to my house next door which is only 10 feet away, as i was walking i just happened to look up, and when i looked up it was literally right above me, how low it was i was able to see the ufo clear as day and my german-shepard was just going nuts barking at it, out of  fear i couldn't move, i watched it hover over me, seeing all those weird colors i could see on it, it was moving real slow, it had to be hovering less then 15 mph, the way it looked on the bottom of the ufo, the edges of it had red lights rotating around it, the main frame of the bottom was either silver or metallic with 3 orange lights in the middle of it, when it was no lopnger above me i could see which looked like a window, the ufo had to be at least 30 feet wide and 15 feet tall, i was able to see ufo until it flew out of my sight heading towards the riverside, im not sure if anyone eles in the reserve was outside at the time, me and my uncle both seen this ufo, im just really curios if anyone else seen it to, i couldn't take a picture of it because i have no phone, as soon as i lost sight i quickly got my drawing set and drew an exact description of how it looked when i was right under it and another one of how it looked when it was no longer above me, after i was done the sketches of the ufo i grabbed my computer and filed my ufo sighting, and as im typing right at this minute, i have a severe headache and my eyes for some reason have a burning type of feeling, i'll never forget this night for as long as i live, now i know that we are not the only ones in the universe, what i seen tonight just proves it, i'll be more then happy to share my sketches with mufon if someone was to reach out to me. its now 4:07, its real late and im going to head to bed
