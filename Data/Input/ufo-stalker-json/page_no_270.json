astonish, and watched its trajectory until i lost line of sight behind tall neighboring house.  waited a split second to recover my view but nothing was there. no disintegration, evaporation, or trail.  this object was definitely a solid shape, not a laser, and was traveling fast enough to break the sound barrier, but i heard no sonic boom.  i went back inside with a little crawly feeling in the spine and spoke to my parents about the sighting.  father is in aviation and having a lot of trouble explaining away what i saw.  pretty hard rational skeptic and found myself almost defensive about my observations to them.  never seen anything like this before.","distance":"Over One

but, i don't remember why, it was getting dark.  i noticed a light between two trees that seemed like a shooting star but, there was a strange feeling i had about it.  anyway, that same night i had a dream where i was running down king st. away from the house but, at the end of the street, instead of turning, i went up into the sky, sort of like running up an invisible steep hill.  strange dream but, just a dream, right?  the next morning, i was awakened by my girlfriends children, in the front yard no less.  i have no idea how i got outside.  i've never sleep walked before and never have since that time.  i began going through changes starting as soon as they woke me.  the children seemed to understand what was happening because they spent a lot of time with me, they gave me some time to kind of \"re-boot\" for lack of a better term.  then they helped me to strengthen my body by getting me to jog after them on their bikes and other such things.  i don't know what happened that night but, and i am sincere in saying this, something either happened to me or i am not that me anymore.  sometimes i get this feeling that i'm somewhere else too.  i know it sounds like i'm crazy but, i'm not.  i need to be put under hypnosis but there's no one around here to go to.  if you guys can point me to a hypnotherapist that will not judge me, i really need to know what happened that

was rolling around in my bed trying to sleep. i opened my window to let in some fresh air when i noticed a bright sphere in the sky. first i thought it was a airplane but the sole airport was in the opposite direction and there we no sounds associated with planes or helicopters. i grabbed my glasses off my study table to make sure of what the object was, when i glanced at it for a second time it started accelerating upwards at breakneck speed. it accelerated for 5 or so seconds before disappearing out of sight completely. i was in complete awe of what i had witnessed and checked the sky again for aircraft, then concluding that no aircraft were present except the mysterious object, i had guessed it to be an ufo. i lost sight of it when it was speeding upwards and the sight was blocked by my rain blocker at the top of my window. i re-positioned myself to get a better angle but it was gone by then.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
