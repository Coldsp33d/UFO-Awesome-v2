some football.  it was a late summer-time dusk.  we bothobserved a three pointed craft, moving from south to north at a steady speed andwithout sound.  our first thought was that it was a conventional aircraft. however, there were no blinking lights, such as one would expect on an aircraft,and no engine sound whatsoever.  there was one steady white light at each cornerof the craft, and a black triangle-shaped expanse in between.  as the craftpassed under a star, the stars light was blocked out.  the craft disappearedfrom view on the northern horizon.  we went home and reported this sighting toour parents.  both of us remember this event to this day, as do our parents.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

which atfirst looked like an airplane flying too low.  she watched to see if it was introuble or going to crash. she slowed down (10-15 mph) and was trying to figureout why an airplane would be in that particular place, flying so low and movingso slow.  using a lamppost for a guide she decided it was not moving at all soher next thought was that it was some sort of light tower.  she states that sheknew that it could not be a tower in that particular place and then she thoughtufo.  she stated that cars were driving by quickly and she wondered why theywere not slowing down to see what this object was.  as she got right next to it,she pulled into the parking lot of an abandoned gas station so she could lookright up at it.  she opened up her car door to ascertain if there was any noiseand all she could hear was the noise from the road.  when she opened up her doorit made a sharp turn to the west.  she followed it with her eyes for a fewblocks and the lost sight of it.  she then drove on a road going west but neversaw it again.  the clock in her car stated 8:48 p.M. she states the object was solid and shiny.  it had very bright white lights in acircle with red lights in the middle

someone was moving around in his basement, so he went there to check. he saw no one.  his german shepherd dog was barking, whining and acting as if anintruder was outside, so mr. _____ thought the noises were coming from someonearound his vehicle.  he went outside to check at 12:18 a.M. he saw no one, butthen saw a large round white light in the southeastern sky.  it was not movingat the time, so he went into the house for his 7x35 sears binoculars. (578 at1,000 yds.)  he said to his wife, \"get up, you have to see this!\"the light was dimmed (by the haze?) but with the naked eye it appeared the sizeof an orange held at arms length and through the binoculars it filled half thefield of vision.  if the house lights and yard light had been on, the lightcouldnt have been seen.They called their neighbor, ________ who came out and also viewed the objectthrough the binoculars.  they all agreed there were three rows of rectangularlime-green lights for a total of 12 lights.The object remained in the same place for 20 minutes without moving, then thegreen lights went out.  _____ told investigator that when the green lights wentout, they saw a little red light under the white object and slightly to theright.  the object started to move in an erratic pattern, described by the 3witnesses as a \"sky show\".  they said during the acrobatics which continueduntil about 1:30 a.M., the object made movements at various times as shown bythe sketch included within the report.  it would often stop and hover.  they estimated its closest point about a mileaway and they could hear a pulsating humming sound as it moved through thepatterns,which was alternately louder and softer.  the white light appeared to bebrighter in the center than at the edges, but he haze made it difficult toperceive any details.  mr. _______ called the lansing capitol city airport andcontrol reported nothing on their radar.At about 1:30 a.M. an officer from the sheriffs department arrived and saw theobject at a great distance (estimated 3 to 5 miles), then watched it as it camecloser and moved back again.  he admitted he didnt know what it was, butwouldnt identify it as a ufo.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
