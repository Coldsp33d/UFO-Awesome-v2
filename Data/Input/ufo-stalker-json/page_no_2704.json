lights when somedistance away did not show the same configuration as she thought them to be upclose (and without her glasses on).The entire episode lasted for perhaps 3 minutes, with the very close, but verybrief sighting of perhaps ten (10) seconds or less near the house furnishing themost clarity for the witness perception - even given the fact that she was notwearing her glasses.Note:  it should be noted that witness at age 18 and on her way home from a highschool dance, saw steady red lights (lower than a jet liner flies) which movedback and forth...And when she pulled in to her home driveway, she stood andlooked for 3-4 minutes before it moved away.Note:  it should also be noted that witness (in a telephone conversation withinvestigator trout) referred briefly to recalling some

were toddlers, and the older two children being age 11 and12) were on their way from sioux city, iowa back to omaha, nebraska on i-29(southbound) when south of missouri valley, iowa (about 3 miles north of thenorth omaha exit, which turns west on i-680), they sighted a lighted objectabout one-half mile ahead of their vehicle.The mother called the familys attention to the light ahead of them, commentthat the lights looked like a crown.  it was at first thought that the objectwas an airliner on approach to eppley airfield several miles south of theirposition.  but as the vehicle neared the lights, the family realized that theobject was hovered beside the opposite side of the interstate, rather thanmoving, and realized they were looking at what appeared to be a ufo.They also observed that traffic on the opposite (northbound) side of theinterstate had drastically slowed and that 4 cars had stopped as if observingthe object and that one individual had gotten out of a vehicle and was lookingup at the object.At closest approach, the object was perhaps 500-600 feet ahead and diagonally tothe left (se) of the witnesses vehicle and at an estimated 500 feet altitude. as witnesses vehicle drew near, the object suddenly began to rise, and as itdid so, the witnesses perception was that the objects lights seemed to flip360 degrees (briefly disappearing from view as it flipped, then reappearing intheir original position) as it rose straight up into the clouds and disappeared.Note:  it should be noted that altitude estimates are always subject to thewitness perception.  because of the 2,200 foot cloud ceiling, we at least knowthe object was below 2,200 feet altitude - and the object may in fact have beenno higher than the witness estimate of 500 feet.  without the ability to be morespecific, what seems obvious is that the sighting was close, and at fairly lowaltitude.Sighting duration was perhaps 3-4 minutes.  to the witnesses, the size of theobject was indeterminate - they indicated that it was smaller than an airliner. the adult (father) witness is a well-spoken, thoughtful type individual, who didnot try to over-conclude during phone conversations with the investigator beforenor during the on-site interview conducted on february 17, 2002.  the twoadolescent witnesses, ages 11 and 12, are intelligent children, fascinated andamazed by what they saw and articulately willing to share their perception ofthe incident.  the children exhibited nothing giddy or frivolous as theydescribed and drew sketches of their perceptions of what theyd seen.  theysimply entered seriously into the conversation when encouraged to do so, as wedrove to the site and sat parked for 30 minutes viewing the area.","distance":"101-500

2001, regarding this sighting.  i interviewed her in january of 2002.Witness description:the witness is a 79 year old female.  she is a homemaker and retired bank andmortgage clerk.  she indicates that her health and hearing are ok and her visionis correctable to 20/20 using eyeglasses, which she was wearing at the time ofthe sighting.  she describes her education level as a partial college education. she has extensively followed the ufo phenomenon in the last few years andindicates that she may have had a number of psychic and ufological experiences.Sighting account:the witness was doing some quick household chores on the main floor of her houseat about 10:30 pm.  she was momentarily standing on her back porch, which is onefloor above ground level, facing southeast.  she indicates that she oftenobserves the sky, and at this moment, she looked up and observed a largetriangular object nearly due south in the sky at an elevation of about 50degrees or higher.  the object moved out of her view so she ran into her living room, which has asouth facing window, and attempted to look up at the object.  she was unable tosee it due to the overhang of the roof.  she thus lost sight of the object atthat point.She felt that the total sighting time was under two minutes [cl estimate:probably less than one minute].  object description:she describes the object as being about six times larger than an aircraft wouldappear at that location.  it moved slowly and silently in an east to west path. she did not know the elevation, and thus could not estimate its size, however,its angular size was larger than that of a garage about  blocks away from whereshe stood [cl estimate, angular size would have been at least that of hand atarms length].The object was described as having at least three non-blinking blue lights oneach wing and one at the apex.  the color was described as dark, but notabsolute black.  the motion of the object was slow, smooth and silent.
