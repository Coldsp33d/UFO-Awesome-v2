south.  the object was much larger than a helicopter andmoved to slow to be a passenger jet. itemitted a low, humming noise as it passed over.  we got into our van and wentsouth of town where the object slowly disappeared.  we watched for a few minutesasking each other if what we saw was real or imagined.  after returning home(10-15 minutes since we first saw the object) there it was again, this timemoving south to north...Same lights, same noise.  my wife mentioned at the timethat she was having difficulty focusing on the object.  i grabbed my camera andtook some shots that did not come out.  we got into the van and headed north towhere we last saw the object.  when we stopped and got out, we didnot see the object but we did see four jets (flying in military formation)moving north to south, when suddenly one jet broke off and flew to the west forseveral seconds before rejoing the group.  we watched the jets fly south andjust as they were to go out of sight, another jet broke off, flew east then backtowards us and then continued moving northwest.  we did not see the objectanymore but did call the local police, who said they did get some calls and thathe faa had been notified.  a follow up call the next day got us absolutelynowhere.  we did notice that our home radio, which was tuned in to a localstation had gone to total static and would only fix itself after i turned it

took them over main street and numerous homes.  theywere traveling slowly enough to be followed by cars and were about 1000 feet up.09the craft eventually moved into the naval base air space and the police wereunable to pursue them further.09my father was a communications specialist and did work on the communicationsrepeater atop b mountain so he had keys to all of the locked gates and clearancepasses as well.  the front gate guards were watching the craft in amazement anddid nothing to stop us from proceeding.  we started up the mountain on a windingroad.  we could see the ships periodically as we turned towards them on theroad.  they  were making better time than us and when we came around one of theturns they were on the ground about 300-500 feet from us.09we sat for a

5 minutes) thecraft were no longer there.09after that we went back home and the next day we contacted a friend of thefamily who was on duty with the police that night and he said93it never happened.94

similar to a searchlight, but stead and not moving.  at first i thought it was a police helicopter(1 or 2 as large and very bright) as news reported looking for a burglar. thought they must be searcing that area.  the light kinda faned out or got widerfrom top to bottomonly can think of search light as comparison.  it was kinda near the arizonapublic service electric company office where they have trucks stored in back andi dont know what else.  the light kinda indicated somebody/something was beinglooked for.  as i went through intersection, i looked away and then looked back. when i looked back light was gone and there was like cloud of smoke whichslowly dissipated...Nothing there.  i looked all over for some type of plane butthere was nothing there.  in the past i have seen bright, broad bands of lightin the sky which seemed to disappear the minute i see them.  they usually gohorizontally from start to finish very quickly.  im always looking for ufos. so far, i have only seen lights.","distance":"101-500
