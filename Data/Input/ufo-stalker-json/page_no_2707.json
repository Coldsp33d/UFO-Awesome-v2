thought was a plane.  he states he was not frightenedand the object then flew rapidly to the southwest out of sight.The following is from the fi report:on july 26, 1987 a security guard reported for work at 6:00 pm, his usual shifttime.  he works at a new car dealership where he has been employed for twentyodd years.  at midnight he sat down at his desk, which is located just insidethe front door, on the north side of the building.  from this vantage point hecould see the entrance drive and the north parking lot.  he noticed that the skywas filled with big fluffy white clouds that kept seperating at they moved tothe northeast.  suddenly a dark object burst from the big white clouds, movingin a straight line with the building.  he was amazed because the object remindedhim of a big stingray as he sat watching its approach toward him.  he estimatedthat the object was some thirty feet across and fifteen feet high.  he suddenlyrealized that the object was slowing as it descended.  jumping up he ran acrossthe showroom to the south exit, unlocked the door and stepped out into thefenced storage lot.  the object moved over the top of the building, glidingslowly and silently over the guard.  he gauged the altitude of the object by atree line which is some fifty feet from a chainlink fence.  the craft had tobank sharply to the right to avoid colliding with the trees.  as it banked tothe right the craft ascended at the same time it went up to an altitude ofapprox. 100 ft.  the craft then crossed over i-75.  after reaching the west sideof the expressway, it stopped and hovered about 300 ft. away from the witness.It continued to hover for four or five minutes.  it suddenly took off at aterrific rate of speed, moving to the southwest.  he said the craft was darkgrey, thirty feet wide, thirty feet long and was sporting 2 very large, orangishred, glowing lights on its rear.  when the object banked, stopped and hovered,the body looked fat at the front and tapered toward the tail, like a helicopter.There was no sound, no wings, no rotors, no windows, no other lights.  he said,\"maybe it was a new plane that the air force is trying out.\"  at 5:58 am theobject was sighted again.  it came from the southwest, moving toward thenortheast at a high rate of speed. once again it started to slow, banked leftover the same tree line, crossed over the expressway (i-75) stopped, hoveredover the same vacant field for 11 minutes before it took off real fast to thenortheast.","distance":"21-100

the west which seemed to be hovering over the northend of yarmouth island. i kept staring at it wondering what it could be. i triedto look at it through my binoculars, but the stabilizer needed new batteries. icouldnt hold it steady so it made the lights dance. the light was very brightand after a few seconds appeared to be rising above the trees. i thought it wascoming closer and decided to wake my husband. he arrived just in time to get aglimpse before it disappeared lowering the sky and going behind the trees on theisland. after that it was gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

that i saidthat is because it was smaller than the sun but it was big. it was about halfthe size of the sun at a distance. then, the spacecraft landed approximately 15feet away from us. to tell you the truth, i did actually think that it was aflying object. when i first saw it, i was very excited because it was new to meand i like things that are new. the object was saucer like, it was

past were back in the sky.  i looked out andsure ennough there were the same bright lights.  first there were four of themjust sitting there, not dropping like they would if they were on parachutes.  ididnt watch them all the time.  they look like powerful electric lights justhanging there together.  then there were three of them stationary and fairly lowin the sky.  a couple of years ago we saw the same thing.  the light just sitthere and they come on and then seem to just shut off without notice.  theydont go up like flares or rocket launches and you dont see contrails.  theydont make any sounds they just hang there.  they dont appear to be very faraway.  my wife was off playing cards, so i decided to use her camera even thoughi dont understand it.  i didnt think i was able to capture anything on film,but i tried anyway.  i took one photo from inside the house and then wentoutside to take the second.  i was surprised when i saw that they did come out. we do have a bombing range south of us, but these lights were east of us.  wenever see anything in the paper about them even though people have witnessedthem several times.","distance":"101-500
