( 5miles from highway) i cant remember the name of the highway but it goesdirectly north and south between defuniak springs and freeport. my lot was on aspot known as rock hill, i believe one of the highest places in the state offlorida. anyway we lived in ft. walton beach and so would reach the highway andhead south, after heading east on the dirt road for five miles. then we wouldhead east again on highway 20 when we reached freeport, traveling all the wayinto ft. walton.    as soon as we left my lot we saw a light appear right abovemy car, then a second light and then a third, forming a triangle,and then fromthe first light a new light would go from it to the second and then back againto the first , then the lights would go out in the opposite order that they cameon. the lights looked similar to auto headlights. they part of one craft. thecraft was within 500 feet maybe as close as 200 feet at times. the craft stayedwith us , repeating this strange (signal?) every minute or so. we drove all theway to freeport with the craft just above us( about 12-15 miles). we stopped atthe convenience store at the intersection of highway 20 and bought a soda. whenwe left the store , turning east towards niceville/ft. walton, the craft wasright on top of us again. ( after we had seen the craft for the first 2 or 3times i asked my friend if we could stop and look more closely, but he wasdeathly afraid to do so and so i did not stop the car, i had the feeling that ifwe had stopped the craft would come down to us and was a little afraid myself)anyway, the craft followed along with us all the way to the outskirts ofniceville where it left us and headed a about half a mile to the north, thereother craft appearing the same way joined it , literally, forming one craft.There were many of them, maybe 5 or 6 . then small orbs, red in color and flyingerraticaly, would join it as well. these craft came from the woods below andfrom the horizon.  then a few craft broke off again and streaked away indifferent directions. then the craft emmitted a shower of sparks from the side , sat there a moment and shot off to the north east.  i am an airforce brat, haveserved time in the army, and am college educated. i have never seen anythinglike this in my life and have know idea what it could have been. my guess is itwas extraterestial. i know about stealth blimpsn etc. and thought maybe, but thesmall orbs (the size of beach balls) and the sudden speeds these triangularthings were capable of were just incredible.  it was a clear night and thesewere all of these were below any cloud cover anyway.     about a year beforethis , in   broad daylight, while on my lunch break , in navarre florida , iwitnessed what looked like a rusty metal cylinder fly by, heading south towardsthe gulf of mexico, approximately 150 feet directly above me and maybe 50 milesan hour making no sound. i could almost see flakes of rust on this object, ihave no idea what this was either. there were no other witnesses that i know of,my co-workers had gone to lunch and i was at the shop alone unfortunately.Recently i have read other reports of people seeing the same triangular craft,even the emmissions of sparks etc.  do you know what i saw and do you think itwas signaling us with the triangular lights and motioning light etc.?          thanks for your interest , i really saw these things and have no reason to makeit up.  my number is 808-981-0000 if you have questions or would like to hear ofmy earlier childhood experiences, i hate all this writing! lol      i haveseveral stories i should probably write down , with witnesses , but sheesh!

wouldneed to fly such advanced craft in a v,     why the lead group were flying in aclump, why they were being so brazen as to fly in broad daylight over a busyhighway.5.  assuming they were 150 ft in

yards.  the echeloning group were spaced about 5 craft lengths apart, maybe250 yards.  these estimates are based on a diameter of 150 feet. but the shipscould have been much smaller or larger.  they were about 5-10b0 from vertical, compass north from my car, flying right above and parallel tothe mountain ridge above the town.6. as i was driving well over 60 mph, i had tokeep my eyes mainly on the
