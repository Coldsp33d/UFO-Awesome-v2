feeling that they might be associated with war. description of object/lights:the witness described initial flash and the later orange flashes to the south asbeing about 1 to 2 inches long at arms length [cl note: it was not clear if thiswas the path length traveled by the light sources, or if it was the actual sizeof an object/light].  the two flashes lasted for about three seconds and seemedto parallel each other.  they seemed to remain relatively stationary and thendisappeared.The other lights were described as white and twinkling.  they appeared to befast moving  and were described as being difficult to actually count.  theprimary witness estimated that there were about 5 or 6 lights present.  she alsonoted that there were no red or green lights associated with them, which mightbe expected on aircraft.  the lights motion was generally such that one wouldseem to vanish from one spot and reappear in a different spot (about 4 inchesaway at arms length).  she did not observe motion between the two points [note:elapsed time between disappearance and reappearance?].Both witnesses felt that the altitude was not extremely high.  the primarywitness gave an elevation of about 30 to 45 degrees.  they appeared to be at anelevation at, or above the level of nearby telephone wires which were about 70yards away. [cl note: an elevation of less than 15 degrees would be required inorder to be consistent with geometry of distant aircraft maneuvers.  seeanalysis, below].  the two witnesses watched the lights for what they estimated to be about 10minutes.  during that time they brought the light show to the attention ofanother employee who was nearby working briefly on a truck at the warehouse(note: his name, but no other contact information is known).Sighting ending:one light then headed quickly from the south-southwestern sky to the southernsky where it vanished.  the witness describes the other lights as vanishing. the primary witness indicates that the lights disappeared with no observabledeparture or fade-out.","distance":"Over One
