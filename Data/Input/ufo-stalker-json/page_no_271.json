am trying to update and correct previous case # 42144.  i singed up for disqus and it wouldn't allow me to do so.  i have tried to correct this many times.\r\nfor starters it wasn't deer park.  it was elk washington on bridges road.  this is a sparsely populated area where people have acreage.  i'm sorry i made that error as well as being unclear about numerous other points.  i have always confused those two towns.  it wasn't my property.  i apologize for that. i continue to wish to remain anonymous.\r\n  one female(me)and one male were walking outside and i don't remember what we were going to do but i was preparing to smoke a cigarette.  i think it was late spring.  it was warm.  what made me first realize that something wasn't right was the sound of dogs barking in every direction, lots of dogs.  that in itself was spooky. we both stopped and listened.  then all sound was literally shut off like a light switch.  it was the weirdest thing and completely surreal.  everything was just wrong.  \r\n  as we were standing there still, we both became aware of what appeared to be craft.  i saw one immediately to my right and just above the trees.  if it was any lower it would be hitting the trees.  this one was pretty close.  there was another one to the north and it was further away.  i didn't see that one right away so i don't know how close it was to begin with.  it was probably 150 feet or so when i saw it. i am not great at estimating distance but that should be reasonably accurate.\r\n  they were matte black and triangular.  they had a bunch of lights.  one thing that bothers me to this day is that i can't quite remember what color all of the lights were.  it seems there were many colors but i can only be sure about a couple colors.  i think it may have had tons of different colors but i can't verify that.  something is really wrong with that in itself.\r\n  i am sitting their in absolute wrapped attention, analyzing with all my powers of observation on this thing, for a good period of time, and i can't remember what color all of the lights were?  so there was some confusion or distortion there.\r\n  i think the rest of the story was pretty clear.  my feelings were that i was very excited afterwards.  it was almost similar to a mild mania (not crazy but overly excited).  i was just absolutely floored and amazed.  there was a really high excitement level and it lasted for days, maybe longer.  i still think about it frequently.  my viewpoint had changed forever (never believed in these things).  i can't necessarily justify it but i don't believe they were military (as i described in my prior report i do have some experience with military craft) and i for some reason i don't believe they were craft either.  i think they might have been things that projected an image of craft. i feel like whatever it was or truly looked like, was concealed in some fashion.  \r\n  there were some strange incidents later and i was told that the other individual had seen them around since and also others had.  there was a tv show talking about an incident in the area.  i believe it was unsolved mysteries.\r\n  one strange incident that i believe was related, was the two of us perceiving a light while asleep.  basically i became aware while sleeping that a light was shining on my face.  i sat up and smacked the other individual to wake them up.  i said nothing to them as i was silently observing.  the light appeared to go off just as i opened my eyes.  it was timed perfectly to where as my eyes opened it was gone.  i never saw the room lit up.  when the individual woke up due to my minor assault :) they stated \"was there just a light shining in our effing face?\"  \r\n  right there i sprang out of the bed threw shoes on and ran around the property.  there was fresh snow and no trace of anything.  i looked up and couldn't see anything.  i examined the tiny and highly placed window in the bedroom, which i was sleeping parallel to and under, and there is no way with the combination of the trees, window position etc. that somebody could have shined a spotlight into that window and onto my face and it was too bright to have been directed elsewhere.\r\n  i had a lot of strange dreams some of which were revealing about my situation.  some were nightmares about the other individual who i was dating at the time.  some of the dreams turned out to be accurate and about things i was unaware of.  if this stuff was trying to involve itself in affairs via dreams it would have been isolating him from me because i was done with that situation shortly there after.\r\n  i really don't feel that i was ever abducted personally and i have no reason to believe he was either.  if somebody was it would likely have been him because the activity continued around there.  i have experienced some paranormal things afterwards but it was years later and in a different state.  it involved \"poltergeist\" activity and there were bunches of sighting of lights in the sky and things in very close proximity to my domicile during this time.  these reports can be found on your page near the capital of bismarck north dakota.  near the bismarck demons (wth, yes that's their mascot) high school.  none of those reports were made by myself but i had poltergeist activity and other things at the time, and even the night of reported events.\r\n  i should also add that i think it's possible that i have received some government or other agency's attention.  i feel a tad harassed. i have repeatedly had government census, dept of commerce census and even a \"government mental health survey\" bothering me more than anybody else i know. on one occasion the individual behaved in a very intimidating and cop-ish/spook-ish manner. he seemed perfectly normal but with a authoritarian attitude. that isn't the type of person you would send door to door to convince people to do voluntary surveys now is it?  i politely refused to participate and he was attempting to intimidate me.  he inquired about where i was moving to (my house was for sale). that was in nd and that pissed me off bad enough to motivate me to report this happening.\r\n  i think it's all related.  i don't believe these things are friendly and i would resist any agenda they may appear to have.  maybe that's why the government, or whoever, is nervous about who they come into proximity to.\r\n  i did get a no-flash picture of a orange misty thing during poltergeist activity.  it is quite interesting but i am not willing to show it to the public because it might reveal where i lived in combination with the other information i have provided.   \r\n ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

track.Which is locked by the national forest service at this time of year.When we first seen the object we was at 2900 feet,we desended to about 2100 ft. and it desended along with us until it appeared to be maybe 300 or 400 ft. above us.It seemed to almost touch the ground at times.At other times it moved along just ahead of us and would be in the forest because i could see trees outlined in front of it.As we traveled up the valley along the creek it moved along with us.At times it looked rectangle shaped and you could see red lights all along its side.It gave off a brite silver light like a star almost.I followed it past our home and when i stopped to turn around it came back as if it was waiting on me.Then just last nite on our way home from town we seen it again.It followed us for several miles and when we got home it stayed over the same mnt for a bit just across the creek from our house.Then it moved on up the valley and out of sight.Will be watching again to-nite with my

happened to be my friends birthday so i can remember quite vividly what happened. i got out of work around eight o'clock and i went home to let my dog out and i went out to the lake to go see him and hang out with friends. i got to his house around 9 and we hung out for 45 minutes or so when we decided to go to\r\nwalmart with his brother and another friend because i just bought a new car and he wanted to get a video game. so we all piled into the car and we went to walmart. we left the brewer walmart around 10:50 right befor they closed at 11 and we headed back towards orrington. we were heading up the brewer lake road and went around an 's' turn and we had noticed these red lights down the road above the dam on the lake. we aren't far away from bangor international airport so it didn't seem like there was anything unusual about something like that; it looked like it was just beyond the dam and it was flying parallel to the road so it looked like it could of been a plane coming in. but there was something unusual about it so when we saw it i started talking about i swear i saw a ufo the previous january. as we drove down the road closer to the object, (and i'm still talking about the ufo) it was like it heard me talking about ufo's because this triangular silhouette went from being far off the road and fairly high in the air (500 - 700 feet) to swooping in very close probably on 400 feet off the road and 200 feet high. the way the object moved down closer was very odd and i was euphoric but terrified at the same time. it was flat with the horizon when the object dipped up once side at a 20 to 30 degrees and swooped in closer; the best way to describe it is the way a feather or a leaf falls to the ground and swoops side to side. after it swooped down close to the car everyone started to have this moment of awe yet panicky. i slowed down the car and pulled off to the side of the road and it was just us four at the time because it was 11 at night. i turned the radio off and i rolled all the windows down and it was dead silent. that too quiet type of quiets and we were all looking at the black equilateral triangle that had glowing bright red lights on each end. the object also had a center light that glowed white and the object was dark against the clear night sky and it had to of been 40 to 60 feet across. as we were looking at it one of my friends in the back seat pulled out her phone and tried to film it on her iphone but we looked at the video after and we couldn't see anything but darkness. while she was filming i kept almost driving my new car off the road into a ditch because this object seemed to be hovering closer to us. i felt like if it kept getting closer i didn't even so i kept driving slowly down the road  going back to my friends house and we turned the corner away from the ufo and this bigger triangular thing was across the lake above the holden/bucksport side of the lake heading towards the direction of the black triangle ufo (this could have been an airplane but it was still dead silent). i was still driving slowly down the road when i stopped and started talking to everyone in the car and we decided to turn around and go back and investigate. when we went back to the area where i pulled of the road of course the object was gone along with whatever the larger object was. for weeks after i kept dreaming about that 4 or 5 minutes of my life and it was odd it happened on friday the 13th.

july 1974 the summer between my 7th and 8th grade school year. i was faceing south when all of a sudden out from the east a fast flying sphere just above tree top level came flying by real fast i would say 2 or 3 hundred mph across the hwy from us me and my brother it was about 30feet in diameter and it had bright colors red blue yellow orange white moveing around all over it without mixing together. their was no traffic on the hwy. at that time of morning. about a mile west of us we watched as it turned and went stright up into the sky untill we couldn't see it anymore. we ran back to the house as fast as we could , we were scared.Woke up our parents and told them what we seen and they wouldn't believe us. i have never seen or heard anything else about anything like what we saw that night. i have always been trying to pay attention to any information about any other encounters from anyone else and so far nothing except for when they talk about the so called foo fighters from world war 2. except they always leave out the part of the multi colors that are moving around all over it.  by the way their was another strange event that happen about a month latter me and my dad was comeing back home one night around 10:00 p.M. and saw a bright blueish light shinning over the tree tops about 3 miles to the south of us as we were traveling west heading home so we thought that we would go check it out. we turned on to a dirt road that would take us in that direction now this is out in the country just farm land and woods. so we turned onto this dirt road heading south now this all is about 5 or 6 miles west of tifton ga. we started going south on this dirt road after about a mile we came up on a deputy sheriff blocking the road my dad stopped rolled the window down to ask what was going on i noticed that the deputy had his gun in his hand pointing at us and all he should say turn around and get out of here so we did and on the way back out we met 8 of them big 6 wheel drive army trucks that have the canvice covers backs. we got over as close to the ditch as we could as they came driving by real fast i would say if we didn't get over as much as we could they would have ran over us because they stayed right in the middle of the road. after we got by them we went a little further and turned back right on another dirt road to try to come in from another direction and went a few miles and turned right heading towards that bright blue or purple glowing light that was comeing up from behind the woods or tree line aproxment2 more miles away and we came up on another deputy sheriff blocking the road and he had his gun out pointing at us and my dad ask him the same thing what was going on and all he should say turn around and get the h### out of here now. so this time we left and went back to the highway.As we went back i keep watching out the back window of the pickup at that bright blueish glow that whould be flickering above the tree tops. we never did find out what any of that was all about.No one that lived in that area knew anything about it and we tryed to find out but nobody would talk about what ever that was. that's something that has been on my mind all of these years that happens back around august of 1974 6 miles west tifton ga.
