to dissapear. it was no where to be seen. it looked about the size of an air rifle pellet held at arms length. i did notsee any movement or distortion while looking at it.  it looked like two cakepans

was a strangehumming sound, almost a drone.  when i looked up to see what it was i saw anoval object.  i thought it was unusual because air planes have red and greenlights on them and this thing had only white lights and made that funny whirringsound.  i know i wasnt drunk.  i, a tee-totalling baptist who never touches adrop.  for a minute there i had to remind myself of that.\"she also called her daughter-in-law who lives next door out to see the object,but it had already gone by the time she got there.  \"if it hadnt been for thesecond one, i dont think i could have convinced her of what i saw,\" said thefirst witness.  \"my mother-in-law called me outside with a real funny tone inher voice,\" recalls the daughter-in-law.  \"i was kidding her, telling her shedbeen seeing things.  while we were talking i was watching three very brightstars up in the sky when all of a sudden one of them took off and flew veryrapidly from west to east.  then i got as excited as she was.\"shortly thereafter the two women, who had been joined by ______, 39 y/o male,spotted a third object.  \"from what my mother-in-law told me this one was verysimilar to the first in appearance,\" said the daughter-in-law.  \"it was about asfar away as an airplane and was circular with a ring of white lights around it.I still wasnt sure that i was imagining things until that third one came rightover the house.  then i realized that i was seeing something very, very weird.\"also seeing the third object was a 15 y/o neighbor boy.  it was after the thirdincident that _____went into her home to call the novi police.  while she wasmaking the call, around 9:30 p.M., the three people outside saw yet anotherstrange object.  they described it as being extremely bright, like a huge whitelight.  it traveled all the way across the sky from west to east, thedaughter-in-law reported, stopped suddenly in mid-air, and made a right angleturn to the north before disappearing out over walled lake.  the group reportedseeing one more object before the police arrived.  like the second and fourthones it was reported as being very bright and shot across the sky with greatspeed.  the daughter-in-law denied the

two objects that just couldnt be confused with shooting stars.  two ofthose things we saw were very definitely circular in shape and had a ring oflights around them.  those same two circular objects also made that strangebuzzing sound.  police officers called to the scene saw none of the objects.  \"the people wereextremely excited,\" said one novi policeman, \"and their descriptions

of streetlights, you know the blue one?  if you was togo underneath them at about say a hundred miles an hour, hundred fifty miles anhour, but have somebody turn it on when you got a hundred feet from it, thatswhat it looked like.  because it wasnt there, and all of a sudden they bothwent overhead.  it happened in about four seconds.  they were real bright in themiddle, and a darker ring around the outside of that, and then around theoutside of that again it was like a, oh, milky.  but the whole thing wasirridescent.  it was about three shades of green, there was a green, blueishgreen to it.  the whole thing.  and it was distinct. and if id seen the one, itwouldve scared me, i know it scared the hell out of me, because it looked likeit was damn near goin to hit the car, and i think they were, what it was,whatever it was, they were using the road for a guide, and didnt see me.  icant understand how come they didnt see me, cause i had my lights on, youknow.  but if youd of been, if you was only twenty-five off the ground, thenthat would have made them about, say ten feet in diameter, but if it was fiftyfoot or a hundred foot off the ground that would have made them probablytwenty-five foot in diameter.  the first one was the lowest.  give me the effectit damn near hit the car,you know.  the second one was a lot higher, and back,in back of that one.  it was probably about a hundred feet (high), it lookedlike it was about ten feet in diameter.  i looked in the mirror, couldnt seenothing.  the top of it wasnt lit up, just the bottom.  he states the objects were thesame shape and moving at the same rate of speed and states they were disks, ofoval cross-sections, indicating an approximate ratio of four in diameter, one inheight. the witness mentioned interference with his car radio.  \"yeah, there wassomething like you go under a power line.  a single power line.  but it wasntas bad, because any power line ive ever went under starts affecting my radioprobably about a block away.  ill start getting a little tiny crackle, thecloser you get the more it gets.  and itll do the same thing, beyond it. theone in saginaw cuts your car radio right out.  this is the way this did, but itjust did it for an instant, just a little zip, that was it.  and whether i gotanything from the second one or not, i wasnt paying attention.\"the witness states, \"they went right over my head, right over my head.  this onewent directly over the car.\"  he also states that when looking through his carwindow that the objects were larger in comparison to his rearview mirror whichis seven or eight inches wide.  he states, \"a lot wider than that.  like i sayit looked like it was about twenty-five feet in diameter when it passed over mycar at approximately 50 foot.  because if it was any lower than that, if therewas any heat at all, it wouldve melted my car.\"he reports that the objects came into sight when about one hundred feetseperated them from his approaching vehicle, and that the closing, and observingtime, was for some four seconds.  the closing speed was at least 150 miles perhour, in his estimation.","distance":"21-100

arbor by way of saline onsaturday evening, 12/2/72, following a church meeting and a shopping trip inadrian.  mrs. ___ was at the wheel of their 1972 oldsmobile (tinted windshield)and they were quite familiar with the route having traveled it many times.  theywere heading northeast on u.S. 12 (michigan avenue) at approximately 50 mph(less than limit) when the sighting occurred.  the incident took placeapproximately one and one half miles southwest of saline at 10:15 p.M.  no othercars were nearby at the time of the sighting, nor do they recall anyconventional aircraft in the vicinity.  their attention was directed to abright, fiery object to their left and about 100 feet perpendicular to thedirection of the car.  they estimated the height of the object from the groundto be approximately 75 feet.  both adults had the initial impression they werewatching a plane on fire which was crashing.  mrs. ___ slowed the car toapproximately 10 mph in order to avoid danger from any explosion or flyingdebris.  the object was reported to have flown at a \"slow plane speed\".  thepath of the object described a rough semicircle around the car from right toleft.  when the object was directly in front of the car it made a suddenmanuever which the witnesss attributed to \"recognition\" of their car beingunexpectedly closeby.  however, further investigation revealed the object orlight most likely manuevered over or under some high-tension power lines whichcross the highway at precisely that spot.  (mr. ____ thought the object swervedover the lines while mrs.___ felt it ducked.)  the witnesses agreed that theobject, when directly in front of the car, was about 50 feet distant (possibly75 at most), about 30 feet above the road, and viewed at approximately a 30degree angle.  the sighting ended abruptly when the object \"winked out like alight\" when it was off to their left over a field.  they estimate the object was200 feet from the car and 50-75 feet in the air when it went out.  in retrospectthey both feel the fire was actually a strong, bright light attached to aphysical object which maneuvered to avoid their car.  they did not feel thatfire or red hot material could turn off as quickly as it appeared to.  theycontinued into saline without stopping and stopped for a cup of coffee (\"...Togather their wits\").  they then went to the police station to report thesighting.  the police report that mr.____ was highly agitated when he came inand that they initially did not believe him.The leading part of this object appeared to be a pale silver-blue metalliclopsided sphere with a long smoothly tapered tail and a shorter top fin. thelong tali, first described as a flame, was later thought to be a cone of paleyellow-white light projecting back from the sphere a distance of approximately50 feet and on a slight incline.  the small fin was described as being a vividbright orange, the color of red hot metal.  on the underside of the sphere andtowards the rear (under long tail) there appeared to be some shiny material thattwirled, sparkled, or scintillated.  just before the object extinguished this\"sparkle-like\" area seemed to be more noticeable.  the object maintained thesame attitude or profile towards the witnesses in the car throughout its arc. they estimated the size of the sphere as 12 feet in diameter and felt itsubtended about 4 inches (vertically) at arms length.  the tail was 3 to 4 timesthe length of the sphere, and the fin projected 4 feet from the object atbetween a 45 and 60 degree angle.  the object disappeared as if it \"winked out\".","distance":"21-100

approached the stop for the highwayfacing an easterly direction, i became aware of a dull reddish flash on thehorizon at an east-southeast direction, my location at this time was two milessouth of berrien springs, michigan.  as i stopped before entering the highway isaw a shaft of glowing red, wider than the vapor trail of a jet and continuingto rise in a straight vertical direction from the horizon.  the rise slowed butthe trail still glowed from the high atmosphere to the horizon.  there was not aray or morning sun visible at such an early hour nor was there a sound of anexplosion audible.  the glowing embers of the shaft was massive, compact and ofa deep red color.  the visible embers did not show any signs of falling back tothe horizon but seem to be suspended in mid air.  my time for travel to work wasmeasured so i had to be driving.  as i drove in a north-northwesterly directioni would glance back to look for the sight i had viewed but was not able to findthe area.  as i left my car at work i looked to the east and there above thehorizon was a pear shaped cloud with the stem of the pear pointing in asouth-east direction.  this one lone cloud was glowing a dull deep red.  my timefor clocking in was short so i could do no further checking.  others who sawthis sight, their description varies except for color.  all call it red andglowing.  at what distance i viewed the shaft of glowing embers i was unable todetermine.Summary of an earlier sighting by this same witness:within this report this witness describes a sighting which he had in august of1965.  as i scanned the sky to my left there appeared in the western sky abright light with a shaft of light penetrating the moistered air above lakemichigan.  the crafts forward movement was like a drift rather than being powerdriven.  as my field glasses were being retrieved from there hiding place thecraft had drifted into full eye view.  the bright forward light had beenextinguished and there could be seen amber lights outlining what appeared to bea flying wing, delta shaped or modified v, some what rounded at the front.  asthe craft passed overhead i looked at it through field glasses and could see araise in the center large enough to accomadate two seats.  the outside lightsoutlined what appeared to be a canopy but no light was visible from within.  asthe craft tilted slightly in a turn to the nne there appeared in the center ofthe wing on either side of center, an opening that was about one third to onehalf the width of the wing at that point.  as the craft came over slightly tothe north of me it could not have been higher than ten to twelve thousand feetabove ground.  i could hear a humming sound and a rush of air. there were nomotor or propeller visible. the craft drifted into an area just south of eauclair and there it seemed to hover for a minute or two, made a slight drifttoward benton harbor or northerly direction, raise quickly vertical then turn tonne and zipped out of sight before i could count to ten.  i nor the children atany time heard the usual sound of a jet motor, just the hum accompanied byswishing air.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":1456,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.0320742,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-86.7416374,"occurred":30119100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":30119100000,"summary":"Ifo
