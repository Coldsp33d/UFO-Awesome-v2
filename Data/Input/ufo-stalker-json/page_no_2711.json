saw the object i knewthere was something different about its appearance.  as the object came closerand traveled at a distance to the right, and overhead of my car i watched in astate of being extremely curious and speechless.  i felt surprised that i wasviewing the object in the air.  traveling at 55 miles an hour on rt. 496 theentire time of viewing took less than three minutes.  i could say that theobject was no closer than a mile away.  leaving rt. 496 i turned onto rt. 96west toward grand rapids.  after going past the grand ledge exit i noticedanother light in the sky.  i stopped the car to get a closer look at the lightand noticed that it was a helicopter shining a spot light at the ground.  i gotback into the car and drove home.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

two teenagers were behind the otherteenagers home \"looking at the stars when they sighted an object in thesouthern sky.  the object appeared as a point of light about 20 degrees abovethe horizon and had the brightness of an uncovered lightbulb they said.  theobject blinked off and on.  they said the object was brighter than the brighteststars and that when the object blinked off the surrounding stars remainedbright.  there was no sound, and the object appeared white.  the object oversome time, gained altitude until it was about 40 degrees above thesouth-southwest horizon over a large tree in the back yard.  at times the objectstood still, at others it sped up.  the object also remained bright for sometime, then faded out, flashed and flickered.  when the object disappearednothing was visible in the proximity.  the male teenage witness claimed thatwhen he flashed his flashlight off and on at the object, it blinked back inone-second intervals.  the object did not move behind anything, and thewitnesses believe it kept in front of the clouds.At 2:00 a.M. the calhoun county sheriff department in marshall was contacted andtwo deputies were dispatched (none being the primary witness of this report). when they arrived they observed the object in the front yard of the maleteenagers residence for 10-15 minutes.  one of the deputies flashed his lightat it, but it didnt respond as before.  the deputies left at 2:45 a.M. and theyleft instructions that should the object make a sudden move, the teenagersshould come downtown to find them.  at about 3:30 a.M. one of the teenagers saidthe object \"shot right up in the air\" about eight to 10 degrees over the tree.The teenagers estimated that the object was about five to seven miles distant inthe southwest. the male teenager called the sheriffs dept. at 3:45 a.M. afterattempting to drive and find the deputies. he said the object seemed to have ared light going around the bottom.  at this time the primary witness in thisreport (the 28 y/o deputy sheriff) and his partner were in the area of 26 mileroad and i-94 when they saw something \"pop up\" in the southwest in the directionof athens.  they described the object as pale yellow or white, and said it made\"silly maneuvers\", moving straight up and down in the sky.  the deputies becameexcited and said they were not kidding when asked by the dispatcher.  they saidthe object was emitting red and blue lights.  the object \"disappeared\" and at3:48 a.M. the object returned to view and began making \"sharp circle turns\" and\"perpendicular turns\".  it was still in view at 3:53 a.M.  these two deputiesthen called another deputy to the scene who also saw the object.  this primarywitness and this third deputy said the object vanished from sight by \"simplygoing out\" and was last seen high (about 80 degrees) in the northeast sky.  thewitness stated it looked like it was traveling higher and higher.  the objectseemed like a small ball, about the size of a dime held at arms length.  twoalbion police officers also reported observing the object in the east-southeastwhile patrolling in an alley.  these two deputies said the object got dimmer,then brighter, and at times completely out.  they later joined the otherdeputies and one said the object appeared to be bright, and seemed to havecontrol or a set course.  dispatchers at the time attempted to explain theobject as a \"stray rocket\", but one of the officers said the object \"jettednorth...Stopped and stayed in one place and didnt move anymore\".  the objectalso \"moved south at a speed that was too fast to watch with a pair ofbinoculars.\"","distance":"Over One

_________ school district and one ofmy duties is to take our sixth grade class on a one week camp experience at theyfcas camp pendalouan on the north shore of big blue lake.  big blue lake is inthe central portion of muskegon county and is also situated in the midst of themanistee national forest. on the evening of may 21st, mr. _____ and i weremaking our rounds at the cabins making sure that everyone was inside and thatall was well.  lights out at 10pm and the fact that it was thursday, the fourthnight of camp meant that nearly everyone was settled in.  the novelty ofsleepless nights had worn off and the cabins seemed quiet.  at about 10:35pm,___ and i, tired from our walk, sat down on the steps of menominee cabin andtalked about the day and the plans for the next day.  both of us had flashlightswith us...And as we sat on the steps we would occasionally shine the lights upinto the trees to see if we could spot a racoon or two.  overhead  was aclearing in the tree canopy that could have easily been about 24 by 35 ft.  aswe sat there talking, something moving into the opening in the tree canopycaught our eyes at the same instant.  seconds before there was nothing butbright white stars there, now there was something of some size and shape.  both____ and i without a word bolted to our feet and then in very excited voicesbegan yelling to the kids in the now slumbering cabin to \"get out here and lookat this\".  the object overhead was cylindrical in its shape.  there was a verybright white light in the very front of the object as well as one in the veryrear.  the lights were slightly larger than the stars in proportion.  they didnot blink on and off but rather were intense then would fade into a less intenselight only to brighten again.  we did not see a beam of light nor were there anyother colors of lights.  we were viewing this thing from right underneath. there were no wings, struts, aerials, or apparent markings.  there was howeversomething going on the surface of the craft itself.  i at first felt that wewere looking right through the thing itself as if it were not solid.  but as wewatched it pass in the clearing i got the feeling that it was reflecting theground and the trees over which it was flying. ____ described it as ashimmering......We did not feel any heat, nor smell anything, nor hear anything. its height in the sky was just above the tree tops plus maybe another 100 ft.Or so. the object was going in a solid northerly direction without any lateraldrifting like a plane might do.  its speed was very slow and i would guess thatone could jog along with it and keep up with it.  the whole incident lasted forabout 15 seconds before it became lost to our view.  as a last resort we randown to the lake, hoping that we could get another look at the object in thenight sky, but sadly we did not see it again.","distance":"101-500

saton the dock and watched the lights expand and contract then we looked at theobject andit had moved a little bit, then we looked away and looked back and itwas gone.Witness 3: me and my friends were

we then began to see a light horizontally across the sky over the lake. lights then started to move up and down through the beam.  we then look over tosee the cloud and it was gone.  we couldnt see it anywhere.  we look back atthe lights, some of them were moving back and forth - sideways, expanding thenretreating back.  this lasting maybe 20 minutes.  after that happened it seemedto be fading away to the north end of the lake until it gradually disappeared. we didnt really think about it being a ufo until after.  we were trying tothink of logical things but we didnt hear any noises and there werent anyother noises to distract us from hearing others.","distance":"Over One

at some lights in the sky.  i first viewed theobjects thru a small bedroom window.  to get a better look we both stepped outon the porch facing west. at first i thought they were being generated from ahigh-power searchlight, but there was no visible beam to support the lights. there were three lights moving in a counter-clockwise direction.  they seemed tobe playing a game of tag-the 3 followed each other until they seemed to blendinto one much brighter light.  the meeting lasted about one second then thegame would continue.  the sky was clear that night - stars were veryvisible...But the 3 objects seemed to be contained within the parameter of thecloud (the cloud was a part of the sky that looked lighter).  they never leftthe outline of the cloud, their movement was very rapid but with no realconsistency of speed. the distance the 3 kept between themselves varied.  aplane (not sure the size of the plane) approached from the west to the east.  incomparison to the objects, the plane was much smaller and moved much lower - itflew way beneath the lights.  by 11:30 on of the lights was no longer visibleand the remaining two were dimmer and slower - they still chased each other butdidnt meet together.  i  got the feeling they were searching for the 3rd light. the objects didnt seem to affect anything on the ground; there was no unusualsound, smell, or feeling.  i stopped watching at 11:30.","distance":"Over One
