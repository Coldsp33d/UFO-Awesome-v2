referred to ______ and ______ who shared a briefencounter with an anomalous object on the night of may 20, 1984.  as related bythe witnesses, the event occurred as follows:having travelled to kalamazoo for a day of shopping, followed by a movie, thetwo were returning to ____ home outside the town of sturgis, michigan.  sometimeprobably between 10:00 and 10:15 p.M., driving in the familys ford bronco, theyturned south onto constantine road, a lightly trafficked county highwayconnecting the town of constantine and the small city of three rivers.  theywere several miles north of the indiana border in branch county. the vehicle wasnotyet up to highway speed when they approached an angular railroad crossing.  acontinuous line of trees on the left (east) side of the road ended just short ofthe tracks.  as the women reached the clearing, they witnessed an elongatedobject to their left and just ahead, hovering over a patch of small trees on thefar side of the tracks.  ____ immediately stopped the auto.  they described anobject approximately forty yards in length, tapering at either end.  the middleportion was seen as metallic at the top and also tapering.  the remainder of thecraft was shrouded in a thick mist resembling the consistency of a cloud.  alongthe lower perimeter (and presumed by the witnesses to extend the entirecircumference) were light green and rose colored lights, partially obscured bythe nearly opaque camouflage and in no discernable pattern.  the mist itselfappeared to have a silvery white, luminescent effect which, however did not castonto the trees just below.  from their vantage point some thirty yards from theobject, it appeared to be \"creeping sideways\" (i.E. toward the witnesses) fromits original position just above the tree branches.  shirley rolled down theside window but heard nothing.  the engine was left running and the headlightsremained on, with no effect to either.  the reactions of the two witnesses wereentirely different.  both immediately and unequivocally determined the object tobe unconventional, but their emotional responses were opposite.   ____ waselated, feeling privileged to witness a spectacle that she later portrayed as\"one of the most beautiful things id ever seen.\"  ____ meanwhile, feltextremely threatened, fearful that the object would proceed above and stall thevehicle.  vocalizing her agitation, she argued that they might be abducted,given physical examinations, made to forget the experience, and left withtraumatic emotional disorders.  after some undetermined amount of time, perhapsa minute or two, ____ reluctantly shifted the vehicle into gear at ____sinsistence.  however, after moving forward about fifteen yards, _____ stoppedthe bronco a second time at the stop sign for the railroad tracks.  this, sheadmitted in the interview, was a ploy to delay their departure and furtherobserve the anomaly.  now melody became even more agitated, demanding that theyleave the area.  after another moment, ____ again proceeded forward and quicklyout of view of the object as a line of trees on the far side of the tracksobscured their view.  as they moved south down the road, ____ detected what shefelt was a less frightened tone in _____s comments.  conswquently, she suddenlyturned the vehicle around and raced back to the scene.  though they had beengone only perhaps one minute, there was no sign of the object when they reachedthe crossing.  the women then decided to continue north to the home of a workassociate of ____, who lives approximately two miles distant.  arising from hisbed, the gentleman did not share their enthusiasm and turned down ____s offerto search the countryside for the object.  they then returned to ___s home,whereupon they were told that ____s son and daughter-in-law had observed alarge, sparkling mass high in the sky at approximately the same time.  the writeconcludes that this was the re-entry of debris from the soviet soyuz t-10 spacecraft, as confirmed by a june 27, 1984 response from the norad spacesurveillance center.  upon return to the scene with the witneses in mid-july,several power lines were noted.  these were parallel to the road and sotraversed the treetops over which the object had hovered.  the next power linepole to the northeast has six large, cannister-type generators attached.  thewriter concludes that, in all probability, the presence of the power lines iscentral to the objects appearance.  it might be further speculated that thewitnesses came upon the scene by chance, rather than design, in that they hadturned onto constantine road from the west only a brief moment before theencounter.  a search of the area revealed nothing in the manner of a landingtrace.  five homes in the vicinity were approaced for possible additionalwitnesses.  no one was home at three, and calling cards with a messageconcerning the incident did not generate any response.  the fourth and fifthfamilies were unaware of anything unusual, either as an observation on the nightin question or discovery in the cornfields afterward. the two witnessesdisplayed genuine bewilderment at the event and were in no way seekingpublicity.  as portrayed by ____, \"its hard enough being a farmers wifewithout something like this.\"  the fellow employee of ______, who has requestedanonymity, related that the women did approach him that night in an excitedstate.  he allows that he was uninterested in the subject and suggested thatthey go home.  in retrospect, ____ regrets having forced their departure fromthe scene since they will thus never know by what means the object departed. the writer concludes that this event was a genuine ce-1, coincidental to thesoviet launch vehicle reentry.Dan

received a telephone referal fromtrooper ______ of the flint post, michigan state police.  the post had receivedtwo calls five minutes apart after 1 am from the flushing area west of flint. both concerned an aerial object at treetop level over the countryside. unfortunately, the latter caller gave a previous address and phone number,rendering followup impossible.  trooper ____ was dispatched and visited theresidence of ______, who had witnessed the event with her 11 y/o son ___ andtheir guests, ____ of flint and her 11 y/o daughter ____.  the trooperquestioned the four and also two consumers power company lineman who wererepairing a downed wire at the site.  all power in the vicinity had been outsince 8 pm thursday.  the lineman had arrived at 12:50 am, ten minutes beforethe sighting.  their presence seems to have had a bearing on the events, as willbe further explained.  on his return to the post, trooper _____ contacted mufon,giving his impression that the witnesses were honest and relating their account. an appointment was set for that evening.  the ___ residence is one of severalnew homes in an area still basically agricultural, with cornfields and woodspredominant.  it is also on an east-west flight path of bishop internationalairport, located file miles away.  areas south and southwest of flint haveelicited several ufo reports over the past years.  _____ and her daughter hadarrived for a visit thursday evening and, when the power was interupted bythunderstorm activity, decided to remain until it was restored.  when theconsumers truck arrived, all four proceeded to the front porch to observe.  tenminutes later, ____ was locating constellations when she noticed two oversizedwhite lights hovering over a tree between two houses a hundred yards to thenortheast.  she called the others attention and the four stared at the lightsfor two to three minutes.  at that point, they were stationary and no soundemitted from the source.  each light was about two feet in diameter, and the twowere positioned closely.  the witnesses found it odd that such large beacons didnot appreciably illuminate the surroundings or irritate their eyes with aglaring effect.  at this point, the consumers vehicle was maneuvering into aditch to reach the utility pole with its elevated cradle.  one of the men stoodbehind, directing the other.  according to the witnesses, the truck then struckthe pole accidently, and the lights immediately rose up slightly, then went out. now they could identify the object as a domed disk with red lights above andbelow where the lights had shone, circling the dome and base.  the craft mayhave been rotating or, since the witnesses did not notice the extinguishedheadlamps revolving, a movie-marquee effect may have offered the appearance ofrotation.  the vehicle began to slowly approach the witnesses before abruptlyturning ninety degrees to the left (south).  it then glided across the road andover a field to a smallish woods two hundred yards distant.  ____ focused herattention on a band of shiny metal around the girth of the object, and allreported at least two sets of prongs (i.E. an inverted \"v\" consisting of tworods about six feet in length, extending from the perimeter of the underside.) these were also bright metallic.  according to the children, the \"prongs\"started to protrude from the vehicle only after it was in motion and heading forthe woods.  mary believed she spotted four such sets and assumed them to belanding gear.  the others noticed only two sets, one under the headlamps, theother positioned opposite.  the group agreed that the object had a very lightand fairly low-pitched \"whirling\" sound while in motion.  this, they remarked,was unlike that of an airplane or helicopter and was otherwise unrecognizable. when either above or slightly beyond the wooded area (which extends for roughly150 yards), the object glided down in a vertical descent until lost from viewbelow the treeline.  its path had carried the craft to the side and behind theutility employees, but neither realized its presence.  the four witnessesmaintained a vigil for nearly an hour afterward, however no reappearance was tooccur.  _______ and ______ used the terms \"mesmerized\" and \"awe\" to describetheir reactions to the anomoly, stating that they seemed compelled to watch asit hovered nearby.  this may of course have been quite naturally a psychologicalresponse but bears mentioning.  the witnesses are quite certain that the utilitytruck did not experience any sort of disruption to its lights or engine.  as theneighborhoods power was off, no other electrical disturbances could haveoccurred.  the family dog, a spaniel-collie mix, had begun pacing, barking in anunfriendly manner, and investigating windows and doors shortly before thesighting.  during the episode, it barked continously, though this may have beendue to the presence of the utility truck.  after the incident, it hid in thebasement and refused to answer its owners calls.  the following day, ______remarked, it was acting somewhat strangely, resting behind furniture normallyunfrequented and acting timid generally.   following interviews with the fourwitnesses, the author spent considerable time in and around the wooded area inquestion.  very few openings existed whereby a craft of the size described(larger in diameter than a full-sized auto) could have landed without breakingtree limbs, and no ground markings or vegetation scorched or swirled was found. the cornfield which lies beyond the woods contained several bare spots, butagain no indication of dehydration, compacting, scorching, or swirling of thecrop was evident.  several neighbors along both _____ and ___ roads were queriedregarding the incident, only one offering a possible insight.  _____ who livesacross and diagonally from the ____ residence, was awakened by her husband whophoned from his workplace to notify her that police had been sent to the area,ostensibly regarding a fire according to his second-hand information via cb. later the same night, at about 5 am, she awoke again to the strong odor of aburnt substance of some sort.  she could offer no explanation as to its origin. faa officials at bishop (airport) stated that the thunderstorms had interruptedpower at the facility sometime after 10 pm thursday.  an emergency generatorrestored most functions, but the north-south runway lights remained inoperableand so that runway was closed for the remainder of the night.  the airportsraw/bulk radar system had ceased functioning at 11 pm as scheduled.  the airportlog showed no light aircraft or helicopter int he area of the sighting near thetime given.  likewise, neither the genesse county sheriff department nor the airnational guard had aircraft in the vicinity that night.  as conveyed to the msptrooper, the consumers power employees were unaware of the events at hand.  theutility pole generator was dysfunctional when they arrived, and so theirattention was entirely centered on assessing and repairing the damage.  withlittle question, a power surge caused by lightning earlier in the evening hadcaused the problem.  the day and evening of thursday, july 21 was, weatherwise,atrocious throughout michigan.  several lines of thunderstorms crossed the lowerpeninsula, some with hail and damaging winds, and numerous communities werewithout electricity for many hours.  so, while inconclusive, it is certainlynoteworthy that the ______ and ________ observed the craft within an hour of theremaining cloud covers retreat to the east.  the national weather serviceoffice in flint indicated that at 1 am, the citys skies continued overcast at7000 ft., though by 2 am scattered clouds only remained.  moreover, the arrivalof repairmen within minutes of the sighting, coupled with the observation thatthe craft extinguished its headlamps and moved away within a second or so of thepole being struck, may not be coincidental.  allowing for some variances intheir accounts, there is no reason to suspect the witnesses report as given. in terms of the descriptive drawings, that of ___ is probably the least accuratein that she wears prescriptive lenses for astigmatism but did not have them onat the time.  further, ____ deferred in large part to the sketches of the twochildren, stating that she had concentrated on the bright metallic belt aroundthe vehicle together with the prongs underneath and so had noticed little inthe way of light configurations or shape of the craft.  the boy and girl,drawing separately from memory the next day, depicted the object in remarkablysimilar fashion.  it might be postulated that the bar of red light shown in_____ sketch was in actuality the metallic band seen by _____, with the glow ofred from a row of lights above giving misimpression that the metallic band wasalso lighted.  in summary, this appears to be a credible ce-1.  perhaps thegreater learning experience was gained by the vehicles occupants in respect tothe interruption and restoration of electrical power.  a summary statement is also included, written by dan wright, concerning thestate troopers report which wont be included here, however most informationfrom within the report is already included in the above summary.","distance":"101-500
