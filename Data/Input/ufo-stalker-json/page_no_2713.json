corner lot next to a large park. i was standing at thecorner waiting for my dogs to catch up, when i saw what i thought was alightning bug across the street at the park. i followed this green/yellowish light as it went streight up slowly. when i first saw it, thelight was already above the tree line, so i couldnt tell how close itwas. i thought it odd that it wasnt flickering, just getting smaller. then thelight started moving south to north. i never heard a sound as it flew itscourse. i thoughtit must be a heliocopter and didnt take my eyes off of it because ithought it was interesting that i couldnt hear it yet. as it got midwaybetween the park and my house i could tell that it was not assending anylonger and i could see some reflection from the city lights on theunderside of the craft. its then when i couldnt belive what i wasseeing. i saw a round saucer shape with only one green yellowish lightat the rear of the object. as it went north ii was able to follow itnorth untill it slowly went out of sight. i thought to myself, did ijust see what i thought i saw! i could not tell how high the craft was,how fast it was moving, or hear any sound at all. i do know that thecloud deck that night was around 8000 ft asl. and winds aloft were lessthan 5 knots. the craft never went behind the clouds the whole time thati saw it, so i know it was under 8000 ft.

canal park that afternoon.  i took the duluth  transitauthority bus home and got off at the corner of piedmont avenue and west seventhstreet at 5:20 p.M.  it was dark but there was still a glimmer of blue dusk atthe summit of spirit mountain, on the western edge of the city.  as i crossedpiedmont avenue, i looked downhill to my left and saw that the full moon hadjust risen.  it was about 10 degrees above the eastern horizon, over lakesuperior and park point.  it was very cold, about zero degrees fahrenheit, andthe sky was completely clear.As i passed the lakeside ice co. building, i saw what i thought was a christmasdecoration through the pine trees, an arch of multicolored lights.  afterwalking about 100 feet (30 meters) west on west seventh, i saw the object moreclearly.It was a black triangle, with its apex pointed upward at one oclock angle, andthe base at the bottom.  the object was in mid-air, and estimated 35 degreesabove the southwestern horizon.  it was the size of my thumbnail at armslength.  the color was matte black, a shade darker than the surrounding nightsky. the object had no discernible motion and hovered silently.  there was nosound.The sides of the triangle were slightly rounded, a bit concave, giving theobject the look of a bulky arrowhead.  also there were three sets or arrays offour lights each on either side of the triangle. there were no lights at thebottom. twelve lights in all on either side. in descending order, the lights ineach array were red, green, gold and white.I halted at the corner of west seventh and 22nd avenue west and observed theobject for five minutes. it was hard to judge distance, but my guess is that theobject was a few miles away, possibly over the spirit valley area in the westduluth section of the city. i was alone on the street.  there was intermittenttraffic on piedmont avenue a block behind me.  i walked on to my home, wentinside and grabbed a small camera.  i wasnt sure the object itself would show,but i knew the steady multicolored lights would. however, when i reached thefront porch again, the object was gone.","distance":"Over One

trying out a new digital camera.  he took pictures ofsome cloud formations.  neither he nor his father saw any anomalous objects. when the pictures were downloaded into the computer, an anomalous objectappeared in two of them.  the object is very small in one, but appearsdisc-shaped in the other.Because the object appears to be headed downward at a steep angle, the mother ofthe family came to believe the object had crashed into the swamp.  she also hadother reasons for believing something had crashed nearby.  first of all, sheheard noises for three of four nights afterwards.  she described these noises ashigh-pitched squeaky sounds.  she had no tape recorder, so was unable to recordthese noises.  the prime investigator thinks these noises may have been birdsor frogs, which start to make a lot of noise around four a.M. that time ofyear.Also, the mother observed what she called a ufo, which was visible in theeastern sky for several nights, at about the same spot every night.  it appearedabout 3:00 a.M. at about 35 degrees elevation every morning, and traveled fromnorth to south.  the prime investigator has determined that this was most likelyvenus.  i would concur, and consider this probably identified.A few days after the pictures were taken, the neighbors son witnessed some menpouring something into the swamp.  according to the witness, they were dressedin unusual suits.  one possible explanation could be that these men were from anenvironmental agency and were pouring dye into the water to measure the waterflow.  there is concern about ground water contamination from nearby mines.The mother also claims that her children have seen glowing figures approximatelyfour feet tall when camping overnight in the backyard.","distance":"101-500
