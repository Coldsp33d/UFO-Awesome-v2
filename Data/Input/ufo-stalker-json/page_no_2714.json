are almost always going due south;this one was going south east. that caught my attention first, i next looked forwings thinking this must be a jet but could not find any. all i could see was alarge cigar shaped white-gray object with a slight glow about it, the size of ablimp, but moving along at a rate much faster than a blimp is capable of. i nextstarted to reach for my camera, as i did the thing seemed to shift into warpspeed and with in two or three seconds put a lot of distance between me and it.I would guess it was maybe three to five miles distant when i first saw it, thenwith in

pier to take in the view of a beautiful clear night. i was carrying a set of 10 x 50 binoculars, as we slowly walked towards the end of the pier, we occasionally stopped and looked at the quarter moon resting in the western sky.  we stopped four/five times to view the moon through the binoculars before reaching the end of the pier at approximately 10:15 p.M. upon reaching the end of the pier, i turned to view the moon again when i noticed a very bright light (white/orange) this time to the right of the moon (1). at first glance i thought it was a bright star and my wife said it looked like a light on a pole, upon veiwing this light with my binoculars, it appeared to be a \"ball of fire\" hanging in the sky.  beneath this ball  of fire was a glowing white ball that appeared to rest at the waters surface. the light maintained this appearance and location for approximately five minutes.  i estimate the light was roughly 1 to 1.5 miles away and roughly 4 to 5 hundred feet above the waters surface.  it appeared to be directly out from the san souci hotel.  i continued to observe this light through the binoculars when i noticed the \"ball of fire\" emitting what appeared to be sparks, like a sparkler (2).  the sparks seemed to only emit from this sides of the fireball.  my wife stated that she could also see the sparks flying as she stood next to me.  she had no binoculars as i continued to observe the fireball through the binoculars, sparks turned to what appeared to be blobs of \"lava\" (red/orange) falling from the fireball (3).  shortly after observing this, the fireball dimmed to non visible when two rectangles that appeared in the same location and was visible for maybe 30 seconds (4).  at this point, the fireball reappeared and i could alsosee a red pinpoint of light to the left and a pinpoint of light to the right.  after approximately one minute, the white pinpoint of light change to a blue/greeen color.  the white glowing ball at the waters surface was no longer visible, and this point, the lights began moving our way or easterly (5).  the lights continued to drift in our direction for the next three to four minutes when it stopped and seemed to hang in this sky.  the light again slowly proceeded in a easterly direction when it appeared to \"tilt\" and come to a pause briefly before slowly heading in a northerly direction.  when the object tilted, the bottom of the object was illuminated where i clearly saw some kind of structure thru my binoculars (6).  i estimate the object was approximately 1000 feet away at this point.  i estimate the object was approximately 60 to 80 feet wide or long and \"thin\" compared to its overall size - maybe five feet thick and was soundless.  the object slowly drifted to the north for approximately two to three minutes before disappearing behind a building to the north of the pier.  about 30 seconds later, the object reappeared on the east side of the building where it appeared to be stationary.  at this point, me and the family decided to try to follow the object so we hurried off the pier and headed to our car in the parking lot.  we observed the object - still stationary - as we quickly walked from the end of the pier to the entrance of the pier.  upon getting in the car and driving toward the direction we last observed the object.  we lost sight of the object and never saw it again.See
