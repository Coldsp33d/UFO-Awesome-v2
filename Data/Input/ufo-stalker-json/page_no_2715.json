thought was a satellite.The pinpoint of light was varying in brightness (not unlike the way a satellitedoes), when it went into a rough circular path, ending in a roughly 90 degreedirection change. my wife witnessed one of the circles and direction changes. mywife left for work, and i continued to watch the object for an additional 10-15minutesduring which time the object repeated the circle26 direction change 3 more times. i lost sight of the object about 15 degreesabove the se horizon due to city lights 10 miles away and approaching dawn. i ama retired army aviator, and an avid amateur astronomer. in all my time in thesky and watching the sky, i have never seen anything like this. the size, color,perceived altitude, direction changes, and speed are inconsistent with any typeof aircraft, satellite, weather balloon, astronomical or environmental event. iwould be very interested to know if this object was observed by anyone else.","distance":"Over One

shaped ufo. i live in colon, mi. (85.19deg west,41.57deg north). the time was about 22:10 when he reported to me that he saw aplane in the sky. i went to his room to see, thinking this odd as all of theairports had been shut down. i have seen airplane lights before, they strobe a aregular, even rate and have a red light on one wing, a blue light on the otherand a white light amid-ship somewhere. what i saw was a slow moving craft with randomly flashing blue, red, and white lights all along the edge of the craft. we then ran outside to get a better view. it was moving due west from a point south east of my position. as it came parallel to our position i did a angle check by hand (a trick i learned in astronomy class) i found that it was about 30 degrees above the horizon over due south. i could not judge its distance as i realized that i was not dealing with just any standard aircraft, and these things could really be any size. i could not detect any sound coming from the craft. but, as i said, i have no idea how far the craft was from my position. as it neared the western horizon i noticed that the only steady lights on the craft were two white rear lights. one on each rear point. i dont know if there have been any other reports of the sighting, but i offer mine as more proof that this type of craft exists. my theory is that they may have been interested as to why there were no other aircraft in the air over one of the busiest air traffic continents on this planet.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

were sitting by the pool at about11:30 p.M. on august 10, 2001. they were looking toward the north at thenight sky from his residence on 4th street n. in st. petersburg whenthey saw a bright object, white in color, appear in the sky. moving likea skimmer bug skimming across water in a pulsing fashion. it stopped,banked at sharp angles, zigzagging right and left and immediatelychanged directions 180 degrees, then drifted. it would repeat theseactions several times during the sighting.The witness stated that the sky was fairly clear but there was somecloud cover which made it difficult to determine the exact shape of theobject, although it appeared to be spherical. the distance wasapproximately 2 miles and the elevation 5.000 feet.The witness is an ex-air force pilot and is familiar with fighterplanes. he said after about 15 minutes 4-6 fighter planes came from thedirection of macdill afb and passed by in a south to southeasterlydirection as though they were searching for something. the first passthey made was at a low altitude of about 1/3 mile above the bay directlybelow the object and the next pass was at a higher altitude. however,the object remained motionless during these periods and it escapeddetection.Later, about 14 or 15 small white/beige lights seemed to materializefrom all directions of outer space. they kept circling the large object,getting closer and closer, then all stopped and remained motionless witha little movement from time to time.After about one hour, witness returned to his apartment. he is at acomplete loss to understand what he observed because nothing in his air forcecareer remotely resembled this sighting.","distance":"Over One
