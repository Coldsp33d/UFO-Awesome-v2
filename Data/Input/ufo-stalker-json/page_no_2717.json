(1 block away), stopped car to observe them fromintersection of diamond oaks rd. and washington, and we stepped out of car.  atthat time, they were moving towards us (toward the se).  they seemed fairlyclose to us now.  the objects moved under their own power and individually, attimes flying in pairs, straight lines, semi-circular patterns, constantlychanging their formations, some seemed to have higher altitudes than others attimesthey seemed to have no particular destination, as if they were observing ordoing some type of maneuvers.  from our long-standing bird watching activities,we were in agreement they were not birds, nor balloons, but seemed under theirown mode of power maneuvering in unusual patterns.  as the objects changeddirections, their color would change from a very bright white to a brilliantsilver.  the objects seemed to move away from us, then come back.  someformations observed: three pairs in a loose triangular shapefrom a straight line moving eastward when front object raised above the line,then the line reversed direction and made a semi-circular curvetwo groups of three at one point, forming a delta shapemaking circular and arcing turns.  we watched for about five minutes, then theobjects formed a delta shape again, and moved away from us at what appeared tobe very high speed.  richard observed the objects quickly disappearing as theymoved north-east.  we got in the car in an attempt to follow them, but whenarriving at the intersection, the objects were no where to be seen.  we drovedown pleasant grove in the direction we thought they

towards tampa.  he observed an object and thought it to be a planecoming in, but he did not see a beam of light coming from it.  it had a glow,yellowish tent coming from the outside of it.  it did not have the aircraftwarning or identification lights on it.  it was coming in from the southeastheading in a westerly but southern path.  it was about 18 degrees above thetrees.  the climbs were not up yet, there were none in the sky.  he thoughtmaybe it was something in danger.  and he proceeded south on highway, he couldsee it was moving very slow.  slightly above it at the 11:00 oclock position,there were jets flying close to it.  the first one or two jets strayed close toit.  as he went down the road a little bit, the object grew smaller and thenchanged brighter.  it lost its corona around it and became a light blue and itconcentrated to a smaller even whiter light with the dark as the steel blueedge.  then it became a much smaller light and it shot out little bb likeobjects, like oil on a hot surface, and then it came back into itself and it wasgone.  when it was yellow, it was more nebulous but when it turned to the bluecolor it became sharper.  (see appendix \"\"1 and 2\"\" )i stopped at sunset road for a light, proceeding south another mile among themand there were a bunch of planes coming in from south.  they were coming in fromthe east and west, like a bunch of fingers.  i thought there were between 9 or15, i couldnt tell.  i could see as far as riverview, coming in from baerss inthat direction.  he was coming from south, southeast and southwest.  the firstobject traveled, at arms lenth during a total of three feet in the course ofabout 15 minutes.  it takes about 15 minutes to travels this distance at thistime of the morning.  it was about the size of quarter.  my windows were downand when i stopped for the lights, i did not hear any sound at all.The first light was in sight for approximate 3-4 minutes.  it moved real slow atfirst and then it moved quickly at the end.At first one or two planes were coming at it and then they were more coming inand then one i stopped at the like they were more.  they were going faster thanwhat you expect a jet to fly at that altitude, but not really fast.  i i thoughtthey must be rendering assistants, there must be plane in trouble.I took it as a matter of fact until i read in the papers that other people sawsomething that morning.  i need not flank it was a space debris, now or i sell. there was nothing there that was traveling at 17,000 mph.  this was aone-of-a-kind event, it looked like it was coming from homassassa, going tomaybe hillsbouro avenue  in tampa.  i cant say what it was, but i know therewere plane coming in to it.Pasco airport nearby and another at

noreluctance to openly discuss his sighting. equally important, as a deputysheriff, mike realized that i would rely on his professional training to helpcontribute to an accurate account of his sighting. mike also volunteered toinquire at the sheriff department for possible additional information or witness(action pending) to better evaluate this activity.Upon my arrival at mikes home for

was driving north on highway 75 and turned westward onto m. l. k. avenue.  ithen turned right (south) on falkenburg. it was then that i immediately saw anarray of very bright lights to the southwest and about 35 degrees elevation inthe sky. since i am also a private pilot, my first thought was that it may be anairplane in trouble.  i, pulled over and stopped to get a better look, i alsoinitiated a call to the airport that confirmed they had no aircraft in that areaand i concluded that the object was not any conventional airplane.  i was now nolonger driving; just sitting and looking and more accurately observing.I continue to watch and was fascinated with the lights.  they were reddish bluein color with an overall orange glow emitting.  wherever it was continued tomove from right to left (southwest towards the south) on an apparent constanttrack anarchy.  i also heard no sound from it.  i estimated it to have been atabout 35 degrees of elevation and maybe oblong or oval shaped.  i could not seeits shape that clearly. i can estimate its size either because i was primarilywatching the lights, although it seemed to be about 25 to 30 miles away.  fromthe time i stopped, i believe its lights were in view for about 20 to 25seconds until they disappeared.  it also must have been moving reasonably fastto get out of sight that quickly.  the unfortunate part is that i had a set ofbinoculars right beside me, i was so fascinated with what i was seeing that iforgot to use them for a closer look.  it was all very unusual and i aminterested to know what it was that i

also expressed was some concern for possiblenegative public relations that could result for the motel and the witness. there was some reluctance expressed to even allow an interview to be done.  bothinvestigators expressed their understanding of the concern and explained thatcomplete anonymity would be maintained.  this arrangement was acceptable and theinterview proceeded.   my best memory of the witnesss narration  follows:i was standing on the (north side of the) second story walkway of the motel atabout 5:05 when i first saw some very bright (assumed) aircraft headlights rightover there (pointing northwest over the water at about 20 degrees of armelevation while standing at the point of observation).  the airport is alsonearby right over there (pointing northward) a few miles and that entire area iswithin the normal flying pattern for its aircraft.  i first thought that a planewas either coming in for a landing or taking off.  i soon changed my mind.  thisthing was coming too fast for that, and then i realized it was several vehiclesin formation.  the one in front was big and triangular in shape.  there werethree others following behind with i believe similar shapes.  it was easy to seethe lead vehicle because those following behind it were in close formation andwere shinning their lights on it.  i could clearly see its unusual triangularshape and the surface looked like shinny metal or silver colored.  as theformation came closer,  it still remained out over the water.   then i walked(about fifteen feet) over here (to the northwest of the building) to be able tocontinue keeping them in sight.  when they were right out there (perpendicularto the coastline-westward) i knew i was seeing something very different fromnormal aircraft.  they were going so fast that i felt sure i would hear a shockor see their afterburners lit up, but it was completely silent.  it was eerie. i felt strange, as if the hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.  asthey continued southward the formation stayed right together, but i could seespace between the vehicles.  i never saw anything change or heard any noise.They quickly flew on by and went out of sight that way (pointing southward).  idont know whats going on, but it didnt seem normal.  so, i later reported itto the news media.  well, i guess thats my story.  i still dont know what tothink of it and would like to know more about it, since the news media tookpretty light of it.","distance":"101-500

so bright and she said that she was more wide awakethan she usually is on rising in the morning.  she then went into the livingroom which also was lit with flashing colored lights.  she immediately openedthe locked front door and looked around the area and saw nothing, she wasexpecting to see emergency vehicles outside.  she then looked up to the west tosee a swirling, beautiful bunch of lights that were the cause of all thebrightness in the surrounding area.  these lights were forming a giant counterclockwise circle and contained every color of the rainbow, pink, rose, red, redorange, yellow,yellow orange, green, white, blue green and violet, she said.  the were swirlingin a counter-clockwise direction and somehow made the witness stare in awe atwhat she described as the most beautiful thing she had ever seen (figure 1). this swirling light formation was traveling very slowly from the west towardsthe south and just above a small palm tree and light post only 250 to 300 ft.Away when the witness first saw it.  she then started yelling for her son, whowas asleep in the living room, to come and see this.  after more yelling andwatching the object briefly out of the

wasable to see the object as it was in a second phase, a turquoise ball with astreak behind it (figure 2).  it was approximately 75 ft. wide.  after approx.Two minutes both witnesses were then astonished to see it change into a saucerlike object which formed a cloud around it and then rose directly up anddisappeared.  both witnesses agreed to witness twos drawings of what they sawand that the gray object had two white lights at either end.  both witnesses suddenly became frightened and ran into the house, barricadingthemselvesand a younger child in the house.  she called her husband at work who was on amidnight shift asking him to come right home.  she continued to secure the houseand when he came home he found them both distraught.They called the airports and did not get a satisfactory answer nor did they knowwho they should call for help.  after waiting on hold, the last airport saidthere had been a lot of meteor sightings this morning and also that  russiansatellite
