watching the movie, amoving light caught my eye out the window.  i turned away from the tv to look atit and expected to see an airplane flying towards the medford airport on finalapproach (united

the distance, to thenorthwest.Instead of seeing an airplane, there was a slow-moving blue lightmoving toward the right (our window faces due north).  my next thought was thatit was a shooting star, and i told my husband, look at that light, expecting itto disappear very quickly like a shooting star.  he looked and saw what hedescribes as a blue light with a light blue circle around it3b then it went out like a light---not like a shooting star trailing debris.Myhusband said that the crew of a ual 737 which flew over about 1 to 2 minuteslater, was pointed in approximately the same direction, and could easily haveseen the phenomenon.  my husband is a licensed private pilot and former airforce navigator.  the object moved in a straight line, toward the nne,descending away from us as we looked to the north.  i thought that the objectwas at an altitude similar to that of other aircraft which fly over our house. my husband thought that its altitude was probably quite high---at least thatswhat my husband estimates, but that is perhaps because he thought that it iseasy to compare its track to that of a meteorite entering the atmosphere.Wewould appreciate knowing if other people observed this phenomena tonight.Myhusband typed this narrative with my

beautiful nite, no high winds, or clouds. topanga is part of the santa monicamountains, south of edwards air base. ken was the first to see the object. hestated  hey, look, that star is moving!.. i looked up and didnt see it at first,until he pointed it out, just above us.  it was amazing, it had an orange color-glowing, it was smooth moving, and just there. its path moved across the sky atleast for 30-45 seconds..26 then just disappeared into a faded descent up.  its kind of hard to explainbut we both saw it leave, yet, both or views of how it left26 the color change was different, except we did both agree that the colorchange was like a silverish liquid type of form. and how it left was straight upwith a smooth silver or vapor trail up that dissappeared just as quickly as ithad appeared.  thats when we noticed just behind us over the hill top of theplatform where we were, there was another object, just over the trees,displaying lights","distance":"Over One
