hours later i woke up to what sounded like a fleet of aircraft carriers flying very low over our house. we are used to some noise we are located under one of the incoming flight paths for cvg.     \r\n \r\nwhen i went to check it out a minimum or 10 aircraft seemed to be lined up flying in formation heading ne and then one by one turned w towards the  airport. \r\n    \r\nthe weird thing is the third or fourth aircraft was behaving differently than the others. it was hovering then it would ascend and descend rapidly. this went on for at least 5 minutes. i went to every window and door to make sure i wasn’t seeing things. i saw the same thing in every possible place.  also i saw flashing lights orange, yellow and red.  i watched the aircraft as it descended towards the airport almost touching the tree tops on my street. it was boomerang shaped with the same flashing lights located on rear of craft. \r\n\r\ni don’t really recall specific feelings. however it does seem the more time passes the less i remember. i experienced blurry vision after. i have lived here twelve years and have not experienced this before.\r\n\r\ni realize there are several other possibilities dhl cargo carriers and some type of military installation located in hebron ky.\r\n\r\njust wanted to check if there were any other reports?\r\nthank you\r\nft wright, ky.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

fighter jets fly over,and above me aproxment 500 feet above me. 1 jet was aproxment 500 feet to the west of the  redish,orange sphere another jet was aproxment 500 feet to the east of the redish orange sphere and 4 more jets were side by side following about 1000 feet behind this redish,orange sphere. what was so strange about it was how low and slow they were all flying and flew directly over the top of me. this redish,orange sphere looked to be about 30 feet in diameter.It was kinda dim with no strobe lights of any kind. after they flew over the jet on the west side of the sphere backed off and turned left and got right behind the redish,orange sphere and after that i couldn't see them anymore because of the trees that are around 1 mile south of me. as far as i could tell they all keeped on flying stright south. now if they should have been flying south east they would have been flying towards moudy airforce bace. i don't know of any airport that would have been stright south or me. any help on this ordeal would be more than i have now. this took place in so. ga. 60 miles north of ga.Fla. line 100 miles east of clombus ga and i00 miles west of waycross ga and 100

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was leaving work to go to my second job when i noticed an oddly intense, firey bright light in the sky to the south east of me.  i was standing on the north side of 14 mile, just east of john r rd, facing south.  to the far west of me, i could see planes in the sky... with their blinking multicolored lights as expected... nothing unusual.   but this abnormally placed fire orange/red light in the east sky, grabbed my attention... i couldn't stop staring at it when i first noticed it because it had struck me so odd ... the color, the size... and it's placement.  i could visualize it in the distance , looking past/through the power lines  draped along 14 mile rd,... it started off hovering in one spot and i questioned if it was just a close, bright planet?  it was seen below the power lines, respectively to my observation angle, and when it started to accend strait up into the sky and was now persepectively far above the power lines within seconds...That's when i got my camera phone out and started recording.  once it accended to around 50 degrees in the horizon,  it stopped and hovered some more, before moving up again and towards the right (or slightly west and upward towards 90 degrees of the horizon) and appeared to shrink in size but remained  intense like fire. then all of a sudden another huge intense fireball, as i witnessed it to be bigger than the first one, appeared about 30+ degrees to the horizon, just east of the first light i had seen (which was now higher and disappearing).... and by my viewing perspective, the second light had started to appear waaaay above the power lines, unlike the first. the second light appeared visually to be tearing through a black piece of paper (sky) or slipping through a slice or cut that had been made.  the two lights projected light that shared this odd boundary between the two, as a warped rhomboid geometrical shape with curled corners ... it looked like the sky had been scraped with an orange paint with a strait edged paint knife, connecting the two lights. although the first light almost seemed to have a force field around it, giving it dark void of space around it, causing the \"painted light/rhomboid\" shape to bend around it.  then i also noticed something else catch my eye as i was staring intensely at what i was witnessing... two.. possibly three other spacecraft , that carried multiple but dull lighting around its edge, 4-6 lights,  would appear, disappear, hover and bounce back and forth, up and down in place, very unnatural flight pattern but consistency in shape , and appeared to be spinning in place in the sky.. almost like it was supervising the event that was taking place. i witnessed 3 total large fireball lights that night, 2 of which  came through the \"cut in the sky\" and they all shrunk significantly  in size before what appeared to shoot off quickly and disappear/disintegrate at another point at the other end of this \"light/painted rhomboid\" shape created by the light they were emitting.  i was watching the event by recording with my phone, and i looked up to see it with my own eyes again, and i noticed i could no longer see them!  these abnormous bright lights in the sky were invisible to the naked eye and i could only see them by watching through my camera phone , which was absurd!  this wasn't a small planet or star like structure, it was very very very large and intensively bright. ok... so now i am super confused and i continue to take videos until i realize i am going to be late for my second job.  when i left my second job around after 11pm, i only noticed one light in the sky... not crazy intense like before but it gave me a sense of insecurity, it made the hair rise up on my body like i had obtained an electrical charge. when i returned home, which is 30+ miles away from troy (notice i said miles... not minutes)  i was given the impression it had followed me home. upon walking into my home it felt like it was just far above me about maybe 60 degrees in the horizon, no longer moving just stationary or hovering, just looking over my shoulder. i could not sleep that night, and  i rightfully should have because i worked a 15 hour day.  the next day when i got off work, i checked the sky to see if i could debunk what i saw the night before by witnessing the same repeating pattern, but did not see it again. i stayed for a few minutes longer to be sure...Made sure to watch the  sky in the same exact direction and observation point, and yet there was nothing at all.  i took videos and pictures to show all the lights and ufo in perspective of each other.  one of the pictures i tried to enhance to make the shape i was seeing  eternal the lights stand out more.  i usually see these videos/pictures better when i am standing in a dark room, since the light from my phone or surrounding lights can often show a glare on my screen and hide the contrasting dark shades.

moment.  i didn't hear any sound. it was just very deliberate in it's presence i felt. the color changed from more white but hints of purple and blue. it was above me for 5 to 6 seconds, changed to a

noticed it driving headed west on ball road after exiting the 57 freeway. i stopped at a restaurant on the corner of ball and state collage and observed it changing direction going se towards me with a large com trail. similar to the arc a missile would make on its trajectory path. the com trail at that point became sporadic and when it was at its closest  point to me i realized it was a sphere not an airplane. it dissaperaed before i could get proper video of it. at its closest point to me it had no trail and was clearly visible to be a spherical object traveling at about non commercial airplane height above the ground. it was large enough to clearly see unmistakabley what it was but could not gauge the actual size. if i had to estimate though it would have been smaller than to be expected from the trailing it left in the sky. possibly the size of a small suv if i had to guess. the video i do have is not great but the object does not look like an airplane with the usual com trail. i noticed that after the object was not visible and miles from the original location that the commercial jets were scrambling to finally land. more than i have ever seen landing while leaving trails of their own before. the com trails were also distinctly different in the shape left as well as the way they surrounded the exiting plane versus the unidentifiable object. it looked like the trail was the object not coming out from behind a distinct plane shape.

a place we have previously seen ufos at, catching up, when we noticed at an approximate heading of 190 a craft that was first assumed to be a plane. first photograph shows first object approximately 1° below horizon. craft is later seen 4-5° above horizon with an estimated distance of 2-8 miles. shortly after first observation, a smaller light emerged from the first, and took up position near it. then, a second did the same, along with a 3rd. emerged lights seemed to orbit in irregular patterns around original object, as the larger one slowly seemed to move to a heading of 180° after roughly 10 minutes of observation, the 3 other objects seemingly rejoined the original, as though they were docking.\r\n (witness reporting is a pilot, and states that helicopters are incapable of docking, and that these craft, including craft from previous sightings in same location, behaved in ways impossible for even the most advanced military aircraft.)\r\nthe 4 objects were completely silent, and operated in a manner resembling spacecraft in orbit, though the objects maintained geological position ± 5° for 45 minutes, unlike an orbiting craft. unfortunately, it was dark, and any surface details of the objects were impossible to see. images will be provided in hopes that the reader of this report will observe them with photo editing software and share their observations with the witness.\r\nat 2129 hours, craft was last photographed before disappearing in the following 5 minutes. craft was observed to 'fade away' instead of departing.

but it was getting louder. the windows in the house were rattling and my 2 nieces ran into there bedrooms crying and scared. the next thing was that my grandmother, aunt pat and a little later uncle buck went outside to see what was going on when all of the sudden we looked up above the house and saw a very large craft hovering just above the top of canyon ridge in front of the house. total silence. we looked and asked each other what was it. uncle buck and said \" looks like a g_d damn city up there\" and  ran into the house scared. my grandmother pat and i kept looking and we couldn't understand what we were looking at. i felt more afraid than anything i'd ever felt before. i knew i was looking at something not from this planet. then in a second it was gone!!!! no sound. since the house was down in a canyon i got into the ranch pickup and took my nephew todd up to the top of ridge to see where it went. well you guessed. nothing \r\n   we all gathered together in the kitchen to discuss and try and make sense of what just happened. the shape was too large to figure out but we did agree on seeing white lights in a row, as if the side of an airliner of the end of the craft leaving. it could have been the triangle shape seen on tv.There were 6 witnesses. i know what i saw and felt.Thanks mufon","distance":"101-500

i realized i might be seeing a ufo. i wasn't prepared for the size it was, and how low it was. i was also surprised to hear sound. i can only guess at size, almost three hundred feet across. i judged it by the size of land i was on and that it was big enough to fly over the neighbors yard as well. it came in low and not fast. it was hard for me to believe this thing could fly. the metal was dull with no writing. rectangle shape with a cut out in the middle. about five minutes after it came over i could see military helicopters in the west, which flew back and forth like they were looking for something although how they missed this thing is beyond me. i was excited to actually see this but questioned whether this could be one of our whatever it is. it seemed so indifferent to being seen. i noticed that there was a lot of sightings in p.A. around the time i saw this and realized it was probably coming from that area. i just kept watching until i couldn't see it

saw two cylindrical objects above the tree line on about the same level as the hill top village of la garde d'ademar.  i noticed them because they were not moving and because they were cylindrical. also they were very large. larger than a plane (light aircraft). one object was higher than the other, and positioned slightly more to the south. it made me think of planes refuelling in mid-air. but these were not plane shaped objets and there was no connecting tube visible. as i drove, i could not see the slightest movement from either object. suddenly i went past a wooded area which shielded my view. this lasted about 30 seconds. when i was once again able to see past the trees, no objects were visible. i stopped the car another 30 seconds later when i came to a roundabout (i.E able to stop) and got out to have a good look, and see if i could see the objects were moving away in the distance. but nothing was visible at all.  \r\ni was shocked to think it might have been a ufo. i certainly wasn't thinking about anything like that when driving. i checked the internet the next day to see if anything had been reported. a ufo sighting had been reporting for the previous week around pierrelatte, but not that day. \r\n\r\nfyi pierrelatte is the site of a nuclear power station (tricastin) and the largest plutonium recycling plant in france. there is another nuclear power station

other and with space in between. then the object slowly rotated and now i could see set of three white lights much dimmer than the red light. i also could see a very dim reflection of city lights on one side of the object. it was snowing lightly at the time. i estimate that it was about a little over a mile away, therefore it was larger than a helicopter. which we see very often over the

in automobile (person does not wish to be known). march of 1996 temperature above normal - about 55f - sky clear, cloudless, stars, no moon, ambient lighting dim but very good. cresting rise on highway approx. 3/4 mile west of intersection of 72e and jackson county (alabama) road 5 when sighted ufo. one car (1.) stopped in right lane very close to intersection of 72e and co. rd. 5; second car (2.) stopped in median near that car and intersection and facing east; third car (3.) stopped in left lane of 72w just past second car; fourth car (4.)moving at extremely slow speed in right hand lane of 72w and never stops during entire encounter, accelerating to high speed and passing out of sight to our rear as ufo crosses highway moments later; fifth car (5.) stopped on right shoulder of 72e halfway between us and intersection with co.Rd. 5 as we pull over to right shoulder also and turn of lights and stop engine. both westbound vehicles (3., 4.) have all lights on. car 1. same. cars 2. and 5. parking lights on. both of us got out of car to view. only sound is approaching and then leaving of car 4. but never loud enough to have covered any sound airborne body would have made in my judgment. as we exit car i notice one person standing outside of car 5. ufo appeared to be to our south and moving at maybe fifteen mph westward (in our direction)above floodplain and along skirts pisgah mtn. (?) and rocky ridge (?). (how long other stopped vehicles had been watching we had no way of knowing.) held up right hand and ufo was somewhat fatter and longer than index and middle fingers held together. craft was at first a pale shape that blotted out dim shapes of hillsides behind it; row of distinctly separate blue, green, and red lights with above and below that a row of distinctly separate white lights. as ufo drew closer it would have been obscured by roadside slope to our right and i walked slowly out onto the highway to keep it in sight. about then it altered its course and turned toward 72e, roughly paralleling co. rd. 5 and i reached the median. ufo continued to approach and i noticed person at car 5. moving and saw its dim interior light come on and go off and saw the person had apparently entered his vehicle. i myself admit to then feeling somewhat anxious and began to creep back toward our car and was at the edge of the shoulder beside the car as car 4. went over and down the incline behind us and it effectively became dead quiet. at the next moment the craft passed over 72e. sorry but i must use a regional comparison: it was the size of bryant-denny stadium, one on top of the other. i had to hold both hands fingers up at about half an arms length to block out the ufo. i guess it was 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. it was a pale gray against the dark sky and totally blocked starlight as it went. the row of colored lights appeared to be along its centerline. they were somewhat vibrant but only moderately bright. the upper and lower rows of white lights were not as bright as auto headlights. there was absolutely no sound at any time from the craft. as it passed over 72e and the railway parallel and north of the highway it veered again, a bit to its left, and accelerated modestly, perhaps to forty to fifty mph. it was there that it was at its closest to us, perhaps no more the two hundred yards. it looked huge. it moved off over paint rock and gurley between split rock and keel mountains to become obscured by trees. at this point i turned to my companion who was the first of us to say anything. \"what the f--- was that!?\" about there i heard the westbound car (3.) accelerate and it gained speed as it passed us racing westward and over the rise behind us. we looked and both cars 1. and 2. had driven away and 5. was pulling out at a high rate of speed. after we got back in the car i continued east as we talked, secretly hoping to catch car 5. but as i rounded the left hand curve past co. rd. 5 i could see the tail lights of car 5. were a long way up 72e. he must have been doing 80 or 90 mph to get that far away from me that quickly. that was the second of three things i have observed for which i have no explanation. it was certainly the most complex sighting i have experienced. it was twenty years ago and i am now 64 and want someone else to know before i die.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
