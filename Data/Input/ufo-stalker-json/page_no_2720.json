theback...It could have been backing up for all i know...Were redstreaks/beams/rods(???).They were bright red and when it banked they went withit without any drag that i can remember. they came out a certain distance andend of them corraliated with edge of disk...They did not appear to beflames...More like light rods.8/it simply went out of my viewing range ,. p.S.Please note...Some of above answers in survey above  relate to things yearslater than this incident...I am just not sure that they are not related.","distance":"21-100

witness on his way home from church about 9:00 p.M.Was headed north on 86th street just north of i-80 in the des moines-johnston,iowa area, when he noticed a car pulled over with a young couple standing in thecold without coats on, looking up.  witness assumed couple watching hale-boppcomet, and so he hunched forward to look through his own windshield and viewedhale-bopp nnw of him for a few seconds at estimated 25 degrees west of north. then settling back in car seat, casually glanced to his left (w) throughdrivers window and saw the ufo at about 75-80 degrees up from horizon.  witnessstopped his car and watched (by this time he was 8/10 mile north of i-80.Witness estimates that for about 5 seconds he could see some dark structure, butwhat really impressed him was his view of huge rectangular bright white lightpanels (estimates 6-8 panels) which looked to be on the side or end of theobject. in addition to the light panels, he observed a centrally located pulsingwhite light on what he thinks might have been the underside of object.  witnessheard no sound from this huge object which seemed to fill a large portion of hisfield of vision (when interviewed at the site by two mufon investigators,witness pointed to a nearby low-hanging cloud to indicate size of ufo....Becausecloud witness pointed to was hanging above both commercial and residentialdevelopment, and investigator was able to measure the distance he pointed out, aconservative estimate might be in the 800-1,000 foot range in size.)  witnessaltitude estimate was 2-3000 feet at land distance of less than 3/4 mile.Witness perception is that object either turned all white, or that the objectitself turned to a side where it was lighted all white, and then elevateddrastically in altitude after about 5 seconds and sped away very fast to the w,with the total sighting no more than 40-45 seconds in duration.Witness quickly did a u-turn and headed back south, hoping to find the youngcouple hed seen by the side of the road, but they were already driving awayfrom the area.  witness believes that the young couple, judging from theirstance and where they were looking into the sky, were watching the object as itmoved from east to west over his vehicle before he caught sight of it himself.Witness called urbandale police department, but was told they had received nocalls about the incident.It should be noted that witness does not want his identity known publicly, so itwould seem that he sees nothing to gain in finally reporting this incident. [note:  the trigger for his decision to finally hunt on the internet for anorganization to which he could report this incident, was the documentary airedin march, 2001 outlining the jan.2000 southern illinois case involving policemenand civilians in various locations.]","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":1153,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6713889,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-93.7058333,"occurred":859870800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":859870800000,"summary":"1997, 800-1000ft,w/in 3/4 mile, 6-8rectangular lig","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Johnston, Iowa","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:5354"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Miami","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":null,"detailedDescription":"The principal witness was walking for exercise between 5:00 am and 6:00 am.  shesawa brightly glowing sphere about three times the size of the planet venus.  shestopped a neighbor who was backing out her car to go to work, asking her to look at thestrange bright light.  the neighbor looked briefly at the direction to which thewitness was pointing and then continued on to work.  the first witness watchedthe ball of light for about seven minutes at which time she lost sight of it.
