would like to know if what i saw eleven years ago was a ufo or a naturaloccuring phenomenon.  i was stationed in germany in 1990.  one night whileguarding an ammo holding area in an isolated area, i saw a bright red light thatwas as bright as the sun.  i was sitting in a small wooden guard shack thatresembled an outhouse but with windows.  the window to my left was boarded upwith plywood3b i could not see the source of the light because of the board.  it was two orso in the morning and it was quiet with no activity.  the area where the ammowas stored at had no lights.  the only source of light i had was a flashlight. the ammo holding area was located in a tactical training area3b the use of white light outdoors was prohibited.  it was quiet and i cantrecall if the skies were clear or not.  there was no moon and it was dark. suddenly the whole area in front of me lit up like it was noon.  it was as ifsome one had turned on a light in a room.  i could clearly see everything aroundme.  it was just like daylight but the light was red.  there was no sound and itonly lasted a second.  the source seemed to come from the sky and to my left3b i could not see the source because of the plywood.  i dont know what couldcreate a light with the same intensity as the sun and not make a noise.  aminute of two later a pair of military humvee sped pass by on a road that wasnear my guard shack.  the vehicles had flashing lights on top.  nothing happenedafter that.  the next morning i asked around.  no one knew anything about itwhile others did not say anything.  i would like to

saw what appeared to be a huge orange star comingup over the western mountains. i said look at that huge star to my brother. hethought it must be a planet, but we are both amateur sky gazers and decided thatit wasnt a planet after all. venus and mars are only up during the day in thewinter and jupiter and saturn move from the upper sky to the western sky overthe course of the evening. the star object we saw came up from the westernhorizon and hovered for an hour just above the mountains. i thought it lookedorange but my brother thought it was blue26 white. as we looked closer, it appeared to change colors at random intervalsfrom orange to blue to white then back to orange. it also appeared to get biggerand brighter, then smaller and dimmer as we looked at it. driving home from parkcity to salt lake city, we lost sight of it behind the walls of the canyon.However, this same star keeps appearing every few nights, sometimes onconsecutive nights, at different times between dusk and 9:00 pm mst. it alwaysrises suddenly just over the western mountains3b it always hovers26 changes colors for an hour or so3b sometimes it moves steadily south along the ridge of the mountains3b my brother and i have observed it many times while airplanes fly just underit toward the airport3b it is definitely too big26 bright to be a star or planet3b since the middle of january it has appeared every other night or so and everysunday night. however, neither of us has seen it for a couple of weeks, exceptlast sunday and we will be checking for it again tonight.","distance":"Over One

if it was burning. 4) i took my foot offof the gas, so to slow down a bit3b to observe better, i placed my face into the windshield. a protrusion in therock to my right hid the object for a moment, and i scanned the area opposite tocatch sight as it re-entered my view. when i realized what it was i wasobserving, i was at first scared then elated as a long held belief wasconfirmed. 5) object was an interstellar space craft. i have only seen drawingsin caves that come anywhere close to this design. surface was as if liquidmercury. glowing, too. brilliant as the sun, but did not hurt your eyes to lookdirectly into it. my first impression was that it was having some smallmechanical problem3b it was twisting from side to side while keeping steady speed. seemed to flushsomething that trickled off orange, then material stopped glowing after leavinginfluence of surrounding aura. i got a wonderful full 3d view of this ship, andwas able to make a detailed model/drawings of it. very simple design, veryfunctional. no lights, no windows, nothing protruding off of the ship. only itemevident was a 3/4 exposed ball (dome) on top, which i have come to believe wasthe main drive. 6)ship regained control, leveled out and ran the length of themountain range until out of sight. through the entire sighting, this ship, whichwas the size of an airliner, made no sound3b not even an echo off of the surrounding canyon.I had no radio on in car, nointerior running lighting. all windows were open, and most of the observationwas hanging out of the drivers window. only other vehicle in the area was anolder model ford stationwagon, which left the scene like a bat out of hell. itried to chase it down, to compair notes, but gave up after reaching 106 mph.Additional details are available.","distance":"Over One
