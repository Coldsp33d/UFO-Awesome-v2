45 degrees to see 2 steady pale yellow-white lightsflying east to west at an extremely fast rate. it passed about directly overheadand proceeded to fly off to the horizon in the west, possibly jinking a bit tothe north at about 45 degrees above the western horizon. this all took under 10seconds. more like 5. the two lights moved parallel to each other and may havebeen two lights on either side of a dark central structure. there was no soundand the object(s) must either have been huge, or low level, as several normalaircraft were in the air at the same time and their running lights appeared muchsmaller than these lights. the lights did not change in intensity, it simplykept going west until i could no longer see it. i thought at first it may havebeen mir or the new space station or shuttle, but dont these objects travelwest to east? there were no trails of any sort.","distance":"Over One

objectwhile driving on 1-75 at 3:20 a.M. south of venice, florida.  it was firstseen at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon at a distance of about500 feet.  the object had a varied surface and its basic color and shapewere muted (there was some fog), but it reflected the lights in shades ofbeige, yellow, orange and brown.  it had a beam light with a yellowish aura.The object was first sighted coming from a northwesterly direction and lastobserved moving to the southwest.  its movements resembled those of afalling leaf.  the witness has spent years in the marine corps and knowsflight dynamics so he wondered how any aircraft could move in this fashion.At one point the vehicle appeared to stall because it decelerated andstopped, then started again.The closest distance the witness was to the object was about 200 feet, whenit came down and hovered over a vehicle parked on the highway.  from thisdistance it appeared larger than a camper but not as large as a truck.  atthis point the witness said his own vehicle stopped and he had to start itagain. he rolled down the window and all sounds seemed to be muted. witnesssaid his automobile was in perfect condition and had never stalled before.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,
