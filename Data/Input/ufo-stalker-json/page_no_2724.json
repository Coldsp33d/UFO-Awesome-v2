sightingand i was stunned to find that looked exactly like an object i filmed indecember 2000 when i still lived in claremore, ok.  i filmed the object using my8mm camera and showed the video to family and friends, all agreeing that it wasa very strange object.  as the bishop tape showed it appeared to be a star orpinprick of light but then would suddenly turn all kinds of different colors andthen do this really strange moving around erratically and would increase in size3b as it did this you can see on the tape what appears to be a disc spinningrapidly, i guess.  im not really sure how to explain it, but it looks exactlythe way the object from the bishop, tx tape did.  over the next three nights isaw as many as two or three similiar objects in the sky.  i also noticedmilitary type

initially, i reported the incident to the national uforeporting center web site but their response was the often times the atmospherecauses a twinkling effect of a planet or star.  i dubiously accepted thisexplanation, but after seeing the bishop, tx video on the news tonight i knowthat the object i filmed was the same kind of thing.  i have no idea what itwas, but i know it unnerved

shore at approx. 10pm. the motor was not running, wewere listening to music when we saw the baseball size white sphere off the sternof the boat. it was about 5 feet above the water and it was blinking  on and offmaking no noise. from what i reacll, it was moving slowly in a northwestdirection from the moment i first noticed it. it was no more than 10 feet away!It continued on a straight path blinking about every 1.5 seconds until wecouldnt see it anymore in the darkness. neither of us could explain it at thetime and cannot to this day.I recently saw a film clip of a very similar objectthat was filmed in the area of a crop formation in england.I would be veryinterested in finding out if anyone else (boaters, fisherman, etc.) has seen anylow flying balls over lake erie.I would

following. as a nws/faa certified weather observer, i should have had ananswer, but i didnt. i say professionally that it was not smoke, but a shaft ofdiminished light, and the jet was following it exactly. then, about 1000 yardsin front of the jet, at the terminus of the shaft, there was a very bright burstof white light, with a spherical object within. altitude was approx.16-18kft.The object then disappeared, and the shaft disippated after about 1 min. i haveworked aviation weather since 1993, and served on an aircraft carrier beforethat. i have never seen anything like this before. i know aircraft and airweapons. this was not a conventional aircraft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

window blinds in my dorm room (ucsd, la jolla) andlooked up at the clear night sky, the constellation orion almost directlyoverhead at that time.  i immediately noticed something strange3b two faintly visible red dots at very high altitude were coming from the west,going east under the constellation i had been looking at (orions belt).  theobject on the left side moved in a straight line going east, and matched speedwith the object on the right side, which appeared to be doing maneuvers (flyingin loops while moving from west to east across the sky).  after a minute or two,they both disappeared from view (extreme altitude and distance).  a few minutesafter this event, a very large, dull red object (self-illuminated) flew overheadfrom the north headed south at high speed, looking somewhat blimp-like (withfurrows, bulges) while rotating on its horizontal and diagonal axes.  itmaintained altitude (between 100-500 feet up?) for some distance, then gainedaltitude very, very rapidly until it reached the level of the previous objects(and looked the same at that altitude), and disappeared from view (extremealtitude).  after these events, another possibly unrelated event occurred nearthe same area of the sky (but in space?)3b i saw between 8 and 10 evenly spaced bright flashes of light.  the first fewflashes were stationary, but with each succeeding flash, the point of the flashmoved in a southwestern direction.  the last flash was orange and elongated,while the previous ones were all bright white.  one of the flashes during thisevent was accompanied by an almost simultaneous flash in another part of the sky(a few inches away in my perspective, if i held my hand at arms length to wherei had been looking).","distance":"101-500
