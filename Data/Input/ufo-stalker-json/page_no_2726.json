posted on ms-ufofiles on 12/11/00).On the night of 12/01/00, while leaving my home (which is located in the deepwoods near the george county line about 5 miles west of hwy. 63 near cedar lake)i spotted from my truck ahead of me in the distant sky a pair of what appearedto be headlights.  i watched them for several min until the road turned in adirection which did not allow me to see them anymore.  the lights were extremelybright and since there is an airport which is located about 15 miles to thesouth of my spotting, i just assumed it to be aircraft lightslights.Two wks later i caught a program on ufos on a&e entitled ufos over indianain which the description of the object was exactly as what i had seen.  thereally strange thing is my reaction to the whole event.  this has troubled mesomewhat.  i never thought of the object again till the show triggered my memorythen bang!..All the strangeness of the sighting came to me at once.I remember thinking logically about how very large  the object would have had tobe to appear as a car with its headlights on sitting in the sky so far away.  iassumed it was quite distant since i could see no movement.  i suppose it couldhave been stationary and smaller, but that would have placed the object perhapsonly hundreds of yards away which i could see it clearly was not.  it was milesaway.I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has seen this object then orbefore, or has any rational explanation that could explain this observance.
