looking up at the sky and remarking howincredibly clear the sky was.  then i saw a bright, small, white light zoomoverhead at an incredible speed, with no sound.  at first i thought it wasprobably a shooting star that would burn out, but when it didnt burn out, ipointed it out to my friend.  it was heading southwest in the direction of thelos angeles international airport, and then all of a sudden it made what lookedlike a 90 degree turn to the southeast and after a few moments of flying in thatdirection, it just vanished.  i looked at my watch and it read 10:13 pm. shortly after that we saw a passenger jet fly overhead, but it had the typicaljet sounds and flashing lights and was not moving anywhere near as fast as whatmy friend and i saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":877,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0412085,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-118.442596,"occurred":971586780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":971586780000,"summary":"Fast,
