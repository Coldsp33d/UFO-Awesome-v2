all happened near the day of my birthday approximately the year was 2008 2009 2010 but it did happen near the day of my birthday or on the day of my birthday or on the morning after the day of my birthday 12 a.M. through 1 a.M.. a good friend my brother and i were sitting on my next door neighbor's porch it was dark out already night time approximately 12 a.M. or 1 a.M. . my friend was sitting on the railing inside the porch when all of a sudden he yelled ufo pointed towards the sky and started laughing. i looked up briefly and saw a odd shape of lights. all three of us ran outside in the yard and looked up at it. the lights were white and weren't connected they were separated but didn't lose their combined shape of a triangle. i looked away to say can you believe this, what the hell is that and then took a second look. as i look the second time this triangle started coming down closer and closer.\r\n it was moving at a very slow speed and it came down to the point where it was just above the trees right in front of us. it didn't descend down and then move straight forward it kind of eased its way down like it was walking down a staircase with no stairs obviously, it just hovered down and floated down in an odd way. it was approximately 20 to 30 feet in the air there was no noise coming off of it and everything was an awkward quiet no crickets no nothing just these lights. i hadn't been drinking that night but my brother and our friend was. they were screaming and yelling laughing i was looking up and just couldn't believe it i've had so many weird dreams about events like this and for it to actually happen was mind-blowing. as quick as it came it left in a split second i turned to look at our friend doug and i went to look back up and it was gone but they were both still staring at the sky. also as quick as this moment came it also left the minds of my brother and our friend doug. to this day they say it was a plane and they don't even acknowledge how low it was and that it just set still and that the shape of the object was a triangle. it wasn't flying flat but it was standing upright in the sky it didn't fly flat like a normal plane. i mention to them all so then where did it go and how did it disappear so quick they said \"it flew off that's what happened\".I feel i remember new stuff when i think back to that day because at first my only memories were of the object and nothing else. to this day i know what i saw i know it wasn't a plane i know it wasn't a helicopter it was something otherworldly.","distance":"21-100

frantically told me she saw a ufo in the sky. she was very panicked, she then told me to look outside the window of my house, because she was pulling in the driveway and knew i'd be able to see the ufo she was seeing. i ran over to the window and looked outside. i saw lights moving in northwest direction. i quickly ran outside and saw my wife pulling in the driveway and i looked behind our house and i still could see the ufo. the visibility did not last long as it traveled behind the tree line behind route 30. when i first saw the object i was extremely excited and filled with many different emotions. i knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter, i thought maybe a drone but then realized it couldn't be that because of the size it may have been. after the event took place i was a little nervous and didn't know what to do and felt i wouldn't be able to go to sleep last night. for most of my life i had been intrigued and always curious about aliens and ufo's. before last night i had always wanted to see something like this in real life and not just on a youtube video. i posted on facebook about what had happened. a friend of mine got in contact with me and said his wife had seen an object the week before that was triangular and she was very freaked out by this. i called my wife at work and told her and she then proceeded to tell me as she was coming home from the gym the night before that she had seen another object that was triangular and thought maybe it was a plane. this very well could have been a separate sighting, our experience last night involved lights that i would describe as four that were rotating around two lights that were  pulsating. the ufo was fast and turned quickly.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

10:30 pm i was driving towards virginia, mn from cloquet, mn. as i came up onto an overpass on hwy 33 to the north of cloquet and to the nw of duluth, mn and saw about six vehicles parked on the side of the road with their hazard flashers on. several people were out of their cars and were looking to the east. i stopped and got out to see what was going on. looking to the east, i saw something very large flying just as it went overhead. it was silent and looked like a black triangle.\r\n\r\nas it passed overhead, i realized it must have been at least 200 feet wide and had some bright white lights on the tips that faced forward. it moved overhead and blocked out a considerable amount of the evening sky. it moved silently at about 30 mph and was out of sight within a minute or so.\r\n\r\ndetails about the evening: approximately 10:30 pm (22:30), sometime in september, 1990 (unsure of exact date as it was 16+ years ago), clear skies, new to ¼ moon (relatively dark), temperature in 50-60f range, no noticeable surface winds.\r\n\r\ndetails about the location: hwy 33, north of cloquet, mn on northbound bridge that goes over saginaw road (county roads 694+46). this location is about 4 miles west of the duluth international airport and there is an airbase at that location, although not very active, just border patrols and air national guard.\r\n\r\ndetails about object: speed of approximately 30 mph, altitude was less than 500 feet agl, direction of travel was from east to west, visible for less than two minutes, triangle shaped with white lights on front (leading) edge, silent, no exhaust or emissions, no electrical interference.\r\n\r\ni am college educated geographic specialist and have researched some possibilities for this object. i didn’t really think about it for a number of years and finally thought about what it could have been. my first thought was that it was a stealth bomber, but realized that the actual production started later than when this was sighted. i’m sure there were prototypes around, but most likely not flying out of duluth at this time. stealth bombers and fighters have never been stationed out of duluth. this object was also as silent as a bird; no wind noise, no jet exhaust, no turbine whine--nothing but silence.\r\n\r\nthe fact that there were more witnesses confirmed that i wasn’t seeing things. i wish someone else would come forward and confirm this besides me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

was around 1993.  i worked weekends as a bartender in a local club, while i studied at university. the bar was within walking distance to my apartment, and at that time, all bars in ontario closed at 1 am.  shortly after closing and locking up the bar, a friend that was in the area, who also lived close by, walked me home this particular night.  it was a beautiful and warm saturday night; the temperature outside was perfect. it was mid summer, and the streets were quiet and empty.  the sky was clear, and within ten minutes we were at my apartment.  my friend wasn't stopping; he just needed to use the washroom before heading to his apartment a couple blocks away.  it was probably close to 2 am.     \r\n\r\nmy apartment building was an old funeral home that had been converted into office space, and then into four apartment units.  i was friendly with the other three tenants, and i remember that as i approached my building i noticed that everyone must have been sleeping as there were no lights on.  the building was situated on a very short block and located in between two major streets in the city.  i lived on the second floor of the building and i could see both intersecting streets from my front windows. directly across the street was the start of major construction of a new large building.  at this point in the construction, it was just cement and steel of what was soon to be a hotel.   our apartment building took up half of the block; the other half of the block consisted of one small house, and a sandwich shop which was closed for the evening. there was no one around.  \r\n\r\nmy friend and i entered the apartment.  he headed to use the washroom located at the back of the unit, and i began the ritual opening of the windows to let my cats out onto the roof which also acted as a canopy for the entrance of the building.  the roof was only accessible from my two french windows.  there were no screens and i had to stand on my couch and crawl through the windows to get out onto the roof.  many times i sat out there with the cats and/or friends and just people watched. \r\n\r\nas i stood on the couch and opened the windows, i was just about ready to exit onto the roof, and instantly, out of no where, this u.F.O. appeared.  it was just there. i knew at that moment that it was a u.F.O.  there was no doubt in my mind, and i did not question myself, nor did i doubt my eyes.  it literally came out of no where.  there was no sound.  it just hovered at eye level, directly in front of me.  it took up the space of the entire road.  i can't remember if there were two lanes or three lanes on the road but it covered the entire area of road, from one side of the street to the other.  it is hard to remember how long it was or the depth of it, but it seemed to be about a story high.  it was between 30 and 50 feet long.  it saw me, and it was purposely watching me.  i absolutely knew that, because there wasn't another soul in sight.  my friend was still in the back of the apartment.  i was shocked, i didn't move.  i just stood there and stared.  i couldn't move, or i didn't want to move.  there were so many lights, different colours, green, white, yellow, and orange.  twenty years ago, i could have described the lights in more detail, but sadly i cannot recall if there were red or blue lights. the body of the object was dark, greyish, like a flat unpolished metal, and there didn't appear to be any windows, not that i could tell.  the lights flashed on and off, all around the body of the object.  it appeared to be like a disc shape, wider at the bottom, and narrowing and more rounded at the top.  the lights were near the bottom of the object and the lights were the only thing on this object that moved.  there didn't seem to be any sequence to the lights going on and off, but they travelled around the object, on and off in a circular motion.  what amazed me was that this massive object directly in front of me, made no sound.  it must have been there for 30 seconds.  30 seconds is not long, but in that moment, time stood still for me.  i didn't know what to expect; i waited for anything to happen.  it just hovered.  i wasn't afraid, but i was concerned if i made any sudden motion, something could happen.  maybe it would leave?  all i wanted was for my friend to witness this remarkable thing outside my window; something that i never imagined was possible to see.  to me, it felt surreal, like a miracle, not in a religious sense, but in the unimaginable sense, where you just cannot place this thing in your reality.  but it was right in front of me, and i was alone, and unable to share this with anyone.  and this was happening right in the middle of a pretty large city.  under my breath, and as quiet as i could, i called for my friend.  without moving my lips, i grunted my friend's name, not taking my eyes off of the object. i wondered if i should in fact be scared, but there was no time to comprehend fear.  and then, just as my friend walked into the room, it simply took off.  no sound, nothing.  i saw it take off at a speed i cannot describe, and as soon as it entered the intersection of the street to the south of the building, it absolutely just vanished, gone!  i actually saw it vanish. no distant sounds, no smoke, and i had no proof of what i just witnessed.  how do you tell that story to someone that has just walked into the room?  i explained to him what had happened, and i'm sure i was frantic and quite animated, but i could tell, he didn't really know what to think.  i'm pretty sure he had a crush on me, and maybe partly that, and maybe i did sound crazy, but i didn't care, and i was glad when he left so i could wait for it to return.  my dad never liked him anyway.  and the u.F.O.  never came back.  i waited for sirens because somebody must have reported this.  nothing. i looked in the newspaper, and waited for radio to cover something.  nothing. \r\n\r\nfor days upon weeks after this event, i was waiting for it's return, like it was on some mission, with some message for me.  i actually felt a bit special that i got to see this.  then later, i remember i started to get a bit worried, maybe this whole thing wasn't a good thing.  maybe i was part of some sick science experiment, maybe it was a secret government thing.  i thought of everything and came up with nothing.  i continued to replay moment by moment, trying to rationalize it; i could not.  how was i so fortunate or unfortunate to witness this? i have always had a supportive family and good network of friends, and i am grateful that i was taken seriously each time i told this story.  i have often felt compassion for those people who too, have had similar experiences, only to share them, and not be believed.  how frustrating that must be.  at least i have had the peace knowing that people believe me and often i am encouraged by friends or family to share with others.        \r\n\r\nto this day, i have no proof other than my word, which stems only from what my eyes saw and how my brain rationalized it.  i am convinced that this object was watching me, and that it did not want to be seen by anyone else, or at least by my friend.  i still wonder about that night, and i still have questions.  why was it there?  why did it leave just at that moment?  why did it reveal itself to me, and only me?  i have spent more time than i can count wondering if anyone else in the city saw this u.F.O. that night, or any other night.  i have taken the time to look at some websites on this topic over the years, and have taken interest in related documentaries and articles, but the experience has not consumed me or impacted me negatively; i just feel fortunate, probably because i did not feel threatened.      \r\n\r\nas time goes by, the details and description of the object have faded, but how i felt will never fade.  the oxford dictionary definition of the word \"awe\" sums up how i felt in that moment; \"a feeling of reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder\".","distance":"21-100

500 feet away, about 50 feet in the air over a building.  at first i thought it was a flock of birds, and i said, that's interesting, what kind of birds would those be?  it seemed to be moving east in a slow flutter.  then it disappeared, like it folded back into the sky.  at this point, i said, well that's strange.  it then reappeared in a fat boomerang shape.  it seemed to be made up of multiple light gray, possibly reflective objects but working together, like a school of fish, or sequins on a purse or dress. it did seem to have a common background that was dark gray or black.  it was still fluttering, but it paused and hovered and moved backward, just slightly.  at this point, i have a bare tree in my way, but i am still walking, so i was past it quickly.  when i saw the shape again, it had changed, and it seemed to be a soft, billowy, upside down parachute shape, or the bottom of a puffy cloud or a puff of factory smoke. i almost convinced myself it was a deflated weather balloon, but there was no top to the shape, only a distinct bottom. the color of this object seemed to blend with the sky, i could only decipher a dark gray sitting in the bottom of the cloud/parachute. then the object changed again, and became almost transparent, as if the sun were reflecting on an invisible craft.  now there really is no overall shape that i can make out.  i saw a few smaller very rigid shapes, like flat prisms or solar panels, and they seemed to fold backwards into the object and then the whole object faded away. this all transpired in about 20 - 25 seconds.  at this point, another sparse tree is blocking my view.  i assumed the object would reappear, as it already had, so i said to myself, i will take a picture with my phone when i get to the other side of the tree, but it never appeared again. i looked for it for about 6 more minutes, but saw no sign of it.  the object made no sound during this encounter. \r\n\r\nthe other objects in the sky were two passenger planes flying east almost parallel to each other, but they were a miles away.  there was a helicopter about 10 miles east circling.  there is also a military base close by, and planes are frequently seen. a military cargo plane flew over a few minutes later.  additionally, a cv-22 osprey plane flew over a few minutes after the first military plane.  i do not know if it lingered in the vicinity, as i had to go back to work.\r\n\r\nof note, the building i believe the object was moving over, processes precious metals.

in my area from 1000 ft. to higher altitudes. this object had no  navigational lights. it passed silently over my head at an unknown altitude in a clear dark moonless sky. it made no sound, did not waver in it's luminosity which approximated the size and intensity of jupiter. it left no observable contrail and passed directly over my head. i watched it move in a straight line from it's first observed point to 40deg above horizon east. the object never changed its luminosity. total observed time 40 seconds. at that point i continued on my walk to west. do not believe it was an aircraft with landing lights on since in going to the east i would have observed a diminishing light intensity and the fact that there were no pulsating navigational lights or any other lights. no sound either, even the daily jet aircraft at altitude can be heard on the ground and seen with red - green nav lights with flashing strobe. my directions and position are correct since i used my iphone information as i was observing the object and recorded them accurately here.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

feria.\r\nrecuerdo y no podria olvidarlo esa noche tan buena no habia animalesya que no se oian ni los grillos solo el agua del rio guadalorce, ni siquiera una picada a nuestras cañas solo en medio de esa bonita noche se escuchaba el relinchar de un caballo que estaba atado a nuestra derecha y aquel animal solo queria estar junto a nosotros con lo cual no paraba de acercarse a nuestro lado y mi mujer lo espantaba para que nos dejara tranquilos.\r\nya que a mi me daban miedo los caballos.\r\na nuestra izquierda a la altura de la copa de un gran eucalipto que alli habia se encontraban tres luces muy grandes como el reflejo de algun planeta pero muy cerca de la tierra tanto que era de una gran magnitud.\r\neran de un color amarillo (color calido),cuya formacion era triangular con base paralela a nuestro horizonte.Alli estubieron perfectamente entre 1 hora inmoviles y 2.Cuando volvi a mirar esas extrañas luces cambiaron su formacion colocandose en linea vertical a nuestro horizonte, justo al ratillo el que estaba mas alto digamos el numero 3 empezo a moverse cada vez mas rapido y a subir en direccion a casiopea que justo se cruzo con un avion de pasajeros elde enmedio se iva

before around here.  it headed north, then wobbled in its path, and moved more towards the east.  there was a commercial aircraft (readily identifiable) directly above me heading north towards the local airport at the same time. the noise from the commercial aircraft made me think there might be military aircraft after the thing i was watching at first, because commercial airliners aren't normally so loud, but i couldn't see any aircraft besides the u.F.O. i was watching and the commercial aircraft, so i dismissed the noise as being that of the c.A. look... i've seen things like this around this area for the last 4 years or so, and i've reported it to you all twice now. i don't know what these things are, but i know this: it wasn't a known aircraft; it wasn't a meteor (which i've seen many of); it wasn't a satellite, or the iss. it literally looked like jupiter uprooted and headed towards canada. no flashing lights. no pulsing. just a single, steady light headed ne, much like
