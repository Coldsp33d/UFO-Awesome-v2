rural area between two small ga towns, the boywhile driving suddenly noticed a white glowing ovoid just above pine trees tohis left, pacing the car. a white beam from the object shone down through thetrees. he immediately sped faster, reaching 100 mph attempting to get away, butthe object continued to pace the car. the girl climbed into the rear seat andobserved the object through the side window. she estimated its size at about 20feet in length. no structure was visible within the glowing outline. no soundwas detected from the object at any time.They momentarily lost sight of it, then their car was bathed in white light fromabove. a moment later they again spotted the object about 300 feet behind themand 10 feet above the road, still pacing their speed. when the headlights of anoncoming auto became visible to them, they looked back to discover that theobject was gone. they reached home without further incident but remained intheir vehicle for many minutes to collect
