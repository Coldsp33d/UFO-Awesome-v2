they travelled quite unlikeanything that i have previously seen. could they have been reflections againstthe vapor in the night sky? possibly, but two of the objects moved in almostopposite directions toward each other. i dont think weather ballons can move asfast as what we saw.After these sightings and our conversation, we continued tolook into the sky for another 15 minutes, but we saw nothing else that wasunusual.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":834,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.6125095,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-122.3297708,"occurred":969680400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":969680400000,"summary":"9/22/00 seattle: sighting of 3 separate high altitude objects","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Seattle, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:6670"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Minneapolis","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":null,"detailedDescription":"During a power outage in the city, a woman went to the landing of her apartmentto see if other residences were affected. she observed a block-sized, dark ovalobject hovering over a building across the street. no sound was heard. manybright white lights rimmed the object. she attempted to hail neighbors but wasunsuccessful. when she looked back, the object was gone.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":833,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.9879154,"location":null,"logNumber":"951009-01","longitude":-93.2588061,"occurred":813294600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":813294600000,"summary":"Oval object hovering over roof in minneapolis.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:6671"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Newton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":null,"detailedDescription":"A prison employee off duty and deer hunting observed lights approaching slowlyuntil nearly overhead. he discerned an oval-shaped object with a silvery blueperimeter and dark underside. four white lights were spaced around theperimeter. fin-like protrusions on the bottom appeared to rotate. the object waseither silent or emitted a faint low hum. it continued on slowly, changeddirection and was soon lost from view.
