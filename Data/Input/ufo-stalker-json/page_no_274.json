many cars on i-15, in both directions.  i was headed toward valley of fire about 3 to 5 miles ahead. the sky was very dark, unable to see any stars, when i witnessed three lights ahead, hovering above i-15. there was one red blinking light on the top, one white\r\nsolid light approximate 40 feet below it, and the seemed to be another white light from right to left crossing the path around the other lights. ive lived in the las vegas area many years and have seen about everything, i figured it was a helicopter or some kind of electric or construction area. i could see nothing approaching the overhead light, just pitch black sky. then nearly  underneath the light i leaned forward on my steering wheel, and looked up, just as the red light flashed from above,  i saw the complete silhouette of a very large flying saucer. i was shocked, this was the last thing i was expecting to see. the red flash slowly dissipated over the round edge of the disc as i passed under it. i don't think anyone else on the i-15 passing under it realized what it was. i pulled into the valley of fire exit a few minutes later and looked back, nothing in the sky but stars and a few clouds with a clear view. i don't know why the sky was so black at the sighting.","distance":"21-100

close the room window during which i have to lift the window blinds to lock the window. while the blind was up, i noticed an elliptical, very bright white light through some tree branches in my front yard. i went outside the front door for a better look and to try to determine the location of the light and to listen for any noise that it  may have (there was no discernible sound). during this whole period from initial sighting, the light was stationary so i went back inside to get my binoculars for a better look. i could tell that the light was actually some distance away. as near as i could tell it seemed to be hovering over one of the two schools just down the road from our house (about 1000 ft). i braced my arm on one of our cars to steady the image in the binoculars and when i did this i could tell that on the left side of the very bright white light there was a small red light on also continuously. after approximately 3 minutes, the light began very slowly moving west away from my location (this was almost imperceptible). i continued watching for at least another 10 minutes when it disappeared behind a mountain which is a little over a mile from my viewpoint. there were no perceptible course changes during this 10 minutes transit.\r\n\r\nafter considering this for some time, i thought this may be a drone that someone was practicing night flying with but then i think the lights have to be strobe lights and not on continuously! plus it was fairly large to be a run of the mill hobby drone.\r\n\r\nthere were no aircraft flying in the vicinity during the time of this sighting but after about another 5 minutes, a small plane flew over with a course from north west to south and after another minute or so, a jet aircraft (type unknown) flew over with a course from south west to north east. no other air traffic before i went inside.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

taped it now 4 times on 4 different dates. jan 22nd, feb 10th, feb 15th and the other night on feb 26th. it's the same \"craft\" and approx in the same spot every time and at approx the same time. it fluctuates in brightness, pulsates and emits a really bright white light. on close up you can see an aura around it and what looks like a plasma field. it's spinning and emitting what looks like energy or light waves. i have all the videos i took up on my new youtube channel. https://www.Youtube.Com/channel/uchzo-heaf23i_0zajbf6tta i've been asking everyone i know. i've sent this to the news and to other ufo type channels on youtube yet nobody knows what this could be. i have not heard anything on it from any other sources. as long as it keeps coming back i will record it and post it on my channel. i've attached each original video as well. if you could too please submit this as 4 sightings, each sighting was on a different date, but definitely the same craft.

12 am and i couldn't sleep, so i was stargazing. there were a lot of planes around so i just relaxed and watched them. until about half an hour in, around 12:45 this chevron shaped ufo came over my neighbor's house and scared me. it was really low but it didn't affect anything. it didn't even make noise. it was silently trolling along around 15-20 mph from the south headed north. the sighting only lasted 30-45 seconds but it was enough for me to stay up until 3 wondering what the actual heck i had just witnessed. it scared me honestly, the way it just moved. it was about high enough for me to double the height of my neighbor's house and it would scrape along the roof, it was really close and it was terrifying. though now i wonder why i didn't take a picture, my ipod was like two feet away on the bed,guess i was too mesmerized. \r\n\r\nin short-\r\n-i was watching the sky out my window\r\n-saw the ufo when it came over my neighbor's house\r\n-it moved slowly in a straight
