as a tanker driver and had returned to our yard. it was apx 1:15 to 1:30 am. i parked my truck and began a post trip inspection. i then climbed up the ladder to the top of the tanker placing me apx 12 off the ground and my added height appx 18 feet in the air..I vented my tank. while on top of the tank i looked southwest and observed 2 very bright lights as if they were on a plane,i also observed marker lights on both sides...Red. i thought this odd as planes have red n green.I thought that was unusual as it was the wrong approach for a plane going to our municipal airport...The \"plane \"continued to get larger as it got closer...In about 4-5 minutes i observed coming at me a giant triangle/with the large top triangle and a smaller triangle under the top,each being appx 3 stories tall@ 15 feet a story..The ship began to pass me overhead at appx a 60 degree above me angle and about 4-500 feet above..The sky was very bright and clear,appx 35-38 degrees..The sky/moonlight lit the craft up very well. as the craft was passing overhead i began to count,1000/1001/1002... up to 1007.7-8 seconds...During this time i saw body panels that had been shaped to form the ships structure,i could see the panels were butted together in sections but not how..Meaning i couldnt see welds or rivits..Only large panels,the craft was a silver metalic associated with aluminum/stainless,the crafts color was weathered and staining in a downward lines on the entire body,there were no windows anywhere on the length of the craft,there were 3 solid red lights on the craft at front middle and rear, the giant front \"headlights\" were fixtures hanging down and facing foward.They reminded me of the large hollywood lights that shine upward into the sky..The ship had no sound of a motor/propulsion,as the craft was passing only the sound of wind being displaced, no exhaust/outlet could be seen on the rear..Just quite...I estimated the craft to be 300 yards long by 200 yards wide,extremly huge,...As the craft continued to the north by northeast in appx 5-7 seconds i heard helicopters, but the normal sound of rotar wash was only half sound.Very stealthy...Two cobra heli's came into view,both appeared to be banking to fall in behind the ship,not a sharp bank but a gradual bank, the choppers were totally black,no markings/no numbers/visible armament could be seen/rocket pod /the flying lights were on and flashing..The closest chopper to me also at a 60 degree angle was very close above me.I could see the instrument lights reflecting on his windows,orange and bright green..I could make out his white helmet...In disbelief at what i had just seen and now seeing the choppers it seemed surreal....I waved.....The pilot waved back.....I was in shock...I watched the craft n choppers go thru a local mountain pass,the crafts width as it passed thru the pass had a very narrow margin to get thru as it was so big.. later on in talking with law enforcement officers on duty the same night,they told me they had seen the ship also and were driving towards my location to get a better view,so their sighting was at a different viewpoint..But comments were made to me of how huge the craft was. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

by the campfire (not drinking) when one of my friends spotted a bright light coming from behind a boulder to the north of us. he jumped up to check it out but it had dissapeared. about 20min later around 12 he saw it again and we ran over to the boulder. hovering about 100 feet off the water just off the shore was a light that was about double the size and brightness of a car headlight. we know this because at first we thought it might be a car or flashlight because it was dark and foggy and we thought it might be on the road. that changed when we saw a car drive by which was significantly to the left, with much dimmer lights. since it was foggy it was difficult to make out the outline of the craft but we were able to clearly see where the light was being directed. the light was spotlighting the mountain and we could see the beam move as it was constantly redirected. the craft itself was completely silent and made strange hovering motions. basically it was able to move and stop with incredibly precise movement and almost no acceleration/deceleration. we watched it for about 5 min and then the light went out and we couldn't make anything out anymore. at this point,being quite overwhelmed but skeptical we started discussing what had just happened, proposing possible explanations. airplane was quickly ruled out due to the hovering, car was ruled out because we witnessed a car drive by to compare it to, our main thought was that it could be a helicopter, but that even seemed unlikely as there the movements were off and there was no sound. (there were tourism helicopters constantly in the area, and you can hear them from 4+ km away easily). as we were discussing, i spotted a light through the trees on the south end of the lake. because there was land and trees in the way we climbed on top of the boulder to make sure and there it was. we stayed there for about 20 min until we decided to get closer. we checked if anyone had a functioning cell phone but everyone's phone was dead (because camping). then we walked around the trees that were in our way and continued observing for the next 2 hours.The spotlight was still directed and moving across the mountains, but we started noticing some fainter, smaller lights on the craft that weren't super visible because of the fog. one was orange- red on the left side of the craft and there was other tiny greenish ones that appeared very sporadically between the orange and main white light. there was also a sporadically flashing red light above the other two,forming a triangle. suddenly, a smaller but very bright orange fiery light flew with incredible speed from the se side (across) of the lake towards the main craft and went out once it reached it. about 10min later a fireball ejected from the top of the craft and burned out as it arced over the craft. awhile after this happened the main super bright light flashed twice and went out. it was then replaced by a slightly dimmer but equally large orange light which started flashing in no particular pattern. at this point we were feeling brave enough that we took a headlight and flashed twice at it. the orange light flashed twice back. to make sure it wasn't chance we attempted again with a different amount of flashes which it once again repeated to us. the main light then switched back on and the spotlight was directed above us where it slowly scanned down in a flat beam of light towards where we were standing. as this happened we were so freaked out we were shaking and holding on to each other and even crouching as the light approached us. the spotlight was then shut off (not even scouting out the mountains) but the main light remained with no additional activity until we eventually got tired and left it still hovering (not moving anymore) in the sky. the only odd thing we noticed towards the end was that the light seemed to almost slip up the hillside towards the road, but it was a continuous trick of the eye because it never really moved although it seemed to be. i feel like this could have a possible explanation though due to the conditions (lack of visibility) and fatigue. still worth noting though. we left to go to bed around 2am.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":82391,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":52.475386,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-02272017-0018","longitude":-116.075578,"occurred":1440631800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1488213818000,"summary":"We saw a hovering light on a craft that was shining a spotlight on the mountainside which went out and reappeared on the other side of the lake. a much smaller fiery orange light flew across the lake going out once it had reached the other craft.","tags":["sound","triangle","lights","flash","disc"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1488232165870,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":null,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":20,"maxtempi":68,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":58,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":8,"mintempi":47,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":null,"snowfallm":null,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":null,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":20,"maxtempi":68,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":58,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":8,"mintempi":47,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":null,"snowfallm":null,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":550,"locationName":"Nordegg, Alberta","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:26135"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Hanalei","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hiking the kalalau trail on the napali coast -- the closest cities are princeville and hanalei on the island of kauai. we took many photos that day...This was the only one where this object appeared. there are no other digital photos (and we took about 5 in this series) where this object appears.

outside. as i walked down sidewalk, i noticed what i first thought was a clear plastic bag covered with water droplets laying on the ground about six feet from my home. after picking up my paper, i used the plastic sleeve from the newspaper as a glove and attempted to pick up the \"plastic bag\". however, upon closer observation; the \"plastic bag\" was actually found to be a mass of clear soap like bubbles about the size of a football. i attempted to pickup the bubbles to examine them, but was not able to separate any bubbles intact even though the bubbles felt far more durable than soap bubbles. my improvised glove did appear wet from the bubbles, but upon smelling it to see if it smelled like soap bubbles; i found no smell from the bubbles. i left the strange bubbles in my yard checking them hourly, and found that they remain in my yard for 4 hours before disapatting. about 2 hours after smelling the bubbles, i experienced severe chest pain and had to lay down for an hour before the pain subsided. i do not believe the bubbles drifted into my yard as there was no wind during the night and the bubbles felt too dense to float. i suspect that they dropped down from the sky somehow,as i do not suspect anyone dropping them in my yard during the night between 2230 and 0430 that morning. not claiming the bubbles were ufo related. however i find them very odd in characteristics and circumstances. i only file this report as i have had a couple dozen ufo sightings at this location in the last 9 years. however, my last sighting was 5 years ago.","distance":"20

like 2d and big the size of 2 school busses about 50 ft over head no noise except a rumble in the distance like a train faint and no trains are anywhere near this spot and a dark grey black cloud sat on the ufo or ufo 3/4 was covered by the dark cloud or the ufo sat in the cloud. every one who seen the ufos described as a diffrent color my son said orange my friend said white but we all said glowing or luminesent or reflective the one up close was not as reflective it was more light absorbing or omitting the light. it seemd to me that the first ufo came from where ever this ufo was headed

in broomfield, co.  as i stopped at the intersection of w. 11th, looking southward, i saw a strange object moving above the rooftops near the intersection of kohl st. and w. 10th avenue, a block away.  \r\n\r\nthe object was a solid and somewhat irregularly shaped teardrop that was horizontal and heading at an even level and speed towards the east. it was a gunmetal gray color.  the plumper part of the object was to the east and the sharper point to the west.  it was smooth, but on the east end, the shape had a slightly squared edge on the top rim. the bottom of it seemed flat.  i wondered if it were a drone, but it had no protruding parts, such as propellers or wings.  i am estimating that this object was about two feet long and two and a half feet at the widest point.\r\n\r\nthere was no traffic, so i turned east on w. 11th and kept looking at it as it arced northeast above the houses on the next street.  i turned down that street, but it flew beyond the street and disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nthe wind was pretty strong from the northwest at that time.  if it had been debris, i believe it would have tumbled and pirouetted in the sky, taking on irregular shapes.  instead, it remained in the same shape, and it moved in a completely even trajectory, at a steady altitude, and at a steady pace.  i do not believe this was debris caught in the wind.  i believe it was a craft moving at a steady velocity, with purpose, towards the east/northeast.  \r\n\r\nif it made any sound, i did not hear it because i was in the car and the windows were rolled up
