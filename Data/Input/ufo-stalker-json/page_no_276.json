don't think that aliens did this, but i am special because someone, or something gave me someone else's vessel, it could have been an alien's, but i don't know. i thought for a long time that this was normal, until i realized that nobody else can do this. i have special abilities that happen, and i don't know how. it just happens. i have no control over it. it happens very rarely, but please put this on tv, just please don't mention my heart, if you do, that is ok, and i understand. i am a normal kid except for my heart, and i also half brother who is two and a half times as old as me, but we think almost the exact same.\r\n\r\n     i was having fun at scout sunday and i was hot and i took off my boy scout hat and i tossed it like frisbee to by full brother, who was sitting criss-crossed and when it reached him, it hovered for a whole second before dropping right in his lap. this isn't the only time something has happened. also i have have teleported from one side of a bench to another. also, a smore's pizza appeared while i was staring out the restaurants window, recently, i have perfectly predicted the future this happens all the time, i have the force because i can close my eyes in a busy hallway and walk with ease without hitting anyone including myself, i am great at blending my voice into a crowd, i have someone else trying to take over my brain, it might be consience but this voice tries to get me into trouble, so i don't think so. maybe i'm paranormal? i have also moved objects before. i never lost sight of the object, but after it happens, nothing seems to make it special. no wings or anything to make it do that. it never happens to other people, and i'm the only person i know who can teleport. it happens once every year or two. i don't know how, and i have never seen a ufo personally. so you tell me. thanks.\r\njust please, don't use my name, nobody knows / truly understands that i can do all of this and that i have abilities.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path then

behind my house. i noticed a bright whiter light object hovering above the school parking lot lightd possibly further behind the parking lot over scattered homes and a wooded area lot.  the object appeared about 1,250 yard's away.  i stood on the deck and took the picture, the light was silent and made no sound, it was there longer than 40 minutes, i thought maybe it was a helicopter or plane coming toward me, giving the illusion of a stationary light, but it just stayed hovering for a long time, no change is size or dimension. however, when you enlarge the photo you can see a bright v shape uncharacteristic of a airplane or helicopter? only other thing it could of been is a stealth fighter with that v shape, but the v is the entire frontal length of the aircraft a stealth doesn't have a long v like that. if you enlarge th we picture the v appears to be the propulsion system with a saturn like ring around the objects middle with a do like top. and what appears to be an energy field or forcefield around the craft,possibly a potential cloaking device.\r\n\r\nafter careful review of the photograph i am convinced what i witnessed that night was either a us government project and that's ok, or a true alien space craft.\r\n\r\nyou can see a day photograph taken in the same place as the ufo photograph the night prior and can early see the parking lots lights of the school in

windows along the wall of my bedroom as i often do when i cant fall asleep. i was watching the stars, when i noticed one of them acting unnaturally. it was hovering above one of the nearby hills and at first i thought it was an airplane or a satellite. as i watched it, it proceeded to get dimmer and brighter, slowly flashing continuously. the coloring was different than that of a star; it wasn't white light but rather a reddish orange with a surrounding pinkish orange aura. it remained mostly stationary except for a slight bobbing motion as it moved up and down where it was and seemed to be rotating as it brightened and dimmed. it moved side to side a few times as well, but still hovered relatively in the same spot. as i watched it, it eventually started blinking a smaller red light and yellow light rhythmically as it appeared to rotate. i looked nearby along the hills to see if there was anything else unusual, and saw three white \"stars\" remaining stationary low along the tops of the hills as well. one was brighter than the two others but that was all i observed. i returned my attention to the main one that was flashing. when i stared at it continuously, everything except it

donut like sphere with a dark center; and sometimes two identical looking spheres but never more than two, began appearing due east of our home towards wimberely, texas which is 9 miles away. the first sighting occurred as i went to the back door (north side of the house), to make sure it was locked for the night at 10:00 pm, and thought i saw to the east what i usually see over the trees at a reasonably low altitude - a star, but this made me pause and look again because it emitted red and green pulses of light through a golden and white light signature. then it moved around, so i quickly called my wife to look at it also. it hovered and bop around for five to ten minutes, and then in my estimate slowly move in an arc path towards the se along ranch road 12 towards san marcos, texas which is approximately 35 miles away. once they begin to move away, and never at the same exact time, it is always slowly but at a constant rate of speed. my guess would be approximately 60 mph+.\r\n\r\nthe objects, when there are two of them, are identical in shape, size, coloration, motion, and behavior in the same directional view from our back porch. we see them appear out of nothing, and we see them after they have appeared above the trees at about 15-20 degrees above the horizon. they spin in two directions simultaneously (a wheel within a wheel,) as they jump and bop around within a reasonably confined area within our view. they go up and down but never in extreme ranges and do not land while we observe them. they pulse (emit) or flicker a few green (short and narrow) beams, longer red beams or rays of light, and they emit a wider beam of golden light in a 360 degree 3d pattern within a general white aura of light around the object. there are also harder to see black bicycle spoked lines around the outer edge of the sphere. my wife couldn't see the green light, but agrees with me on the other three dominate colors. pulsing is the best word to describe the light emissions, but to me the short green rays and slightly longer red beams stick out like steady fixed thorns or quills.\r\n\r\nas of february 23rd my wife has seen them seven times and i have seen them six times in the same area between 8:00 pm and 10:00 pm cst, with one exception. at 01:00 in mid february my wife saw one south west of the house with no information given as to height or distance or subsequent activity - she went back to bed.\r\n\r\nour response was one of interest and wonder to finally see with our own eyes what others have talked about our whole lives. this is our first sighting of anything unusual. my impression is that they are preprogrammed scouts or probes collecting data, but where they are appearing is only cattle country full of limestone rock with a few scattered homes. please note that we are moving away from this property within the next week to a location overseas, so our phone numbers will not be working then, but our emails should be working. we have planned this move for a year, so this was a nice gift of last minute luck for us. thank you for your great work in this area. the attached video was done with an apple phone. i hope you can

en 1979 en junio, desde que tenía 4 años de edad hasta mis 12 años aproximadamente he tenido pesadillas que eran recurrentes donde me lavnataba a media noche lllrnsdo desesperado y aterrado y mis padres tardaban horas en hacer que recuperará la calma, en mis pesadillas los actores cambiaban su forma según cada pesadilla, unas veces se les veía otras veces no, a veces con forma de robots, otras de monstruos. siempre me veía en una habitación sumamente oscura y frente a mí una gran pantalla luminosa como las pantallas led que hoy son comunes pero que en aquella época eran solo ficción, en esa pantalla aparecían varias secuencias de números que yo debía seguir o completar con mi mano sobre aquella pantalla presionando números aleatorios, esas entidades me obligaban a hacer esa secuencia solo que nunca hablaban pero yo sabía lo quqe querían, luego esa secuencia se hacía más y más rápida y cuando no podía seguir la secuencia ellos presionaban en mi mente para seguir haciéndolo y era cuando despertaba llorando y aterrorizado\r\n\r\nestás pesadillas pasaban más o menos cada mes o a veces duraban tres o cuatro meses sin suceder y dejaron de pasar más o menos desde que cumplí 12 años,lo curioso es un niño de 4 años o hasta 6 y 7 con pesadillas de números que eran parecidos a lo que se conoce como la secuencia fibonacci que cuando la descubríamos después  la asocie de inm disto con mis pesadillas.\r\n\r\notro dato curioso es que cuando tenía 24 años sufrí unas convulsiones por un problema familiar que me llevó a esa situación y el hecho que me desmayara me llevaron a hacer unos estudios médicos entre ellos un electro encefalograma y radiografías de mi cerebro y el doctor juan josé sánchez encontró justo en el centro de mi cerebro un extraño cuerpo del tamaño de un grano de arroz que era anómalo y extraño lo que el describió como un tumor, me pidió que justo un año después volviera hacer los estudios para ver si cambiaba de tamaño y al hacerlo no había cambiado su tamaño original por lo que el doctor dijo que no me preocupara por el\r\n\r\nsiempre he tenido la curiosidad por el tema ovni, una vez a mis trece años junto a mi mamá y una amiga de la casa vimos a lo lejos a las 5:30 ok un ovni en forma de cigarro que subía lentamente en el cielo a lo lejos y luego como si hubiese volteado o girado de vertical a horizontal se convirtió en un punto que desapareció, siempre he investigado el tema ufo ovni, y a veces siento que no encajo en la sociedad, tengo algunas premoniciones que se cumplen y con mi esposa actualmente hemos tenido experiencias extrasensoriales en unas tres ocasiones en 5 años de casados,en las que cosas que pienso ella las ha recibido.\r\n\r\nquisiera saber si esa experiencia q la cual nadie nunca me ha dado respuesta tenga algo que ver con el fenómeno ovni y sea producto de algún tipo de abducción ... muchas gracias amigos de mugon. espero pueda ayudarlos a en su busuqueda de la verdad...","distance":"N/A","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":82347,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4398945,"location":null,"logNumber":"VE-02252017-0005","longitude":2.1817947,"occurred":481342800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Catalunya","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

aproximadamente 5 metros de diâmetro,e não dava para ver o seu formato real, apenas as luzes girando sequencialmente atrás de um bambuzal.Não emitia nenhum som e nenhuma fumaça.Espantado, chamei minha esposa que estava deitada no quarto, mas quando pronunciei seu nome, o objeto simplesmente apagou as luzes imediatamente e desapareceu!,sem emitir nenhum tipo de som ou rastro de fumaça.A partir deste evento, tento buscar explicação para o fato ocorrido.Aproximadamente um ano antes do ocorrido, observei quase que diariamente(durante 1 semana aproximadamente), uma luz branca pequena(do tamanho de uma bola de futebol), intensa e de brilho constante ficava  dentro do bambuzal,que por acaso ou não, antecedeu o nascimento da minha primeira filha.Um ano antes do nascimento da minha segunda filha esta mesma luz,só que em tamanho menor(bola de golf), entrou pela fresta da porta exatamente no momento em que eu e minha esposa estávamos tendo relação sexual.A luz entrou, parou em cima de mim e
