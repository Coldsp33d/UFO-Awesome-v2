and watched with amazement.  i ran up the block and watched the craft as long as i could until it finally went out of site.  i asked people at the swap & shop if they had seen the saucer and no one had seen anything.  i couldn't understand why or how this could be, because it was about as big as the drive in itself.  the saucer was hovering over the drive-in for five minutes or so then moved on west slowly.  my thoughts were it was a blimp or something like that but it looked too real to be a blimp.  it was very real and i seem to be the only one who saw it.  now that is strange.  but true!

had no wings, was orb-shaped, and seemed to be rotating. it was stationary as the plane flew by. i decided to grab my phone from my pocket to snap a photo so that i had proof to show others. i managed to get the plane in the photo. while the ordeal was occurring, i was a bit scared that i would be abducted, but also intrigued at the fact that the technology must be far more advanced than ours. i decided to run into the house to grab my camera to take a video or at least a high-quality photo. when i had come out, the object had vanished. i never saw the object again.","distance":"Over One

my husband out because the light was moving and i wanted to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  we both agreed that the object was moving strangely so i went and got my camera out to video record it.  my son also came out to see the object.  he placed the camera where it would be stationary and you can clearly see side to side and up and down movement, hovering.  at one point which i did not catch on camera, the lights dimmed to a blur, then got bright again.\r\n\r\nwe did not hear any sounds coming from the object.  in fact, it was extremely quiet outside last night, much more than usual. we live in the country and normally you would be hearing a lot of insects and dogs.\r\n\r\nthe object was too far for even the camera to make out what it was. the object stayed in the

direction in a triangle shape. no noise. just moving lights in a somewhat slow pattern. but continuous. we watched for a good long time. it was too cold. we came back in. i went back outside. the guys followed. we saw a plane coming from a distance to the far right of the object. the triangle & lights continued as before until the plane got very close. then the triangle grew much bigger. after the plane appeared to pass through the location of the triangle then it went back down to the original size. all this time the lights kept going in the same motion without stopping. i joked & said we should call the police. well i did. i reported everything to the wichita county police since we are on the outskirts of iowa park. they asked a few detailed questions. they asked if i wanted an officer to come speak to me. i said no. it was getting late & was in my pajamas. the officer said he would send a police officer out to check it out. we noticed that it stayed in the same exact location for about 3 or 4 hours. that field is usually used for wheat crops. sometimes the local farmer will put his cattle there to graze. it was empty at the time. no cows. at one point  my son tried to use our camcorder  to film it but all we got was static. it wouldn't  come out on the camcorder. i tried to report this online shortly  after it happened  but i used some bogus ufo site.

league night when we noticed a white light shaped like a saucer hovering over mnt. charleston west of las vegas nv. when we turned the corner onto stewart ave we notice approximately 8 to 10 other cars pulled off the side of the road watching the same light. we pulled over and joined the others. everyone was excited and pumped. several wanted to exchange names and handshakes stating that we were experiencing something that may be a life changing or life long memory together. i immediately told the others in my group to stay with the other people on the side of the road while i drove back to my house to call nellis afb to report it. we didn't have cell phones in those days and i only lived approximately one mile away. when i got home and called the base, the operator at the base answered the phone saying :if you are calling about the ufo, we already know and are scrambling jets as we speak: i said thank you, hung up and returned to the others. when i got there, the light was still there at which time it had a baby white saucer slowly drop down from the large one attached by a beam of light as if it was tethering from the mother saucer. it descended down what looked to be maybe a hundred feet, then moved the same distance to the north and then again dropped down the same distance. all the time still connected to the light tether that remained in the same path it took to get where it was. at that time we heard the nellis jets roaring very loud as they took off in the direction to the ufo. at the jets were headed that way, the baby saucer very slowly followed the light beam tether back up to the mother or large saucer as if it was going into the bottom of it where it descended from. as the jets got where i would guess was 3/4 of the distance to the saucer, the light slowly dissipated. we all gave one another hugs on the side of the road, got in our vehicles respectfully and drove off. there was very little mention on the news the next day other than there was several reports of strange lights last evening over mount charleston. when i mentioned it to others they just blew it off by saying maybe it was the military doing red flag training or something. its been many year ago and i've always wanted to tell some one about it and there it is. my ex wife has since passed away, i've lost tough with my other friend that was with us and my sister lives in rhode island and i'm now in south texas. my sister remembers the incident very well and agreed that i should tell you my story. thanks for reading this and i like what yall do on hanger 1.   cheers

i would be ridiculed or dismissed by authorities.  i pointed out the object to my husband, who was driving the car, but his main focus was on watching the road in front of him.  he did not see the object ascend and descend over the other home.  i did, however, tell my sister about it, who thought by my description, that i had seen a ufo.  at the time of this siting, the public, to my knowledge, had never seen government aircraft that were shaped like this, and that could hover like this craft did.  i was within 500' of this object, but i did not hear any noise.  trying to justify what i saw,

was passing by a landmark (el último trole -\"the last trolley\") by the beach. next i was parked far away on the side of road #2; a busy main, 4 lane road . about 500 ft. above  me was a craft. it looked like a very large jumbo plane, without wings nor windows, white and self illuminated. it had a straight white beam touching the ground and did not illuminate anything around me. it was just compact ad straight down. it did not touch my car. don't know how long i was there. then the object went straight up without any noise in a second. it flew across the sky to the left. it was bright white and about the size of venus. it stopped when it met with another star-like object and the flew off in a second towards\r\nne, towards san juan, our capitol. they just disapeared.\r\n\r\n i don't remember getting back on the road. both my daughter and i were calm, as if in a daze. i turned right towards a road which is a shortcut to home. all of a sudden we saw a bright light light coming towards us. we both awoke from that daze and i started shaking so terribly that i could hardly keep my foot on the pedal. we both stared screaming and saying \"they've come back for us!\" we then noticed it was a plane. then calm returned and when we got home we went to bed and, strangely, did not talk about it for about a year later. it was as if it never happened and it had been wiped from our minds.\r\n\r\ni have had things happen since i was a little girl and through my adult life to the present. i have a scar on my right arm from an event when i was about 16 years old. i am a 77 year

cabins had no electricity or running water so we had to collect water from an outside tap and collect firewood and so on .Anyway it was around midnight when my ex partner went outside to bring in firewood for the morning from our supply when he came rushing back inside excitedly saying \"come here quickly ,you have to see this \"it was unlike him to act like this so i got up and followed him outside .He was looking straight upwards at the sky and i followed his gaze and at first i couldn't see what he was talking about .The night sky was beautiful to look at because carbeth has no street lights or city lights so the stars seem brighter but then he pointed and i focused and it was then i saw it or rather them .In amongst the twinkling stars there were a group of them moving in a co-ordinated fashion .I have tried to describe them to people over the years and the nearest description to the way they moved was like ,you know when you look through a kaleidescope and turn it ? ,well very similar to that .They were very high up in the sky and looked just like the surrounding stars except these were not stars .I have no idea what they were all i know is that i have never seen anything like it before or since ,it was as if they were putting on a display ! i'm guessing that because of how high up they were that they were quite far apart from each other but yet the really weird thing was that they were perfectly in time with each other .Like they all would stop and change direction at exactly the same time .It actually made the hairs on my neck stand up because i know we don't even have space craft that can do what these things were doing .To this day i'm baffled by it .We watched them for i don't know how long but until my neck got sore from looking up ,then eventually we went inside to go to bed but i couldn't sleep ,i couldn't stop thinking \" what was that ?\"i got up again around an hour later and looked outside again and after a few seconds i spotted them again ,in exactly the same place ! i will never forget what we saw that night .It has made me believe that some intelligence ,something that we don't yet understand exists out there .I saw it
