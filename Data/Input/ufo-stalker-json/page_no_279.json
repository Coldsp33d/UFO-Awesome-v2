silhouettes of bodies. i remember three in particular. one seemed just like us, only taller and wider shoulders, the others seemed like what we call \"greys\" and the last seemed weirder, \"insectoid-like\" beings. the only way i can explain this is that it felt the exact same as if when downloading an image on an internet browser, you select \"always open after download\". i felt completely safe and peaceful, as if i was being shown a family album filed with beings that i had never seen. \r\n\r\nupon finishing the meditation, i got up and went to my window, waiting to see if my attempt at establishing contact had received a reply. during this time i was wondering if all that i had seen was just the product of my imagination, inspiring itself on our expectations on how an alien would look like. \r\n\r\na few minutes had passed and i was looking at my right side, when suddenly i felt the same pressure on my forehead and an urge to look towards my left. to my surprise, hovering over the mountain behind my house, there were two white orbs. one pulsed, the other blinked. \r\n\r\ni stood there, completely stunned, frozen in place. my mind rushed through the possibilities. planes don't hover, helicopters make noise (and there was no noise at all), cars don't float and nothing that i know can hover, blink and pulse light and be the size of a golf ball at that distance. in all the years i've lived here, i've never seen any lights like that in that location or anywhere, for that matter. \r\n\r\ni was slowly reaching the conclusion that there was no other explanation and so, i thought - \"is it really you?\" - and instantly, the orbs started blinking/pulsing at a much faster rate. needless to say that when this happened, i simply stood there in awe over what i was witnessing. i do not want to reach conclusions but i would be lying if i didn't say that it felt that they had not just responded to my contact attempt but that also, they were giving me an answer to a question that i did not verbalize, but rather thought. \r\n\r\nas far as the orbs, they simply disappeared as inexplicably as they appeared. after they left, i believe that i stood in front of my window for another five minutes or more, trying to make sense of what had just happened.\r\n\r\nat no point during my meditation or visualization of the orbs did i ever feel threatened, afraid or did i see anything that would justify that i would feel that way.

road on that section between jerseytown and exchange. around the intersection of school house road,i noticed a bright ball in the sky to my right, high in the sky but level with the setting sun (one hour from sunset?) framed right if center in my windshield.  the sun was ahead and to my left. the object looked like it was reflecting the sunlight, it was very bright in the clear sky. \r\n\r\ni watched while i drove and finally pulled over at a state game land parking area, at the intersection of ants hill road, hoping to get a picture.  i was lower than the main road and trees were blocking the object, so no picture.  i got back on 44.  i lost the object briefly, not sure if it moved or my angle was bad, then it was visible again.  i was looking for a safe place to pull over, but it's all farm land with ditches on the side of the road. \r\n\r\nlost object again, road was turning more sw and object was, presumably, behind me.  pulled over at church next to public swimming pool in exchange, got out of vehicle.  couldn't see object.\r\n\r\nat the intersection of  rt. 44 and rt. 54, noticed multiple double exhaust trails in the sky to the se.  i turned right onto west 54.  pulled into the turbotville grocery store and got out again. i looked up and directly above me was a fighter plane giving off a double exhaust trail.  it was high up but i could make out the wings and shape.\r\n\r\nhad i originally seen this or another plane either head on or tail on so as to appear motionless?  or was this plane over the store investigating something unknown in the sky?  or was it merely a drone surveying farmland and i misjudged the distance?  i don't know what i saw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":82259,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1133493,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212017-0024","longitude":-76.68391009999999,"occurred":1487609100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1487709009000,"summary":"Stationary

slowly disappeared behind some clouds.\r\ni wish i could offer you more on my experience,but i'm not very educated.\r\ni can tell you,it wasn't far off,and it wasn't extremely high in the air.\r\ni lived at that time in a very very tiny community,like less than 900 people.\r\non the back of the house of the family i lived with at the time was a huge marsh and further up is a huge mountain,with a

the night of january 31, 2017, my fiance and i were home in bed talking when we heard an unfamiliar engine-like noise growing louder and louder as if on approach. the sound was not quite like a train, a plane, a helicoptor, or atv but all crossed my mind because the noise varied in its characteristics but always sounded like a motor. as the noise grew to something of a roar we simultaneously questioned what the heck it could be and looked toward the window. each of us saw 4 very large bright yellow lights - they were in a row, in the woods, about 120 feet from us. the lights were evenly spaced, spanning maybe 15 to 20 feet. i also think they were 10 to 20 feet off the ground. then, almost immediately the lights blinked off in sequence from our right to left.  we both assumed the lights were mounted on some kind of vehicle or craft but neither of us saw anything other than the lights.  as we contemplated what could possibly be out there in the woods (did a small plane come down?  should we call someone?), the noise recurred giving us another moment of pause before bright white or yellow lights rapidly flew by the bedroom windows about 20 feet away and 10 to 15 feet off the ground. each time, the sound preceded the lights and ceased when the lights disappeared. we only moved here in the past month and do not know our neighbors so we have not asked if they heard/saw anything odd that night.  i did have the opportunity to ask the nearby sheriff's office and the state police about it a few days later - both denied having had any calls/reports pertaining to the event.  interestingly, our 2 dogs, both always ready to bark, did not stir at all.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

flying near his house. naturally i was skeptical about his claim but i have known him for nearly 20 years and and in that time i have never known him to be a liar. he told me that these lights he has seen near his house where he has lived for the past five years always came across as headlights to a car. while hanging out by the fire pit one day he actually paid attention to these lights and saw that these lights move in ways that a car with headlights does not move. immediately assuming these were lights from an airplane, i asked him if he was sure they weren't airplanes.\r\nhe told me that airplanes do not move in this matter.\r\nsoon after this i ended up moving in with him, and within the first two days of being there i sat outside with him all night and (soberly) observed these lights.\r\ni have seen drones fly. i have seen helicopters and airplanes fly. i have never until then seen anything aside from an insect or humming bird fly in this manner. let alone a \"machine\" that lights up.\r\nthese are ufos.\r\ni began to tell some friends and family about this and they all just assumed that i lost my mind. when i told my girlfriend about it she even called me crazy, but she gave me a chance to show her and her kids.\r\nwhen they came we began to flash these lights with a couple of high powered flashlights and they flashed back the same sequence.\r\n\r\ni see these ufos in the same area every single night. these are real ufos. i am not crazy. i do not wear foil hats and go crazy on a bunch of government conspiracies. i have not included pictures of these lights because it only looks like headlights in the distance on a \"shaky hand\" recording. if you would like me to actually record this and send it to you, i will. \r\nbut without a quality camera with

slept underneath the stars. one night while lying on my back looking up at the  dusk sky i saw what i thought  at first was a satellite. it was the size and shape of a star it moved slowly and steadily across the sky. then i noticed another satellite just like it heading straight towards the first one.  it was as if these two satellites were playing chicken.  the first satellite then stopped on a dime when they were at an apparent distance of 1 inch  from each other  and then, after hovering for a moment,  it moved south east compared to where it was moving which was west or left  across the sky. the other satellite continue to move right across the sky with the same speed it had since i first spotted it.  i didn't know what to make of this. i couldn't explain it but it was very far away and i was tired so i didn't think about it. i can't remember if it was later that night or the next night but i woke up in the natural way people do to move and lie back down in a more comfortable position. i laid back down on my left side that is when i saw that the ground around me was glowing. the rocks ,the grass,  and nearby trees were all emitting light somehow.  it was like nothing i've ever seen before sense and in that moment the world seem to stop. the closest thing to it would be like someone shining a spotlight on the ground except there were no shadows and there was  no glare. the ground itself was illuminated.  then i looked up and saw it. a bright ball of light in the sky above me. as though it knew i had spotted it it immediately shrink back down to the size of a star. (or zoomed away i can't tell which)  and then traveled left just like one of those satellites at a steady pace until it passed beyond the horizon.  the strangest part of this experience was how calm i felt after seeing this i felt pleasant and optimistic at the fact that i know for sure ufos are a real phenomenon and i went back to sleep and didn't even think about it until three weeks later.
