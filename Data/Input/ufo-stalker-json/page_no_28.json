clouds crossing the sun. i was waiting for a mass of clouds to pass so that bright sun would return so i could take photos. i looked up to where the sun was behind the clouds. at that moment i noticed a vey fast moving aircraft. it was white colored and flying well above the cloud level. it appeared to resemble a concord jet but with sleeker wings and no tail, just a blended body. i saw it for 10 seconds at the most. i turned my camera back on but by that time it had flown behind the cloud bank. since it was flying very rapidly and in a straight line i got my camera ready to photograph it once it came by the other side. but it never appeared. i heard no noise and saw no contrails. it was traveling from southeast to northwest.Where i was is in the flight path for jets landing at orlando international airport which is appx 10 miles south of the sighting location. they are usually low enough where often you can make out the airline name or logo on the jet. i also see jet traffic flying over at higher altitudes. this unknown aircraft seemed to be flying higher than commercial jets. i did not notice any lighting or any markings or insigna. just a white colored aircraft. from my vantage point the size in the sky was very small, maybe aspirin size from an outstretched hand. afterwards i watched and scanned around for about 5 minutes and saw nothing. i have attached a rough

there have been so many lately. i saw one every night for 6 days straight. a weird thing i should mention; two hours before these sightings, two black hawk helicopters flew from north to south down the coast. my husband  says that if there are two, it means someone important is in one of them. when training they only use one. we are several hundred miles from nearest air force base. have heard lots of large jets around lately too. the photos i got of the large orb are tic tac shaped, just like the one in the disclosure video the air force got. they called it the tic tac and said they had been tracking them for two weeks before finally getting footage and visual sightings. perhaps these helicopters were tracking them?

of post oak lane in denton, tx. when there was a break in the houses to my left, i expect it was over the golf course, i soon noticed what appeared to be the moon, it was very large and somewhat ominous looking. i rolled down my window to get a better look as i passed. it was not a full moon, but maybe 80% or so. i recall seeing moon-like features to its surface. i can't explicitly say craters, i just remember it being so much like the moon that i accepted it as such and had no reason to doubt it. i had this weird sense, even though it wasn't clear, this moon gave off like a dreary/foggy vibe, and i began wondering \"what if the moon affects our emotions and we don't even realize it?\" and having imaginings of a werewolf transformation. which was odd, because in retrospect i was feeling unusually agitated at work that day and on the drive home. but i wrote it off and continued driving. then, less than 1/4 mile down the street, i noticed to the right, on the opposite side of the road, was a particularly mundane and typical looking moon. when i got home, i intended to climb onto the roof and see if i could see it, but it was too slick from rain and too dark to do that safely. after 5 minutes or less, i decided to drive back out and see if i could see it again, maybe get a video, although my phone was on its last leg. i drove back to the beginning of robinson, turned around to come back, and could not find the big moon again, despite going back multiple times. when i came closer to home, i noticed i could also no longer see the smaller, more mundane moon from my car from any vantage. a bit perplexed, i decided to go home, having been wondering if i was losing it the entire time. when i got back home, i was surprised to see that the excursion took 30 minutes, as that's on the longer end of time that it would normally take me to get home from work, and it did not seem like i was looking for these things for that long. as i recall, these objects, while both passable for the moon, were not identical. i do recall the color being similar if not the same, but the larger one seemed to be more eclipsed, and the surface details i recall being more vibrant/detailed than the smaller one. not only that, but only the larger one gave me an ominous feeling about it - almost like this thing coulda been in the thriller video.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

in the warehouse of the arcturian triangle ships they operate. there was a bad rain storm last night in my area that i live which is perfect cover for them, so they can slip in and out. i woke up feeling disconnected from reality and myself and even kind of scared, this has been going now ever since i was 5, i am 36 years old so do the math. arcturians are skinny \"gray=green aliens\" with \"cat eyes\" that are peaceful and they speak via telepathy they can mimic human voices, sometimes their voices are male, sometimes female. they probably came back to monitor to me to make sure that chip they placed in my ankle is working, since last january 2017 i had ankle surgery after a break, and they moved the chip from my shoulder to my ankle, and then moved it somewhere else. i do a tingling in my ankle from time to time.  i remember their triangle ships and all these lights and even seeing earth from the circular viewpoint of their ship. that's all i remember, if you want to

second floor of my house,my wife was laying on the bed watching tv and i was looking out the window,with my forearms on the window with my head sticking out i get a good view of the sky and just pryor to that i was watching a few videos on how to remote view and in a way i was trying to see if i could make some kind of contact now i'm not saying that because of remote viewing i had this experience but it could be a factor.Now as i was looking out my window for about 30 min out of nowhere a black triangle appeared right in front of me right above a tree we have in front and it's about the size of our roof if not smaller and this thing was right above that so it was close,at first my brain was trying to figure out if it was a blimp,plane idk anything but quickly realized it was none of those things..It made no noise it was so black i could just see the shape of the lights and the craft but no detail to it as if it was all one peice of material.The lights looked l shapped and they kind of over lapped each other..It had these lights on each corner of the craft..When it went directly above me they almost looked like x's and the light looked like no other light i've seen before i mean it was white but a white i've never seen before..It's not like the light we see when we turn on a light bulb..So as it hoovered over my house i leaned out as far as i could unroll i couldn't see it
