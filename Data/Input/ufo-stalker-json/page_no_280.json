had an encounter.\r\n\r\ni am currently working in ho chi minh city as an engineer and often walk home from work during the evening. i usually take different routes home depending on the time left i have for the day. on the evening of the 20/02/17 at around 7pm, i was walking on the riverside on hoang sa, heading towards east. listening to music and observing my surroundings, i usually like to look up at times to see what planets i can see. sometimes i use google's skymap to identify the planets. on this particular instances, i noticed an object transitioning between blue and red colour with a flight path downward towards the horizon. the transition was not constant either and varied. at first, the speed of the object looked like a normal plane. i know from my previous experiences this may not always be the case, so i locked my eyes on the object. i was also waiting for the white lights usually flashing off the wing tips of planes, however did not see any. then i noticed that the speed was not constant with minor accelerations here and there. i knew at this point that the object was certainly not a plane. i was really excited because it has been a long long time since i've seen anything, and of all places this particular incident is in ho chi minh. i observed the object heading towards the horizon or houses and trees. before it went out of view, the lights seems to decrease in intensity and disappeared. so i continued my walk home after a few seconds. the object then reappeared again around where i first saw it earlier and began a similar travel path as it did earlier. though this time the light seemed less intense. i lost sight of the object after it went behind houses and trees on my horizon.\r\n\r\naround a minute after my sighting i did see an object fly around the specific area, but it was just a plane.\r\n\r\ni did take two recordings on my phone, but i think my camera is too poor to capture the incident. only the light of the star was

very bright and strange light formations flashing and moving strangely about. i work for an airline and know the shapes and sizes of common man-made aircraft.This phenomenon was none that i had ever

the light formations were occurring in an up and down plane. there was a nearby street light that was in the foreground and was my point of reference during the entire filming event. my girlfriend

to keep the camera on the street light as a reference point with my right hand as i viewed the actual event with my own eyes. this is why on occasion that i didn't keep the main objects within the view finder of the camera.\r\n\r\ni remained astonished, joyful and thankful at my observations, as i have been enlightened to the ufo truth through the testimonies of the disclosure project of dr. steven greer and the subsequent testimonials that have occurred as a result of the movement. i had also become a big fan of hangar one which is obviously put out by mufon. i had even gone so far as to email  jan harzan from mufon a few years ago, asking him how i might help get the truth out to the general public. i had no idea that i would experience not one but two separate and distinct ufo events within a 6 month duration. you see, this is the first of two events of significant unidentified aerial phenomenon that i have experienced personally here in wichita over that time span.\r\n\r\nthe video speaks for itself. one other notation is that shortly after the incident began, my girlfriend and i walked outside into my back suburban yard and viewed the event unobstructed. my property sits adjacent to a public park where the ufo experience was taking place.\r\n\r\nalso, in the earliest portion of the video, you will see a green laser light shining in the sky near the streetlight. it remains unclear to me as to whether or not the laser is from a neighborhood person shooting the beam into the sky or is it a part of the ufo phenomenon itself? i am hoping that mufon can enhance my raw video footage and aid my in determining whether or not this is an extraterrestrial event or a military light show that had occured in my neighborhood. i did not report this to local authorities for the fear of local ridicule and also for the potential of government harassment. \r\n\r\ni look forward to your experts viewing my video, questioning my experience and together investigating what we witnessed.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend is willing to submit her own report to the incident, should mufon require her testimony. \r\n\r\ni am sincerely telling the truth as i personally experienced it.\r\n\r\ndr. tony andrew wilbeck  ","distance":"101-500

three lights in the sky close to the clouds i was photographing, two together and one by itself. i took two pictures using my cell phone that included these lights. on the second picture the lights to the left seem to have changed positions. i had heard that there were drones in the air getting information on the fire, so at first i discounted the lights as drones. however when i viewed the pics later and expanded the picture it seems like there are specific shapes to these lights. as you can see there are telephone lines and homes with cars passing by and i have included the screenshots with the details of each photograph. i was only able to stay in this position for about a minute,there was a truck behind me honking trying to leave the subdivision. when i got out on the main road and

when taking brake,when i see a falling star i all ways watch it till it burns out or no longer can see it.This one caught my attention when i saw a flash of a light and i stayed looking at that spot and about 5 seconds it happened again ,had my eye on it this time and yes it looked like a distant star moving across the stars -not going fast like some do-it didnt change direction stayed on one path, it just would get as bright as if i shined a flashlight standing 5 feet away from you right in your eyes(in the dark) then it would dim back down to were i could hardly see it.To me it had to have a lot of energy to make that burst of light that bright and with in second's it go's back to original light. i watched it for at least a minute traveling through the night sky pulsating bright every 4-5 seconds and until i couldnt see it anymore. my feeling when i saw it - not surprised - i've seen stars follow one another before and turning 90degree and if that's us/humans that high up, then we all in for a shock. who ever reads this when your telling friends or someone that you saw something, night or day and you can't explain it and they think your stupid,tell them take 30 minutes out of a month for 4 months,take the kids out in the country at night ,look up into the stars.Ask how stupid they feel when they get back!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
