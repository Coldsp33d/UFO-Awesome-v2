it was moving with us. there was no physical structure to it, as it appeared to be literally made of light. the light varied in color and was dynamic, not static. it was almost impossibly bright, like no other light source i've even seen, even though it was the middle of the day.\r\n\r\nit appeared about 30 feet in front of my car, and it seemed to be matching my speed. i was going about 40 mph at first, but i slowed down a little bit, not wanting to drive into it... but it seemed to slow down with me, remaining the same distance ahead of us. then i sped up a little,  and it did the same thing,

object #1 stay positioned in front of the cup. object #2, a yellowish-white pseudo-star, about +2 mag., moved eastward back through the cup, then curved southeast along ursa major until it reached the area of the real star alpha lin (lynx). the pseudo-star stopped there at 8:06 pm and remained stationary for almost ten minutes. i turned the telescope on the object, it was yellow-golden yellow, about +3.5 mag., but shining brightly compared to the stars in the immediate area. in the telescope i viewed a curved line of 7 stars. the object moved to three different positions along that line: it was close to alpha lyn but was not at it. once when the object dimmed i could see the dark, grayish outline of a craft through the telescope; most times it looked spherical though light often reflected to a more cylindrical shape. at 8:13pm the object dimmed out completely to the naked eye. at 8:14pm it brightened to about +2.5, moving southward along the line of stars in the telescope. i pointed my orange light at the object and it moved about 5 degrees toward me, then returned to its position. at 8:18 pm another plane flew within 20 degrees of the star-like object, and as the plane neared, the object \"elevated\" by 15 degrees to \"plane level.\" it came within a few degrees of the plane, then returned to its position at alpha lin at 8:22pm. this object #2 covered a total of about 40 degrees of the sky. at 8:45 pm i had to leave (without getting my astronomy done!). the final location of the object was still near alpha lin, approximately 30 degrees northwest of regulus, behind the head of leo. see attached star chart for simpler explanation.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":82183,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.674302180625084,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02192017-0006","longitude":-83.09191344283525,"occurred":1487445900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1487482584000,"summary":"Observed 4 white pseudo-stars moving around and watching aircraft in the area of ursa major.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1487500941862,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/82183_submitter_file1__2017218Obj229.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"48307","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Rochester Hills, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:28338"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A silver ball that looks orange on the pic i took.  snow melted under its flight path.  went slow.  you can see sun also reflecting on power pole support cables.  my son and grandson have seen them too over green lake in spicer about three miles away.  then it just disappeared.  saw a triangular craft as well but the pic i took of it vanished from the camera somehow...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":82182,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.739243,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02192017-0005","longitude":-94.6825498,"occurred":1422662400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1487481599000,"summary":"Silver ball reflected orange","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1487500041857,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-6,"maxtempi":21,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":-10,"meantempi":14,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-14,"mintempi":6,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-6,"maxtempi":21,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":-10,"meantempi":14,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-14,"mintempi":6,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":750,"locationName":"Minnesota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:28339"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Rochester Hills","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Went outside and was setting up astronomy binoculars on a tripod when i noticed over my head a white star-like object, about +2 magnitude, moving slowly southward from west of auriga, about 80 degrees elevated. it continued to move slowly southward, about 40 degrees until it was about parallel in the sky with rigel (in orion), and still high in the sky, ten degrees from zenith. it came to a stop, dimmed, then dimmed out all together for a few seconds. it appeared again, dim white, then it became orange, reversed direction and moved about ten degrees north (toward me).

get some air \r\n\r\ni often watch the planes blinking and can hear them. we are on the heathrow flight path i think. i am from new zealand and adore the night sky back home but on london not so much as it is so light polluted. last night was particularly clear and i could see some tiny stars. i felt like it was very still and something was different. hard to explain. more of a sense. i looked to my right and saw the brightest lights so i just sat and watched. i realised it wasn't moving at all. just sitting there. i could see what looked like six lights surrounding the outside and with nothing solid in the middle. i kept thinking it was moving further back and then back to the original position but i wasn't sure. it would look like a brihht ball and then the lights were distinctive. i asked my husband to come outside as i wanted to make sure i wasn't imagining it. i asked him to look and he immediately said oh my god that's so brihht and it looks like a bunch of the brightest stars. he kept asking me if i thought i was changing shape and i was relieved it wasn't just me. the planes were flying past and i realised that where the pkanes were meant the object was much higher than the planes. it made no noise. i decided to try and take some photos with my iphone. i took a couple and then zoomed in and realised that it might be something different to what i was seeing. my logical brain was telling me it was a weather balloon or a satellite but i couldn't quite believe it was as somehow i just knee it wasn't. the object moved to the right slowly slowly as i had to move along my balcony and lean out whereas when i first saw it i was seated but it didn't move quickly or even look like it was moving - more like it was just quietly sitting and hovering. \r\n\r\ni felt mesmerised and fascinated and for some reason extremely happy yet emotional. i cried like somehow it knew i was watching and i felt good about that. that makes me sound like a total crazy person and i assure you i'm not. i don't have a better camera so only have my iphone so did the best i could. when it mover further back it became more of a ball of brihht brihht light and then when it came closer i could see all the lights on the outside. \r\n\r\ni watched it until.Thr lights just suddenly went out and i watched for another ten or so minutes but it didn't come back. it was like it turned its lights off and just vanished. i have never seen anything like it in my life. i can't compare it to anything.

like a giant egg and was white, appeared to have a tail, and was glowing green all around it.  it was moving slower than a meteor or falling star - seemingly deliberately slower.  there are trees around that blocked my view once the object fell below a certain point, but it appeared that it could have been landing.  the shape, the size of it - it seemed quite large - and the color - plus the way it was moving - these things are what struck me the most.  i don't think i will ever forget it.  i wish i could have gone out and investigated; maybe i would have if i could have seen exactly where it appeared to land.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

horizontally away from the other star. way too slow to be a plane, and the glowing white light was a solid constant light, never flashed it just remained glowing. once it got a little ways away from the star, and very very slowly, it started to move upwards. it got a little ways up and then a cloud rolled over both it and the star. i couldn't see the star from the cloud coverage but i could still see the glow from the object through the cloud. the brightness faded slightly, and didn't move too far above the height of the other star before i had to go inside because i felt a bit
