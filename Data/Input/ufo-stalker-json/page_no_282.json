what i am reporting to you people happenned in 1979. i was a police officer patrolling my sector when i saw this bright red (same as a road flare) spheric object hoverring over a power plant. it was before sunset and many others saw this phenomena which was very visible for more than a minute. i pulled my police-cruiser on the shoulder to observe this and other vehicules did the same. as anticipated, i was asked what the object was by the people witnessing the same thing and i couldn't answer them. whatever it was, it didn't last long and disappeared out of sight leaving no trace at all. it was only a few days later i read in our local paper that an unidentified flying object had been reported and had been catalogued as a u.F.O. i never officially signaled this incident before to anyone but do still have in my possession a clipping of what i had read in the paper. i don't know if you will even acknowledge to what i am sending and i do request complete confidentiality. why i am reporting this to your organization is because of what you seem to be requesting of the public through your program. i am now retired and 62 years of age. i have donated a kidney in 2009, have sufferred a heart attack in 2011 and was operated for a skin cancer. my life funnel, like everyone else is narrowing and for whatever this information can be of value for you, i'll leave that up to you to decide. was this energizing itself over the power plant i have no idea.","distance":"101-500

shirt with 5 buttons missing and had socks on that were not my own also i only wear boxer shorts these were under pants that i had on. i also noticed a scab under my hair that was not there before and

elementary school at the time making some details fuzzy to remeber but together we've decided to come out about our story. as i was saying we were in our backyard when my younger brother pointed out a \"kite\" to me in the far distance skimming the tree tops. but as it got closer we realized it wasn't a kite. it was the most massive plane that we had ever seen in our entire lives. it was completely silent and flew very low. it was immense with two sets of black wings the set in the front appearing shorter and more stubby than the set at its rear. it slowly came from the northwest over a neighboring house and slowly inched over our heads and over atop our house we ran around the front of our house to watch it fade away into the southeast. from behind we could get a clear view of the lack of any steam leaving the plane and no type of writing or numbering on it either just black with some red detailing and a minuscule window in the very front. this plane like object was much slower and low flying than the average plane it kept a perfectly steady diagonal path going straight ahead of itself. the creepiest thing about the plane wasn't the lack of windows or how silent it was but the feeling it gave us. it made me feel like i had to run after it to see where it was going and i became so obsessed with it i drew images of it and i even got a family members involved who was a retired air force veteran, police officer, and fbi agent. finding out what the plane was consumed me even when i was so young. this same day we saw another plane. we had seen the first large black plane around 9-9:30 and the second one came about half an hour later. it was a bright white plan the same immense size and the same build but without the red detailing this time. it flew over from the east and once we caught glimpse of it; it made an abrupt turn to its right going into a tree line where we lost view of it for a matter of seconds and then it came back out continuing on its straight path from east to west. it was slightly faster than the one we had just seen prior and its movements were much more peculiar. it was the exact same plane though. the same silent sinister feeling. the same tiny window that looked laughable considering the size of the plane. the same thing happened again we went into our back yard and lost it over some trees and we've never had an experience such as that again. there was something just disturbing and off putting about the plane like objects we saw that day. they felt uncomfortable and wrong and just still to this day give me a bad taste in my mouth. i still feel drawn to them though and i feel disappointed that i still do not know what i saw. it's been almost 8 years now and the fact that i still feel squeamish and upset telling this story makes me wonder what were those planes for? who was flying them? were they intending to hurt us? and if so, why?","distance":"21-100

or stars, the air was still. i had driven around the corner to my grandparents house about 8 pm with my 5 year old son in the back set, as i turned in the driveway i just happened to look to my right, at about 500 yards away maybe 300 feet above the ground i seen a flash of white light going up, it was like standing in a dark hallway and a door of a lighted room had opened and shut. immediately after that from the same point was a uniform cascade of balls of light that fanned out as they went to the ground, and about 10 feet from the ground everything disappeared . the second light was different than the first, it had substance, as the balls went down they left a wake of light behind them like boats in the water, the wakes crossed over,  it was like one behind the other because they didn’t get messed up, they stayed uniform. i know exactly where it occurred, there is a patch of grass in the field where the soil is to shallow to till, close to the ground it lit up the patch. 30-31 days later just before sunrise going east with clear skies i was driving, and as i slowed down for a stop sign, i looked to my left and it was 18 inches from me, coming from behind horizontally but on a small scale/ size. i didn't see the initial flash of light this time, it was literally like a flash bulb, but the balls and pattern was the same.  my eyes were like a flash bulb had went off in my face. when i stopped, i got out to look at the vehicle, didn’t see anything on it and i had just crested a hill and nothing but open fields behind. both times it seemed like it was there because i looked. you never see a picture of an auto collision as it occurs, this seemed like it did. my first though was lightning, but then i realized lightning doesn't do that.\r\n  ","distance":"20 Feet or

riding around in my 4 wheel drive truck, conducting a bigfoot investigation. at about 0100 hours in the morning, we were parked in a camping area on the center grade (probably raulerson house camp). i was using my night-vision monocular, scanning the area for any movement when i saw an unidentified aircraft to my north moving in a west to east direction. i could not tell how far away it was, but it appeared to be over the north side of the swamp, possibly near the high tension power-lines that run through the area. i had not noticed any aircraft in that area previously, so i decided to watch it with my night-vision. as i was watching the craft move in an easterly direction, it came to a complete stop and hovered in place at an undetermined elevation. i could not make out any shape to the craft, other that it appeared as a ball of light. as i was scanning to the west of the craft, i observed another craft or ball of light approaching the first craft. it came to a stop and hovered a short distance from the first one. i then observed 3 or 4 more approach from the same direction, stop and hover at what appeared to be an equal distance from each other in a linear east to west formation. i believe that there were 5 or 6 crafts in total. they remained in this formation for 15 to 30 seconds, when suddenly the center light or craft descended out of my line of sight due to the tree line. the other lights then closed the gap made by the first descending light and while remaining in formation, descended one at a time from the center position, closing the gap made by the descending light. it appeared as if they were descending into the same spot below the tree line. i watched the area for a few minutes after they descended, but saw no further action from them. i gave the night-vision to my friend so that he could observe the area, and he stated that he could see a glowing light coming from that direction. i observed no further crafts or movement after the initial sighting. i initially felt that the lights could have been helicopters, but i doubt that they would remain in a linear formation and land in the sequence that they did. i got the impression that they were descending in the area of the power-lines, and i doubt that helicopters would risk a dangerous maneuver like that at one o'clock in the morning. i have not seen any further formations like the one in this report during subsequent investigations in that area.

north. i have lived here for years and i've never seen a light in that area before. at first i thought it was a construction site crane with a light at the top but the light was too wide,then i thought it was a tower but no towers are built overnight.I looked at my cable box and the clock said 6:09pm. i tried to make sense of this..No navigation lights,hovering,no noise so it wasn't a helicopter,it wasn't a plane,it was not flares! no blinking lights,no pulsating lights,no flashes,no nothing but just hanging there..A bright red oblong light in the sky!I kept my eyes glued to this thing cause i didn't want to miss if it made any sudden moves in any incredible fashion until it blinked out in front of my eyes!! my eyes widened and my heart started pounding..I ran into the living room to tell my mom who was watching tv..By the way the time on the cable box read 6:20pm! i'm still a little freaked out as i'm writing this..I keep looking out my window!     another point i want to make is that my building and window is in a departing and arriving flight path to laguardia airport and during my sighting there was air traffic in the general area of this thing and also in the path of a few departing flights! they must've seen this thing ..No doubt about it! can you guys inquire at the control tower at laguardia? i'm not going to do it..They'll think i'm nuts! i also called my sister upstate cause she had an experience with my niece and her friend here in the bronx about 15 years ago! i've had other strange sightings before but i felt compelled to write to you guys this time cause that sucker just blinked out in a millisecond in front of my damn eyes!I hope this report helps you in anyway and if you have any other questions just feel free to call my cell and let me know if you guys find out anything about laguardia and other witnesses...I would love to know!  p.S.- one more thing..I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but it was too dark and too far away to pick up anything!","distance":"Over One

up. weeks later doc referered me to consultant because i could not bend my finger.I was seen by a doc schofield.I was then subjected to four operations to transfer/graft tendon tissue from my left arm to affected/severd area of my finger.I was in hosp. for six weeks a time.This was 50 fifty years ago.St lawrence hospital,chepstow,at that time was a 8 eight-10 ten hour bus ride for my parents.My family were all from coal miners and very poor.On my last op. i was in denbyshire ward at the south edge.A nurse who looked after me was called suzy wingwong.When i asked other nurses what her name meant i was told that she alwayc calls the wrong number on the internal phones, ah so we calls her suzy wingwong cos she,s from china. suzy told me one night that it is going to be blue cold in the morning and to wear my bed socks.I had always walked around bare foot or slippers.Bed socks was for the posh boys.The wake-ups were always 6.Am,was,breakfast,go back to bed if you want.But me wearing my normal socks to bed was unusual.I remember waking up in the middle of the night and sort of asked to come out and see the blue cold.I remember opening the ( french style )cast iron doors after walking across the ward from my bed.I had my socks on and walked into the blue misty glow.I wasn't freightened.A man in a white all over cover,like a frogmans suit,only his face was naked and he looked oriental took me by the hand and said wow  arnt you cold you had beter get back in bed and go to sleep,i will shut the doors.I remember walking across the ward and diving into bed.6.Am came i was woken up by another nurse . we kids had to pull our blanketand sheet off before we went for a wash and breakfast.Well i remember the fuss when the nurse discovered my socks covered in grass and mud and a trail leading from the doors to me! the doors were found to be bolted shuttop and bottom and the lock was key locked. the caretaker,maintenance men and night shift was all called to explain how all this could have happened.Everyone had an excuse. they were all mortified.Then they asked me.So i told them the above in my way. doors were not changed,the windows 8ft up remained closed. i asked about suzy.I rememberfeeling so sad.She had been moved to another hospital.\r\nthat is the start of my contact.In\r\n1985 i had a tumble at work and was taken to a+e. they xrayed my left hand and said did you land on anything sharp or needle like i told them no it was a soft rubber belt about a yard wide and 20 yards long.So the doctor showed me the xray photo and examined me an said you have something inside you by your scars on your left index finger. i told him it was an accident when i was a kid. the doc. told me they didn't use foreign objects at that time because of infection and rejection by my body.There was no wound on my hand or puncture marks.I still remember this doc. walking away scratching his head.     this above would not be my only encounter with my friendly

tell this story i better show something. when you hear the car go by, that is how often i heard cars pass thru the night. not a ton of them. i watched this thing for seemed like an hour before i tried to get closer. i ended up driving closer with a better view: my hand is shaky at times had a hard time steadying it on the dash, but still the thing was always moving, never stayed still but seemed to gravitate to a center point: pass it by and come back moving top to bottom to right to left, but always thru a rough center point. my first thoughts were could be et but seemed more likely to be government because i had intentional disruptions that night and the following. both times they pulled up in cars with headlights on, right behind me. very unnerving when there were infinitely more other places to pull off the main road up there. the first night i pulled my eyes from the light and checked out my rearview to see if it was the park police or something. when i saw that no one was getting out of the car, i looked up and the light was gone. i think the outstanding thing about it was the kind of light it gave off. it was more like plasma or something, it was a more pure and intense light than you see on passing aircraft. i was ticked off at the car behind me and looped back to see who it was. it looked like radar from mash with his face buried in a map. the next night i came out to the park to see the sunset then stars, and didn't see a ufo type thing, but a car pulled up behind me in the middle of nowhere, and kept his lights turned out. and didnt leave, so i got out of my van, walked over to see 2 guys reading maps. they never looked up. but they got the picture and cut the lights when i started motioned a knife to the throat motion with my palm. another weird thing, i talked to the park rangers on duty at the gate both nights, and they acted like they never heard anyone ever report such things. but when i was looking up park info, hours and cost and such, i ran across this article about a lady who runs a retreat up there near the entrance, who said they see odd things in the sky all the time. that just fueled my desire to go skywatching, using my sky guide, until i had no phone communications ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

horizontally low in the westward sky which should have been without any lights as it is a large marsh area with no buildings for miles. i wasn't able to get the lights to focus well while trying to capture video with my iphone 7 so i tucked the dog into his bed on the floor between my bed and the glass doors. i opened the curtains just a few inches to see if the lights had moved but was distracted by a twinkling star high in the northwestern sky yet it felt a bit close to be a star. thinking it was a drone i took some close up photos on my iphone using hdr and the live feature which make tiny moving photos of hat makes sense. the resolution is amazing as most of the detail i captured was not visible with the naked eye. what i captured made me feel very uncomfortable and panicky as i took video and still photos of what looked like drones with lights hanging from large dark sheets of fabric or something very tall and wide. upon looking at my photos the sheets look more like metal extensions of something and there seem to be several of these units in the background of some of the photos. a hum and buzzing sound accompanied the apparent coming and going of little metal balls and boxes hat floated around low in he sky just across the street from me. i've heard this noise before almost constantly after retiring for bed in the early am most nights. the dog reacts when the humming gets louder or closer to our home. there was also a loud bang on our chimney which we have heard before a few times early in the am in recent weeks. it wasn't windy last night and there is little wildlife around us. also, i've been noticing  shadows on the balcony and what has seemed to be lights shining down from over our house over the last few weeks. i've actually got a few weeks of photos and videos taken recently that have yet to be evaluated however last night i took 72 stills and 4 videos on my iphone before finally turning my back to the glass doors (which  are covered with sheer curtains) and finally falling asleep around 3:45am. i felt afraid last night because some of whatever was floating around and blinking seemed to make moves closer to my home. with a clang on the house and the dog reacting all night i can't say i'm not contemplating getting something more than my pellet pistol to protect myself. from what, however, i can not seem to determine exactly but one of the photos shows something that resembles a helmet with dark visor and weird tentacles or arms with holes at their ends , like double barrels and also lights. this is awful to have to see and hear and i want to find assistance in evaluating this which occurs almost every night.

looking up like i always do at the sky.  it's 72 clear bluebird skies in sc in feb so we were enjoying the weather.  as i am looking up at the sky i see a jet liner coming out of the south heading north east.  just then an object the same color as the jet liner enters my view from strait over my head moving from sw to ne. it is egg shaped and the size of venus in the night sky.  the object was moving at what appeared to be a high rate speed.  it went from over head to out of sight (about 70 deg.) in 4-5 sec.  it caught me by surprised because i couldn't believe what i had just saw.  i actually called the ufo hotline within 30 seconds of this happening (google search on my cell phone) and the guy was very short with me and requested i submit a report here.  after i hung up i was looking up toward where the object had went and i saw what appeared to be the same object appear from the ne and back to the sw.  the object was moving slower this time and it actually stopped briefly and then quickly went off to the east and then suddenly vanished.  then about 1 minute later another object the same shape and size following what appeared the same path as the first approaching from the sw moving to the ne, but moving at what appeared to be a slower speed (70 deg.) in 7-8 sec.  that object went out of sight and i did not see anything else.  i even checked the wind to make sure i wasn't seeing something blowing with the wind but it was coming out of the east.  like i said the skies were clear and i definitely saw something i can't explain.
