in awe, others also were watching. \r\nto my right i started to hear an aeroplane coming which was now the only sound in the sky. the front of the triangle began to go higher out of my view, shortly

march 1986\r\n\r\ni am convinced i once saw an ufo, have never one since,\r\nand this is my account of this sighting.\r\n\r\none early spring day i walked up a hill on my way to salthill beach.\r\n\r\nit looked liked it could rain, even though there were patches of blue in the sky.\r\n\r\nas i examined the clouds, to judge if it would rain soon, \r\na cigar shaped object appeared in the sky between the roofs of a row of houses.\r\n\r\nas i continued walking the object moved in the sky relative to the position of the houses on the ground, due to the perspective. i made a stab at estimating it's distance.\r\n\r\nit hovered above the roof tops about one or two miles away, not moving.\r\nit's appearance and color made me think of a zeppelin. \r\n\r\nthen i continued walking and the object disappeared behind the roof of a house and some trees, because i moved and the perspective changed.\r\n\r\ni expected to see it again where it should have reappeared, \r\nbut it remained disappeared. \r\n\r\nthen i walked back to where i had seen the object last, because this was strange. a slow moving blimp should still have been in about the same position in the sky. \r\n\r\nbut the object was no longer there.\r\n\r\nall this happened within a few seconds. \r\n\r\nafter i reached the top of the hill i walked down to the beach promenade, i could see that there was a lot of activity in claude toft park, next to the beach, it looked like a festival was going on.\r\n\r\nat the seafront i had a clear view of the whole sky, \r\nand i asked people about having seen a blimp or if balloons had been launched for the festivities, but no one had seen anything. \r\n\r\ni ran into a friend, who owned a local amusement arcade, and i asked him what was going on, and he told me it was \"college week\". he also hadn't seen any unusual activities in the sky, although he looked at me in a funny way when i asked him.\r\n\r\nhorses were on show and riders did what they do best, they rode around in a small concourse that was set up. the sound of live music was in the air, or so it seems to me, college week came to a close on the 1st of march 1986. \r\n\r\nabout two weeks after this i saw a headline in a magazine at a newsstand: \"major ufo flap reported over irish coast and england\". \r\n\r\na large number of witnesses had seen ufo's and reported them.\r\n\r\ncorroborative evidence that ufo's were active around ireland at the time, i found 30 years later.\r\n\r\nmy particular sighting is not mentioned, but there were a number of reports. \r\n\r\namongst them is the prince charles ufo from 23. feb. 1986.\r\n\r\nby coincidence a local artist and archaeologist decided 7 years later! to create megalithic-like stone circles in the location where i had seen the ufo. he timed and aligned the circles with the impact of the comet shoemaker levy 9 on jupiter. the artist had not known about my ufo sighting.\r\n\r\ntwo weeks after the sighting i dreamed of a struck alien vessel performing an emergency landing. i perceived coordinates in latitude and longitude. when i checked those in 1986 it turned out to be at disko island in greenland. \r\n\r\nthis i followed up in 2016, and found on satellite images a shipwreck near those coordinates. this is at present going to be the destination of a expedition to the site in june 2016.\r\n\r\nwhat i found appears to be a conventional shipwreck, maybe norse in origin, or a whaler. so this ufo sighting from 1986 has some long-term effects.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

behind my house trying to film a music video. my friend and i both have been seeing these \"ufo's\" since 2012, we became obsessed with going out late night early mornings to observe the night sky and always encounter some sort of orbs or actual craft. we had been seeing them every night prier in clusters, on this night it was like every other night so it became normal for us to see them. it was as if they where spying on us. so we went down the street behind my house to a small wooded area to shoot a music video being independent musicians. as we got to the wooded are we had noticed a craft with multi color lights on the underside of the object that seemed to pulsate, we got big into studying anything to do with \"ufo's\" and or extraterrestrials and one thing we learned and actually performed was telepathically speaking to the craft, for instance we would say we see you move or come toward us and the would. anyways this night we were just about to start filming the music video but this one craft distracted us so we watch and did the telepathic communication saying come closer, it did and kept getting closer until it was almost over the top of us. we then heard what sound like movement in the grass. i told my friend its probably a deer but he responded it sounds like to feet moving not four witch i also heard but blew it off. the phone with the music on it stop working as well as the camera so we decided to give up. as my friend started walking out of the tree line i was fixated on the craft. next thing i hear what sounds like something lightly landing in the grass to the left as i turn and looked a approximately 4 foot pail grey entity with a large head and huge black eyes was staring directly into my eyes. it then made a hissing nose that i cannot describe. i was frozen my legs would not move i could not scream or blink. i eventually fell back by using every amount of strength in my legs and was able to get up and begin running out of the wooded area to catch up with my friend. he seen me running and i was able to yell at this point in which he started running with me. we got about 200 feet away from the tree line i was shaking and crying i hand to kneel down he asked what i saw i told him. he then told me he also heard the hissing sound as well before i was able to run out of the woods. ive dealt with paranormal experiences before, negative energy and positive but the feeling i had from this encounter was the most scary, threatening feeling i have ever felt. we then made it back to my house i was still shaking and crying, i could not even talk. it has dramatically changed my life. i want answers, what did i see? why did i see it? i dont know who to talk to the only person that believes me is my friend that was there when the encounter happened.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was taking a late-night walk along the shore in jax beach since the moon was bright, the air was crisp, and i needed to work out some pent up energy, listening to music as i usually did, walking southward toward the pier. i had already made my first trip down to the end of the line of condos and was on my way back. typically i didn't look around very much, due to many sharp shells, but i glanced over my right shoulder, and i saw what i first assumed to be a passenger plane coming in for a landing-- and suddenly panicked realizing it must be a crash landing, as there were, obviously, no strips around, (and i took my earbuds out in a panic). the craft even turned rather nose-up as a landing jet would do, but the more i stared at this...Thing, it became apparent that this was not, in fact, a passenger plane, and was extremely close, in the way it passed behind the 1st street condos. it may have been larger, and farther away, or smaller and much closer-- it's difficult to say, as the only features were the three red lights, all moving in perfect, consistent distance from each other. it continued on this path, rising slowly, still nose tilted up, several hundred, not more than a thousand feet past the pier before making a total u-turn- and a quick one, too, curving back downwards toward the ground. at this point i was absolutely certain it was nothing commercial, and it flew over the water, faster than it had over land (but certainly not \"fast\"- absolutely not more than 60mph), back north, i'd estimate no further than 200 feet further out into the ocean than the tip of the pier itself. it slowed down and came almost to a stop, very close to the surface of the waves. there was an faint white light on the waters surface below where i could only estimate the craft was, despite the lights on it being red. seemingly uneventful before it continued on back north and eventually disappeared into the distance.\r\n\r\nthe roar of the ocean there at the beach is incredible, such that you can hear it over music played at full volume in your ears, so the craft may or may not have made noise.\r\n\r\nthere were several other people on the beach at the same time as me, notably a young couple playing in the water almost up under the pier, and a group of three or four very lanky college-aged guys walking the opposite direction as myself. i do not recall anyone walking at all during this event, and afterwards nobody spoke to anyone, even people walking together. i was very upset by what i'd seen and was in a hurry to leave-- upset to the point one feels afraid to run, and began making my way back to the boardwalk connecting my street to the beach, and walking through the dunes passed a young woman who looked, as one might say, as if they'd seen a ghost. zombielike. i asked her if she was ok, if she saw what happened, and only got the faintest reaction. dunno if i hope more that she was drugged up or that she'd seen what i'd seen. no reaction from the men, either, but i didn't ask them-- at that point i hadn't yet worked up the nerve.\r\n\r\nwhen i arrived home i quickly asked my mother if she had heard or seen anything. she quickly wrote it off as recreational drones and glowing jellyfish, when pressed said it might have been a test plane/flight from the nearby base.\r\nas soon as i was done talking to her i nearly ran to my computer and started scouring facebook for any mentions, assuming someone would have immediately posted something, found nothing, then spent the rest of the night tossing and turning with anxiety.

stars to be visible. it originally caught my eye because it was the brightest visible object, next to saturn, in the sky at that time. the other reason it got my attention was the speed it was traveling. it was moving about as fast as you would expect an airliner to cross the sky but i saw no external lights i.E. anti collision lights, strobes, red and green wingtip positional lights... just a bright point of light. i first saw it northwest of my house heading southeast and went almost directly overhead so i saw it \"coming and going\" and the point of light never changed brightness like you would see on an aircraft if you were to see the nose (landing light), and as it passed, see the dimmer the tail light. it stayed the same level of brightness the entire duration of the event. from my perspective it passed about 10° to the east of orion's belt. i live approx 6 miles due east of jacksonville naval air station and see a lot of military aircraft and this was not an aircraft. i also was an army aviator, flying uh-1's and oh-58's (a and c models).I attempted to take a picture and video with my iphone 4s but the distance and size of the point of light wouldn't allow my phone

and longitude.  there are two witnesses including myself:both professional and credible, one an engineer with academics us air force academy (engineering) and washington (seattle), the other from univ of california. taken with cell phone.  first pics are above a house of one witness an hour prior to event.  weird clouds so we decided to take some pics.  we then went to store, and on return an hour later noticed the weird clouds, now from a marina 5 miles away.  stopped to take more pictures, as now two short and weird colored rainbows were a part of the scenarios.  one is easily visible in the pics.  started taking pics and within a 2 second window the clouds open up (cloak lost?), and you see what we saw...One witness almost fainted.  took her breath away.  in person you could see that object was huge, and that pics might only be seeing the bottom half of this \"pyramid on a side with sharp edges, but you could see relief and contours (vents, windows, appendages, etc.).  was about 5 miles away, seemed like 5 miles wide by 8 miles long, the visible part, and there are no mountains even close to this area like that.  also note on a separate visual, friends , who i saw and talked with a couple of days after event, saw it from underneath, and witnessed two concentric full circle rainbows with same weird colors as the vertical ones we witnesses. we watched for 15 minutes...It soon became cloaked again 20 minutes later but we did not see that actually occur.  the initial pictures are from within a mile an hour before...The last ones are from the marina 5 miles away.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface, Louvres,

in the air with my children when we noticed 100s of birds (seagulls specifically) flying southwest and remarked on how odd it was. after a couple hundred flew past, a large number of them begin circling in the southwest sky. as the birds dispersed and continued their path southwest, a golf ball sized very bright white object appeared very slowly from the south and held position. it rose and fell in elevation very slightly and with the naked eye appeared blueish white. \r\n3. as a result of the prior days 3-way lunar event with the comet, snow moon,and eclipse, i thought it was still the comet visible. but as it moved, there was no tail like a comet and its progression was not steady as a comet's.\r\n4. when observed through a telescope, the object could be seen to be a white orb, with what appeared to be a white ring around it which constantly spun around the craft. also when viewed with the telescope, white, red, and blue light could be seen being emitted from the object. very subtly it moved north in the sky, then back south, before finally north again. \r\n5. at first, doubt, i could not believe what i was seeing. then humbled to know despite many attempts at cover ups, the truth it out there and it might just be as curious about us as we are about it. it left me wanting to know/understand more.\r\n6. i observed this behavior for six hours with it mostly remaining still. around 2300 hours that night i went out to check again and it was gone.\r\n\r\n12 feb 2017\r\n1. outside intentionally looking for the object which appeared in the sky around 1645 hours, quite close to its arrival time the previous day.\r\n2. the birds were once more circling in the southwest sky, this time, while the object was present, then (the birds) dispersed to the southwest.\r\n3. as the result of a website attempting to explain it away as a us navy launched test missile, i considered the possibility that may have been true.\r\n4. much as the day before, it was hovering and emitting the same color lights.\r\n5. determination, i really want to know what this object is. \r\n6. at around 1800 hours, the object entered a cloud structure and when the cloud blew past, the object was gone.\r\n\r\n13 feb 2017\r\n~no sighting~\r\n\r\n14 feb 2017\r\n~no sighting~\r\n\r\n15 feb 2017\r\n1. while driving as a family to the grocery store, the object was spotted by my wife, which was then observed by myself and children as well. tonight it was situated in the southwest sky, centered above a radio tower off of florida avenue/ california state highway 74.\r\n2. it was the only light in that section of the sky.\r\n3. an unidentified flying object of foreign origin which was not constructed by humans.\r\n4. while mostly stationary, the object descended what seemed like inches to the naked eye. a white glow surrounded the object. and then the object returned to just being the brightest thing in the sky, no longer pulsating or emitting irregularly.\r\n5. i feel like it knows it is being watched, just as i feel it is watching us. i just wish i knew why and could get a solid answer.\r\n6. currently, the time is 2004, and it is in the sky as i write this report.\r\n\r\nmisc: during any time the object was present, i was able to take pictures with my cell phone, but i was not able to send them to anyone as i was trying to share and get peoples' eyes in the sky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"06:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional
