States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving home from a nearby food store about 9:35 pm on thursday february 2nd, 2017 and noticed two larger than usual lights low in the sky to my right about 1/2 mile from my house. i was driving north on a side-street intersecting mine. when looking west, between trees and housetops, i could see the strangely discernible globe shaped headlights of what otherwise seemed must be a very close commercial airliner. curiously, the usual forward flare was not apparent in each light as with plane landing lights. i saw two small round white globes of light about about a finger's distance apart if held at arms length. depending on the landing patterns being used by st. louis airport six miles away, i often see low (about one to two-thousand foot) commercial aircraft coming from the west to turn around to the west to land, i'm southeast of the airport. this craft seemed much lower and much closer than usual. it was never above the trees nor the two story single homes of my neighborhood. i could only see the lights between houses and usually through the winter trees, sometimes in empty sky. myself traveling north, i then turned west onto my one-way street for the two block drive to my house.</br></br>\r\n\r\nabout 1/2 way down my street, the lights had become larger and further apart and lower and now almost directly in front of me looking down the street. at the end of my street is a large city cemetery, several city blocks in size, with interspersed trees. when almost directly in front of me the lights \"stopped\" moving diagonally from the southwest to northeast and seemed to come directly towards me. the lights had seemed stopped but were getting larger and lower still and so i'd guessed the craft had changed direction and was heading towards me.</br></br>\r\n\r\ni was now very slowly driving just a few houses from mine, staring at how bright and big the lights were, with a strange flickering to them. in hindsight, i suspect that it was the shadows through the trees that caused the flicking i saw in the light, which were between us as the craft was moving. yet, the lights were distinctly two large globes with very bright light with a very wide flaring from them.\r\nthe lights then started to very slowly ascend and dim in size and brightness. the left side light then quickly \"tilted\" up so to at least a sixty degree angle from the other. i was now stopped in front of my house to turn into my driveway, a small red light then appeared between the two lights which were now much less in size and brightness, yet still equidistant, and apparently now just above the trees as the flickering of the lights had stopped. it then quicly flew to the northwest \"banking\" away to my right.  from a very slow ascent, it had then immediately flew about the rate of a fighter jet banking in an airshow, quickly going out of sight while staying in the same \"tilted\" position.</br></br>\r\n\r\nin the associated hybrid image, the picture is simply a \"likeness\". it's created from a picture i took a frew minutes after the event, and used gimp software to paint in the lights. the globes of the lights were about the depicted relative size, but the flaring i saw was much brighter and wider, the software i used was not able to depict the level i thought i saw. if it wasn't for what i perceived as a flicking in the lights, i wouldn't have thought by how it appeared that there was anything between the lights and myself, they were so bright. i had to squint my eyes to continue to look at it. they were behind two winter trees, a small one just before the cemetery fence, and a three-times  larger one about forty yards straight behind.</br></br>\r\n\r\nwhen the lights had slowly ascended from that image depicted position, it appeared to also slowly move backwards as well as the lights slowly dimming. when it was just above the larger tree, the flickering had then stopped, that's when the left light stayed equidistant but quickly raised to a sixty degree angle above the other. it then started to move quickly away, a small red light then appeared and it accelerated and banked away at sixy degrees towards the airport until it was out of sight behind trees and houses.</br></br>\r\n\r\nat the image moment, i was crawling to a stop just in front of my house (the barrel mine, the white fence my next door neighbor's), it was a bit intense for me. i remember telling myself, \"i just think i'm seeing this, this can't be happening.\" that's when it was just essentially that low but appeared to be moving closer at that low level judging by the globe areas of lights getting further apart and bigger. that's also when i had to squint to continue looking at it, it was intensely bright. no cars went by on the cross street, nor did a car come up behind me while i was on my street. a yellow helicopter did fly by, traveling north to south at most one-hundred feet over the cross-street, just before i got to my house, obviously between the lights and i.</br></br>\r\n\r\nonce it was out of sight, i drove into my driveway and got my groceries out of the trunk. when picking them up i noticed i'd started to uncontrollably tremble. i'd realized i couldn't deny i'd seen something unconventional, and more so, that it seemed \"targeted\" towards me. it seemed it was some sort of craft over the cemetery. it seemed that what it was doing, that it had me \"in mind\".</br></br>\r\n\r\nin 2009 and 2010, especially that fall, i made a number of reports to mufon, many from around my home as this one. i've not had any reports since until this obvious one, where this experience is making me wonder about the future.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path

lights in the sky. they didn't make any noise, wasn't moving just hovering there, and had no other lights but the red orange solid color. they appeared to be far apart but in a pattern or line i suppose. one was at the top, then another was under it maybe 20-40 ft apart, and the last one was at the very bottom, 20-40 ft apart also. but they weren't in a straight line... the middle one was out farther right then the rest and the top and very bottom ones were lined up perfect. they lasted no longer than 4 seconds and then they just disappeared. i didn't take my eyes off of them, i blinked and they were all gone. i looked farther into the distance and seen two airplanes but their lights were so far off into the distance there was no way they were what i had just seen. plus, their lights

about vibrations first it was like watching water on speakers then it became more a feeling then a dream. it felt like it was getting stronger or closer. it got my heartrate upand woke me up. i had heart problems so it didnt really alarm me. but once awake could hear it in my mind feel it through my body. yet i heard nothing. i felt like iwas being summoned. i sat up on my knees to look out my second story windows when light so bright and blinding that it want like light at all it was like energy. i felt so connected to it and would have ran out the house after it parents at the time be damed. but i didn't. apparently i passed out. because when i awoke i was tucked into my bed tightly. something my parents never did. it was like the bed was made up around me. my hands where laid one one the other over my heart and my feet crossed with my toes intertwined. part of me felt like i should be scared but i didnt. i felt happy for the first time in a long time. i felt renewed and focued in a way i had sense i was much younger. i crawed out the bed long before the alarm for school went off. \r\n i bathed and went on about getting ready for school. i didnt think about the light or what happened i just seemed to be almost floating with hope and purpose. \r\n  as i went out the walkway to the driveway i notised tree branches broken some on the ground some hanging from the trees. i wondered what happend. the closer i got to it the pulsing inside me came back. i could hear the buss comming so i took off to catch it. when i got home people were there looking at the trees and the ground and the security power pole that held a light. our farm was 516ac. this area was between the house and the barn. the first circle i saw was burned into the ground. all the grass was dead in these three circles one around 21 ft with straight bars deviding it in three sections. the others were slightly smaller but left the exact same burn patterns. i asked my guarden mom what was going on. she asked if i had anything to do with it. i said absolutly not. people were taking soil samples measuring the marks and taking pictures. mom pointed out that the light that was bolted to the pole was turned all the way around to the other side. making that whole area dark at night. a man in a suit asked me if i saw or heard anything. i said no becauae mom gave me that look that said dont speak. i was sent into the house and shortly my guardian father arrived and ran the people off. a artical was wrote in the lincoln times news paper about it possibly being a ufo. my parents refused to allow anyone else on the property and we were told not to speak about it. because it didnt happen. his words didnt change the fact that for the next 20 years it still didnt grow grass. my guarden father is dead now and his wife still owns the property. my husband and i maintain it for her. to this day i have never spoke of my account of what happened. the event changed me and i dont belive for a moment its been the only time.  i have physic abilities and have for as long as i can remember. i am a spiritual leader and ordained minister. i was suposed to be a lawyer or doctor and merry someone from the upper sections of life. i chose a differnt path. a life of sacrifice and devotion to the opening and awaking of human minds and connection to their soul within. i know this path is a direct result of my connection to other beings and other worlds. i started remembering past lives and seeing energy and even amplfied other ablites i already had. i stared seeing plant and animal energies and feeling a heartbeat connected to earth. i remember in the early 80s while living on the streets in tampa fla seeing and going through something similure.  i would love to talk with someone about these events. i hope to recieve a email back. thank u for reading","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned
