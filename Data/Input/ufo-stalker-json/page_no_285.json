noticed that light there before. so i grabbed the binoculars and could not believe what i was seeing! it was bright. it had colours. it has designs. first it was just hovering and still. after a bit, it start rotating over and over. i seen what looked to be windows;tons of them. way more than what i seen in pictures. i showed both my kids what i was seeing so they could witness what i was seeing. i don't have a camera so i didn't take a pic. even if i had taken a pic though, i bet it just would have looked like a bright light cause seeing what we seen through the binoculars was so different from what we seen with our bare eyes. eventually the ufo began to descend down. below the ufo was the university. this university sits on burnaby mountain.The ufo appeared to land to the right of the red light that is on that mountain located there. that was the end of that. the whole episode lasted for approximately 20 minutes. it was awesome. my adrenaline lasted all

go up on the roof of our house and you will get better reception. i went outside and climbed up the ladder and got on the rooftop . as i set there listening i looked up slightly and saw something coming toward me a little to the left of me in the sky. it kept moving toward me and i saw the round shape and dome of it and it had pulsating lights of different colors around the bottom. i thought, what in the world and then i realized what i was seeing. it came to a complete stop and just set there above the houses. i actually pinched my self and thought this is real. at the same time i heard voices of a man on the ground talking to someone in a plane on the scanner. the person on the ground asked the person in the plane if he had seen anything strange up there and the guy in the plane said, i sure have and it just passed right in front of me and i'm landing this plane now. the ufo then started moving straight back in the direction it came from. what shocked me also about it was that a sound never came from it. i was very shook up and climbed back off of the rooftop and went in the house. i didn't tell my family until the last few years because i didn't think they would believe me. i don't know why but i looked in the paper the next day and there was a small article that said that the sheriffs dept. had received about 500 phone calls reporting a ufo being seen. i didn't call because i didn't figure they would believe me and also thought, what can they do about it.

aircraft. \r\nhere is my story and what i witnessed.\r\ni am a truck driver, i was on my way from san bernardino ca to las vegas nv. it was around 11 pm on thursday, february 9th, at that time i was in between baker and primm california heading north on i-15. after some time i had noticed that there wasn't any traffic heading south on i-15 for at least 5 minutes. i just figured that there must be an accident on the other side but a few minutes later as i was cresting a hill here comes the highway patrol with all their lights on driving somewhere between 80-100mph with the military in tow. they were all escorting a single flatbed trailer with an incredible somewhat triangular shaped ufo like vehicle on the trailer. it was much wider than the trailer and had 3 sets of landing gear in which it stood upon. it was also covered in a shrink-wrap like material. it had markings on it but none looked familiar (no american flag or numbers that i could see). the color of the material it was covered in was light grey,dark grey and black. i desperately tried to get my phone out of the car dock to try and get a picture but wasn't fast enough. behind the truck carrying the object was more military vehicles and then about a half mile or so behind them were more state troopers keeping traffic back. i've seen many different ufo pictures and this object was close to being similar to the tr-3 but it's edges were much more rounded and wider. i really wish i could have gotten a picture of it, but then again i'd probably have the military or some men in black paying me a visit.","distance":"101-500
