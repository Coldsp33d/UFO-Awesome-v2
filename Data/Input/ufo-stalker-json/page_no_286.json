(i later realized it was not coming from the direction of the orlando airport but more from the direction of cape canaveral now cape kennedy.)  we both sat down to draw pictures of what we saw while it was still fresh in our mind as we did not have a camera with us.  our pictures do not exactly match but they are similar.  i would really like to know why no one else saw this. it was monday night football and my husband was watching tv but there had to be someone outside that evening in a city the size of longwood or orlando.  and this thing was way too big and too low to miss.  my sister and i are not special in any way, we are not physic, we were not contacted by aliens or abducted, but we are also not crazy and we both know what we saw.  many years later i saw a tv show about something similar being seen in the hudson valley, ny in 1982 and 1983.  another tv show interviewed a woman in texas who reported the exact same thing.  and the phoenix lights in 1997 were very much the same.  again, neither my sister or myself want to be on tv - we just want to know what we saw.  and most of all i would like to speak to some other people who have seen the same thing we did.  i was 35 when this happened.  i am 70 now, and obviously am not giving up until i get some answers.  it is quite clear to me that this was a ufo and we are being visited.  so will you please have a field investigator contact me.  i would really appreciate being able to tell this to someone who would believe me.  i am fortunate enough to have many close friends but the few i have told just don't care to talk about it which tells me they either don't believe me or this sort of thing just isn't important to them.  how could this \"not\" be the most important thing that has ever happened to mankind.!!!

she was wimpering.  again, i thought she had to go to the bathroom, so i took her outside in the back yard.  she immediately ran around the pool four (4) times, without ever stopping to go to the bathroom, and then stopped in the middle of my yard.  facing the field behind my backyard, the dog stopped.  all of a sudden, a bright light appeared at the end of this field.  it was perfectly round and was about the size of a house.  the light was hovering slightly above the trees.  there was no origination point - either above, below, left or right - to this light.  the light tiled downward and, at that point, the light appeared to be oval shaped.  the edges of the light were defined, with no shadows or extending light from it.  there were no noises or sounds.  as a matter of fact, everything was unusually still and very dark that evening.  i was frozen and mesmerized by this light source.  my dog was also frozen - she did not move.  the light lasted approximately 7 seconds and then disappeared quickly.  as soon as the light disappeared, my dog ran to the front of the fence facing the front yard/street, and began growling.  she growled four (4) separate times and then stopped.  i immediately called for her and we went into the house.  when i came inside i checked the clock.  it was 2:24 am.  i looked out the front window to see if i could see anything or to justify why she was growling.  i did not see anything, but i did not go outside in the front yard.  honestly, i was scared at that point.  when i awoke the next morning, my left forearm felt sore.  i brought my dog downstairs and then looked at my arm.  it was bleeding, swollen and red.  the area that was swollen was about the size of a golf ball.  within this swollen area were four \"bite marks.\"  the four (4) red \"bite marks\" were positioned to look like a smile.  above this \"smile\" is one additional \"bite mark\" which is located above and in the center of the four (4) marks.  the swelling is down and the redness is gone.  however, as of 2/12/17, there is still one red \"bite mark\" on my arm.  the spot still itches and is slightly raised. (see attached pictures)  it feels like something is under this spot. when i awoke from sleeping, i realized i had fallen into a deep sleep.  while it appeared as though i slept for a very short time, i felt as though i was completely rested.  one final thought. . .Everything during this event occurred in fours.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

thought maybe she heard someone in front of the house or sometimes we have deer that cross through our development.   from inside the house, i looked out a front window.  i saw a huge bright round light.  the light was extremely bright similar to an led light, but the light was yellow in nature.  the light had defined edges, no overspray of light.  i walked outside onto my front porch to see if i could get a better view.  there were no sounds or noises.  i walked back into the house and watched from the front window.   after a few seconds, a beam of light stretched from the round light to the road.  this beam of light was the width of a car.  it originated from the bright round light and stretched to the road.  i could see the light on the road.  the beam of light lasted a couple of seconds and then it retracted back to the bright round light and then both lights disappeared immediately.  the entire sighting lasted approximately 8 seconds.  i tried to justify that it was maybe a plane with a search light.  but there was no sound of motors or anything.  i wiped it out of my mind, until i witnessed another light on january 7, 2017.  now, i am convinced there is something to these experiences.\r\n","distance":"101-500

would guess that it was about three to four feet in length. \r\n\r\nthe object had the appearance of molten lava. it was not tremendously bright but it was bright enough that i could see it perfectly.

north hollywood. i noticed a bright light to the left of the moon, about 45 degrees above the horizon to my right.  it was too large to be a star or a planet from our view from earth. it was a bright pink solid ball with a fuzzy violet light orb around it. i stared at this object for about 2 minutes as i was driving up the highway. in a split second, this object got extremely bright and brilliant like nothing i've ever seen before, and then blinked out. it was so fast, and that's when i began to think it wasn't human because it seems almost impossible for something to go as bright as it did and disappear in a blink of an eye. after it disappeared i could see the outline of the orb for a minute as i was blinking because it was so bright. it almost looked like the object was still there, just more faint, but i knew it wasn't there anymore. i've always believed in aliens and know many people who have talked about separate accounts of \"alien\" encounters. predominantly stories of the \"orange orb in triangular pattern\" ufo and \"high speed, blinding  aircrafts\" that are hypnotizing. i had never heard of anything like this, but i also know los angeles is one of the alien capitals

weather was clear and mild. i was at home alone at about 2:00 pm, sitting in the living room watching the news on tv. in front of the sofa where i was sitting is a 4-foot by 4-foot coffee table. \r\n\r\n\ti was looking across the room at the tv. suddenly, about 15 degrees to the right and about 4 inches above my line of sight, a small movement occurred in the air directly above the coffee table. i reflexively turned my eyes and head toward the movement.\r\n\r\n\ton first sight, i thought i was looking at a moth or butterfly, with iridescent, pale, blue-green wings closed together in the up position forming a flat, vertical plane. the blue-green plane then divided into two halves that rotated downward in a 180 degree arc, forming a perfect sphere slightly bigger than a golf ball. \r\n\r\n\tthe orb hovered motionless, making no sound that was audible to me, but the irregular pale, blue-green color swirled slowly over its surface. i stared at it intently studying it, trying to see if it was some sort of exotic, flying insect, but there was no insect body present, just the beautiful, translucent orb.  \r\n\r\n\ti thought i would slowly rise, lean forward and catch the thing between cupped hands. at the moment i made the slightest movement toward it, the orb quickly rose about five inches straight up, and resumed hovering for a moment. when i made another slight movement toward it, the orb accelerated horizontally toward me, passing about 5\" directly over my head. it moved faster than my reflexes could react.  i turned my head and shoulders as fast as possible, to follow it with my eyes, but it had disappeared.   \r\n\r\n\ti searched the entire room very carefully to see if anything foreign were there. nothing was found. my wife is a meticulous housekeeper, cleaning the living room every week without fail. since that time, she or i have cleaned every inch of it, including tops of furniture, under furniture, in crevices of upholstered furniture, between the windows and plantation shutters, inside lamp shades, behind pictures on walls, everywhere. no trace of any flying insect or a ball of any kind has turned up. \r\n\r\n        it did appear to have mass, but it could have easily been a ball of some form of energy. either way, it was an object of some sort.\r\n \r\n\ti am former military, and practicing attorney for many years. i am experienced at making calm, analytical observations and recording them accurately. i was wide awake, calm, not at all afraid, but was intensely curious. if called to do so, i would take an oath to the truthfulness of my statements written above.\r\n\t\t\t\tcharles e. payne\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

that's staring you right in the face... truly a blessed day that i'll never forget. so ill cut to the chase, last night after a nice time with the family of some netflix and chill time my farther was preparing to head out to my grandfathers well with it being a nice evening for a change we had the front and back screen doors open to get some fresh air, well as my farther was getting ready to head out my mother and i noticed a-lot of commotion outside with the animals, my neighbors cows & horses were annoying and acting as if their were being spooked or knowing something bad was coming and just as my mom and i were seeing my dad off the coyotes were screaming up a storm which was weird for the timing and all during the same time frame we were having issues with our phones, network and other electronic devices acting up with a couple flickers of the electricity as my dad was heading to the garage door to take off, a that moment my dog sassy was giving me a couple of yelps so i naturally took her out to do her business and at that moment when i stepped outside i felt most uneasy the air was clearly statically charged and with a weird musk to the air as if a big spring time thunderstorm was going to occur, it also gave me that eerie feeling like ive been working in the sun for a long period of time, so as i get sassy inside my phone prompts me of a motion detection at the back door so i rushed to the garage door to see what the detection was and to my surprise ive witnessed something that will forever make me see this world in a different light, as a man of science i believe it is only fair to show you what i witnessed i hope this shared knowledge will help some bright minds out their one day solve life's greatest mysteries, never forget knowledge is power.

i noticed on my left, parked on side road running parralel to highway 400, what appeared to be a ufo being transported on back of flatbed of semi. to the left of the parked semi, was a highway patrolman parked right next to semi facing highway 400. around the object, on the ground were orange cones as if it was a construction site. i then turned around and headed west bound to get anotger view just to see if what i thought i seen was true. it appeared to be perfect disc shape and appeared to be so big in size that it was hanging on side of flatbed. i then turned around once again heading east bound again but this time took pictures. this was approximately at 1130 hours cst. i then went to work trying to process what i had just seen. at approximately 2200 hours, i came back the same way to see if the objectbwas still there. it was, however this time it is dark and tge semi lights were on as if they were about to leave. also, now there are 2 highway patrolman and there was also a bright flashing light right on side of the object. to someone who has not seen this in daytime, will not be able to see at night because the light was so bright, it made it impossible to see the object at night as if they were hiding something. i started to investigate what i seen and there has been only 2 other reports of this incident. 1 report is supposedly a video from a year ago. since there were only one legit reporting, they are saying this could be a hoax. it is not. i seen it. which is why i am sending this. i would like to please know more about this incident if any other reports were made. attached photos will include 4 photos taken heading eastbound. all photos are sent as they were taken. you will need to zoom in. also attached, yoyou will find a couple screen shots of the other reporting.","distance":"21-100

county. the sidewalk we were on goes do a hill past and elementary school on the right and open field to the left. at the bottom of the hill is a culvert the flows to the field. going over the culvert there is a small rise and the beginning of a housing area. the housing area starts on the right side and within 100 yards or so, the field on the left becomes housing. it was in this transition area that we felt a vibration like a deep bass, but no actual sound. i looked up and to the left and saw a diamond shaped aircraft with red lights at each corner and a larger round blue light in the middle. i grabbed my friends shoulder and yelled \"jim look, a ufo!\". when he looked up and saw it we both ran to hide in the bushes by the housing on the right side of the road. the craft was now slowly moving to the east, maybe 30 feet off the ground. when we could not longer see it we started walking on our normal jogging route, trying to convince ourselves that we had not really seen what

sphere was shinny as well. it looked as if you had taken a exersize ball and wrapped it with aluminium foil, completely seamless with no ridges or lines. the sphere hovered several feet above power lines for approximately 10 seconds. as i reached for my i-phone to attempt to take a photo, it took off so fast, i couldn't even tell which direction it went. i had gotten a strange one with the world
