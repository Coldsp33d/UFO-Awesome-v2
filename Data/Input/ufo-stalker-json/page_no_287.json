 was this godly?  was this an angel?  was this alien contact of some kind?  was it going to speak?  was this a probe?  was there a message?  clearly it was going to have to grow a lot more if i was expected to take a ride.  and also came the question why me?   what was the message here?  it came and went with no residue and no visible sign that it had ever been there.  i will say that i felt at peace the entire time.  i did not feel threatened.  i did not feel that it was going to harm me in any way.  i just don't understand why it 'presented' itself to me at all.  i am not fanatical about religion, but am broad in my religious experience and acceptance of other beliefs and am myself a christian.  i am not a scientist, but am usually fairly logical and seek to find an explanation of this object.  maybe it was just a probe to see if i was open to the idea of future contact?   if this was contact, they did a poor job, for i am left with no message.  however, i think they are back and i get the feeling their intentions may involve more interaction than before.  the unknown can be a little unnerving and i am trying not to be fearful. i can only hope that i am able to report back with a positive experience if they intend more interaction - for this last visit on feb 9, 2017 was with a much larger object.

experimenting with the focus by backing it out and causing the image to expand.  in the past this has proven to be useful in seeing some detail which normally are not visible.  this was true in mufon case # 66979 in which i was able to see the moons of jupiter after some image enhancement.\r\n\r\ni did not have an opportunity to download the images to my computer until six days later.  while looking at three of the images, i noticed that there was some type of craft in the images.  all told, \r\ni took seven images but the other four did not show the craft.  so, i just happened to catch the craft as they were crossing the field of view of the image.  interestingly, one can see a halo effect around the object, potentially resulting from a strong field.  in image #1, the dark spot near 7 o’clock is enhanced in the four image 1 edits.  also, one can see a white craft off of the face of venus near 1 o’clock.\r\n\r\nimage #2 was taken 7 seconds later and one can see that the white craft from image #1 had crossed around to the right of the planet and is visible outside the rim of venus.  there appear to be three other craft inside the rim of the planet.  one is near 1 o’clock, another is not too far from the center of the image, and yet another is at 3 o’clock.\r\n\r\nimage #3 was taken 31 seconds later from image #2.  the object is located at 3 o’clock.  this craft is much larger (or closer to the camera) than the three in the previous image—being 4 times larger.\r\n\r\nbetween the three images of venus above, i have identified 7 different craft.  \r\n•\ttwo are visible in the first image.  \r\n•\tin the second image one assumes that the white craft outside of the planet is the same as the one in the first image, plus there are three new ones.  \r\n•\tin the third image there is a craft that is four times larger.\r\n\r\nsince there is no way to know the distance to these objects, calculating their size is not available.  the reason that i was out that evening was to photograph venus because of the sighting that two friends of mine had of a craft (or several craft) over venus on monday evening of that same week.  there is a very big difference in what was observed however.  that sighting (mufon case # 81920) had craft that were rapidly morphing, multi-colored, and visible to the naked eye.  there is also a very real possibility that the craft in that case was covering up the real planet venus. \r\n\r\nthe only reason that i saw craft in these photos is that i blew up the image using the change in focus, and then further enlarged the images on the computer.  i saw nothing particularly interesting as i snapped the photos.  the other significant difference is that my friends were very amazed at the brightness of what they took to be a planet.  the planet venus that i was shooting with my camera did not look especially different from any other time that i have seen the planet.\r\n\r\nthere are three colors to the craft observed.  image #1 has a small black sphere in the southern area of venus that initially drew me to investigate it.  on further editing the image i became aware of the white craft above venus.  there are also craft that are somewhat translucent in images #2 and #3.  both the black craft and the translucent craft appear to have a field of some kind of field surrounding the spheres because it creates a perfectly round “halo” effect surrounding them.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

that shone kind of like a star, but it was huge. the stars were out and were the size of peas. this light was 10 times that. maybe bigger. it made no noise. it had all these rays coming out of it. white. and looked like lasers or lightning coming out of it. it woukd shine really bright. change shape into something long, then go back to a round circle. i watched it for an hour and a half. my family saw it too. it eventually started to descend and was gone.\r\ni knew it wasn't a plane. at first i thought it was one of those chinese lanterns but they burn out after a few minutes. as i have used those before. then i thought maybe it was a light from a tower. but when it started moving i knew it wasn't. plus it would have been lower in the sky if it was a tower. \r\nthe craziest part was how it seemed to morph closer with all those rays getting bigger then retreat. at one point i got really scared and ran in the house. \r\nthen it was just gone from my sight. \r\ni took a video but it just looks like a round ball. but i got a shot of the moon so you can see the size comparison. although the stars were out, none of them were picked up on my phone camera. i did do a very short time lapse video. and you can see the object jump up and down when you go through the frames. if it was from me moving my phone then woukdnt any movement be side to side ?\r\neither way, when the pictures are magnified they look different. \r\ni didn't get any sleep that night. \r\ndo you have any idea what this could have been ?","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in the back of the truck unloading my girlfriend noticed a bright white orb like light coming our way. as i was throwing the garbage out of the truck my girlfriend seemed very frightened and was abnormally yelling at me to look because of how close it was coming. i yelled at her to grab my phone so i can take some footage of the light. it came so close that it hovered above the tree line just asif it was watching us. it was very bright and just hovering there silently. my girlfriend was so frightened that she was begging me to jump in the truck and take off because she didnt like the feeling she had. i mentioned to her that it could be a remote control drone and that there was nothing to fear. i stood there laughing and made a joke saying that whoever was flying the drone must of been laughing at us because of how dumb we looked just staring at it. after about 5 minutes my girlfriend noticed all these red and orange , orange/red, green, blue,  orbs surrounding us in the sky. they all hovered above us and seemed to be getting closer. at this point we knew for a fact this was no remote control drone because we were seeing something unimaginable. my girlfriend panicked and wanted to take off as fast as possible. she was so scared she was begging and crying that we needed to leave. she ran and jumped in the front seat of the truck (she has no license) lol and was about to take off. i had to run and pull her out and tell her its ok and that i wanted to get some footage. i calmed her down and the red orbs hovered off. the big white orb remained and we video taped it for a while and it eventually faded off into the distance. one of the red orbs came close to the white orb and hovered around for a bit. i have video of the white orb as well as a red orb near it. we actually followed the red orb with the truck and watched it a few miles down the road until it just vanished. i have never believed in ufos until this night and have no stopped looking up sightings since. i have been thinking about this event since it happened and cant wait until i get another experience like this one. i have lots of footage but i dont want to send you the other videos because of all the swearing and myself getting mad at the girlfriend for wanting to leave. i also have two pictures of the orbs.","distance":"21-100

 let’s get out of here”, and i remember driving fast towards a curve in the road ahead.  i also kept thinking, “i have to remember this, i have to remember this…”.\r\n\r\nstrangely, we didn’t discuss it at all and drove straight to the hospital in yellowknife.  however when we got there the carload that left after us had already arrived.  there is only one road and they hadn’t passed us so they wondered where we had been.  i remember standing under a wall clock and wondering how that could possibly be the time as it was much later than it should have been.\r\n\r\nseveral years later, my husband and i were visiting rm and her husband in edmonton and i asked if she remembered when we’d seen that ufo.  she responded with a flat “no” and went on talking about something else.\r\n\r\nmany years after that, my husband, three daughters, and i visited rose mary and her family in inuvik.  i’d told my children about the ufo sighting, but told them not to mention it as rm had no memory of it.  we’d barely settled in for our visit when our youngest daughter asked about it and again rose mary responded with a flat “no”.\r\n\r\non april 17, 2003 i was hypnotized in grande prairie in an attempt to gain information concerning the lost time.  i had a 90 minute session which was taped.\r\n\r\nunder hypnosis i recalled being taken into the craft along with my two friends and all of us being subjected to physical examinations.  they used a plate-like instrument to go over our chests and a pen-type instrument on our abdomens.  i also remember something being inserted into the inside of my right eye socket.  when asked about it, i responded that i’d been tagged.  the hypnotist asked what it made me think of and i said camera.  (interestingly, for years after that time, i’d close my eyes and then open them and pretend that my best friend in ontario could see everything i was doing.)\r\n\r\nduring the abduction experience, i was constantly being reassured that we wouldn’t be hurt and that it would be over soon.  i was the second person to be examined and i also remember feeling angry and indignant at being treated like lab specimens.  when the examinations were finished, we were told that we wouldn’t remember anything and i remember thinking, “you’re not going to tell me that i won’t remember anything.  i will remember”.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home i tried to listen to the tape of the session, but i could only make out the odd word.  it sounded as if it had been recorded on a very fast speed.  i talked to the hypnotist and she assured me that the tape recorder worked fine before i came and it worked fine after my session.  about 8 months later i again tried to listen to the tape, but it was even faster than before and no words could be distinguished at all.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

the stars started moving slowly. i thought it was weird so i called my roomate outside to see what she thought. we both watched as the star like object moved in one direction toward the clouds. it was bright enough to see the object stop and hover in one position for a few minutes, then come back out of the clouds in the same way it came in. after watching the object for about five more minutes it just disappeared. it didnt blink or have any red, green or white lights like a airplane and it did not move like a air plane. it was definitely weird.
