(the field is at least 500 ft on the road side)  i stopped, my daughter turned off the music and i got out and stood next to my vehicle door.  my daughter moved into my seat so she could see better too.  (and kept telling me that maybe i should get back into the vehicle!)   as it approached i did start to become very nervous but the massive size just kept us staring up.  it passed overhead and seemed to literally be passing over the electrical power poles with no more than ft between the lines and the craft.  and, it was slow as slow gets.  i have never seen an airborne object ( maybe a dust ball or paper airplane might be slow)  fly that slow and be that huge!!  it also made no sound that we could hear.   it was silent from our view and that was directly beneath it,\r\nit also had a dome shaped cockpit(?) underneath in the center of the craft that appeared too small for anymore than 2 people.  a medium shade of a blue single light came from this area.  one each end of each wing was a light blue almost white led looking light.  there was no blinking from these lights, they were all static.  it was not shaped like a stealth bomber as it was way bigger and elongated into a more boomerang wing configuration.  just one big long black wing.  it was very cool but i wish i knew what it was.  i will or my daughter will be submitting another report as she saw it on another night last month again while on her way home from work.....That's 5 years it's been flying around....So far..Yikes!

jet closely overhead and the sound of a projectile being fired followed immediately by a second projectile. immediately following the second projectile i heard the sound of a second jet engine take off close by heading from east towards the west.I remember looking up toward the ceiling and it was dark in the restroom. where i live, we are proximal to mcclellan afb and beale afb.\r\ni stayed in the restroom. my attention is drawn to the right of the shower. the light is now on and the bathroom door closed. i then heard a siren, kind of like an all clear buzzer/booming sound and a loud voice. i heard a voice that sounded very angry say the word \"merqab\". i looked over to the wall. i saw what appeared to be a transparent rectangle, i could see the outline. it was a charcoal color, like someone had taken a pen to draw an outline. i could make out a wave like motion. it was fully self contained. it disappeared after about 2 minutes. there is an air conditioning vent above the area but the heater was not on at that time.\r\ni do not remember being aware of it disappearing but i do know that it was gone at a point and i noticed my dog suzy enter the restroom by pushing the door open with her head.I looked at her and kind of shook my head, looking into the mirror and said \"ok\", washed my hands, turned off the light.\r\ni entered into the kitchen area and looked at the clock on the oven. it said 0605. i walked back to the bedroom and wrote down the series of events with dates and times and a brief description of events. i got back into bed but could not fall asleep. i got up after appx 3 hours of tossing. i have been told that my mood is marginally elevated today. my wife and i have begun noticing a strong ammonia smell from the living room area. i shampooed the carpet in there yesterday so there should not be this smell today. this has happened several times in the past but it was not associated with the carpet being shampooed. i have also been experiencing a low

you hold your fingers apart half an inch and then extend your arm in front of you. it was pretty visable. \r\n\r\nit seemed to travel in a wide, slow curve moving se then east. it produced no noise and was very fluid and smooth.\r\n\r\nwhen it started to move east, it changed shape. it was clear. and very fast but again, fluid. it turned into 3 wide ovals circling each other. it changed from white transparent to a dull red orange, though i'm not sure it wasn't just the reflection of street lights on it. the ovals moved clockwise horizontally at a consistent speed. slow enough to see the smoothness of the spheres. it looked like a shiny metallic surface. \r\n\r\nit never stopped moving, but it picked up speed after this, moving east and up. and it went up ultimately, until it looked

2015. while we were driving towards the house along a driveway, my friend took photos of the house and surrounding area. once at the house my friend and i went out on the deck to see the view. there i mentioned to my friend, who is interested in ufos, that i had seen a very bright single light above a tree line a few weeks before when my boyfriend and i were at the house. the light my boyfriend and i had observed was so bright i mentioned to him at the time that there must be a planet coming up through the trees. however, as the light cleared the trees, i noted that it was way too bright to be a planet. the light then moved back down into the tree line, silhouetting trees as it traveled and vanished with no sound. my friend and i only noticed the lights in the attached photos as i was pointing out to him the area where the very bright light had been sighted a few weeks previously. he had immediately noticed that the photos he had just taken on his phone had lights in the same area. both photos taken by my friend occurred within the same time stamp of 8:50 pm on august 11th, 2015. i have included close-ups of the lights in the attachments.\r\n\r\ni am reporting at this time because on november 14, 2016 my boyfriend and i had an intense encounter with anomalous lights observed from the same deck. the mufon report on that case is # 80432. i did contact two small area airports in january of 2017 to see if they knew of any aircraft in the air at the time the photos were taken in 2015. i have not heard back from them. also, on january 27, 2017, a sighting that was reported at the us and mexico border showed photos of lights that were so similar to what was recorded in my friend’s photos, that i felt the need to share a photo from this sighting in the attachments.\r\n\r\ni have no idea if the lights in these attached photos are anomalous in nature. i would like to find out.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

take off in a no special direction they might change  directions and keep flying the same way until they fly so far you can no longer see them. i have approximately 15 minutes of video several nights in a row of these objects they're here almost every single night. i am also close to an air force bombing range which is probably why they are here so often. i can fillmore see these objects just about every single night and leading to end the day or two after a full moon there is a lot of activity. i have also seen some strange aircraft that's probably military that i have never seen before and they usually fly over me after i'm make contact with the ufo. it seems like the aircraft is watching what i do and maybe taking pictures or they definitely know what i'm doing. they are definitely watching me i think there might be a portal somewhere close. usually i lose sight of the object when they fly out of range of my night vision camera or sometimes they just fade out disappear. these objects are either high altitude military drones or allen craft. i get excited when i see these things you now because it's just exciting i'm not scared or anything like that but you know most people didn't believe me until they saw the video. most of the time they just fly away on a few occasions they have flown right over my location and have hovered  there for a long time and just never moved till i move myself or just gave up you know filming that night. i am colorblind but sometimes people tell me they change color. they dont do anything crazy. sometimes they grow real big and real bright and just fade out disappear in an instant or change direction or just shoot off like a rocket and disappear. i have made dvd recordings i was unable to download for this report but can email the video to anybody that wants them just send me your email.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

welding flash. at one point the brightness began to flicker wildly. though it is hard to say exactly what it is.  i watched this object for over two minutes before i realized that it's no airplane since it barely moved at all. my first thought was to take a picture of it but just as i pointed the camera the light suddenly vanished. all i could see was a tiny dot barely visible then it was gone, just nothing.\r\n\r\nin the end it would not have mattered since my s200 camera with it's two megapixel sensor has a max focal length of 74mm which means that it's incapable of capturing something that is over two kilometers away.","distance":"Over One

for over 6 years. i am using a bushnell trail camera. i noticed in three pictures on january 13 at 7:48pm to 8:03pm a very bright light moving over or within the tree tops. when viewed in quick sequence you can clearly see the path of the object. it appears to have individual lights on it when i zoom in using my laptop software. i have had this camera in the same location for years and can show thousands of day and night time pictures from this exact spot. the object appears in the first picture at 7:48pm. the second picture at 7:52pm the object has moved a little closer and you can see the individual lights better. the third picture at 8:03pm the object seems to be moving up and away to the top right of the frame. i worked as a restricted radio operator and a weather observer at an airport in the high arctic. i am used to identifying aircraft and weather phenomena. the object is hovering for 15 minutes so this is not a plane. there are no navigation lights that i can see nore did i hear a helicopter hovering over my back yard for 15 minutes. i have never seen any civilian or military helicopters acting in this fashion and there is nothing but forest below the object at this time and location. a drone comes to mind however this is a very bad location to be flying a drone over the forest and at night. there is nothing there but trees and i know the two closest neighbors and they do not own or fly drones at all. the nearest house other than mine and my two neighbors would be unlikely to fly a drone that far away,blind over the forest hovering for 15 minutes with powerful lights shining into the trees. it is hard to tell the size of the object but it appears to be large but i'm not sure. it makes no sense to me after all these years of taking pictures from this exact spot that someone would be flying a drone here at that time at night over the forest for 15 minutes. why my camera started taking picture is strange in its self. i would be happy to explain more as there is much more to tell. if you have any questions please ask. the camera will remain right where it is. thank you.","distance":"101-500

we had on in the house, making the sight of the object easily seen. my girlfriend was across from me facing toward me and, because the object was so bright, saw the brightness light up the wall behind
