would go from a sphere to a cigar shape and once it passed the house it went back to just being a sphere. he said all around the object there was this wave like pattern that of fire. also that everything went super silent while the object passed by, no bird sounds, no wind sound, no car sounds, nothing just silence and this effect of sound cancelling was only when the object was passing

the front door and to my astonishment saw 5 red orbs moving slowly over a mile away coming from below the horizon line against a ridge slightly toward my position on a clear dark night from the east. the lead red orb was gaining altitude while moving southeast as the other red orbs behind followed the lead object.  i alerted my brother and sister to then come outside and observe the strange objects , they did.  i then ran back into the house , grabbed my cell phone and ran directly east across the street by a telephone pole and took 3 videos with my cell phone while my sister and brother stayed by the house.   my brother and i can be heard on the videos conversing back and forth while the objects were in the sky and i was video taping them.  my brother at the same time called a friend and his wife that live by a nearby lake that the objects were flying over.  both my brother's friend and wife had stated that they were seeing the objects as we all were.  as the objects would follow each other and the lead object reached a maximum height it's red glow would go out and the next orb would then appear from below the horizon line.  at one point one of the three highest orbs went up vertically and back down forming a momentary triangle then continued an (in line) flight pattern as before.  we counted a total of 12 red orbs at different times during the 25 minute encounter.  myself as well as family members were in awe by this event.  shortly after a youtube video was posted that i ran across from an individual in a nearby town that saw almost the same event as we did.  the youtube video was soon after deleted before i could comment on it.  about the same time a female in washington county reported to the sheriffs about multiple red/orange orbs being seen over the local walmart.  the story was printed in the marietta times. my brother and i both agree that these objects defied what man-made objects normally do in the sky.  my sister being more skeptical thought them to be man-made and explainable.  it was truly fascinating and thrilling to see something this strange.","distance":"Over One

objects hovering and moving lazily in no specific flight path. objects(5-6) appeared to pulse and glow with orange/yellow light only when hovering.Would dim considerably when moving. two objects appeared to \"exchange\" light or energy with one dimming and the other brightening in close proximity. objects also appeared to \"fly\" in very close proximity on purpose with no apparent regard to their proximity. objects would move from hovering position approx. north of first position and back and forth in an indeterminate manner almost \"lazily\". observed this for approximately 1.5 hours. dimmer lights appeared to travel north and back to original position. at first we thought the objects could be helicopters or planes but we observed them glowing and dimming and doing odd, lazy movements in sky approx. 50° to 60° over horizon. no spotlights seen. objects appeared to have red and green lights when dim. felt that objects were not normal aircraft due to odd behaviour. was exhilarated at prospect of encountering unknown objects in sky never having seen anything like it before. did not feel any particular negative feelings, just that we were seeing something unusual. attempted to move to higher ground to observe objects more clearly. watched them in two positions over approx. 1 hour. as far as we know we were the only people to observe this event. never truly lost sight of objects and left after 1.5 hours as it was late and we were tired.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

home and often look up at it when the moon is out because of the glow from the moon on the snow i enjoy. what i saw first was a helicopter flying around the top of the mountain by the arial tramway.(we have request reports of missing hikers on the mountain)and when i saw the helicopter shining a spot light on the mountain,i though they were looking for someone,and went inside and got my wife to outside and take a look.\r\ni was in the marine corp with a helo squardren as a medic and got to see quite a few different styles of helicopter so i knew what i was looking at, especially after i heard the rotors of the helicopter and the search light. i then went inside and got my field telescope to see what was going on. the helicopter seem very focused on the one particular area but did fly around to different spots. the area they focused on when i zoomed in on the area i saw a large red sphere that remained on. the helicopter never shined the light directly on the object but behind and to the right side of it.\r\ni assumed it was a team of people maybe rescue crews looking for others? i made a comment to my wife about how skilled this pilot must have been,i had an outstanding view of the helicopter even at 7 pm in the evening and because it really isn't that far from our home.The pilot remained absolutely still in midair over the object for very long periods of time without moving at all,completely stationary.And that was on the side of the mountain about 10,100 feet up, 400 feet from the very top of the mountain by the tram itself. my wife had a few looks of it too and we still were wondering what on earth was going on up there. i made a few comments as time was going by like how very strange this all was,was this a downed plane?\r\ni brought the tripod and telescope closer to end of the property in my front yard to get even closer look and to my absolute astonishment as i was looking at the helicopter shining the spotlight again,this sphere changed different colors first white then light blue then red again and paused changing colors.\r\nwith my wife right beside me and as i was looking through the  scope the red sphere changed shape, flattened like a pancake and from the exact spot it was on flew straight to the right due north with the helicopter observing it,it traveled about a quarter of a mile then stopped changed direction and traveled due south and disappeared out of view. it wasn't flying fast at all more like a controlled glide.It observed flat from the side but as i was able to keep it in view with the telescope i could clearly see 3 lights, 2 brilliant red (like rubies) the front and rear and a smaller white on the side, the object appeared see through and triangular in shape and when observing it,it had a dreamlike quality to it, it was exceptionally beautiful to look at and it never made a sound.As i'm writing this seeing how it happened less than 2 hours ago i'm absolutely amazed at what i saw,my wife got to view this object and the helicopter also but didn't see the object change color or shape as i witnessed. i have mixed feeling,shock comes to mind,i never thought in a million years that the red object that we were observing would actually take flight and fly away. we lost sight of it as it went behind the lower edge of the mountain going south with the helicopter still flying around the top of the mountain by the tram.\r\ni wonder now, we're they looking for occupants on the side of the mountain? i will submitted a drawing if asked. an added noted note: palm springs tramway is a very popular attraction during the winter months here. when we were observing the helicopter flying around and then seeing the red sphere the tramway that runs every fifteen minutes with a trolling going up and coming down the mountain,not one cable car came  up or down the mountain,chances are for the length of time we were looking we would have seen one of the cable cars or both. also during the entire event through the telescope we saw different (teams?) of people with high powered flashlights trying to get over to where the helicopter was shining the spot light by this object but with the recent snow fall from storms weren't having much luck,or so it seemed. thank you","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

south, was a small neighborhood park with a patch of woods to the west of it. as i was driving past the park a bright flash of light, like a car headlight, caught my attention on the edge of the park near the woods. i ignored it at first but then saw it, out of the corner of my eye, move upward and fade. i slowed down the car and saw that it was still glowing but had the shape of an orb. it was about the size of a volkswagon bug and was around thirty feet above the ground entering the forest. it was quickly obscured by the trees but still visible as i slowly crept forward in the car. it clearly lit up the park and i remember it lighting up the trees, but it's been a long time and i'm not sure if i definitely saw the light reflected on the trees or not. it moved slowly through the trees and then went above the tree line where it was less visible, or disappeared off and on, while it moved west.\r\n\r\ni drove past the woods to where i thought it would end up, but it had disappeared. i then saw it appear again further to the south west and followed it, weaving through neighborhoods to try to get below it.  i turned onto canton center road and it was ahead of my car and to the right. i looked at the road again and looked up and it was directly to my right...Around 200 hundred feet away. i looked to the road again and had to slam on my breaks because there was a large animal in the road. it looked like a black panther. it ran into the parking lot of the canton public library.\r\n\r\nat that point i completely forgot about the ufo and turned into the library parking lot to find the animal. it had disappeared. i sat in my car for a few moments until i freaked out and left to go to a friend's house.\r\n\r\ni'm not suggesting there is a connection between the ufo and the animal. a black panther was sighted near a local courthouse shortly thereafter and again, i believe, sighted outside a local schoolhouse a few weeks later. i was glad to see the reports because they verified my story. someone's illegal pet likely escaped. however, it's such a strange coincidence that i'd have two weird sighting, one leading to the other, that i figure it should be mentioned. i'm hoping there are possibly other reports from that area in 1992 that mufon may have on file...","distance":"101-500

7:15 pm to 7:25 pm a friend and his wife (who want to remain anonymous) observed what they initially thought to be a planet slightly above the moon.  i initially received a text from his wife asking: “whats the really bright, star, planet, satellite just above the moon tonight”?  i answered that it should be the planet venus.  the husband however stated that he saw three or four green lights on the upper right side of the “planet”.  these lights remained for the entire period that they were driving in a westerly direction through lee’s summit, mo, a total time of about 10 minutes.  the lights actually were blinking rapidly and appeared to have red on the left side of the light occasionally.  \r\n\r\nhe noted that the “planet” was exceptionally bright.  the position of the lights with respect to the rim were roughly following the outline from about 1 o’clock to 4 o’clock.  “it was much brighter”, he said.  the witness also stated that the lights were not synchronized but pulsing randomly. \r\n\r\nother persons in the general kansas city area have also seen unusual “craft” in the location that venus is supposed to occupy in the sky and in other locations as well.  one incident is seen in mufon case # 80199 on november 3rd, 2016.  it is interesting to note that the video which that witness took has the craft to be in the same location as venus was supposed to be in.  it showed a rapidly morphing series of cylindrical shapes and colors from frame to frame.  it too looked like it pulsed and changed colors-- from the naked eye perspective, red and green tend to

buddy and his wife and 2 boys were visiting from florida. we lived in the foothills of the appalachian mountains and we spent our summers romping the various mountain attractions nearby. one of the boys was 9 years old at the time, and we had become fast friends the week of their visit. one afternoon our parents were inside the house relaxing and reminiscing while we played outside on the carport.Something caused us both to turn and look towards the back yard. there hovering 15-20 feet off the ground was a dull metallic vw bug sized craft with pulsating red green and blue lights. the object was curved on the side facing us. we were at eye level with the object and it was very close, approximately 10-15 feet away, just hovering there as if it were observing or studying us. we both were in shock for several seconds and just stood there speechless. it made a whirring sound like-waahhuuwaahhuuwaahhuuwaahhuu. i was terribly frightened by this craft as was my companion. we both came to our senses and ran in the house. our parents in their merry making were oblivious to what was just outside the window where they were gathered. it took several seconds for them to realize that we were serious and not just playing a game or a trick on them. we all ran back out to the carport, the craft was gone. i am now 46 years old. this incident has stayed with me to this day. i have never seen another craft or anything either close or far up in the sky which could by considered a ufo. i know what i saw that day was something very unusual and not something seen normally in our skies

did not return. the large ufo used all of the same colors but also showed a very bright (star colored) light at times. the color patterns of the large ufo changed as i watched. at times it was concentric circles, at times more like a halo, other times like the pattern of the stripes on a basketball. at one point the large ufo appeared wobbly.\r\n\r\neventually the large ufo  moved extremely

morning when i cum uo over a hump back bridge and i seen the side of somthing dark glistening i was unsure what i was looking at as i keept walking i could see a very larg shimmering surface it looks like water or cling film as i walked further past the few houses need the bridge i seen a shape as if it was vanishing and when i got closer on the towards the turn bend on the road i looked again in total shock and amazement i was looking up at a structured building that looked to be hovering but i could see somthing else that was full length that was masking it's structure with total stelth the part that i could see was very large with two striped red lines on it with a smaller structure at the top left of the other structure i could see that was visible the other part thst was hide was showing off a marker light to its top left it was like it was imitating a star in the sky i know straight away i was looking at somthing i have already seen in a ufo documentary from the early nintendo ninties i could hardly take a breath as i watched the massive structure the smaller part on the top far left was  changing it's stuctural shape and i count even understand or work out how it was doing this i stood for almost 50 to 55 minuts watching the structure then i started to work out what it was looking at for it was in know way interested in me looking at what they were doing i could see the structure changing shapes it went from looking like a post pillar box shape somthing resembling a speed camara box then it changed shape into what looked somthing like a automatic washing machine  i could see all sorts of things in and around the rest of part ove the ufo building sized craft it was totally breath taking i even tried to talk to it from across the road way it was situated across the road up in a field i stood there utterly terified as i looked over and up at the craft then i got the worst shock ove all when two rows ove windows apeared totally light up with large figures inside the windows were very larg and all conected with very little separation between then in two long rows the window sizes were comparible to the front side ove a norman up and down stairs home i could hardly breath as i looked at several figures moving around behind the windows i could see around seven figures as and more  that looked like they were walking out away from the front windows into other compartments behind what could be doors it was at that point i found my breath and desided to start to start walking the rest ove the way back into my home town as fast as i could it was looking right past me whare i was stood into what was thought to be a gas works fir pumping gas but i know it's used for military porpoises it was scanning the area across the fields when i was too there they didn't take very much notis ove me the road was very quiet no cars were on the road that night as i walked back towords my home whare i live it is on the same road way in the high street i had to try to wake up my two brothers and there pit bull teri or i knocked and banged on there door i could still see it from that side of two as i was only one mile away from whare i seen it rugby i jumped up onto of the wall i'm my brothers back garden what i could see past the rows ove cottages and i could still see the top half over the craft it was anormous  i keept on chapping at my two brothers door and i couldn't even wake up there dog thst is normally very noise and backing at any small noise or sound to get to their door first to welcome who ever is there i walked out there gate across the road looked back towords the larg building sized craft i could still see it from my line ove sight along both side of the cottage's that was on the west side ove my two brothers home i went back to there door to bang on there door to try to get them up but i could not even get them to stir atall i jumped buck up on top of there wall that run all the way around there home and looked out again the craft was rising up over to the southwest it gained hight so fast but not like supper fast it rise up like a jet taking of within ten or fifteen seconds it was gone i was very disappointed i could not get my brothers to wake up i have shown them the craft it resembles a isriali building dull  of white with two stripes i had seen it befor i have even found it by looking for
