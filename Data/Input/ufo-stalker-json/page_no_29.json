9/28/2017\r\nlocation: monterey, ca\r\nshape: changing\r\nduration:until dusk\r\nmultiple ufos sighted, heard hums, lights flashing/blinking/colors changing, moved rapidly/bounced multiple directions. cloudy no stars\r\n\r\nfor over 3 nights, starting 9/23 around 9:30pm, i saw a white spherical light on the horizon of northwest mountains. strange large lights would fly above this larger light, and they flashed red, white, blue, and moved far too quickly in a bouncing motion to be an airplane. living close to the airport i disregarded sightings until 9/25 about 10pm i noticed the larger light was no longer white but orange and had moved farther north. same colored and shaped smaller lights continued to randomly hover in sparadic movements near orange light, until eventually speeding off in whatever directions or disappearing. 9/27 1am i see that large orange light is moving in circle formation and can also see an odd rectangular shape to light, or at a certain angle seemed like 2 lights determining shape to still be rectangular. i have also noticed that orange light has rocket some small white light from top of light, and moving like a missle (straight in sky) has also left some sort! of chem trail looking cloud for a considerable distance about 5 seconds. at 3:55am i became uncomfortable and sit in a chair on the opposite side of the window, and notice a floating green, white, and blue light that was quickly spinning and moving sporadically different directions. 4:08am green light has now moved south west toward my home in a bobbing or jumping formation. light continues to weave forward and backward as if trying to hide behind clouds. 4:15am light is stationary every time i look at it, but within 2 secs begins to climb sky in much too fast a speed to be anything considered average. these occurrences are extremely frequent here, and i have spotted them on average 6:7 times per week since 2014 along with many other different descriptions. i can occasionally hear strange humming noise as well when lights come close enough, unlike any aircraft i have heard before. 9/27 absolutely zero stars out due to cloudy and overcast

looked like circles or paint cans along the side coming towards me 4 of them evenly placed. as i was watching it fly over the house across the street it was like i had to focus my eyes to keep it in view like it was vanishing like a cloud sort of, i felt like i had to concentrate to keep it from disappearing, and the harder i focused on it the more of it's shape i could see, then i noticed that my right frontal cortex above my eye was swelling as if a migraine was coming on, they pain intensified the harder i concentrated on the craft, as i'm struggling to keep this thing in sight on the street out of the corner of my eye a white car pulled aburptly onto my street, stopped imeaditly went into reverse and pulled off, then the craft went over my house and out of sight, soon as i couldn't see it anymore the pain in my brain stopped. the next morning when i got out of bed soon as i stood up it felt like i was stabbed in both sides of my back with this horrible pain that lasted for 2 and a half days untill i was so concerned i went to the hospital and soon as the doctor started to examine me the pain left. it was hurting then as she touched me and asked does it hurt here i had to say no because the pain left right then. i made no mention of the encounter to the hospital.

window. actually this sort of thing happened a lot. what can be described as grey aliens pasty white almost see through skin. small bodies long fingers, sickly looking from a human perspective. the first visits they were aggressive and would shine things in my eyes or run some kind of scanner over my body. sometimes they would take samples but when they came i would attempt to ward them off. sometimes attempt to scream, push even hit them until one night. it was the same time same light only a female human appeared. she had the face of claudia black same hair, i didn't know how to react to her. she said \"can we be friends?\". i couldn't speak. most of the words are fuzzy. we then began to talk. i asked her if the others were her friends and she said she was in charge of them and apologized for their treatment of me. i asked what they wanted. she said they wanted to see how i was made. i didn't know anything about that sort of thing back then. i was 8. she explained that everything on earth and elsewhere living or inorganic was made. then she said understanding what came down to genetics, organs, bones and their combination would help her species understand humans. so i eventually agreed for her to proceed. suddenly the blue white light seemed to pick me off of the bed and i couldn't move. in all of 35 years i have yet to feel something like the feeling she seemed to evoke. it was like every fiber in my being was just under some kind of metaphysical ecstasy spell. i had no concept or any sensation other than that. then it lowered me to the bed and i was sure for 100% this woman was not human. she was now looking at me. i asked her if human was what she really looked like. she said no but i may be frightened by what she really looked like. after some

cassiopeia. the sky was absolutely clear with no cloud cover. it was fairly dark with some moonlight.Very close in proximity to the area where the constellation is, i saw a translucent, very feint bluish white light that was shaped like a very narrow, cylindrical object, moving extremely fast from south, over my apartment building, to north, until it disappears into the horizon. i could see it fly continuously in an absolute straight line, at a very constant speed,until it went so far that i couldn't see it anymore. it made no sound. nothing odd, with electricity or animal behavior happened. it was maybe 15-20 seconds, from me seeing it, until it disappears into the horizon, on it's straight path. i was absolutely astounded at what i had seen, because it was unlike anything that i has seen before. the object, itself, looked almost like a bluish white lazer light. there was no physical structure seen but there was a perfect shape to the object itself. it was perfectly shaped like a very skinny cigar. it seemed to be fairly low because it wasn't at a high degree in the sky. i have a tree line, about 2 football fields in front of my building and it was, to my eyes, about 10-20 degrees above the treeline, when it disappears into the horizon. this object was so perfectly shaped, light, that it had to have been a planned or constructed object. it moved at one constant speed, with no variation and went dead straight. the color was such that if you hadn't been looking at the exact spot of where it was, you would have never seen it! it appeared to blend in with the sky, with the lightest translucent color that you could see. it was moving so fast that, again, unless you were looking, just a little off, you would have missed it or passed it off as a flash. i was fortunate enough to see it from my building and followed it with my eyes, until it went so far that i couldn't see it anymore. the size must have been pretty big, because it was much much longer than any plane in the sky or width of a nearby building, across from me. the night was super clear, so i'm not experienced at determining height in the sky. it did look to be 10-20 degrees above a tree line, but could have been quite high....Due to my inexperienced eye. what struck me so odd was the perfect shape of this translucent light.....It had a begunning and end. also, the pathway that it was on was absolutely straight, fast and looked to be intentional.... versus a falling star that's a little imperfect. after my initial awe, i had the thought that whatever this was, blended in the night sky so we'll, that it was meant not to be seen, or was \" blending in\". it was moving so fast, on it's straight path, that it would certainly have been missed if you just glanced up. i was, unfortunate enough, to have caught site of a moving object in my site, and was able to follow it until it disappeared. i have seen many odd things in the skies above this area, but this was just plain bizarre. i did watch it until it disappeared and waited for 10-15 minutes to see if i could see another anomaly, or see if there would be anything in the area that could possibly explain this light anomaly. i saw nothing else unusual, that evening and ran immediately to tell my elderly mother what i had just seen\" this time\". i have two other very odd sightings that i have not reported, because i thought there were so many things seen in my area, that i may not be taken seriously. i avoid my back porch, for this reason. it makes you feel a little scared, after so many odd occurrences. quickly, i will add two more. one evening, about three months ago, i was watching a normal airplane go across the sky...From north to south east, when the plane all of a sudden had a second identical plane, just behind and below it. i actually stood in amazement thinking i was seeing a rare phenomenon of the light bouncing off of the clouds and causing a mirror effect. i thought it was really cool looking! we had low cloud cover, that evening and the plane was below the clouds. i thought i was seeing a rare mirror effect of the planes lights on the mist in the air. i watched it until it disappears around the end of my building. i had watched this plane across the sky and this happened only near the end of the sighting. i ended the evening thinking i had seen something cool, until i told my ex what i had seen and he pointed out that if it was a mirror effect, that it would have been an opposite image of the plane and not an exact image. he also pointed out that it wouldn't have been behind the plane, but under or over it! i hadn't thought about that, but scientifically, it was true. i still don't know what i saw. one last quickie. i was changing my puppies, doggie pads, on my back porch.....That's why i'm out there in the first place....Most of the time, because i try to avoid going out there.....When a very large triangular set of extremely bright red lights came directly down the center of the field where my back patio faces! it was 5 bright red lights, in a triangle pattern....One light leading the object. it slowly and soundlessly went west to east, not way up in t nohe sky. it made no sound, it was constant speed and kept going slowly until i could see only the back red lights of the object, at a distance. i ran and got my elderly mother, who also saw the tale end of it. the lights were huge and you could see them from a good distance because they were so bright. this was about six months ago. i don't know what's going on, in my area, but i'm not a nut case! these things are really happening and i'm not sure if our government is doing something in this area, that we don't know about, or is there something more to be afraid of. for now, i will change my dogs pee pee pads, on the back balcony, with my eyes shut! i would love to know if others are seeing unexplained occurrences in the skies above the chesterfield/ richmond virginia area.I can mail sketches, if it would be helpful.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At time of incident, had turned 11 years old during prior month, and school year had started few weeks beforehand.  at time, family was staying with parents of step-mother of the period, located within rural area in close proximity of sylacauga, al.  area terrain was low, forested hills, with paved roadway, and widely-spaced residences in reasonably cleared areas along route.  incident occurred after nightfall & evening meal (approx. 7:00-8:00 p.M.?), on night with no following day's school.  younger step-cousin of period had hiked his way through forested area separating the neighboring residences, requesting my younger brother & myself accompany him back to the other residence, to engage in playing various board games.  to best of memory, evening was seasonally warm, moonlight was available, and area foresting prevented accurate wind condition observation.  as the 3 of us proceeded back through the forested area separating the residences, i took note of the amount of noise we were creating just from the effort of walking through the seasonal \"tree-litter\" all over the forest floor, and ambient moonlight was enough to easily avoid footing/collision issues.  by time approx. half way through forested area, i had wandered slight distance ahead of other 2 individuals (approx. 10-15 ft.), from them being engaged in dawdling around pushing & jesting each other.  while continuing to walk, i made sure my trajectory would clear to the side of a moderately-sized tree ahead of me, and i twisted my upper torso around to my right, to issue my own jests back towards the others.  laughing from the various jesting, i then twisted my torso back around into proper orientation for walking, just as i arrived to the side area of the tree i had made to pass by.  as my eyes swung around to first notice the proximity of the tree, i suddenly caught sight of what looked like a \"person\" jumping out from around the tree from a hiding position, and came lunging towards me with outstretched arms, as if to seize/grab.  distance separating was alarmingly minimal, and because had been caught totally off-guard and was quite startled, i rapidly twisted away from \"whoever\" was leaping at me, turning towards my left and crouching/hunkering over in a desperate defensive position, with teeth clenched & eyes force-closed, expecting the attacker to soon contact my exposed back.  from the brief glance at whoever was leaping from behind the tree, the person appeared to be approx. 5 1/2' tall, slim-normal build, and had hair that looked \"normal\" (although non-combed/un-kept), of short-medium length & lesser color shade than medium brown.  glance did not last long enough to take in particulars of facial features, clothing, etc., and leaping action was done with no associated noise attributed, as if attacker able to avoid treading through the forest floor tree-litter.  i do not know how long i maintained the crouched defensive posture, but after long enough time had gone by in my mind without feeling the person \"attack\" me, i began to slowly, cautiously rise back up out of the defensive position, while listening intently for any forest floor litter noise to indicate location or pathway of the attacker.  absolutely no associated noise was detected, and as no \"noticeable\" physical attack was forthcoming, i apprehensively finished standing back up and glanced all around me.  whoever had looked like jumping at me from behind the tree was nowhere in sight, and any departure from the area went undetected.  during the process of glancing around me, noticed that both my brother and the step-cousin were actively in the process of displaying recovery from almost identical defensive reactions/positions as myself, and were also starting to glance about in apprehension, confusion, etc.  after determining nothing was around us, we simply shrugged shoulders at each other, and resumed our progress through the forested area, as if nothing had occurred. only once during the evening's board game play did my brother casually ask what i thought that was all about, back in the woods, to which i replied i thought it must have been a \"spook/ghost\" pulling pranks.  this explanation seemed to satisfy him, and the incident has never been discussed, since.

my husband said it wasn't a building, because it was in the sky. we couldn't understand what we were seeing. if it were a plane it would have been the size of a football field, so we were confused. after several seconds the light began a straight, short descent, but still remained in view on its diagonal. as it descended it changed to a much narrower shape; that is when the lights faded to more of a dim yellow, at which point you could clearly see some sort of structure in between. it appeared to be like a building in the sky. eventually there were only two fuzzy, yellow, dim light balls on each end, with the clearly visible, thin structure in between. it was not moving.  it remained exactly in place, on its diagonal. when we got off at summerlin parkway, we could no longer see it, as it seemed to be behind the mountains. by the time we had argued, and wrapped our heads around what was happening, it was too late to take a picture. we had been on the highway (both i 15 and 95), and it disappeared when we got into our quiet neighborhood. we fully expected to hear about it on the news when we woke up, but nothing seems to be reported. we have never been particularly interested in ufo's, and have actually been skeptical of many tales of sightings. never did we think we would see such a thing. we don't understand what it means. does this happen all the time and we are unaware?

approaching distance, above the highway, the same altitude of say an small airplane or helicopter, a bright light shown in the sky which appeared to be your normal run-of-the mill small aircraft or

which faces sw, brought this object to my attention. i stepped onto the balcony and immediately observed it hovering to the sw. no way to judge distance or size. brightly flashing primary colors, far brighter than any star, in no apparent order is all i was able to discern. i estimated magnitude -5 or more based on my many sightings of the iss in the past which is roughly magnitude -3.7 to -4. i estimated the elevation above horizon ranging between the index and middle finger of my fist when the base is lined up with the horizon.\r\n  after a few minutes i was able to determine it was descending, almost imperceptibly except for a trio of palm trees near line of sight with the object which i was able to use as reference. again after another few minutes it began to ascend at near the same rate. about the time it began to ascend my wife brought me binoculars which didn't resolve any more detail of the object. other than binoculars i would occasionally shift my gaze and focus on a different object before looking back in the hopes of making out any details. throughout the sighting the size, brightness and behavior of the object never waivered. i wound up watching it for 20 minutes before i had to get to bed.\r\n  personally i am loathe to cry ufo despite my clear fascination with the phenomenon. alien/ufo as well as space/science subject documentaries are a favorite pastime of mine. i also enjoy the rare occasion i can watch a launch from vandenberg afb as i just witnessed the space x launch of the spanish radar satellite this morning. at first when i see this i rather expect it to resolve into an aircraft (lax is and hour drive to the east) as has happened numerous times in the past. when that expectation begins to fade after several minutes i want to continue watching so as to dispel any possible notion that it could be a terrestrial aircraft by reasoning since there is no lateral movement it is either directly approaching or distancing itself from my location. the reason i don't suspect a helicopter is vertical vortices that happen when they hover out of ground effect for long periods resulting in loss of lift. even if a helicopter was

(angela was not injured.) upon being slammed into a wall, apparently not particularly forcefully, she managed to escape down an inclined building basement entrance that had steps and hung on for dear life until the turbulent weather had passed. angela has a history of seeing distressful beings that other persons do not catch visual sight of. at the time of this turbulent weather event, which has been classified as a tornado, which is out of the ordinary for this part of the country, i was at home inside my house where we incurred large trees falling on the house with damages that are not extensive.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":90364,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9078353,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02222018-0007","longitude":-79.72136760000001,"occurred":1518721920000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1519293188000,"summary":"A co-resident of mine was picked up and carried 1/2 block in the weather turbulence of a potential ufo (according to her description) recently classified locally as a tornado.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1519352746261,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":19,"maxtempi":66,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":17,"meantempi":62,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":19,"maxtempi":66,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":17,"meantempi":62,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"15401","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Uniontown, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:474"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed, Treetop","city":"Luanda","country":"Angola","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"00244923426602\r\n\r\n\r\ni live in angola - luanda, i´m 35 years old and i would like you to take a look in some photos i took last week.\r\n\r\ni went for a work to a place called \"barra do kwanza\" that stays in the border of luanda (angola´s capital) and bengo (another province) and this place is also the river mouth of kwanza river that is the biggest river of angola.\r\n\r\nso, in one of the margins of the river is a place called \"quissama park\" that is a natural reserve with a very rich flora and fauna.\r\n\r\nyou can find there a lot of big wild animals like zebras, gnus, nyalas, boars, giraffes, elephants,  and others.\r\n\r\ni finished the work and since i always wanted to know the park i went there to take a look; there, i was convinced by the workers to try the safari that would take more or less 2 hours  to finish.\r\n\r\nthe weather was very nice with a little drizzle before and we started around 3 pm on a big truck.\r\n\r\nwe saw a lot of animals on the way and after 30-40 minutes, we went to this place called \"salina\" that use to have a big lake with a lot of animals around.\r\n\r\non december 6, 2017, was a big fire on this place that took the life of a lot of animals, mostly reptiles that couldn’t run away. nobody knows how the fire started.\r\nthe locals told us that since the fire took place the elephants have stopped to go there.\r\n\r\nso, we were passing exactly on the prior fire place and the truck got stuck in the mud. we have tried to take it out with no success.\r\nwe decided to call another car to help and after 1 hour he arrived. \r\n\r\nthe second car got stuck too trying to pull the other one from the mud. \r\n\r\nwe have been there for 2-2.5 hours.\r\n\r\nas we were waiting for the solution to get out of there, we started to explore by foot the area around, (not too far) is a beautiful place. as we were talking, i started to take some randomly pictures with my cellphone (samsung galaxy s8). \r\n\r\ni saw that the sun was in a good angle to take some pictures with the palm trees.\r\n\r\ni didn´t notice anything strange and there was a good feeling of being there despite the problems with the trucks.\r\n\r\nso, after a lot of efforts of the workers, they were able to take the car out of the mud and decided to take us to the base and pick up the other car on the next day.\r\n\r\nso, we went to the base to pick up our cars and go home.\r\n\r\nafter all, when i was at home, i started to see the pictures and something called my attention.\r\n\r\ni was in shock, amazed about what i was looking at. i always wanted to see something because i really believe in it.\r\n\r\ni started to look all the pictures to see if i could find something else and i found in three more pictures.\r\n\r\nthere was this ball orb or sphere in the first picture that looks like is hovering above the trees. you can also see the sun on the left side.\r\n\r\nin the second picture looks like she went down and left this track of light on the way.\r\n\r\nin the third picture looks like is going to the bush. \r\n\r\nthe fourth photo, actually was the first that i took, you can see the object at ground level.\r\n\r\ni started to analyze one by one and maybe is just my brain that wants to believe but when i zoom in i can see some shadows of humanoid/et figures, faces or bodies around the balls. again, maybe is just my mind playing games.\r\n\r\ni showed the pictures to some people that was really impressed with the images and others told the might be some kind of reflection of the cam.\r\n\r\ni don´t know what really is so i would like to have your help on this.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":90363,"landingOccurred":true,"latitude":-8.812104,"location":null,"logNumber":"AO-02222018-0006","longitude":13.2403779,"occurred":1519084800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Luanda Province","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1519279338000,"summary":"Photos reveal strange circular object hovering and landed in the wild life reserve","tags":["photo","light","hovering"],"timeZone":"Africa/Luanda","timeZoneName":"Africa/Luanda","tweeted":1519352745892,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0000","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Luanda, Luanda Province","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Landing","$$hashKey":"object:475"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82749,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":29}
