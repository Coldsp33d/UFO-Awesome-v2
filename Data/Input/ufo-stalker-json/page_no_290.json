was no sound heard from the craft and once it began to move it disappeared within a couple of seconds.  total time of the sighting 6 to 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe time that evening was approximately 5:20

southern view over looking the ocean and surrounding bay, when off in the distance at about 30 - 45 degree above trees of bay,  looking south we observe a flashing, pulsating strange green  light.We never thought to pull out a camera , as  it was unlike anything we had perviously observed while star gazing.  just a strange light at that time.My girl friend pointed it out, then turned to light a smoke ,and in that time it started to move. in the time i said,\" look, it  is started to move\". tthe light traveled from south to west of our position. not too far over the bay, because before i knew it , it had passed directly over our heads with lightning  speed. it was really hard to judge its  speed and distance over our heads, with no reference  points. what was really bizzare , was the sound which leads me to believe, it was not that high over our heads, maybe 150 feet, extremely fast, it shoots over our head towards the resort ,higher up from our position in front of the french restaurant ,at which point it made  two right angle turns, i can only imagine was to avoid hitting resort, i can only presume, and than it vanished over top of the resort,bizzare .The best way to describe the sound was a soft  brrrrr sound or better yet just like the sound on the jettsons years back ,best i can remember that.I myself, am in my 60'.S i asked around only person other than my girl friend that observed it ,was one of the staff selling time shares,  i did not get his name ,asked him if he ever seen it before ,he replied that a couple of years earlier he managed to catch something similar on his iphone . i attached a photo of our view of the bay for reference. what  strange is, it\"s  like it new we were observing it .","distance":"101-500

entered the i-94 freeway from wis. hwy. 25 at menomonie, wisconsin, traveling west to our home following youth basketball practice. we immediately noticed a brilliant white light ahead of us to the west along the south side of the freeway, at about 30 degrees above the horizon and at the 4 o’clock position with the moon being noon on a clock. the light was far more brilliant than venus or even the moon and clearly larger than venus or any other star.\r\n\r\nas we traveled west at about 75-80 miles per hour, we were able to keep pace with the object as it moved west along the south side of the freeway. during this time i was quite curious as to what it might be, as it was far more brilliant than jets that flew through the area or any other natural object. \r\n\r\nupon arriving home at e1120 700th ave., knapp, wisconsin, about 8:10 pm, the light appear to be stationary due west of us. i went inside to get my camera, a fuji finepix s8650. \r\n\r\nstanding in my front yard, by changing the focus of my camera lens, i was able to observe the object from my front yard through the viewer. rather than be stationary as the naked eye made out, the object appear to be bobbing up and down and back and forth sideways. i have taken video of this (see video a). i could not hear any sound from the object, though i likely was too far away to hear anything. \r\n\r\nduring this time, when not looking in the viewer, the brilliant light appeared to slowly descend to about 20 degrees above the horizon. i also observed a bluish-white light that was far less brilliant cross north to south toward the object (see photo b – the orb at the top of the photo is the brilliant light). when coming under the brilliant white light, the bluish-white light disappeared. to the northeast, another orange-red light headed in a west direction and to the southeast a third orange-red object and a blue light also headed west. the trio of these latter objects were about 45-50 degrees above the horizon. i felt a small amount of fear, as confronting something i couldn’t explain.\r\n\r\ncold (the temp was about 7 degrees), i went inside to view the video. after downloading and viewing, my elderly mother (who lives with my son and i) and i checked a window to see if the brilliant white object was still in the sky. it was. curiosity got the better of me, so i decided to drive my truck toward to see if i could get a better view.\r\n\r\ninitially i drove west on 700th avenue, which parallels the freeway north of it and then once across the border with the county line curves under it and parallels the freeway south of it. due to icy conditions, i drove about 40-45 miles per hour. the object appeared to be exactly due west of me when i paralleled the south side of the freeway. i felt a good amount of fear here, wondering what i was getting into and what i would do if the object closed on me. but the desire to know, and as a former journalist, the instinct that this was something potentially very important kicked in, and i decided i would keep observing it for as long as possible. \r\n\r\nat the intersection of the country road with wis. hwy. 28, about 9:05 pm, i exited my vehicle to see if i could better view it through my camera. a orange-red light traveled north to south toward the object and once under it disappeared. at that point, the white light diminished in brilliance – though remaining brighter than any star in the sky – and began moving west, paralleling the freeway’s south side. due to the proximity of a heavily lit truck stop to the north and the headlights of my truck, i was unable to take a quality video, and the object began to move before i could turn off my headlights and walk to a stand of trees that would block most of the truck stop’s lights.\r\n\r\ni immediately got onto the freeway and followed the object. traveling at about 75-80 miles per hour, i was able to close on it. during this time, the object’s color shifted from white to orange, though it still remained as brilliant as any other light in the sky.\r\n\r\nat exit 16 where county road t  intersects the freeway, i exited about 9:25 pm and parked at the top of the westbound entrance ramp, one of the higher points in the immediate area. by adjusting my camera focus, i was able to video record what appeared to be a set of three lights that formed a triangle pattern (see video c). the top light was orange and less brilliant than the other two. the bottom left light was yellow and about equal in brilliance to the bottom right light, which was red and blinking in a discernible pattern of blink-blink-blink for a second then a pause for a second. the yellow light sometimes went out but didn’t follow a pattern i could make out. the orange light always remained lit. the three lights remained exactly equidistant from one another, as if they were part of a single object.\r\n\r\ni re-entered the freeway but was unable to close on the object, following it to the wis. hwy. 65 exit, where i exited to get gas at the flying j. as leaving the truck stop at about 9:35 pm, i still was able to make out the object to the west, still paralleling the freeway, but dimmer and lower on the horizon, as it were farther way. at that point, i drove home.\r\n\r\nalong the drive home, i noticed two helicopters , both flying fairly low as paralleling the freeway. their lights blinked in a different pattern than the object, their lights were much dimmer than the object, and their rotors could be clearly heard.\r\n\r\ni arrived home about 10 pm, where i downloaded and watched the video taken at the county road t exit and then told the story to my son and mother. i wrote this account the following morning at 8:30-9:15 am.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

general direction is east. then a flash of red/orange light came from that direction but it seemed diffused looking. a similar red/orange flash came off the original object but with less intensity. my

outdoor wildlife. \r\non the morning of december 12, 2014 ( (i keep a log book/journal of days events and this is one of the entries) i was making my way out to the backyard gardens. i was on the path for the bird feeder and noticed a huge object next to the moon. it was very bright out that morning, almost seemed like it was day time. i stopped to look at the moon and made a mental note to find out what i thought was a planet next to it. whatever this was, it was huge!\r\nall of a sudden, i got this cold breeze that seemed to come from behind me. there was no wind that morning. it is a chill you get when perhaps you are watching a scary movie or something frightens you.\r\nwe have a lot of deer in our yard, many bucks. i know you have to be careful around them. i heard this voice in my mind say \"stay calm\" and my name. i was laughing to myself thinking i was losing my mind. \r\nthen for whatever reason, i looked straight up over my head and there it was! there were two huge round bright lights on either side of this triangular craft. it was moving slowly across the back yard.\r\nit was above the highest tree tops. i would estimate the height of approximately three telephone poles. \r\nit slowly moved over me, no noise, no vibrations, nothing. \r\nonce you have had an experience, especially up close as i had, you are in awe but also i feel you freeze i ran over to my son's bedroom window, yelling for him to look out his window but he works 2nd shift and was sound asleep. by the time i got back to the path which is only a few seconds (maybe a minute) this object was gone. the lights were huge.  the craft itself was about the size of 3 car lengths so maybe 45-50'. i didn't get to see the front of it well as when you have something that large silently going over you, you are trying to reason your mind with what you have seen. \r\nthe craft proceeded west. \r\ni wish i would have had a camera with me but i probably would have been so excited seeing this

who my family was except my mother. the day this happened to me is always vivid in my mind and it cant escape me for anything. the day went on with me being scared of every person i met; aunt uncles cousins. for some reason we were having a family dinner that day at my grandparents house. as the day went on i began to recall what i thought at the time as a dream. now i believe otherwise. what i recalled was something i could have never known since my parents didnt let me watch shows that would have aliens or crafts of the sort in them. the event which i know now was a memory happened like this; it was still night out, i was standing at the end of what appeared to be a spaceship, at the time i didn't have a description of what it was. it was long. i would say roughly 30 to 50 feet long more cylinder shaped but almost flat at he bottom. the walk way was down and a bright white light was shinning from it. the opening itself was roughly 10 to 15 feet across and 10 to 15 high. i was standing at the end waving at whom ever was inside. i remember holding someones hand but not sure who it was. i remember feeling the wind as the walk way went up and covered the opening. it began to take off and then black. after the beginning of the take off i cant remember anything else. i don't think it was a dream as i had never even heard or knew about ufo's at the time. this memory was so vivid and real to me. its was almost 26 years ago and i can still see the whole event in my head. it was almost like i knew the things inside. for along time i thought i might have been switched with another kids and i was in fact an alien genetically altered to look feel and even be human. i have since had kids and i fear that something like this may happen to them. i have since only one other time seen a ufo in my life. i want to know so bad all the detail and have thought about hypnosis to see if i can recall any thing from then.","distance":"20 Feet or

same type of objects were witnessed on two occasions. yesterday i was out on the back porch when my husband pointed out what looked to me like a jet at first. it was a quick presumption on my part and due to the cloud like trails it was leaving behind. but with a bit more observation it became obvious that it was not. it was moving far too slow to be a jet and was falling toward the ground. looking through the binoculars i could see two bright orbs of light at the leading edge which seemed to separate slightly from one another. the decent was far slower than i imagine gravity would bring a solid object down. it took at least five minutes to get from mid sky to where i could no longer see it behind the trees.\r\n\r\naround the same time today my husband came in to tell me that there was another one in the sky. this time i thought to grab my camera. it looked and acted almost identical to yesterday's sighting, a bright circle of light falling at a slow rate of speed leaving two trails behind it. two very fast jets flew across the sky from west to east in the same area as it descend. \r\n\r\nwhen i lost sight of it behind the trees i took a look around and spotted another one higher in the sky but in the same southern direction. it too look as though it was falling to the ground and at the same slow rate of speed. this one however broke into four segments but all four fell at the same rate. another jet flew by shortly before i lost sight of it. and then another, but this one came from the east, did a quick turn about above the falling object and returned east. these jets were far faster than commercial airlines fly.\r\n\r\ni did and still do feel a bit bewildered by what i saw and am very curious to know what exactly i witnessed. \r\n","distance":"Over One
