heading east. thought then it was drones but objects made no noise and started turning south while ascending to app. 250-300ft. snapped another picture from middle of parking, looked to see if anyone else was out there, heard voices but didnt see anyone. started recording video then and continued walking towards end/ back of the east parking area. thats when 5th object appeared still from east but this one was heading more sw, 4 object were now heading south, at this time heard what sounded like a shotgun. stopped recording, got in car pulled on work road and started driving down bacck side of work heading south, objects were now about 500 to 750 feet up, there was low clouds moving through area at this time, 5th object was still catching up to other 4, i was looking out left side driver window, trying to get to darker area of work, object moved higher into clouds. there was no erratic movement, thought maybe they might have been chinese lanterns. they moved smooth and when they turned south still maintained stright line movement but gradual ascension. didn't get opportunity to record again, whole episode lasted between 5 to 10 minutes, about 1/8th of a mile east is open

same type of objects were witnessed on two occasions. yesterday i was out on the back porch when my husband pointed out what looked to me like a jet at first. it was a quick presumption on my part and due to the cloud like trails it was leaving behind. but with a bit more observation it became obvious that it was not. it was moving far too slow to be a jet and was falling toward the ground. looking through the binoculars i could see two bright orbs of light at the leading edge which seemed to separate slightly from one another. the decent was far slower than i imagine gravity would bring a solid object down. it took at least five minutes to get from mid sky to where i could no longer see it behind the trees.\r\n\r\naround the same time today my husband came in to tell me that there was another one in the sky. this time i thought to grab my camera. it looked and acted almost identical to yesterday's sighting, a bright circle of light falling at a slow rate of speed leaving two trails behind it. two very fast jets flew across the sky from west to east in the same area as it descend. \r\n\r\nwhen i lost sight of it behind the trees i took a look around and spotted another one higher in the sky but in the same southern direction. it too look as though it was falling to the ground and at the same slow rate of speed. this one however broke into four segments but all four fell at the same rate. another jet flew by shortly before i lost sight of it. and then another, but this one came from the east, did a quick turn about above the falling object and returned east. these jets were far faster than commercial airlines fly.\r\n\r\ni did and still do feel a bit bewildered by what i saw and am very curious to know what exactly i witnessed. \r\n","distance":"Over One

minutes north of downtown minneapolis, minnesota.  north suburbs for short. \r\n\r\ni'll give you as much details as i can think of. \r\n\r\ni will start by saying the synchronicity in this was mind bending in its own.  i was in the process of telling a friend of mine goodbye and we were outside smoking a cigarette and i was facing west looking at the moon, what i am pretty sure is a faint mars and a really bright venus. infact you can see venus briefly at the start of the clip.  i noticed what i thought was another bright star sitting a little to the north of venus and it reminded me of the chilean navy ufo video. i said to her, \"hey crazy news in the ufo community.\" and thats when the \"star\" sitting north of mars began to rise. i announced to her basically holy smokes there is one now or else thats a plane with no flashing lights. after i focused on it for a few seconds i decided to run inside and grab my camera. its a sony hdr cx-330 handi cam.  when i returned outside the object had was moving from the western sky towards a south east direction and then turned towards the north and then started traveling east sky and continued until  trees blocked my view of it. towards the end of the video the object appears to fly but that is me filming up into the tree canopy. there are no leafs on the trees because its winter here so you could can see through them, thats why it looks like its flashing, it was a solid object, any flashing is because of filming through the trees. thats the reason i had to quit filming it was so low in the sky i was losing eye sight of it because of trees and structures. \r\n\r\nthe camera really doesn't do this justice. with the naked eye you could see an extremely shiny surface on what seemed to be a solid round object, but the lights so bright you cant see it on the film. it made no sound at all and its hard to see in the video but it would sway left and right at times. \r\n\r\nat about 14 seconds you also see another light come into frame in the second clip, and then zoom towards the object, i do not know if its some sort of weird glare some how or if its a shot of another object flying towards it. i did not see the second object at first when i was filming.\r\n\r\nthe first clip is the object coming my direction, the second is because i had to re position to get a shot above the tree cover that was behind me.   so its a front view and back view, of a bright ufo.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with

is on the south side of hilliard, and the columbus airport is due east of where i live. so, i am used to seeing aircraft every evening, coming and going to this airport\r\n\r\nin looking due west, i caught sight of a round white light, at an altitude of a plane flying over columbus, not on a landing course. the light was pulsating on a 1 second on, then a 3 second off, then repeated the whole time i observed it. the oddity was that the distance the objective covered when blacked out was tremendous. i would guesstimate it was 5 or 6 miles west of hilliard when i 1st saw it. it flew directly over columbus on an eastern course. from when i 1st saw it to when i last saw it, it covered at least 10 miles in 10 to 15 seconds! if it were the size of a commercial airliner, i estimate it's altitude at 30-35k feet.\r\n\r\nmy son and i have an interest in astronomy and planed, so after watching the object for 10 to 15 seconds, i ran approximately 50 yards to my front door, opened it and

i could not see any plane however, only the cloud getting bigger and longer. the speed of this cloudy object seemed faster than any of the jets on approach, more like a fighter jet at an airshow kinda speed.  as it got closer i could see that was producing an enormous contrail, take a regular, single contrail and stack four on top of one another then multiply that by eight or twelve lengthwise, at least!  the normal contrails were that sliver of skin wide at arms length, but by the time the object was almost over head this thing's contrail was as wide as both of my thumbs from the second joint to the tip put together lengthwise (like two thumbs-up put together and held sideways).  the contrail was a solid rectangle of white billowy contrail exhaust, like a well formed square edged rectangular column, not rolling not swirling not expanding not contracting not round tubes.. it was a solid rectangle column of smoke.  the contrail stayed solid, at an altitude of maybe 15,000 feet from one edge of the horizon to the other when it exited my field of view, for at least 20 minutes, i could still see remnants of it when i was driving home 30 minutes later.  now....The object.  the thing producing this massive contrail was a sliver of brilliant orange. almost hurt my eyes to look at it, it was that kind of bright. it was a very thin chevron, at arms length, when the orange chevron was almost overhead, the widest part of the chevron, the horizontal width, from front leading edge to tail at its midpoint was barely the same width as the piece of skin between my thumbnail and the side edge of my finger. from the midpoint to the outer edge of the chevron, the lateral length, it tapered to a sharp point just to the edge of the contrail, which was the about the length of my thumb tip to the second joint, and double that from end to end. i could see no vertical thickness of the chevron, and it was very defined along its edges, straight lines.  the angle of the tail edge was around 170 degrees after looking at a protractor, with the lead edge maybe 165. the gap between the chevron and the contrail was less than the chevron's widest part. and that was it- i could see no plane! i could see no wings! i could see no structure that was producing the contrail! i could only see this thin, super bright, super sharp, wide angled chevron leading this two story 8-room apartment building size contrail! no sound, ever, through the 5 to 10 minutes it took to go from the ene horizon, to just a mile north from overhead, making a gentle flat turn over town, then off to the nnw horizon.  i'd say it was coming in from the direction of st.Louis and heading toward wichita, and made it's turn over springdale.  it was easily less than half the altitude of the planes that were making contrails up high, and under the clouds that i could see.  never a sound. never saw anything other than the chevron and the contrail. i called the local airport, not the regional, but they said they couldn't tell me anything.  i have spent a year thinking about it, wondering why i don't report it, it has bothered me that no one else i have talked to saw it. the contrail  was huge, absurdly noticeable, it should have been on the news, caused accidents, something.  i have seen military jets playing over springdale before, making wide curves, leaving big contrails and exhaust plumes as they chased each other... this thing was way bigger than any fighter at that altitude and seemed at least as wide as two a380 side by side and stacked two high. i felt like the chevron might, or must, have been just the firey exhaust jet coming out the back of something that was invisible.  no weird shiny heat ripples, nothing, just a super bright chevron, followed by a giant contrail, fast as a jet, low altitude. i saw it, i know i saw it, wide awake, no hallucinogens, no beer, and at least one other walker that was out there at the park that day saw it, he was staring at it the whole time too.  anyway, i feel better now that this is out, and i really hope the owners of mufon aren't just coopted government shills. this world, our people, this whole thing we call reality and life and our future could do some much more, things could be better, if this type of information was shared instead of just becoming another national security interest.

time for focus that object with my telephoto lens. then i asked my friend for more details. he's replied to me \"first i thought it was a coin shaped star but why a star should appeared in morning

with my cell phone and turned behind to call you because numbers of time you were used to say that you had ufo sightings before what we used to laugh about. after i called you 2 or 3 times and looked around for, it was started to moving by it self. i swear it seems like something is floating or vibrating and trying to act like stay still minimum 4 to 5 minutes. but i was thinking about is there

west, right above the trees with a jet plane directly behind it in pursuit.It was so low that we were able to see the doors of the landing gear on the jet. this happened within seconds, my daughter started freaking out, because it scared her and she looked at me and said,\" please tell we just didn't just see what i thought we just did!\" all i could do was confirm with her what we had both saw. i was at my mother's house within 2 minutes and called my husband immediately because my daughter and i have always been sceptics but my husband had always been a believer. he told me and our daughter to draw what we saw immediately, so we sat in the car and we drew it out. we went into my mother's house and told her what we saw and my mother said she heard a roaring, rumble noise that vibrated the house. like an engine was accelerated to the max! we are still in shock, not really believing what we saw. my husband told me about this website and wanted me to report this.","distance":"101-500
