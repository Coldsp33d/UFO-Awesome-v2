30, 2017.  i was enjoying the scenery of biscayne bay as my cruise ship headed to the cruise port of miami, fl as was my usual custom when returning home from a cruise..At approximately 7:10 am i saw the familiar blinking lights of an airplane approaching the miami airport. i heard the usual sound of a plane . less than a minute later i noticed a very bright reddish orange orb of  light ascend over a building. at first i thought it was a light fixed on top of the building but it continued to slowly ascend until it hovered directly in the path of the plane.  i became frightened at that point thinking that i was about to witness a plane crash and suddenly the light ascended so fast to avoid the plane that it didnt seem real.  i couldn't believe that it moved and stopped so quickly, it hovered quite a few feet over the plane, staying there until the plane was well past that spot. it stayed there for about 30 seconds more and then disappeared so quickly.  it disappeared in a flash. it made no sound. it did not leave a trail or make a break in the clouds. it was just gone. the entire incident happened within a five minute period. i stood on the balcony a few minutes more in horrified amazement wondering what i had just witnessed. i hope to find out if anyone else actually saw what i had just seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

upper half of the window. i thought at first it must be a plane or perhaps venus. the object stayed bright white throughout the sighting but pulsated. it flashed off a few times but only for a second. i realized it could not be a plane because from where i was sitting, it remained in the same pane of glass in the upper half of our window. my husband said it was a street light but it was too high to be a streetlight. he tried to take a photo with his ipad and i went to get my sony camera. i took eight pictures through the glass and screen between 7:28 and 7:37. i checked to see if the pictures came out and what they looked like when i zoomed in. i continued to check if the object was still there and if moved. the object remained in the same place but it went from circular to egg shaped, from my vantage point. i saw another object that traveled towards the brighter and larger object that i was watching. it did not join the larger object and did not stay. it was there and then it wasn't there. at 8:00 (20:00) i went downstairs with my husband to get some dinner but decided to go outside to take a few more pictures. by then the stars were out and orion's belt was visible higher up but in the same easterly direction as the object i was observing. i took four photos between 8:18 and 8:20. the object appeared a little higher against the pine tree. street lights and car lights are visible in the photos in addition to the object and the stars. i don't know when the object left. it was gone by the time we finished eating. i tried to take a video but so far haven't found it on my camera. i probably didn't do it correctly. i have seen things that i can't explain while on airplanes. i am curious but not afraid of the sightings.

september 17 1976 my father had taken me deer hunting we were hunting with bow and arrow.  i was 15 almost 16 but he would always walk me in the dark through the woods to my treestand he always told me to sit still here i've seen deer here.My father was a quite the hunter, hunted in canada as well.Anyway i've never spoke of this before i've always felt it was supposed to be a secret somehow. it's been 40 years but i remember it like it just happened. my walk me through the woods as usual we found my treestand it wasn't like yet because my father used a flashlight to show me it he told me he been down there looking there was plenty of deer that will be coming out of the soybean field around 25 yards from my treestand on the edge of the wood line as soon as the sun came up. and he'd be on the opposite side of the field in his stand the field was probably 300 yards wide. anyway i got into my stand my father went out of sight maybe 45 minutes my eyes adjusted to the sun starting to rise had been a calm day no wind blowing no rain no nothin then i heard up the tree line the leaves on the trees rustling i looked up there the small trees were shaking back and forth making the leaves fall out i watched it has the tree started shaking closer and closer and closer to me as i looked up in the tree i fell what i can only playing as if you're driving down the highway on a hot day that hazy look you see on the road it was above the trees 15-20 feet coming down the tree line towards me i could see the sky but it was hazy and swirling  i was in a tree i'd say 16 inches in diameter when it got you my tree my tree started to shake i grabbed  it to hold on because it was shaking very hard meantime i was looking up it i'd say when i looked up at it it took two minutes for it to finally go past me over my head no more than 10 feet the only noise it made was what's the swishing of the wind and leaves i'm guessing it was 50 yards to 80 yards round as i looked up i could see the edge after it went by trees quite shaking and  the sky cleared up.  i sat and watch the tree shake and wimbrow until it was out of my sight i couldn't see no more trees shake it i know how my father was if i would have told him i probably would have got laughed at by him and his hunting club friends the only thing he said to me that morning around 10:30 he came back he said my face looked like it had gotten windburned.It stayed kinda reddish for a couple days. that's it.Thanks for listening feel good to tell it somehow","distance":"20 Feet or

saying,\"yeah, it sure looks like a star but it's too low to be a star. look it's actually moving closer. look now, from here it looks like it's hovering right over your house!\"  as we were getting closer it looked like it was brighter but it was also moving west. my mother stated,\"jody, what are we looking at?\"  i said to her,\"i think it's a real ufo. look it's hovering and then taking off again.\" by the time we made it to the driveway, the huge light was about 2-3 miles away. we kept looking westward through the trees in the bush and my mother said,\"i can stil see it.\" i looked as well and we could still see it out in the distance. my mother wanted to get in the car again and follow this massive light. i told her that it's too far already, we'll never catch up to it so we didn't bother chasing it. it didn't look like any man made lighting and there's no way it was a drone with lights on it. it was simply too huge of an object and it resembled a bright star that could hover and move very fast. what we both saw was very impressive and quite remarkable. this is a sighting that we both will never forget.

the evening was perfectly silent.  from that distance, i would have been able to hear a helicopter clearly.  i went back into the house and retrieved a pair of binoculars, and viewed the object through them.  as i focused the binoculars, i could see four smaller objects, two of which were visible only as single, white lights, one visible as a single red light, and one visible as a pair of white lights.  they were all very small, and flitting about the object like flies.  the fourth object appeared as if it might have been triangular in shape, but it was difficult to ascertain.  i dropped the binoculars down and called to my wife to come out and see, and as i kept my eyes on the object, a second object of the same configuration as the first appeared beside and below it, on its right-hand side.  there was no dark shape that suddenly illuminated, it simply appeared out of nothing.  both objects hovered together for a moment as my wife came outside and observed them with me.  after about two minutes of the objects hovering together, the original object began to move slowly to the north while emitting a flashing red light in its underside.  at this time, the smaller lights flitting about the first object disappeared. it was difficult to see if they went into the first object, or simply blinked out.  the second object remained hovering in a stationary position while the first object moved slowly to the north and disappeared behind a house across the alley from my own. i watched the second object for about ten more minutes, until it finally began to follow the path of the first object and move slowly to the north as well.  it took about a minute before it too disappeared behind the same house.\r\n\r\nthe objects were hovering in the center of the flight path for our local international airport, in the same position as a previous object spotted on january 26th (mufon file #81752).  planes had been taking off from the airport all day, but now, while i observed the objects, there were no flights departing the airport.  around 2100 hrs, departing flights resumed.  about an hour after the sighting, the westerly wind picked up once more.  i do not know if there is a correlation between these two events and the objects.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":81819,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.14914000285627,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01302017-0014","longitude":-114.06130089424138,"occurred":1485720900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1485796494000,"summary":"2 objects glowed yellow with red flashing light.  one was visible with several smaller lights buzzing around. second object appeared, then first flew away.  then second object flew away.

thin air a ball of light about 300 ft. from the front of my windshield. 300 ft above the ground. this object can manipulate light because the light that it was admitting ended around its horizon, as if it were in some invisible bubble. in the middle of this bubble of light was a sphere, the most purist led light i've ever seen. i say led because it had a bluish tint. the sphere itself was like a ball of plasma that was emitting light. very bright and white with bluish tint, but the whole bubble of light was very dim. hard to explain since i've never seen anything do that before with that kind of manipulation of light. this bubble with this sphere inside of it, did not reflect light on any surface around me. it was as if it didn't want to be seen. there were people doing things in their front yard in the area, but didn't even notice it. two young guys noticed it and started hollering and yelling, amazed at the ball of light they have just seen when i went around the block. the horizon of light around this object grew and then shrunk, about 6-8 times before disappearing in front of my eyes. i then drove my car around the block, that's when i saw two guys amazed at what they had just seen. they yelled out, \" wow did you just see that light?\" i just kept driving because i was even ashamed to say that it was a ufo, i still couldn't believe what i had just seen in front of me. since then i had seen about 4 more sightings in 2016 and one in 2017. when i looked directly into the sphere from my stationary position after stopping my car, it stopped growing and getting smaller and it just stayed there as if it paused, maybe it knew i was looking at it. this sighting comes a couple of months after my ex girlfriend told me about being abducted. she said she had a personal experience with the tall greys. after her telling me about this, i had spent some time with her on a couple of dates, and this is what happened to me. as far as i know i didn't have an personal encounter with beings like she did, but i have had some sightings of lights appearing in front of me, and i even recorded a video of one and put it on youtube already with my current girlfriend, who she also says have had experiences with et's in her lifetime. in the video it was her first time seeing something like this as an adult. believe this whoever reads this, that's
