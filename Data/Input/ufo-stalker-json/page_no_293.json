horizon. we saw a total of about 10 over about a 20 minute time span. they rose up from the horizon line to the ne in groups of 3 or 4, perhaps around the delray beach area. they slowly traveled south rising upward along the coast and disappeared into the low cloud cover just about due east of our house. they flew quite close together and were too bright to be drones. they didn't have flashing lights like standard aircraft, but more of a steady orange glow. they may have been far enough away (8 miles) to be over the ocean, but that still doesn't explain what manner of craft they were.\r\n\r\nplanes don't take off and group like that and i don't know of an airport north of the boca raton one nearer than the somewhat distant palm beach international. if anyone else saw them or has an idea of what they might be, i'd love to hear about it. here is a photo of a group of 4 facing east ne with the rightmost one about to disappear into the clouds.","distance":"Over One

to the car.  i looked toward the western sky and saw what looked like a very bright planet (white light).  sky's tonight were crystal clear with moonlight.  all planets visible as well.  the light was so large i couldn't help but look at it more.  i saw on the right side of this light a flashing red intermitent light.  i thought at first it was an airplane.  i continued to observe object for five minute but no apparent flight path to the naked eye. to the naked eye it was stationary. i was so shocked at this enormity of this light i ran inside to get my 10 x 50 power hunting binoculers. by comparison this white light was maybe 10 x (ten times) the size of any planet and 100x as bright.\r\n\r\ni returned outside with binoculars and began to focus on the object.  the light began to move farther east and north towards me. the object became crystal clear in the binoculars. this large light began to take wild paths directionally, up and down, left and right, and 90 degree turns.  i was abslutely stunned to see this large light come from the direction of an enourmous ship, curcular in shape diameter but with a more rounded bottom.  this ship easily 10x the size of the large light.  the ship was so clear in the binoculars i could see the bottom construction.  i could see the lines of compartments unform in nature.  the large ship had no lights but cleary visible silouette in moon/star light. due to the angle in sky i could not see the top of large ship but appeared i could see 90% of bottom except the western edge.  the ship remained stationary.  i viewed it for approximately five minutes before it completely disappered.\r\n\r\nit was hard to tell but it looked like two smaller white lights came from the direction of the ship and joined the large light.  the large light became stationary after bouncing in the sky.  what amazed me was these lights came together and transformed themselves into a very large multi colored disk.  the disk had a solid band of lights around it with very clear red, blue, green, white lights. the interior of the disk, what looked liked the bottom of disk, had very clear colored lights, not solid but more polka dot pattern.\r\n\r\ni observed this phenominon for 50 to 60 minutes and went back inside.  i stuck my head outside 15 minutes later approximately 9:15 p.M. centeral time usa, and object disapeared.  hard to tell distances.  to the naked eye large light clearly visible but ship was not.  with binoculars everything was as clear as if someone took a photograph.  my 83 year old mother saw everthing

glowing object flying from the nw from our present viewing position moving e/ne. my wife said, \"what's that\"! i said, \"i don't know\". i had been watching it before she noticed it as i was trying to determine what it was for myself. my wife went inside with our son and i was about to write it off as another airplane but decided to keep watching it just for the heck of it. the first thing i noticed was it's unusual illuminated color, and i didn't notice any strobe or marking lights like i'd seen on planes flying in the area many times before. then i noticed how fast it was flying which then lead me to see how high it was flying as well! i thought it might be a satellite but it was much too dim to be one of those. the object moved in, what seemed to be, a perfectly straight trajectory from the nw to the ne. not much else was noticed about the object at this time. then another, very-bright, object appeared suddenly out of nowhere!! well that really got my attention!!! this object appeared to be flying in the same, perfectly straight, trajectory as the other object. it got even brighter, much like the sun or a star, and then pulsed a couple of times between bright and dim before completely disappearing! i tried to see if i could locate it visually but the object could not be found. i quickly looked for the previous object and much to my amazement it was still within view. not much had changed with this object but i continued to watch it anyway. at the approximate location where the second object disappeared, this object started getting brighter and pulsing as well!! it too soon disappeared! i looked vigorously to see if it had been blocked by a tree or something but to no avail. the object was simply gone! it was then that i knew, or at least believed, that i had witnessed 2 ufo's. their illumination, flight path, and supernatural behavior is what has lead me to this conclusion. i am not writing this report to be right. i am simply sharing my experience with others who may be able to help me understand what i saw. i would not be offended it i was proved wrong, but i would like for this to be done scientifically if at all possible. thank

has been an eventful night so far. at 6:12pm i went outside to the backyard and looked around the night sky. though there are streetlights i can still see the prominent constellations and tonight the sky is clear. i looked south and saw orion and about 10 degrees below orion's belt (which points on an angle downward) i saw a large bright star which was as large as venus is these days, but not as strikingly brilliant. i could see sirius a little over to the right and below it a few degrees. it was larger than sirius. i thought to myself \"that's odd i don't remember seeing a star there before \" and watched it for a few seconds, then it abruptly started to move on a straight path horizontally and at the same level (aprox. 12 degrees above the horizon) and was moving rather rapidly. it moved at a steady speed with no variance straight toward the south-east. there was no sound, and it didn't vary in brightness or shape.  it was a white orb-shaped star-like something. i was soon going to lose sight of it due to a building next door, so i walked toward some stairs so i could be higher and watch it for a longer time.  i took some steps toward the stairs and glanced briefly and i could still see it moving in the same manner. then i looked down to climb several steps and looked and it was gone. i climbed up to the second story and scanned all around and it was nowhere to be seen.\r\ni did a few things around the house and decided to report this 6:15 sighting here. altogether i watched it for about 6 seconds.\r\n i went outside again at 7:00pm and looked at the sky to see if there was any detail i had forgotten or miscalculated and then saw a small, white pinhead sized orb moving on a arcing trajectory from gemini down toward orion. it was fading and then brightening as it moved and it moved at a steady speed. it continued past betelgeuse (the left shoulder star) then i lost sight of it due to some branches. i watched it for about 10 seconds altogether. i came in, took note of the time and continued with this report.\r\nat 7:14pm i went out again and looked at orion and saw another white, pinhead sized orb moving straight down from above orion toward bellatrix (the right shoulder star) then it curved under orion's belt. it was visible for the whole duration with no variance of light.  i lost sight of it due to the same branches of my neighbour's tree. i watched it for about 7 seconds.\r\nthere are advantages to seeing only the major stars with darkness between because anything moving catches your eye. we have seen a lot of activity from our backyard over the years and just the other day i realized i hadn't seen anything happen for about two months. one member of my household mentioned he had seen a moving star several nights ago.  so it felt good to see tonight's activity. we keep our eyes on the sky at night as a habit because we have witnessed so much and are very curious about what we're seeing.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

amateur astronomer) when i noticed seven bright white lights lined up in a v formation approaching my location from the north. as the object approached it moved very, very slowly and it appeared the seven individual lights did not move in relation to each other, therefore the seven lights appeared as if they were attached to one very large object. as these lights slowly moved past my location they slowly turned from bright white in color to all red in color. if indeed this was one large object instead of several smaller objects then i would estimate that it had to be at least one football field in size or larger! at no time could i see any structure or connecting material between the several individual lights because it was too distant for me to see it in that much detail. for the entire time i witnessed this object, it made no noise whatsoever. also, the speed that this object(s) was moving was, in my opinion, far too slow to be any kind of fixed wing aircraft for they need to move faster for their wings to provide sufficient lift to keep them airborne.  before the object appeared, my sister and i were taking astronomical photographs so when i pointed out this object to my sister she took a few photographs of this formation of lights in the night sky. unfortunately, i have since lost the negatives which my sister created of this formation of lights but i do still have two photographs of this formation of lights and they are quite amazing!!! they show something very unexpected and incredible about this formation of lights and that's the only way i can describe them. you have to see them for yourself to understand. unfortunately i can't make any copies of these photos to show you all because i have since lost the negatives.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

startled us. we instinctively jumped up and opened the window to look outside, when suddenly a huge black triangle moved directly over the top of the house and out heads at an extremely low altitude. the lights observed, along with the black underneath of the craft, made a perfect triangle shape. the craft also appeared solid due to it blotting out the stars as it was observed. the lights themselves were completely static and did not blink or pulsate, with a larger dim white light positioned at the centre of the craft. we both observed the object a it slowly drifted off into the distance until it was out of sight. \r\n\r\nupon seeing the craft i knew it was not a conventional aircraft due to the extremely slow but steady rate at which it moved, long with the steady unblinking lights - and needless to say we was both left shaken and concerned as to what we had just witnessed. \r\n\r\na craft of that size flying at such a low altitude over a populated area seemed completely out of the question to myself as i tried to reason that what we witnessed could have been a secret military aircraft such as the tr-3b - but again what would such a secretive project be doing flying so low over populated areas? \r\n\r\ni simply submitted this in hopes for some closure on what we witnessed that night.
