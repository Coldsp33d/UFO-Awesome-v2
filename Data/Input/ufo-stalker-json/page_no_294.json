they would stop and remain still.  suddenly, they flew off at 90 degrees and disappeared - fast like a comet but no tail.  both of us looked at each other, shrugged, and never spoke of it.  never reported it and never really gave it any consideration except, just thinking it was one of those strange encounters in the military. no physical effects... it appeared to just observe us and fly away.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

circled together for a couple of seconds. the lights were randomly appearing and moving for around 10 minutes. at one point the light was moving upward in straight line, it seemed liked there were around 5 lights blinking one after the other. when i first saw the lights i thought it was that thing that airplanes used, but the lights kept moving in weird way, which made me think of a ufo. i got several videos, i'm going to include a 18 second one and see if you can determine if they were ufos and not just ordinary lights. after around 10 minutes the lights stopped appearing as often, and eventually stopped as fas as i could tell. i went inside after and looked over the videos i took.

then sometime in between 1979 to 1982). it was a warm, sunshine day with no clouds, clear blue sky. i was riding on the raised dirt trail going from south to north along the mount anthony union high school field on park st in bennington vt. i was a little girl, in the summer of 1980 i would have been 10 or 11 years old depending on if it was before or after my summer birthday.\r\n\r\ni stopped riding when i noticed a quiet, low, smoothly gliding big heavy black triangular craft over my head. its width was wider than the road next to me.  it was as high as double the length of the telephone poles next to me. the bottom surface of the craft was smooth, looked like a very dark grey matt brushed metal. there were no windows, wheels or any type of elements attached to the bottom, the bottom was perfectly smooth. i remember when it was over my head, it emitted coldness from it. i felt the coldness on my body, especially on the back of my bare neck and arms, gave me chills. i assumed it was cold from being high in the sky recently. it was gliding so low that i couldn’t see it once it passed me beyond the trees over the horizon of the tree lines. i was perplexed and looked around to see if anyone else was noticing this, i only saw one station wagon drive on the road down below me, driving in the opposite direction of the craft and the driver didn’t seem to notice anything, the driver was just looking straight ahead with a blank look on his/her face. after the craft left, i felt odd, overly relaxed, without any thoughts traveling through my mind during the rest of my bike ride, basically spaced out. \r\n\r\nif i remember correctly, the bike ride from my home to my friend’s house usually took about 12 minutes. at this point i was only about 2 to 3 minutes away from her home. when i got to her front door, i felt very relaxed, light headed and spaced out. she answered the door with an exasperation of where i had been, i was supposed to be at her home hours ago. she told me i told her on the phone i was leaving hours ago. and i typically would have done that, i would have left when i told her i was going to. i was confused by her confusion. she asked me if anything was wrong. i was confused, i couldn’t remember anything about my morning, past the moment i saw the craft. i couldn’t remember talking to her on the phone, i couldn’t remember leaving my home. i couldn’t remember my bike ride up to the point of seeing the craft. and up to this day, i don’t remember anything about that morning before i saw the craft. and i wasn’t so shocked by seeing the craft that it could have done that to my mind. it didn’t scare my senses out of me, it was quiet, peaceful, and smooth and it passed me by quickly enough before i couldn’t see it anymore. it didn’t scare me at all. it was as peaceful as watching a butterfly. but it was already afternoon by the time i had arrived at her home and i couldn’t understand why.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet

moving in different directions, over the picnic area (towards the south), between 45 and 60 degrees elevation. stopped to look for a few minutes. some (about half) moved to form a circle which rotated for about half a minute, then dispersed to form a scattered pattern with the other lights.The lights were of varied diameter and brightness and changed brightness. continued jogging eastward and saw fewer lights (10 to 15) which moved in scatterd directions. on reaching the intersection (corner) of east memorial loop drive, saw what looked like a normal moon (above the clouds, which were low and very thick overcast) and the lights had seemed to disappear. was ready to forget about the event when i had reached the corner but then saw the \"moon\" break apart into three white lights, two of them moving in small arcs, from bottom to top and on each side to rejoin in the center. this was very alarming so i stopped. other lights also appeared above the clouds. i stopped another jogger asking him to look at the sky and he was also stunned. he thought maybe they were strobe lights. i pointed out the shape the lights were then creating, a specific rectangular shape with the lights on the top and bottom corners moving together (up and down over 1 or 2 seconds) to form concave arcs on the left and right sides of the rectangle. the jogger said \"i dont know what to think\" still

still present.When i arrived at my car at 8:00 pm there wer no lghts and no moon,. i then drove to exit the park and looked in the same area of sky (south, se and east) and there were no longer any

a planet!  i stopped as it didn't seem right. it keeped coming and getting brighter at a speed faster than the blackbird! since it was coming so fast and curving toward the front of my house i ran to the front and in that short time (seconds)  it was coming down toward the street. i saw a neighbor walking toward me(going home with groceries) and asked did she see it , it stopped right in front of me. she said she did and commented on how fast it was coming and then stopped in front of us. it was all a shimmering white about 30 ft long and about 15 to 16 feet tall.  then in an instant it seemed to turn around with like a small snout in front i had not seen before and then headed west so fast it was out of sight in about 3-5 seconds!! i couldn't believe it and my neighbor couldn't either! i thought i reported it before but not in such detail.  i had seen one previously but it was long ago and only consisted of a light coming from south to north very fast and high in the southern sky , i first thought it was a meteor but then it stopped for a couple of seconds made a left turn and headed east again very fast. in both cases there was no sound and no flashing

 for the past three weeks my husband and i have been getting up early to drive around and look for deer since deer season was active at the beginning and a lot have been seen on the side of the roads, we have really been impressed with hwy 1125 close to the small town of newport..  the past two mornings before jan. 25th were pretty eventless.  this morning started with all kinds of deer probably over 30, raccoons, hogs.  it was the best morning we had.  we started at 0130 and around 3am we were ready to go home but have been down speights road right off of 1125 a few times to either look at our map or change drivers.  give or take a mile down the road is a curve with a secluded cow farm, we decided to stop there and see if any other deer were around but this time we pulled up and went to the right a bit stopping just after the electrical pole with a large cable going to the ground.  we turned off the car and all the lights, my husband climbed up and sat on the door/window and was looking with his night vision and i stayed in the car it was cold out but there were millions and millions of stars shining and the sky was as clear as it ever has been, i noticed a brighter than the brightest star but never thought more than it was beautiful.  i would turn on my flashlight every couple of minutes if i heard rustling of branches or my husband asked me to. the last time i turned on my light it was for an extended time that time.  when i turned my light out i noticed right in front of the car that a star looked close, as i watched, started to notice it wasn't still but moving closer slowly and  having little movements as if the wind was moving it being brighter and whiter than ive ever seen almost looking light a diamond.  i said my husbands name two or three times without an answer so then i tapped his leg, he climbed out of the window to sit down and i pointed at the \"star,\" with him being speechless except for saying, we knew this baby, in less than five minutes the star had moved below tree line about what looked like half a mile away, my husband said, \"there are more coming,\"  i noticed four circular objects in perfect row being a hazy orange, line up perfectly to the left of the star.  appeared that when the star got brighter and dimmer then the objects would move into a chevron form, a \"v\", again within less than five minutes there were two more objects that joined the first four but they came from the left of me behind us. the star then came slightly closer to us, two more objects arrived but stayed to the center of the star and other objects.  i had become nervous because they kept showing up and we were sitting ducks in the pitch dark and everything turned off.  a few minutes passed and i couldn't take it anymore and had to leave.  the star nor objects \"chased\" us or showed any kind of threat, almost calming when it first started.  we drove up and out of speights road noticing that the star had raised to above tree level and we could see it until we got to the overpass going over hwy 287 back into bowie but just before we got to the over pass an extremely low large craft that looked like a plane or space shuttle returning to the ground went from out right to our left, very shiny metal, no writing or decals and three large green lights on the back of it.  once over the overpass we never saw anything again.   iphone or android phones didn't catch anything?  would draw diagram if wanted.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet,

outside of superior wisconsin on county highway b just past pattison state park. just after rounding the final curve in the road heading due east to my home, i noticed what i first thought was a large, very low flying plane in the distance about 2 miles directly ahead just to the right of a local radio tower. it seemed to be fairly large like a big, twin engine private plane and appeared white or light gray in color. however, i couldn't make out any detail because of the twilight conditions except for its general tubular shape and a bright red light on its left hand side. since it appeared to be moving so very slowly in the distance, i assumed that that it was a plane in the process of banking away from me and that i was seeing was it's red portside wing navigation light. i had a car right in front of me and also oncoming traffic so i could only glance at it. i thought that the object acted oddly as it was so low and seemed to be slowly drifting rather than turning or moving as a plane would. that's when i suddenly noticed a bright, reddish ball of light pop up a hundred yards down the road from me. it appeared suddenly from behind some obscuring  trees near the south side of the road, shooting up to tree top level, hovering briefly and then moving quickly towards me paralleling the right hand shoulder of the road. it's flight path had a slight wobble to it but was more or less a straight line, horizontal and probably only 50-75 feet above the ground. as it neared my convertible, it suddenly veered to the northwest and passed almost directly over my car at perhaps 20-30 mph before i lost sight of it due to obscuring trees on my left near the road. the object appeared to be about 4-6 feet in diameter and spherical to oval in shape. the most remarkable thing was the multitude of small but bright, randomly flashing multicolored lights which appeared fixed as if imbedded into some kind of hidden structure. the rapidly blinking colors were predominantly red but also with noticeable green, blue and yellow lights. as it passed overhead, i saw a shimmering, almost transparent membrane surrounding all of the lights, sort of like a giant soap bubble. there were no props or drone structure visible. as it was passing over the evergreens their tops seemed to violently sway as if in a strong wind. it was soundless and exhibited no external means of propulsion. after i lost sight of the orb's lights, i noticed that the distant object that i had first seen was now gone. i drove around locally  for a while but saw nothing unusual. i felt nothing unusual during the encounter other than astonishment and had no apparent missing time. the car ahead of me on the road seemed to slow down so i believe he had seen it but he didn't stop and kept going. there were two cars right behind me who may have witnessed this also but they didn't stop either. pity, i would have liked to have compared notes. the total time of the encounter was probably no more than 2-3 minutes. no electrical or electromagnetic effects to my vehicle noted. the sky had a high overcast but the weather was stable with no storm clouds in the local area.

 i'm guessing.  i went back into the house and retrieved my camera and video camera.  i had the camera on a tripod, and attempted to take a photo of the object.  all i got was a blurry dot (poor quality camera).  then i set up the video camera, and recorded four minutes of video.  during this time, the object was stationary.  once again, all i got was black screen.  at this point, i went back in the house and retrieved a pair of binoculars.  i put the camera back on the tripod, and set the binoculars on top of it so they would be stationary, and not jittery in my hands.  what i saw through the binoculars was a crescent-shaped object, glowing white-green in colour.  the points of the crescent were aiming upwards, and at the bottom center of the crescent was a flashing red light.  i estimated that the red light blinked on and off once every second.  i called my wife out to look at it, and at first, she thought it was simply a star.  but as she looked through the binoculars, she was amazed. \"that's no star!\" she told me.\r\nthe location of the object was in the direction of the local international airport.  i would estimate that it wasn't over the airport itself, but it was directly in the flightpath of commercial airliners. while i was observing the object, i noticed a jet departing (i could see the running lights and hear the jet engine) from the airport to the north of the object's position.  in eighteen years of living at this address, i have never witnessed an airliner take off from that direction.  it was as if the airliner was told to fly around the object to avoid it.  after approximately 35 minutes, during which time the object never moved, i took my camera equipment back in the house, and remained inside for about twenty minutes more in order to warm up.  at approximately, 2115 hrs, i went back outside, and the object was gone.  i wish i had put on a jacket and stayed outside to witness its departure!
