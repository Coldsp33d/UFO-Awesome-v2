to frys and such to meet someone and i wanted to bring along a few things even though i knew it wouldn't be too long there. my mom and elder cousin were lightly bantering in the car as i struggled to unlock the back seat door. and after a few grunts of disdain i had finally gotten it open, and hopped in immediately to escape the bitter cold, only to be told by my mom at the last minute to get the electric card and that's when my frustration kicked in and i swiftly hopped out the car so i could be in & out since all i was wearing for an ex use of a jacket was a thin cotten cardigan. stomping my way back to front door i turned to take a quick look up at the stars since i'm pretty fond of star gazing and i thought, 'a second look couldn't hurt'. how i was wrong. there in the sky amidst a few scattered stars was a unsettling and strangely lit \"star\". i had paused for a minute to observe it's movements because i knew i couldn't outright claim it to be something without full proof. it hadn't exhibited any strange signs so i went cautiously back into the house to go fetch the card. but when i rushed back out to observe it again, i saw the diamond shaped object,almost like a star from heaven brighten and dim at such a rate that was unknown to the casual stars i was used to seeing, and began to dissipate as soon as that. i was frantic and nervously yelled to my family members if they had seen what i saw, but no answer, only a curt yell to \"hurry the hell up!\". after that i rode with them silently, questioning my beliefs and all that we know as ares, and how quickly we are to feed our egos and proud ourselves thinking we're the most advanced thing to come. i thought of how wrong we are, and once again fell into a state of contemplating. i need to be honest right now, this isn't the first time i've seen a ufo in my neighborhood and i've also had strange occurrences in my house since i began to question and wonder about other life, going as far as speaking openly about it to others. i saw another ufo right when we got to frys and since then i've had this overwhelming sense of dread. please help me figure this out, i have a strange sense that something badight happen soon.","distance":"101-500

roads.  on january 14, 2017 around 4:05pm in the afternoon, i decided to take some photos of the setting sun which just had started breaking through the clouds near the snow-capped mountains in the distance.  i took three pictures with my android phone within a minute's time, and continued on a walk with my dog.  the next day i opened one of the photos to show a friend in the house i live.  when i zoomed in further and further, i noticed a strange grey-tinted circular to diamond shaped image in my photo getting bigger, blending in like a chameleon with the changing sky, mountains, and everything else.  the image is grey-ish and does have a pale curved cross indication on it when zoomed in closer.  i am not able to judge distance away from where i took photos but image has to be more than mile or two from where i was, short of the mountain range in the distance.  i showed it to this friend in the house and a couple other people.  we wondered what the image was.  none of us had ever seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nwe small-talked about it in the house but at that moment, i never thought to open the other photos until much later overnight when i was near sleep.  i thought to myself that i had taken the other two photos, and wondered if the image might be in those as well.  one of the other photos, after zooming in quite a bit, has the circular to diamond shaped orb image in the distance as well, but with a somewhat different appearance on it than the other photo.  when zoomed in, this 2nd photo has four symmetric darker circular indications on the lower edge of the image, with a pale mid-section, and a darker top couple of sections on the image.  the third photo i have does not have this grey orb image, i assume because i had panned over on the horizon not capturing the image when i took this photo.  i did include this third photo for viewing as well.\r\n\r\nfrom what i can gather, the image on the two photos is not a dust spot on the lens because a dust spot would be at the same spot on each photo.  i do not have these strange orb images on any other personal photos i have, nor have i ever noticed in my lifetime images such as these on photos i have ever taken or seen.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

bright light and whirring sound.  the light came through the bedroom window next to me.  i heard this low pitch whirring sound, unlike anything i was familiar with.  there was no other noise which seemed strange, because i had dogs in the yard.  as i tried to get up and look out the window, i realized i was paralyzed.  the sound and light lasted approximately 15 minutes.  i went back to sleep and explained to my wife what had happened the next day.\r\n\r\n  the second encounter was also late night or early morning and again my wife and i were in bed.  i awoke levitated approximately two feet above my mattress.  on my wife's side of the bed i observed two small figures.  there was also a third figure at the foot of the bed.  all three were wearing hooded cloaks and appeared to be approximately four to five feet tall.  as i levitated above my bed, i could feel my body being examined.  there was no pain and the figures remained motionless.  after approximately thirty minutes, my body abruptly dropped to the bed.  i was awake and had regained my ability to move.  breathing heavily and wet with sweat, i awoke my wife.  i explained what i had just encountered and she seemed unconcerned.\r\n\r\nencounter three was a little less eventful.  at the time of my encounters, i was employed as a sheriffs deputy.  this event occurred while i was on duty and in my patrol vehicle.  it was winter and i was on a well lit, well traveled road, approaching a railroad crossing.  the crossing had no lights or mechanical arms.  as i approached the crossing, i noticed a bright light to my right.  the light was a great distance away and was not moving.  it was a clear night with no moon or stars.  the time was approximately 7pm.  i kept my eye on the light, looking for movement or something to help me identify it.  it never moved and it was definitely not a earthbound light.  getting to the railroad crossing, my vehicle stopped and i was still trying to figure out the light source.  the next thing i remember was being at the railroad crossing and looking at the clock on my dash.  it was approximately 9pm.  had i been sitting on a well traveled road, at a railroad crossing for two hours?  the light was gone and i continued my work.  i have no memory of what happened those two hours and can only speculate on a possible abduction.\r\n\r\n  i have had no other encounters and have shared these with many people.  the encounters were interesting, but not alarming.  do i believe in aliens?  i can only tell you my experiences and let you decide.  something happened and i have relayed the information.  maybe i'll have another encounter, that will prove they exist.\r\n ","distance":"Over One

quickly in a downward diagonal direction. it was sort of far away and though we followed it a bit with a car, we couldn't be sure what it was but we felt like it had to be a ufo. when arriving home, my two friends sitting in the back seat both felt a presence behind them but saw no one when they instinctively turned towards it. we decide to rush inside when all of a sudden we see the saucer again, much much closer this time. it was clearly a disc-like shape with flashing blue and white lights and a quiet machine sound barely louder than the strong wind we were also hearing. we all dropped the bags we were carrying to run towards the street to get a better view, but it was already descending diagonally downwards fast and it quickly fell below the tree level in less than 15 seconds. because it was so fast, barely anyone could pull out something to record with but somehow one of us already had our phones out and took a very unclear video. we have heard the noise again but haven't looked because we are scared.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:26:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional
