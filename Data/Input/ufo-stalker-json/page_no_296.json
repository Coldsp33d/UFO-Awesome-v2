held on both sides of my sled by my brother & a friend of his. they, wishing to play a cruel joke on me, turned my sled around and pushed me over the back side of the hill which was uncleared and very steep. the sled took off at a tremendous speed which made it nearly impossible to avoid the many trees & rocks that were in my path. as i approached the very bottom of the hill i unfortunately ran in to a tree. upon contact my body was thrown a short distance in to another tree which ruptured my kidney & spleen rendering me paralyzed from the waist down. as i lay there unable to move anything other than my head & arms, i constantly kept watch up the hill waiting for my brother to come down and help me; to my surprise he left me there. this caused me to go in to a panic, because where i was located was so deep in the woods no one could possibly see me, or even find me unless they were told i was there. after about 30 minutes of laying there it began to get dark; as the darkness set in i noticed a strange orange glow in the sky above the trees; then suddenly what appeared to be a heat force surrounded me; than a figure appeared before me that resembled an old faded brown robe. i could not understand what was happening, so in my attempt to figure it out i began to look for details so as to make sense of what i was experiencing; but what i could not see confused me even more. in my search to figure out what was before me i noticed there were no hands or feet to be seen; it was just a robe that covered some form of energy. than suddenly i was placed on my sled, and it began to move within this heat field out of the woods with this robe in the front of me creating the appearance that someone was pulling me along. as we moved out to the sidewalk along the main street i constantly looked through this heat field and watched cars going by, and wondered if they could see me as i could see them; even though the heat field made everything appear a bit blurry. in quick time i was pulled directly to the front door of our house; and upon my arrival the rope attached to the sled that was held by the robe dropped to the ground and the robe floated off and disappeared into the darkness.

walker, mn around 2:30am.About 10 miles out from walker i noticed a bright point of light in the se ahead of me. i thought it might be a bright star. as i drove the point of light begsn to grow continuously. at first i thought it to be a plane but it was moving to slowly towards me. it had no flashing lights so i know it wasn't a helicopter either nor was it a hot air balloon. i slowed my speed to about 5-10 mph as i watched it approach and grow in size. the object continued its path until it hovered over head. the object was shaped similar to an hourglass. both the bottom and top structures were round like hockey pucks. bottom was like 2 pucks stacked then the middle was hourglass shaped then 2 more hockey pucks atop that. on the top of the top strucure (hockey pucks for lack of better shape comparison) a very tall spire almost like a radio tower continued for about 100ft. the spire had blue/green, red and white lights continuously covering it. the puck sections each were the approximate size of 4 story buildings and both had a continuous clean, bright white light that wrapped around with round red,green and orangish lights spuraticly above and below white light all around the puck shaped portion. the middle curved section between the puck shaped portions was about 50-75ft high also with lights. the object at its closest to me was about 100-200ft above ground and above me moving about 1-5 mph. i reached for my spot light i use to shine deer but was unable to reach it with an intention of shining it at the object. the object continued past me and i accelerated and continued on to the casino. there are 3-4 towers with ligjts along this section of hwy between cass lake and walker. there is also a private landing strip along the hwy. this object was not one of the towers or anything that would use a landing strip or pad. objects this size and shape should not be in the sky or able to fly. when the object was ovet head i lowered my window and i could hear no sound from object. no engine or sound of burners as in a hot air balloon. it also appeared to have a metal exterior. no visable windows. the white light was like ive never seen. hard to explain. it was the cleanest, brightest white light i've ever seen. all the lights were. when i arrived at the casino i ran into a friend at the entrance. as i explained to him what i had just witnessed a door security guy overheard my conversation. he approached and he said he has seen the same shaped object before as well. m a biologist and have been very skeptical of these kind of stories, as they are a dime a dozen here in northern minnsota, especially on reservations. now i don't know what to do or think about it.

turned to the direction that it came from i saw 2 more lights coming in our direction. same color, size, path, and speed. i asked my daughter to video them also. she did but she did not have too much space on her phone so when those faded out approximately in the same place as the first one she stopped recording. that wasn't it because we saw 2 more appear about 2 blocks away, it was a cloudy night and the lights just appeared below the clouds and come straight down our street again, same routine. she began recording again, by this time we were all excited not to mention tipsy. we had quite a bit of fireworks going off in the neighborhood that night but not on our block. you can hear some in the video in the background. but what we saw was definitely not fireworks. then we saw the last 2 lights appear and begin coming down the same path, by this time we couldn't believe what we were seeing. they all came down our street with absolutely no sound. they were the same color and as soon as the first pair would disappear the next two would appear a couple of blocks away. we didn't feel frightened or anything like that, just in awe. by the time the last two were going over us we were waving at them and wishing them a happy new year.\r\non the 3rd of january i saw that another houstonian family celebrating the same night also saw and recorded video of what looks to me to be the same lights but their sighting was a little different as they saw more than 2 at a time. i also began searching youtube to see if i could find any other houston sightings and i happened upon a video that was shot on new years of 2013. they also looked like the same type of lights. so i'm not sure what is going on but i am sure that these lights were not planes or helicopters, drones or lanterns and definitely not fireworks.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

noticed a large silver saucer craft hovering near crescent lake. i jumped off the swing and ran towards the lake in our back yard. the craft was about 50 feet round with a dome on it. the craft was silver, but the top part was very bright white. the craft seemed to wobble slightly, but to immediately correct itself.\r\nit was tree tip high and came towards me and ended up hovering over our house. i ran inside to tell my dad and get him to come outside, but he didn't. when i came back outside it was still there. when i looked up inside of the bottom of the craft, i could see two bright white lights rotating in side. one went clockwise and the other went counterclockwise. \r\nthen it slowly moved toward the lake and hovered over the edge of the far side of the lake. it then moved 4 or 5 blocks near the banyan trees and stoped. a laser like beam shot out of the craft and entered the water at an angle. that lasted for 2 seconds. then the craft slowly moved towards the south, then slowly arose to the sky until it looked like a star.\r\n\r\ni was in boy scouts at the time, so i think it was about 1969. i lived near the lake until 1974 when we moved. i don't remember what month it was. it was late in the day, just as the sun was setting. the whole thing lasted about 15 minutes. not sure what color the laser light was, didn't know about lasers at the time.","distance":"21-100

(see drawing # 1 attached) our first thought was that a car was coming but when we looked up we saw a bright white sphere that was heading towards the field. (see drawing #2 attached) i ran towards my sister who also came to me. we were so terrified that we both grabbed the mail box post. when we noticed that the sphere was farther, we ran home to tell our family who immediately watched through the window.  one of my brothers said and i quote: “this explains the energy surge we experiment minutes ago”.  my other brother said: “it looks like the light i saw with mom when i was three”. and my mother replied: “we are not alone in the universe”. after the stress was over and the sphere gone, we wanted to return outside to continue to play. my mother told us that it was too late because it was 10h30 pm already. we were both surprise because for us, it felt like we were playing outside since a short time. \r\nthe normal life continued, but i stayed with a feeling of strangeness… incomprehension… of missing time…\r\na few years later, i did a nightmare. i was on a metallic table unable to move. i felt that something was “moving” around me but i couldn’t see anything except for a device attached to the “ceiling” that was coming down towards me. i was panicked, i tried to move… they hold my head. i was told telepathically that i won’t feel any pain… i felt that my sister was near me. the device pierces my right eye with a thin needle. (see drawing #3 attached)\r\ni calmed myself because it was true that i felt no pain. i couldn’t move, but i could move my eyes! i remembered thinking that i wasn’t cold even if i was on a metallic table. i turned my eyes to the left and i saw 2 “dark grey beings” in front of a console. there was a “tall pale grey”. when i saw him, i thought, “this one he’s different”. he then turned to the two short ones and signaled them that i was watching. so, a short one came to me. he “reassured me” that nothing bad would happen either to me or my sister… he turned my head towards a giant tv screen to my left and made me understand that if humans don’t change they will go to their destruction… by images of famines, explosions… (see drawing 4 attached)\r\ni woke up in tears thinking to myself that this was what really happened…\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":81692,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.8168783,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01242017-0007","longitude":-71.2061609,"occurred":427593600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Quebec","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1485259776000,"summary":"I can’t explain what my sister and i have experienced when we were teenagers. today, i’m 48 and i now dare talking about it.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1485278201262,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":12241,"locationName":"Québec City, Quebec","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:33773"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Sutherland Springs","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Witness was loading pvc pipe into the back of his pick-up parked at the diesel pump at the vp gas station / convenience store on hwy 87 in sutherland springs. witness was facing southeast when he first saw the object to the southeast. it's silver reflective color caught his attention (mid day, bright sunlight). it was hovering approximately 450 feet southeast of witness's position, about 300-400 off the ground, to the right / se of hwy 87. witness had no idea what it could be so he continued to watch it. he describes the object as a silver disc about 8 -

ordeñarlas en la mañana siguiente. una de esas tardes cuando me dirigía a apartar las crías tuve un encuentro que me causo un trauma por mucho tiempo ya que lo que vi fue algo que jamas olvidare y que nunca avía visto y que hasta el día de hoy no e vuelto a ver mas que por la tv. en la tarde monte una mula para ir a separar las crías y al terminar de subir una pendiente note un zumbido al de un motor eléctrico que se escucha lejos, mi ojo inicio a buscar la dirección de donde venia el zumbido y fue en ese momento que quede en shock por unos minutos luego de eso lo que dicto y instinto lleno de temor fue huir del lugar a pedir ayuda pero en el camino de regreso pensé que nadie me creería y no conté el echo hasta barios años después.\r\nlo que observe al buscar la fuente del zumbido fue un objeto relativamente pequeño a muy poca altura del suelo digamos unos 50 o 70 metros y yo me encontraba a unos 100 metros mas o menos del objeto así que pude observar en detalle la forma del mismo desde su color que era un color plateado como en del aluminio recién pulido reflejaba bastante la luz del sol pero se podía ver a detalle su forma tanto así que apreciara como cuando unes dos platos y en la parte de arriba tenia una cúpula trasparente como de vidrio pero no se veía a nadie dentro de ella. se veía perfectamente que el plato de arriba estaba estático pero el de abajo giraba y de en medio de los dos platos despedía un humo blanco muy blanco parecido al efecto contrail que realizan los aviones comerciales al ascender a cierta altura pero el objeto que describo estaba muy cerca del suelo así que no creo que fuera el mismo efecto. este humo salia a medida que se movía muy lento en linea recta tan lento como cuando ves desde un costado a 200 metros de una vía recta moverse un vehículo a una velocidad de unos 60 o 70 km/h. lo pude observar moverse una distancia de 100 o 200 metros por uno o dos minutos si acaso hasta que entre en pánico y salí corriendo en mi mula muy asustado así que no pude ver asia done se dirigió ni que paso después. \r\ndespués cuando regrese a encerrar a las crías aun estaba un rastro de la estela pero el objeto avia desaparecido.\r\nen otra
