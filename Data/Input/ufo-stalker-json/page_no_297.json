a chaise lounge chair with a westerly window with lace curtains in front of me.  i noticed an abnormally bright light that i thought was a star.  two seconds later it hit me.  we cannot see stars here in tn on a cloudy night.  i live in the country.  there are no city lights, not even street lights.  it was a black night, except for this object.  i got up, grabbed my binoculars and went to the window.  the \"star\", appeared totally different in the binoculars.  it was sort of hexagonal shaped, and had the most beautiful red, blue, yellow and white lights.  they appeared as a pattern on the side of it.  the colors would pulse and flash.  i was in shock and yet mesmerized.  the object was not moving.  i ran to get my husband from the other room, to make sure that i was seeing what i thought i was seeing.   he came out and witnessed it too.  by this time it was getting smaller, and he left the room.  i continued to watch.  seconds later it was just suddenly there again.  i got out my camera and started snapping pictures.  then i shot a short video.  the camera captured 3 balls of light in a triangle shape that was not visible to the naked eye.  the video caught strange lights moving erratically,  unlike anything i had ever witnessed in my life.  i cannot upload these to this computer, but if you contact me, i will be glad to message them to you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

local time (cet)\r\n\r\nnocturnal lights - two people witness a bright, white light flying rapidly over them at low altitude while driving.\r\n\r\nstate road (\"landesstrasse\") b49 (aka \"bernsteinstrasse\"), driving direction south.\r\n\r\nlocation lat 48 deg 9.010 n, long 16 deg 54.331 e\r\n\r\nit was a starry, clear sky.\r\n\r\ntemperature: -7 deg c. wind: east, 1.0m/s, visibility 6.0km (schwechat airport)\r\n\r\ncar's speed ca 80km/h at time of sighting, then increasing to ca 100km/h\r\n\r\nwhile i am driving on the b49 on the ramp heading up to the bridge crossing the river danube, i call out to my girlfriend and passenger: \"what's that!?\" pointing my finger to a white, bright light moving into sight in the upper right corner of the windshield.\r\n\r\ni took notice of the light since it was shining strongly and moving. for a split of a second, i thought it was a reflection in the windshield, but it was too bright and moved in a way that did not match any reflections.\r\n\r\nthe two of us follow the light for approx. 2 seconds as it disappeared beyond the tree line/beyond the other side of the river.\r\n\r\nthe light was very bright, white in colour, like a star. it did not have any halo, but sharp contours. no other colours or blinking lights were visible.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend had a better view of the object than me, who had to focus on the traffic, and she estimates the object to be two fingers wide on arms length as it disappeared over the trees/other side of the river. she made a drawing of the object a few minutes after the sighting and a computer graphic of that drawing is included.\r\n\r\nwhat she saw resembles two parallel rectangles above each other, both wider than taller having the same width, with the bottom one taller than the top one. both rectangles shone with even light and were connected via a thinner, less shining \"rod\". the whole assembly was slightly tilted to the right. we believe this view represents the object from the rear.\r\n\r\nthe object flew fairly parallel to the road on a southern trajectory, see attached map.\r\n\r\nboth of us were impressed how fast the object passed over us and disappeared. no noise was noticed. we felt a bit excited after the sighting.\r\n\r\nthe objects altitude:\r\nhard to estimate in the darkness. we guess above 300m and below 1000m.\r\n\r\nthe objects speed:\r\nthe distance from losing the object to reaching the beginning of the bridge, with a clear view of the river and the opposite side, was no more than 300m. the object must have covered at least 2000m during the same time to be hidden from view due to the terrain, likely much further since it must've had some altitude as well.\r\n\r\nwith these pessimistic figures, the object was at least 6.7 times faster than us, who were traveling at approx. 90km/h (we increased speed after the sighting to approx 100km/h, the max allowed on this road). the object's velocity at ground must thus have been at least 600km/h to be able to disappear from view as we reached the beginning of the bridge.\r\n\r\nif though our view was indeed not completely blocked by the trees and the object disappeared from sight due to the terrain on the opposite side of the river, which is likely due to that we did not see any light shine through the tree tops whatsoever as it disappeared, the object had covered a distance of over 2000m in 2 seconds, equaling a velocity of at least 1000m/s or 3600km/h.\r\n\r\nthe location of the sighting is 25km east of the vienna airport (schwechat) and 6km north of the airfield spitzerberg. after talking to head of operations at the airfield 22nd of jan, 2017 10:00h, any operations after dark can be excluded, they are not flying then.\r\n\r\nno matching commercial airline flights can be found anywhere close to the area hours before or after the sighting using a flight tracking site.\r\n\r\nthe rescue helicopters operating in this area are eurocopter ec 135 t2's. they do not match what we saw.\r\n\r\nwe are living close by and have been traveling on this road and bridge thousands of times.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

thrown in an arch shape and blink out 3\\4 into the fall. then it did the same thing but more to the right. i thought this was strange so looked around to see if anyone else was saw what i saw. no one did but everyone was either asleep or having a loud, involved conversation so i wouldnt expect them to be looking out the windows. after i saw the lights and turned to see if anyone saw it i checked the other windows to see if there were any lights or things that could be reflecting on the window to make some sort of illusion. there weren't any lights or anything that could make some sort of illusion. about 10 minutes later i saw one blue light and one red light begin to land like a plane but blink out before it could. i estimated how fast it was going and i guess it was going 40-50 mph. too fast for a plane to be landing. the lights were stable and appeared to be on the same craft. i saw the blue\\red thing over an area where there are lots of crops and farming land. the only thing i could think the blue\\red ufo could be is maybe a crop dusting plane. but crop dusting usually takes place during the day. we eventually hit some mountains and i could not see them anymore. \r\n\r\nwhen i saw the first one i was listening to a podcast about paranormal things like ufos bigfoot ghosts and those sort of things. maybe the podcast got me into some sort of state of mind that made me think that these lights were more than they really were.\r\n\r\ni was feeling very tired before i saw the first ufo and not necessarily thinking about any particular thing. after i saw the first one i was very dumbfounded and confused about what i just saw. my mind went into overdrive trying to make sense of what i saw trying to logically explain it. i can't think of many things that can explain what i saw.\r\ni would not lie about this. i take this field and many others very seriously but also skeptically. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

mega building with my class. it was real early. only a little light from the moon lit the hazy sky that morning. though this ufo was very visible. not sure how more people didn't notice it. we had just begun stretching when i caught it listing across the sky out of the corner of my eye. a big black triangle just moseying across the sky. it being a naval air base, i thought maybe it was just a stealth bomber or something. but in retrospect it was too big at that distance to be any bomber i've seen. though i guess maybe it could be some military black project. who knows... i asked around if we had stealth bombers coming into that base but i was told they don't go there. i was really excited! my first(maybe second) real ufo siting. i asked somewhat quietly around me if anybody else saw what i saw. only one person responded. my buddy from boot camp just in front of me doing jumping jacks, *all wide eyed n such* turns around to me and says \"i saw it man...\" i asked what he thought it was. he excitedly says \"i have no idea dude... o_o\". we can just make it out above the mega building flying above the trees past the building and past the parking lots and roads leading out of the training facility. which had to be a good 500ft away or more. its just my best guess see as there was a big ass building in front of me. but if i have anything its good eyesight and perception. we watch on as this behemoth keeps moving south across the sky eventually losing track of it as it moves behind more trees and into the night sky. i do remember seeing something on the news about a black triangle moving south out of ohio over the ohio river around that time too. i believe it was before my sighting. eerie stuff(an ohio joke... sry). thats about it though.\r\n\r\n  btw. what i meant by it possibly being my second ufo is that when i was staying at my grandmothers place for a bit in ohio. i spent a whole week just perusing the net and watching videos on youtube about ufo's and alien sightings. come friday morning i watched some more ufo vids for a bit then got up for some food. i dragged my lazy ass out to the kitchen where my gma was chillin, drinking her coffee. i sit to talk to her on a stool by the window. me coming off my week long ufo binge. i look out the window into the sky. i start freakin out a bit because what i see way up in the stratosphere is one of those swarm time ufo sightings. it was a bunch of white dots kinda darting around the sky. i was freaked out because i just spent the last week researching ufo's and now i think i see a bunch above my home. i was sure i was going to be abducted that night lol. i only say it may have been my first ufo sighting because i'm not sure if they were ufo's or just a bunch of balloons that got away from somebody. but

already seen this light approx 2o mins before i did.This light was not travelling like you would see a satelite travel. it seemed quite stationary, and i grabbed my bins to have a better visual. this light under 40x magnification had an orange coloured core, but was moving up,down, left,right,and in an extremely erratic movement,but also in a very discernable pattern where it was not blurred or distorted while watching through the bins. i had my wife watch through the bins and she confirmed that what ever this was, was moving extremely fast, but yet not out all over. the pattern it displayed seemed to have it's boundries, and towards the last visual, the orange lighted core changed to a very bright light (almost blue) with a long tapered tail and it's movement became faster again. it was almost as if whatever was up there, was sending some kind of signal, as none of it's movements were repititious, but did seem to have a purposefull pattern.When this object(?)disappeared behind the mt.Proctor range, the whole mountain ridge was illuminated. after it's disappearance, i immediatly called relatives in the west kootenays to tell them what i seen, and please verify a visual. there part of the country was heavily fogged in.\r\nmy wife had told me that about 15 to 20 mins. before i spotted the light, that she heard what sounded lke a low flying aircraft, but the sound ended very
