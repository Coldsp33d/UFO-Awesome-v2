this sighting was remarkable, because it left no trail, suggesting a meteorite, the speed was much slower than a meteorite and the object remained a brilliant white light throughout it's

from the point of observation.\r\n\r\nconsidering the distance of the mountain range, and the size of the object, and the fact that i can't tell how far beyond the mountain range it was, this object must have been huge.\r\n\r\ni followed it's descent and saw no flash indicating an impact, or anything else that compares this to a meteor event....The object left no trail, no color other than the

being watched, like the feeling you get walking though a dark house after watching the ring or some other scary movie. it was a nice day overall and i had my ipod with me to catch sunset shots later that day. i stood up and went outside for fresh air and looked up and saw them i watched the objects for about 10-20min trying to identify them there were no nba games or events at the nearby stadium and ruled out blimps. and normal air traffic was still going on and ruled out planes large and small i am used to seeing jets and advertising planes and was easy to know these were not one. i suspected a drone but drones in the city are loud and when it flew behind the building i zeroed in on it and realized that it was much farther away than first thought and at that range a drone would not be visible at all and it still had a good size to it at that range meant it must be 2/3 the size of a plane at least. i took video evidence and for a while was unsure weather it was worth reporting and just kept it for myself to look at randomly. it should be noted as i was taking video my ipod had 100 percent full battery but as i was filming the low battery warning would keep popping up and the ipod would power down and then another small clip then power down, after a few decent shots i gave up and just finished watching the things for another 30-40 min. they appeared out of thin air se of the main building and  went behind the tall building and as it passed going n it disappeared off in the distance all the while at a constant speed while visible. i did walk around the building to see if they went off into the distance naturally but as far as i could tell that did not seem to be the case. the objects are white/grey and semi reflective cylinder/cigar shaped with a small spec of something on lower dead center. video was filmed on ipod touch 5th gen mkj02ll/a. form my standing position in a open parking lot. when filming the teal and tan building is northeast and

(this whole time i still calling it a helicopter, trying to think rationally like a human) at one area in the river just below where that thing was, cause this was right buy the river bank, over a little community. i turned on my search lights to navigate this area, and when i did that. this thing stopped moving, and went in this perfectly straight line (like it was on rails) about 20 miles out of they way, and then did a \" u \" turn coming back in my direction, but was on pace to intersect over my vessel. i thought also that this \" helicopter \" did this, and these moves awfully quick ? then it started over the tree line, then over the river, and eventually over my boat. it was blinding bright also when it started over that tree line, then over the river, and above my boat. immediately i noticed this wasn't no helicopter!! i would outside my pilot house to check this thing out flowing me up river above my boat. it was only less than 500 ft above me. it's was cigar/tylenol pill shaped at each end underneath this thing to use lights in there was this strange symbol marking in the tween them lights. i keep trying to read it, but gave up cause it wasn't writing. it was a strange symbol, or marking if some kind. it was completely silent. finally after the 4th-5th time i ran out side my pilot house, i ran back on to give my boat a steer, and then grab my iphone to film this thing, and i noticed out of my port forward pilot house window it was turning, and flying away. i grabbed my iphone, scanned area to see where it was, and it was on the western bank, the morgantown side above the tree line like a ball of light. like i seen from the beginning. i snapped a picture of it, and then it started picking up speed, and then shot away at high speed around a high rise building, and was gone.\r\ni saw it again 3 days later when i got of the boat with my girl freind at the drive inn, but it was like 20/30 miles away, and like a ball of light, or comet with no tail going across the sky.\r\none year later in washington co, about 45 miles away. i found a crop circle formation. what was weird about it was that every plant in this formation which was huge, like 600 ft long, every plants top node was swelled, and bent in a 45 degree angle. there was thousands of plants matted down to make the formation, and the ones out side the formation was affected.\r\ni took sample plants, and many pictures, and videos also.\r\nthis light for the next year was seen by many people in south western pa, ohio,west virginia area.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":81615,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.633455999999995,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01182017-0019","longitude":-79.95154679999999,"occurred":1401926400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"West Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1484775801000,"summary":"Cigar, tylenol oil shaped. two huge lights at each end underneath craft.
