burst we could see a silver shimmer and a hugh black craft materialized. it had volkswagen size lights on the side of it. one was green and one was blue. three pickup sized bursts of red translucent light/flames shot out of it, one at a time. dark pillow like clouds seemed to be surrounding it, the clouds were low to the ground and seemed to surround the black, disc shaped, two story high craft.\r\nthe craft made no noise and was about two hundred feet off the ground. we were about a mile from it. the area has no homes where it was hovering, just a wilderness area.\r\nwe were traveling about 55 mph and traveling towards it. we slowed down when we saw it to get a better view, but had to speed up when a car came up behind us. we turned towards a clear cut area to get a better look,

search lights to  navigate  an area of the river, and the object stopped moving. then flew away in a straight line about 20 miles, and made a u turn back towards my direction. then started over the tree line, then over the river, and evently above my vessel. it flowed me for about 10 minutes up river, above my boat. it had two huge light at each end of the craft, and this strange symbol ? or patterned on the belly of the craft, in between the two huge lights.\r\nat first i kept trying to read it, to see what it says, but gave up. cause it wasn't writing ? it's was some kind of symbol, or pattern. i ran into my pilot house it get my iphone to record it, and when i was in my pilot house i noticed it out of my forward port window it turned, and was turning away, leaving. i so grabbed my iphone looked where it went, and it was on the western bank, the morgantown side above the tree line. it was  just a ball of light again like i seen in the  beginning . i snapped a picture of it, and it started picking up speed, and shot away at high speed around a bulinding, high rise building.\r\nsaw it again 3 days later at the drive inn with my girl freind, but it was 20/30 miles away.\r\njust a ball of light, like a comet with no trail, or tail.\r\n1 year later found a mysterious crop circle, and in the formation every plant  node  was  swallen, and bend it in the same way, a 45 degree

was  probably  500ft of the ground. when it hovered above my boat, and i was outside the pilot house looking up at it. it was probably less than 500ft, cause my pilot house is raised 38 ft in the air. i could see this thing clearly!!!!\r\ni have a picture of it before it shot away. i was looking up,at this thing for at least 10 minutes. it was like it was checking me out. the way the thing went far

because it wasnt a star, at this point i grabbed my binoculars and searched the sky, only took a minute to find it because the location of the ufo, had a black background (no stars) and (no clouds) obscuring my vision...I couldnt see an actual solid object to whatever the lights were attatched to, but it had one central super bright white light and was constant but all around the wgite light were randomly blinking lights 3 or 4 at a time with shades of red green blue and possibly yellow,at times the colored lights would stay on briefly, i believe object is square because the lights were on each side of the bright white one, so like one in the top left corner, top right corner, etc., the object still! hasnt moved and does not remind me of any type of aircraft, blimp, helicopter, or any type of satellite, it was about 9pm then, and its 9:54 pm now still there, still no movement whatsoever, i dont know if its anything at all! but it grabbed my attention enough to fill out this

at first. there were no other cars around and i said something to my friend about the light. as we were looking around, another light, \"blueish\" started to spin on top of the car, and it was brighter. that's weird? i thought, there was not any car lights or flashlight that i knew of that could do that. the only way to describe it was it looked like it was right out of the movie, close encounters of the 3rd kind. where the truck was lite up by that ufo at the railroad tracks...You know those kind of lights. we looked on for about a minute and didn't hear any noise and there wasn't anyone around that we could see, no one playing tricks on us with lights nearby. so, at the same time we both stepped out and looked up in the sky...There were lots of pine trees around and we couldn't see anything where it could have been coming from, it was dark. even more odd was...At that moment when we had just looked up to see where the lights were coming from...The beeper i had in my purse started squealing beeps i had never heard before. i reached in my purse to grab it and turn it off...It startled me so much at just that moment. i tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't stop. so,
