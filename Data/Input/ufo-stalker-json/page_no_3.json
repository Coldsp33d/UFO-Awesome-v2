couldn’t give the thickness of the “feet”. \r\n\r\nit seemed to be watching me or taking data(?) and perhaps when it saw me notice it, it scampered. (spider like) very quickly  straight  along the ceiling (about 15’) to the wall where it vanished.  there was no center, or body to it.  i’d say i got a 1-2 second glimpse of it while it was stationary almost above me, and then another 1-2 seconds till it reached the wall. as mentioned, i was fully awake, thinking perhaps this non organic (seeming) “visitor” had woken me, tho it emitted no light or sound. it was after it disappeared, that i noticed the time to be 1:15am. i was able lay down and to fall back asleep. i was not under any influence of drugs, medications, or alcohol, or any mind altering substances, and was fully awake when i noticed the object.\r\n\r\nmy reaction wasn’t really fearful, perhaps because it had relayed a harmless message. i picked up that it was taking data (?) and when it saw me notice, it scampered across the ceiling never dropping lower. nothing like this has ever happened to me. i was alone in the house, other than my small dog who didn’t notice it at all. \r\n\r\nnaturally, i’m extremely curious to hear if anyone else has had a similar experience with an object as described. last night, 4/4, i did email george noory regarding this unexpected encounter, which i’d assume is ufo related. also, i do think if i were to see this thing again, i would be frightened. hopefully it found me to be a waste of time for any future visits!","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

mountain wilderness area in nevada. the first night we were camped fairly close to the dirt road where we left our car so we decided to do a night time hike back to the car to get some more supplies. as we reached the car, one of my room mates pointed at the sky in complete shock. we all finally looked and saw a bright flashing light moving across the sky. at first we thought it was a satellite or plane but upon further evaluation and observation we came to the realization that either of those two options were borderline impossible. the reason for this conclusion came from watching this object change direction, change its flight path, change its brightness intensity almost as if it was looking at us or noticing us as we began to flash our lights at it. this strange behavior continued for another minute or so before the object faded out again from one of its flashes and then instantly streaked miles across the sky leaving behind it a neon blue streak moving at speeds i have never seen before. the strangest part of this whole encounter was the emotional connection felt with the object. not only did it seem to notice and look at us once we started flashing it with our head lamps, but once the blue flash happened everyone either started tearing up or staring blankly out of pure shock. obviously this was a reality shaking event so the emotions felt are pretty explainable but there was something about noticing the light and it staring right back at us that left us all very unnerved for the rest of the night. after the blue streak, the light blinked possibly two more times headed in the same direction it was previously headed and faintly and simply just disappeared.

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The following event occurred on wednesday, april 4, 2018 at approximately 3:00 pm arizona time.\r\n\r\nfor around a half an hour i heard a fighter jet flying around the lake havasu city area. after around 20 minutes i was able to spot it directly overhead at an altitude much higher than 30k feet. it was barely visible and i only spotted it for a few seconds, but it was definitely identifiable as a fighter jet. it appeared to be flying in a tight circle. i can’t remember if it had a contrail or not. i lost track of it after just a few seconds, then heard it flying out of the area. after about a minute i heard it come back and again spotted it again flying in a circle and in just about the same spot. i lost track of it again after just a couple of seconds, and shortly afterward it left the area for good.\r\n\r\nhaving already seen two unusual incidents in this area in the past couple of months, i bought a canon vixia hf r800 camcorder with 32x optical zoom, which arrived just over a week ago. it’s impossible to track objects on the display when they’re high in the sky in broad daylight, so i just kind of pan the camcorder around the sky in the general area of what i see and hope for the best. the focus was set to infinite and the zoom was set to 32x optical (no digital).  hopefully i can improvise some sort of crosshair on it before long.\r\n\r\nafter the second sighting, i went inside and downloaded about 10 minutes of video to the pc and was able to catch something. this first video is of a white object. i don’t know what it is. the perceived direction of flight is probably not the true direction or true speed because i was panning around slowly.  a few seconds into the video you see a commercial jet that was flying either to or away from la. i can’t remember which. the clip between the white object and the jet is unedited. it will give you a real good indication of their relative sizes. for most of the day, i thought maybe the small white object was the afterburner of the fighter jet. later on, i realized that if it was afterburner, then the jet maybe should have been bigger in the film. either way, i don’t know. i’m not an expert. one thing i do remember, though, both times when i saw the jet i don’t recall seeing any afterburner flame. i also know that when i twice observed the fighter jet it did not look anything like the white object in the video. it just looked like a fighter jet flying way up high in the sky. also attached is a screen print of the white object and the commercial jet side by side so you can compare relative observed sizes.\r\nlist of attachments:\r\nufo1 - short, real-time unedited video of the white object and a commercial airliner.\r\nufo1-slomo - edited clip showing white object in real-time then slow motion with orientation changed to fill the video better.\r\njet-sizes - picture of jet and white object side-by-side for size comparison.\r\n","distance":"Over One
