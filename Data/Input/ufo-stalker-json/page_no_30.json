there, i was convinced by the workers to try the safari that would take more or less 2 hours  to finish.\r\n\r\nthe weather was very nice with a little drizzle before and we started around 3 pm on a big truck.\r\n\r\nwe saw a lot of animals on the way and after 35-45 minutes, we went to this place called \"salina\" that use to have a big lake with a lot of animals around.\r\n\r\non december 6, 2017, there was a big fire on this place that took the life of a lot of animals, mostly reptiles that couldn’t run away. nobody knows how the fire started.\r\nthe locals told us that since the fire took place the elephants have stopped to go there.\r\n\r\nso, we were passing exactly on the prior fire location and the truck got stuck in the mud. we have tried to take it out with no success so we decided to call another car to help and after 1 hour he arrived. \r\n\r\nthe second car got stuck too trying to pull the other one from the mud. \r\n\r\nwe have been there for 2-2.5 hours.\r\n\r\nas we were waiting for the solution to get out of there, we started to explore by foot the area around, (not too far) is a beautiful place. as we were talking, i started to take some randomly pictures with my cellphone (samsung galaxy s8). \r\n\r\ni saw that the sun was in a good angle to take some pictures with the palm trees.\r\n\r\ni didn´t notice anything strange and there was a good feeling of being there despite the problems with the trucks.\r\n\r\nso, after a lot of efforts of the workers, they were able to take the car out of the mud and decided to take us to the base and pick up the other car on the next day.\r\n\r\nso, we went to the base to pick our cars and go home.\r\n\r\nafter all, when i was at home, i started to see the pictures and something called my attention.\r\n\r\ni was in shock, amazed about what i was looking at. i always wanted to see something because i really believe in it.\r\n\r\ni started to look all the pictures to see if i could find something else and i found in three more pictures.\r\n\r\nthere was this ball orb or sphere in the first picture that looks like is hovering above the trees. you can also see the sun on the left side.\r\n\r\nin the second picture looks like she went down and let left this track of light on the way.\r\n\r\nin the third picture looks like is going to the bush. \r\n\r\nthe fourth picture, actually was the first that i took, you can see the object at ground level.\r\n\r\ni started to analyze one by one and maybe is just my brain that wants to believe but when i zoom in i can see some shadows of humanoid/et figures, faces or bodies around the balls. again, maybe is just my mind playing games.\r\n\r\ni showed to some people that was really impressed with the images and others told that might be some kind of reflection of the cam.\r\n\r\ni don´t know what really is so i would like to have your help on this.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":90360,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"AO-02222018-0003","longitude":null,"occurred":1519145940000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1519264680000,"summary":"Orb or sphere captured by cam in picture","tags":["light","hovering"],"timeZone":"Africa/Luanda","timeZoneName":"Africa/Luanda","tweeted":1519352446635,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Luanda","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:509"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Unknown","city":"Carolina Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On february 6th, at approximately 10 pm, i was at the beach with my dog, sitting on a bench looking at the stars. i was surprised to see a pulsating, then spinning object, randomly changing white, blue and green, hovering east over the ocean, for approximately 5 minutes. i took a couple of videos with my phone;

seeing, and then, all of a sudden, the light just took a sharp turn upwards and ascended, to the point where i couldn't see it anymore. i was speechless. all i could say was \"you won't believe what i just saw\" to her on the phone. i went inside and told my parents about it, but it was gone. i sticked outside a little more, but unfortunatly i could not see anything else out of the ordinary on that night. i wasn't able to take pictures with my phone, since it was all really quick.\r\ni couldn't make any details of the object, other than that it glowed white with a steady, white light, no blinking nor fading. it was quite far away, fairly high, and it seemed to come from a rural area on the outskirts of the city. it was keeping a steady trajectory and was pretty fast. the curve and ascendance where even faster, unreal for any plane or helicopter.\r\ni didn't experience missing time, nor any strange events. the call i was having with my girlfriend didn't get any static or malfunctions. \r\ni was pretty excited at the time. i told my family and friends, most didn't believe me, but i didn't care, because i saw it with my own eyes. there where no news on tv or the

orbs seem to be playing. and moving around. all craft then went in front of the sun. i had to leave. wish i had waited for them tp go past sun.\r\nthere were no signs of propulsion, as they moved steadily. they were moving too slowly to be very low and keep flying. but they were too close to be moving at a high rate of speed. i would estimate the altitude to be 5000 feet. i am a past military

(ages 12 and 10) observed a large object (size of a house) traveling just above the treetops along chain bridge road. they were traveling from mclean to washington dc and saw it on chain bridge road but also saw it again after they crossed the chain bridge and were on the dc side on clara barton parkway.    my son first saw it and said \"what is that?\"  my wife was driving and didn't look but immediately thought it was a plane because the potamac river nearby is a regular flight path of airplanes landing at reagan national airport.  she said, its probably just a plane.  but my son had a clear view and it wasn't a plane.  then my wife saw it and so did my other son.  the first time they saw it, it had 4 blue lights.  they crossed the bridge and then saw it again from clara barton parkway.  they say this craft was as large as a townhouse.  it was not a conventual aircraft (plane, helicopter, balloon). they saw it twice from very different vantage points.  i tried to find a webcam with an archive feature to look at its archives but couldn't find one. i recommend researchers explore that since we're still inside 24hrs of the incident.   i also recommend researchers file foia requests for any radar data from national and dulles airports.  i know this happened at 8:15 because my wife called me as soon a it happened and i have the phone timestamp.   on top of all of this, intriguingly, there were several sever power outages in mclean yesterday.  probably not related but worth noting since most power outages occur during weather events like high winds, ice or rain....But it was sunny, warm and clear yesterday.   \r\n\r\ni am posting this in hopes that anyone else who saw it will corroborate the sighting.  if a researcher wants to interview my family, give me a call.

manchester in the uk. i have decided to write to you as i have recently been watching a lot of “ufo” programs on the channel “h2” and on one i watched today yourselves were involved, and so i am curious as to whether or not you are able to provide any possible response to something which ahs gone on with me for a period of over 20 years. i must also point out that i do not in any way say “i have been kidnapped by ets’” as i have never gone that far.\r\n \r\nwhat has happened to me has took place every so many years since the year 1991 or 1992, and part of which sounds very much like the beginning of what happens in “alien abduction” but i never got to any spaceship.\r\n \r\nwhen these instances happen, it will occur over a few nights and then nothing for a few years and then it will happen again, for a few nights and then again nothing for a few years.\r\n \r\none night when i was 17 or 18, (i am now 44 and so can’t remember exactly) i had gone to bed and gone asleep and then i was aware that i was slowly floating upwards as i was getting to the ceiling i shot through the ceiling very quickly and straight upwards, as though there was some force pulling me. my front was facing downwards and my back was facing upwards. i was trying to fight this, and this is the point, i am aware of what is going on, i know i went to bed and gone asleep and so this could not be a dream. as i was somehow trying to stop myself from going upwards and i start to plummet downwards very quickly and landed on the stairs, but i could not move, there was some form of paralysis. then the same force starts to take me back up and fast from the offset, but it felt as though the force was from around the waist. within this i was sick, not the normal taste of vomit but that bile taste that you can get in the back of your throat when your stomach has very little food in it, and what came out landed on my front. as i reached the loft i was then sent forwards and travelled very quickly through the lofts of the adjoin houses. it was at this time that i was saying to myself “this is a dream, this is a dream, wake yourself up,” i kept shutting my eyes and concentrating that i must be on my front and so with my hands kept trying to push myself upwards, eventually i managed to do it and woke up. i do now have epilepsy but not at the time in september 1992 i joined the army and served five years prior to getting sleep deprivation epilepsy. the form of epilepsy was only diagnosed a couple of years ago. every time i went through a wall, or a ceiling that was a kind of sshhuu and can only describe this as being sucked through. for years i do not know what has happened i know it can not be a dream as i am aware of what is going on at the time and that i have gone to bed. i mention the epilepsy as this was one of the explanations that was given within the programme i watched today. i never saw a bright light and as i have said i never, to my knowledge got on any spaceship or had anything done to me. sine the military and my diagnosis for epilepsy i have had received multiple fractures of the back which means that i have lost 6 inches in height and have degenerative disc disease. i have mentioned all this so you are aware of all that has took place to me over the years. \r\n \r\nthe reason for writing is that it was a force that pulled me, i was aware of what was going on, but cannot say i ended up on any spaceship. please could you see if there is any explanation that you are able to give.\r\n \r\nmany thanks for your time in reading this e-mail.\r\n \r\nyours\r\n \r\ndaniel flatley\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

downtown brandon,ms in my car alone going to a friends house around 9 or 10 i suppose at night. when going through the corner i noticed a low pulsing light that i first thought was stationary or just moving super slow that was a single solid color and not like what you normally see with airplanes or helicopters. i live near enough to the airport to have seen aircraft my whole life day and night and so the unusual color and size and rate of pulsing was confusing and caught my eye. \r\n\r\ni noticed it was low and not going very fast too, which made me slow my car down, roll the window down and come to a stop to listen to see if it was a prop plane or a helicopter or whatever because im thinking whats this airplane or helicopter doing. my car was still running by the time it got almost overhead so i cut the engine and when i did, i noticed there was no sound coming from it. i could see no wingtip lights or strobes, it looked like an oval or ball kind of shrouded in the light and invisible when the light was in the low output phase of it cycling from bright to not bright. when it was full bright it was somewhat hazy and i could not define any wings, landing gear, prop, nose, tail, rotors or anything that would be normally recognizable as a common aircraft.\r\n\r\n it was low to the ground moving slowly, maybe 300 feet max above the ground. i watched it till it passed over the road and my car and till it go out of my field of view when trees on the other side of the road began to obstruct it. it was moving at what i would guess to be maybe 50mph. it moved from south to north and i was traveling south on whitfield road on my way to 468 then to 469 to head down to my friends. i was very confused and thought what the heck was that. i thought i had just seen a ufo

event i witnessed, late one wintery night while jogging on a rural road  south of gravenhurst ontario canada, happened on a cold, crisp, clear, stary night. \r\nthis event happened many years ago and i've only spoken about it a few times due to the ridicules from the people i shared my experience. however, i know what i saw and that will never change. as weird as this short event sounds this is the exact account of what i saw. \r\nit was approximately 11:30pm, mid january, 2011. i was about a mile from my home on an unlit rural road south of gravenhurst ontario. the road is lined with trees on both sides at this part of the road. i was on a short straight stretch approaching a left bend in the road...I was say 500 ft from the bend. \r\nsomething caught my eye up in the clear, stary night. what it looked like to this day confounds me. there was what i can only describe as a fully engulfed, burning sea-container, falling silently from the sky. \r\nit's trajectory angle downward was approximately 80%-85%. it fell slowly, so i feel it wasn't close to me, as this \"sea container\" shaped object also fell silently. \r\ni'm an older canadian, so i still speak in the imperial measurement system.\r\ni stared at this object for about 4 seconds then began to search the night sky, and from where i was this was about half of the sky in the vicinity from where i thought i'd see some aircraft debris also falling. the night sky was absolutely clear except for the burning sea container, which was still quite clear and viewable as it silently fell for a few more seconds before&#8203; it went out of sight behind the tree-line down the road near the bend.\r\ni strained my hearing while i waited for the book of its crash landing, but heard nothing. as it was winter i suspected the object fell into a forested area beyond the farm fields just past the tree-line. this is an area in muskoka where farms were cut out between the sometimes massive granite outcroppings, mixed in with forested areas, so i'm no sure to this day where this object fell. nor am i sure as to its actual size, as this thing fell silently and made no sound when it, must have, hit ground. the people who owns the property have never found any such object anywhere on their farmland or bush property.\r\nfrom the line of sight and trajectory of this object as it was falling, i suspect it either landed in the forested areas west and slightly north of my position between myself and sparrow lake, near where i lived at the time.\r\ni continued down the road towards my home and the open farmland area beyond the tree-line blocking the decent of the object. i looked for a glowing light, or smoke trails, up and down the landscape close by and off in the distance, but saw no sign of a crash sight. \r\nno sign of any objects still in the sky, airplane or mother-ship could be seen. haha, but i found no plausible cause for the falling sea container object.\r\nfrom the time i first saw this object till it was out of sight may have been 8-10 seconds. add 2 minutes, at the most, till i had a clearer line of sight further down the road, to where i thought this thing fell. \r\ni can still close my eyes and picture this object with absolute clarity, which i can best describe as a sea container, completely on fire slowly falling from an otherwise clear sky.\r\nthis spring, before the leaves form on the trees, i was planning on buying a good quality drone to help me start a search for this mysterious object.\r\ni listened to news and radio stations over a week but no mention of any falling objects in the night sky. i figure there was either a cover-up, or other people were ridiculed and dropped the matter, or i'm \"seeing things\" as was often included in my ridicules...But i know what i saw. \r\nby coming forward with this somewhat older story i'm hoping that maybe others saw this thing falling from the sky and we could form a search party and locate whatever came down that night, or at least try to.\r\nsince i was a young boy, i've been watching the night skies and believe i've seen ufo's way up in the outer atmosphere traveling the night skies above earth. \r\nthis is unrelated to my falling object sighting, but in the past 3 years i have twice witnessed what i could best describe as a 'space battle's far out in outer space. \r\nso maybe i'm lucky, or not lucky because i've never heard anything about these incidents either. adding insult to injury, my fiance jeff rolled her eyes at me now when she enquired as to what i was doing on the tablet. this is exactly why it has taken years for me to get the courage to come forward with my story about the falling, and fully engulfed in flames, sea container and the short blurp about the two space battle's i've seen.\r\ni'm not crazy, i know i sound like it though, but the events we are witness to in life would be much easier to speak about if more people come forward. \r\ni hope someone else saw the things i saw and have, or will someday, come out with their own story.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned
