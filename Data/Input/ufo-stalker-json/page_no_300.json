stayed on one path until i shined my light on it. i shined it over and over and it turned around back towards us. my friends girlfriend jokingly told me to stop trying to get abducted! we were all commenting how satellites don't move like that!When it was almost directly above us it stopped completely. i turned my light on and off and the \"satellite\" got brighter and dim again, like it was using a dimmer switch for a light. it seemed to respond to my light,but who knows.I would shine it, it would flash back. i did this 2 or 3 more times until it started moving and looking just like a satellite again until it dissapeared over the treeline. we all thought it was a cool experience but none of us were shocked by it. almost any clear night we see bizarre things above my place. i chose to tell this because its the most witnesses i've had at one time. i've had more experiences at the same location, one of which is so crazy sounding to most people i won't even tell my friends because

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have never reported this or really mentioned it to people. it happened around 10 years ago i was 16 at the time, but i can picture it perfectly when i close my eyes because it was really wiered to me at the time. \r\n   i was out with a few of my friends a can remember we were walking down castledyke in barton upon humber and i can remember my friend joe pointing up at the sky. there was an orange orb/ light in the sky. it looked about the size of a basketball from were we were stood, it was really high up in the sky and looked the size of badket ball so it must of been an absolute massive object because airplanes only look like tiny dots when they are high up. it wasn't making any noise that we could hear it was just thete. we observed for around ten miniits then a smaller orange glow dort if dropped away from it l, this \"glow\" was about half the size of the first \"glow\" which was still hovering as sorted of dropped/floated down another \"glow\" was released again about half the size it acted in the same way as the first one. as it dropped/floated down it caught up with the first \"glow\" that was released and when it was level they both dissapeared in a flash then within a few seconds the first \"glow\" which they came of also disappeared in a flash. we did mention it to one of my friends parents and they said it would of just been flares and nothing out of the ordinary. so after they had told us that i put it to the back of my mind for some years. but i always new something wasn't right it couldn't of been a flare first of all flares don't release flares and judging by the size of it. if it was that high up and looked the size of a basket ball it must of been a massive object. then the way the two smaller \"glows\" hovered wasn't natural it was asif the first one slowed down and let the second \"glow\" catch up with it. then they both disappeared when they were together. then the large object disappeared shortly after. we were amazed and shocked at what we saw i can remember feeling facinated we were coming up with all different things we thought it wad. but even tho we didn't really say to each other i think that we all thought it was something alien we were exited about it as well rushing to scotts parents (another friend who wad there) we rushed in the house all shouting over each other getting exited over what we had seen. i gained a real sense of wonder from what i saw that i have never lost and as i have grown up i have realised that ufo's are not fantasy they are not made up by crazy people like we are told they are 100% real and need investigating . so as i have grown up i have looked at what i saw in a different point of view but still kept it to myself. i can definitely say it wasn't a flare we saw as i have seen one since and its a completely different colour and moved in a completely different way. what i saw was 100% a ufo not a helicopter,plane or jet. i have only told one person what i saw other than my friends parents, i have never spoke about it with the people i saw it with. but as i remember at the time we were all fascinated about the way it behaved. there is an airport nearby humberside airport this is a small airport and i am positive it wasn't anything from there. it was just a large orange \"glow\" it was very bright it looked like the orange colour of fire. to this day i have never seenvanything like it in the sky. i noticed on the mufon app that i could report a sighting so i did because i new i wouldn't be judged and critised and its not face to face which makes it a lot easier for me. so this is my encounter which is the truth if i was going to lie i would have come up with something a lot more farfetched. if there is anything else please email me. that's everything. \r\nthankyou creating a platform for myself and others to share our experiences its a good help to tell someone who won't critise you and attack your character and just think you mad. you are doing a wonderful brilliant job. \r\nyou probably hear this a lot but i would appreciate it if thete is any work or research i could help you with. i can look at things with an open mind and with a different perspective which really does help with this phenomenon.

and i. after disclosing the information i am going to write about to my family and friends i have been oucasted and ridiculed by almost everyone i know. my first experience was roughly the beginning of december, i have always been a sky watcher especially at night i own a couple telescopes and have always had a fascination with the stars. anyway, early december the sky is crystal clear so naturally i am looking up . one night about one thirty i see a pulsing orb, almost appears to be spinning and disappearing st the same time . it had tentacles at least 6 that were spinning with and against the orb. i could tell it was moving towards me and at its nearest was probably 30 meters from my house and was making a light humming noise/hissing noise . it flew past my house and continued for at least 2 miles until it vanished. the second happened on the night after the night when the moon was to be at its closest to earth in 60 years . the moon was by far the most beautiful moon i had ever seen was. was a insane orange color that i have never seen out of a natural\r\nobject and was about  half moon with a pretty good hook in the middle not sure what it is called . anyway that night i was driving home at around 12 and again i saw an or. that was fading in and out of the sky . it appeared to be disappearing. then out of nowhere another two or a appears maybe thirty  and sixty from the original craft perfectly symmetrically spaced in the sky . the all fly in perfect symmetry towards the moon straight at it until they are so close together and so far away that it looked like the flew into the moon. my wife was with me it was the most incredible thing we have ever saw . still think a if it all day every day . has consumed me .

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Back in 2012, over spring break, i was playing soccer in an indoor/outdoor gym at a campground.I started to hear strange noises, and suddenly got an odd feeling. the feeling one may get when someone is looking at them, but more intense. at this point i was standing in the middle of the gym, and looked up to see a boy standing about 15 feet outside of them gym (i was looking at him through a screen window). so i looked up and met eyes with this boy. he looked about my age at the time, young, maybe about the age of a pre-teen. his features were very detailed...He had blonde hair, dark eyebrows, sharp facial features, and he was unseasonably tan. the strangest thing, however, is that he appeared to be transparent in a sense. as if he were a hologram. i was shocked, i looked down and a second later i looked back and he was gone. i ran out of the gym to look for him, but he was no wehre to be found. also, the night before it had rained, and the only footprints in the sand were mine and my dogs. so then later on that day my two cousins had came over and i had told them about what had happened at the gym. after that we went to a waterpark, and the boy was there..I made sure to point him out to them. they both had seen him and gave me specific details about what he looked like, and what he was wearing. i had to make sure i wasn't going crazy and just seeing things. the whole time at the waterpark the boy would just stare at me, and wouldn't even swim. he would just sit at the edge of the pool. the reason why i remember this so vividly is becuase of the sense i got from him...It was like some odd connection, i'm not quite sure how to expalin it. the best way i can say it is, it felt the way two magnets feel when you are pulling them away from each other. it was such a strong emotion that i had only felt after leaving the boy. when i think back at such a vivid memory that was, i realize that part of the gym experience simply doesn't add up. i was standing in the middle of the gym, but my view of the boy would have had to be right in front of the window. however, that is impossible to see the boy from where i was actually standing, compared to what my view had to have been. two years after that, i was just about to head out and go snowboarding when i get this familiar, yet strange feeling again. i looked up, and there the boy was. i just remember feeling so overwhelmed by his presence, so compelled. he had unmistakable features: blonde hair, unseasonably tan, dark eyebrows, chizzeled face. he was looking directly at me, and we held eye contact until i had passed him. i tolf my cousins, who were with me once again. after a few hours of snowboarding we had decided we were going to head in; as we were walking back towards the lodge i saw the boy again.He looked directly at me once again, and i was overcome by that same odd feeling. two years later, on new years eve 2016, i was staying with my cousins in a hotel. we were all standing in the lobby, and i was looking down at the floor when i saw these black shoes walking by. i slowly raised up my head and once again, made direct eye contact with this boy, who didn't look so boyish anymore. i was overcome with the same familiar odd feeling. i wanted to run after him and try to talk to him, but i couldn't because he had walked into an employees only area, strangely enough. then that night in the hotel room i was having a hard time sleeping. i remember waking up, and seeing someone standing at the end of the other bed (the bed closest to the wall, mine was close to the window) i looked around and everyone was laying down asleep. i couldn't make out the features becuase the room was dark, but this persons build looked exactly like the boy's... i had looked back up at this person, and saw him walk in front of the door, but instead of opening it, he just disapeared... now, this doesn't quite add up because from where i was compared to my view the second time i looked up, it wouldn't quite make sense, because my second view would have had to be from the end of my bed, but i was still laying down where i had originally been, and you cannot see the door or even the short hallway leading to the door because of the wall. this made me think back to my experience at the gym, becasue something very similar had happened there as well. it may be easy for one to simply address these are mere coincidences, but my first experience at the gym, and the feeling i get when i am near him is unexplainable. strangley enough, i have many of the symptons of an abductee, and have seen my fair share of ufos. it just makes me wonder if this boy has something to do with it.
