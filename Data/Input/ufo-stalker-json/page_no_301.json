hospital in columbus, ohio which is about 18 or so miles from my home. i could set my own schedule as i did not work directly with patients. i worked late afternoon to midnight or 1:00am so i could be home during the day with my child who was out of school for the summer (my husband worked during the day). i was driving home and it was after 1:00am, it was a nice summer evening with a very clear sky and i had my driver's side window down partially. as i drove along, about two miles from my home in a rural area, i looked to my left and was stunned at what i saw. there, hovering about 10ft or so above the trees next to the road, was a disc shaped ufo. it was bright, illuminated from within, with a row of lights around the middle and a dome on the top. i slowed my car way down, was almost at a complete stop as there was no one else on the road at the time. i could not believe what i was seeing, i was absolutely gobsmacked. i rolled my window all the way down and there was nothing but silence (not even crickets and on a summer night in rural ohio that is unheard of). it was maybe as wide across as a house and wasn't a thin disc, it was just disc shaped. after observing it for a minute or so, i became afraid. i knew that it's occupants had to see me and i felt very uneasy. i drove on and told myself to just breathe. as i was about half a mile from it, coming the other way at top speed with his lights flashing (no siren) was a police car. i thought of turning around but didn't.\r\n i've told this to maybe three people since then. i've just now felt comfortable writing it here, i'm amazed at all the reports here, i'm glad i'm not alone in what i saw and no one here would think i'm crazy. i never gave much thought to ufo's before but i think about them all the time now, i think about that craft every single day. strange things have happened to me throughout my life,things that i cannot explain, but this one is at the top of the list.  \r\n\r\nsorry this is so long,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a cold and clear starlit night in the winter of 1976.  i lived out in the wide open cattle country of nebraska where there are no street lights, so if it’s clear you can see millions of stars.\r\n\r\ni was a senior in high school and was ready to drive into town to play in a basketball game on friday night.  i was driving my father’s truck.  when i pulled onto the main highway (i was the only vehicle on the road at that point), i immediately noticed a craft just over 1/2 mile ahead that was hovering about 20 ft. above the ground on the north side of the highway.  it was shining these huge and powerful spotlights down along the river meadow where the cattle would graze in the winter time.  the craft had a red light on the front (the end the spotlights were shining from), and a green light on the opposite end.  neither the red nor green lights were flashing at that point.\r\n\r\nwithin just a few seconds, as my headlights shown down the highway toward the craft, the craft rotated and shined those powerful spotlights at me.  they were so strong they lit up the front of the truck from about 1/2 mile away.  i know this distance because there is a big curve in the highway at the point from where i was, and the craft was hovering right next to that curve.  the spotlights appeared to be about 4 – 5 ft. apart.  it shined those lights at me for just a few seconds, then slowly rotated back with the lights shining back toward the meadow and the craft slowly started moving across the highway and down over the meadow.  \r\n\r\ni noticed as soon as the craft moved, the red and green lights started slowly flashing.  it moved across the meadow toward the river which was only around 300 yards away at that point.  the thing i noticed right away was that there was no sound.  out in the vast country like this, you can hear a sound for miles, but nothing.  it gradually picked up speed as it approached the river which runs west to east along the highway.  it turned off the spotlights as it crossed the meadow, but the red and green lights kept flashing, and they would increase the speed of the flash as the craft increased in speed.\r\n\r\nat the point the craft moved above the river, i was at the curve in the highway where i first saw it hover, and i was speeding up continually trying to get closer.  i was only maybe 400 yards away at that point, and the craft turned and followed the river, just above the tree line.  it was amazing how this craft just cruised along above the river at such a slow pace and no sound.  i was fixated on the craft as i kept driving faster.  it went along the river for about another mile and then stopped on the south side of the river.  at that point the red and green lights stopped flashing as it hovered.  i had caught up with it and i pulled off the south side of the highway next to it.  at that point i had my windows in the truck down to try and hear some sound, even though it was freezing out, but there was no sound and i was only around 100 yards away from the craft as it hovered about 40 ft. above the ground.\r\n\r\nthe craft appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter.  it was dark in color, but again there are no street lights out there, and it was a dark starlit night, so that may have made it appear darker in color than it actually was.  there seemed to be some faint white lights along the edge of the craft, evenly spaced from the green light to the red light.  i wanted an even better look, so i was going to get out of the truck.  i had to wait for a minute because there was another vehicle coming down the highway, from east to west (they had to have seen it too), and i waited for it to pass before opening my door.\r\n\r\nas i opened the truck door, the dome light in the truck came on, and immediately the craft started moving in the opposite direction from which it came (back to the west).  as it started to move, the red and green lights started flashing again slowly.  i turned the truck around as fast as i could as started following it back in the west direction.  i noticed the craft start to accelerate gradually as i did as well.  it was still just above the tree tops and the river.  as it sped up, the red and green lights flashed faster and faster.  the dim white lights along the edge seemed to start flashing as well.  \r\n\r\ni had chased after it about a mile and it continued to accelerate.  i glanced down at my speedometer and i was doing over 90 mph at that point.  i still had my windows down in the freezing air, and there was not a single sound from the craft, which was only a couple hundred yards away.  i was just approaching that curve in the highway where i originally saw it hovering for the first time, and all of a sudden, this craft accelerated at a tremendous speed as it angled up about 40 degrees in a southwest direction.  the red, green, and now white lights were flashing at a very fast pace as it accelerated off towards the stars.  within 5 seconds, it was so far away it was out of sight.  again, absolutely no sound as it accelerated to this tremendous speed.\r\n\r\nthe distance it had to travel to be out of sight within a few seconds is unbelievable.  it was a clear starlit night, and you can see for a long way when it’s like that.  we can even see satellite’s orbit on clear nights like this, and they are hundreds of miles up.  there are no military bases anywhere close to this area.  this is in the middle of nebraska.  what is called the sandhill’s region.  the closest military base would probably be colorado springs, and that about a 7 or 8 hour drive from this location.\r\n\r\nthere have been cattle mutilations is this area where i saw the craft.  in fact there was one cow that was found around this time frame, about 3 miles east of where i saw the ufo.  no blood, no tracks lead up to the cow, and organs cut out.  i suspect this ufo was hunting cattle with those huge spotlights when i first saw it.  again, it was panning the river meadow/pasture where cattle are kept during the winter time.  guess i just happened to get in the way of their search for cattle.\r\n\r\nafter the ufo was out of sight, i drove right back to the house and told my parents i just saw a ufo.  obviously i was excited and they said my eyes were very big.  i sat on the couch for a while to calm down.  this was back in 1976.  there is no way we had craft that would even come close to what this thing could do, and i’m sure to this day, we still don’t.  this thing defied the laws of physics.  there is now way a craft can hover like that, move that slow, and accelerate that fast, without any sound.  to this day, i still remember this as if it happened yesterday, and this was over 40 years ago.  i did not tell anyone else about this for over 30 years, but now that more people believe, i am willing to tell the story.  what an amazing experience to have.  i feel lucky to have been in the right place at the right time.  this was not some light in the sky, this was a close encounter and i will never forget it. \r\n\r\nsorry the story is so long, but that’s the only way i could tell this like it happened.  i hope others will get the chance to see a ufo in their life time.  \r\n\r\nthanks for taking your time to read this.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

ground level, and the being returning to the domed light that spotted me.\r\n\r\nthis light - was extremely bright, but small - certainly less than an inch in diameter and was fixed ...In other words it did not move. it appeared to be a beacon or marker. i stood and observed it for approximately 5 minutes - being very still. i quietly went back inside to grab my camera - but when i returned it was
