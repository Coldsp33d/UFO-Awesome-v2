almost dark if i remember correctly in may of 1986 when i noticed their were about 8-12 crafts of some kind scattered all around our house. their were a couple as close as a few hundred yards, and their were some that looked to be a mile or so away. my mom and i were on our back deck looking out at our lake we owned along with four or five other families that lived on it when i saw a huge triangular (it honestly looked like something out of star trek...It had a long nose about 15' wide and about 30-40' long and behind that it looked like a huge triangle. it had at least 8-10 different lights on it, and several different colors. it came right over our house, about 75' in the air (we had about 10 big trees in our back yard and it was about 25' over them i'd say) and it looked to be going about 10 miles per hour...Very slow. it stayed going the same direction toward the center of our lake which was about an 8 acre lake and stopped right over the center of it hovering for about 2-3 minutes. then, it slowly started moving again at the same speed, and the odd thing was it took the exact path it came in on but never turned around...It was like they put it in reverse and took the exact same route out of there as they did coming in. we watched it until it was out of sight, which was probably 10 minutes or more as slow as it was going. that's about everything from that particular incident.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

was with my husband and four house guests, standing on the west facing lanai which is at a second story level.  i live on a bridge less barrier island on the bay with the beach about a quarter mile to the west.  my property runs from bay to beach with no buildings between my home and the beach.  it was very dark out and around 1am.  suddenly we all see a bright, glowing oval object cruising in a straight line from left to right, going north at a moderate speed.  it was level with our elevation, directly out from us, and seemed to be around 100 yards or so away.  it's very difficult to guess it's size, but i would guess around 20 feet long and 10 feet high.  it could have been larger or smaller than that.  it could have been 10 feet long and five feet high.  i'm not sure.  it could also have been nearer or farther than 100 yards, but it was definitely over my property and fairly close.  we had time to discuss it, saying \"do you see that?  what the heck is that?\"  all six of us saw it.  three men and three women, all of us in our fifties.  then as it was nearing the northern side it suddenly disappeared.  blinked out.  i thought i saw a couple of flickers before it blinked out, but none of the others saw any flickering.  it was completely silent.  it never made a sound.  we were all awed by it.  i felt a little fear because my husband has always kidded me about being an alien because several years ago he woke up and said i sat up in bed and said \"oh no, not again\" and then proceeded to make bizarre sounds that reminded him of a computer transmission.  blips and beeps.  weird stuff.  i have no memory of it, but a couple days later i woke up with long bruises on my right cheek.  i took a picture of it at the time, but would have to look hard to find it.  i'm not saying i have ever had encounters and i sure hope i never have.  no memories whatsoever of anything like that.  just one very weird and vivid dream where a huge ufo was disguised as a cloud when it suddenly whooshed down to me.  it was just a dream, but i do remember it very vividly.  i'm hoping to get the other five who saw this object to also report it, or at least write down their recollection on the event.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

back.  i stepped out onto the deck to see what had scared him.\r\n\r\ni looked up and saw a round object in the sky to the north.  i immediately knew it was a ufo because i've seen three others prior to this.  it was about the size of a small pea in the sky, and was fairly close, i'd say about 400-500 feet high and about 1000-1500 feet in the distance.\r\n\r\nit was spherical in shape, very light gray in color with whitish fuzzy edges.  the surface was dull, not shiny, and i noticed it appeared to be reflecting sunlight.  there were no distinguishing features - no portals, lights, colors or sound.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the ufo it was moving northwest very slowly in a zigzag path, but then it abruptly turned and came directly towards me.  it got close enough to be about the size of an aspirin when it stopped and hovered in the air for about 8-10 seconds.  i got the impression it was checking me out.  as i watched it it morphed into a square with rounded corners then back to a sphere again.  this happened 3-4 times.  the grey color and white edges remained the same.\r\n\r\nit began to slowly move away from me, resuming its zigzag path to the northwest.  i got the feeling it was looking for something.  suddenly it just disappeared, just winked out.  the entire sighting lasted 40-45 seconds.\r\n\r\nthis was a strange encounter.  when i first saw this ufo i felt dread - i don't know why.  then when it came directly towards me i was paralyzed by fear.  when it stopped and hovered i wondered if it was trying to communicate with me.  once it began moving away from me i suddenly realized that i was calm and unafraid, as if i hadn't just experienced something extraordinary.  as for my cat, he was scared and jumpy for about a week after this incident.","distance":"501

was facing the inner wall of the ditch and i could see my back yard ground level. stepping sideways along the ledge i suddenly but \"slowly\" became paralyzed. i couldn't move my eyes or body and had the ability to keep standing upright. seconds after a needle in which i could feel and hear it digging into my face. the whole time this was happing i was trying to move. after a minute,i was able to regain my movement to jerk my head away from the needle. after that i felt my face and there was no blood or pain. i didn't look behind me or around. i simply got out of the ditch and walked back home. i didn't know about aliens in 1987 and so i was confused to what just happened to me. there are also other peoples stories about the woods, i learned many years later about an alien that wondered around in the woods. my brother told me years later about his story of seeing an alien standing behind a tree near the ditch as he was walking closer to the ditch and was able to run away. my mom was warned about something in the woods when we moved into the new house and was told not to go into the woods. since then my memory of the event left me to wonder what happened to me. now its 2017 and i'm hearing microwave frequency in my new area for about a year and nobody else can hear the frequency but me. its very organized and must be advanced military technology microwave auditory. i'm thinking that the needle procedure was an alien implant. i believe that the alien implant is able to pick up microwave frequency from the military by \"accident\" just like an antenna. this had led me to think that i truly have an alien implant deep in my face just under the cheek bone.      i would like to be interviewed.
