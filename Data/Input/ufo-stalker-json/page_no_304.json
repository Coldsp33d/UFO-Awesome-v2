to my house and got my best friends attention. he and his girlfriend both came out and saw the object, at this time was almost over my mothers house, all of us noticed 1 eerie thing no loud jet engine sounds only a whirring or humming sound, another weird thing is that none of us could see a fuselage of a  normal jet it was blacked out and in a v or chevron shape, the object never stopped and it continued over the mountain until we lost sight. now to give you an idea of elevation my yard is about 875ft above sea level and the mountain tops are around 1600 to 1800ft above sea level, this

think i was sitting alone on the grass looking up at the sky when i noticed a four ship 2 abreast and 2 inline formation of what looked like delta winged aircraft, the only thing was that they were alight and had an all over underneath white light glow from nose to tail. i think there was more than 1 formation moving around each other but its hard to remember that part,i remember seeing one of the formations coming from the east and slowing down, they then kind of split up and individually moved without banking as if somebody was just moving them around by hand until all 4 ufo's were facing each other as if they were having a meeting with each other,maybe telepathically. they stayed there for some minutes then 1 by 1 each ufo turned on the spot toward different directions, then 1 by 1 from a standstill they slowly accelerated to what i can only describe as warp speed and out of sight. i never really said anything because i was young and i thought what i saw will explain itself when i get older but it never did. there was another thing that has puzzled me, around the same time during dinner break at school i went to the shops nearby, i had some spare time and wandered what was around the back of the shops to see what was there,i saw a really peaceful place with green fields, there was a road and on the road was a large red tractor, an oldish farmer in a tweed suit and a cap was leaned forward over the steering wheel looking like he was asleep or resting, it was a bright hot day, i thought at the time it was nice but time was getting on, i said to myself i will come back tomorrow dinnertime and went back to school. i think it was the next day i went to the shops and went around the back again this time all i saw was a builders yard, i think it was the back of a diy shop, i thought i must have taken a wrong turn and kept looking for the field, i was sure it was there and kept looking for it time after time but to no avail. as i got older i looked on the net and it said people have wandered into different dimensions, it fitted what i saw because they said there is no wind, its peaceful and bright but with no sun in the sky, which is what i recall.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

lights at around a 30 degree angle north-west of my position. distance and height were too difficult to estimate from my position but after checking on google maps there are mostly only fields in that direction. the postcode i observed from was po13 0hr. the lights were evenly spaced in a large triangle formation with one more forward than the others when i first noticed them. they then all turned purple and started to move. you can observe in the video how them moved. i had full zoom using a phone camera so quality isn't great but they were all bright purple in colour and didn't change again. they seemed to move in a random manor, moving side to side and up and down very quickly and turning very sharply. they would pass each other to swap sides, sometimes coming back to form triangles for a few seconds before moving again. several times it looked as though one moved into another and became one light before breaking apart again. they disappeared below the houses several times so that i couldn't see from my position what they were doing until the final time when i waited several minutes before giving up that they wouldn't appear again so whatever it was possibly landed because they didn't appear above the houses again. i went back inside the building onto the second level to view from a higher angle and could see one light again just above the house but it quickly disappeared downwards and that was the last i saw of them. they never went higher than the initial height i observed them at.\r\n\r\nthere were no other aircraft i noticed in the area although there is a small airfield behind my position. the weather was dry (although rain earlier in the day), the sky seemed clear, stars were visible overhead but none visible at the angle/height of these lights, presumably because of light pollution. when i left where i was 30 minutes later, the sky around the area where the lights were was a hazy red colour. the rest of the sky in the surrounding area was black but this area specifically was a different colour. i thought this might be some kind of heavy light pollution in that direction but according to google maps there are mostly just fields there, nothing that would give off unusual light pollution.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":81450,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.81802461707856,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-01102017-0012","longitude":-1.159406638255181,"occurred":1484002200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1484051015000,"summary":"3

of an orange sunset.\r\n  \r\nwe then noticed what appeared to be fireballs and we assumed they were a meteor shower but then we noticed something out of place as 3 orange globes were traveling at various speeds/altitudes/hovering and were leaving behind a trail which vapor but more of a shock diamond trail which appeared to be longer as the speed increased\r\n\r\nspeed,greater matched their orange colour, the 3 orbs  there was 3 of these objects but i never saw the one with vibrating appendage (i'll refer to him as spidey) until i looked at the pics at home. it stayed at power line l.Ntil we got home then lost him.\r\n\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the orbs just before arrving home but spidey went over us one final time and this is when it changed colour from grey to red, green white

cool and nice, so i sat next to her to just be with her and let her enjoy the time. then i noticed this round light move quickly, kind of back and forth, and then stop and sort of \"park\" if you will. we sat staring at the bright star/orb like thing hovering sw of us over the red lights of the hotel. to the east of us, the moon was almost full with a red ring around it and i sat there talking to the dog about what she thought the light was or whether it had always been there or if i was imagining things.  idk - and after awhile, when it didn't move, calmly we went back inside. i got out the camera and walked back out to see if it was still there and, it was, so i tried to take video, which is super short because i'm a bad videographer and the battery died. i thought to myself that it was just a light on top of the building and that i'd just not noticed it before. figured i would see what the video showed and went back inside. after a few minutes i decided to go back and \"check my mail\" and look to see if it was still there but this time it was gone so it wasn't my imagination or a light on the building. i then googled to see if anyone else had seen what i saw and a video came up taken in 2011 in a city close to mine. same exact thing in that video that i saw tonight. will have to figure out how to download the video to upload

she did see it, and i then asked her to describe what she had seen before i said anything, just to confirm in my own mind that i saw what i actually thought i did.   she pretty much described the exact thing that i had witnessed at the time and we both just sat there wondering what the heck we just saw in the sky.  although this sighting appeared quite a while ago,  i ran into her again and she also still remembered the event to this day.  i always wondered what it was that i had seen, as i had never seen something like this before, or after it happened.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

middletown road in noblesville,in, not far from the durbin area. it was a clear morning and i could see quite a few stars in front of me. initially, none of them stood out, although one, in retrospect, was more of an orange color and larger than the rest. this light was toward the left side of my vision when i noticed it rapidly growing to about three times brighter and larger than its original size. by the time i was able to register it and turn in its direction, it was gone. i'd say it took about one to one and a half seconds for it to get as bright as it did, but it disappeared in an instant. i continued to look in the area i had seen it in for some time after but it never returned.\r\n\r\nif i'm being honest, the incident wasn't all that profound. i just saw what seemed to be an immobile star in my peripheral vision get brighter and brighter before blinking out. after it happened, i thought that it was all a little strange and then realized that what i saw was a ufo in some sense of the word, although it was not flying from what i could tell. maybe there is an explanation for this sort of thing, but i've never seen anything like this. i've seen shooting stars,

i had my phone in my pocket so i took some videos and pictures, and as soon as i began recording, i suddenly saw two other lights in the sky, both of which i believed may have been commercial airliners, in addition to the initial object. \r\nhowever, the original orb i saw, continued to hover in the same position, while the other two were following what looked like normal flight paths. then suddenly one of the commercial planes, made a strange maneuver that seemed very abrupt and maybe intentional, due to how awkward the angle was that the aircraft turned toward the object in question and seemed to have intentionally crossed into the area where the orb was that i had seen initially. it was at that moment that the orb started to slowly move \"backwards\" as if it were a car that was in reverse, and disappeared into the clouds. \r\n  ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

windows we saw a bright light come streaking across the sky as if it were headed toward the water. the light was much larger and brighter than a shooting star. it looked similar to a magnesium flare but seemed to fall faster than a flare would fall. we immediately ran outside to get a better view so we never saw the light impact the water . we assumed that it struck the water so we really didn't expect to see anything, but there was a red light out in the lake moving back and forth along the surface of the water? we assumed that the red light was a boat and that the boat seemed to be looking for something. one of my cousins said \"it's a drug drop\" meaning someone was dropping drugs from a plane and someone was retrieving them in a boat. the odd thing was that we never heard a plane or a boat. sound really travels across the water there so much so that u can hear conversations of people in boats on the water so u definitely would hear a boat motor. i don't remember how long we watched the red light because the next thing i knew my parents were home and ringing the door bell because we had locked the door. i'm not implying i have missing time i simply don't remember ever going back inside or locking the door.  thinking back about that night have created some questions as i get older. primarily the way the red light moved on the surface of the water. i grew up fishing, running nets, yo yos, trot lines, etc with my dad so i'm very familiar with boats at night. most people actually don't use running lights at night because you typically have to manually plug them in to turn them on and they are really just to let other boats know whether you are coming or going. so one side of the light is red and the other side is green. if it were a boat wouldn't we have seen the green side at some point since it was moving from right to left and then from left to right across the water. lake d'arbonne has a lot of stumps in that part of the lake so if you want to travel fast you have to stay in the channel out in the lake. which i convinced myself must have been where the light was because it was moving so fast he had to be in the channel. if it were in the channel i should have heard the motor of the boat for sure. one day i would like to have my dad go out to the channel and go as fast as he can from left to right then turn around and go back and forth to see exactly what it would look like. in my mind it was just moving too fast for a regular boat. none of us had ever heard of people dropping drugs into the lake so i don't know why my cousin jokingly suggested that but if that were true wouldn't the boat try to avoid detection. if so that red light was the only thing we could see and couldn't hear anything so they weren't doing a very good job of being stealthy with that damn red light.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

will report this cause he won't. the location is a block west and just about 100 yards south of forrest general hospital in hattiesburg, ms. the hospital always has helicopters flying in and out but we can hear them coming and going for miles. my friend says it's the first time he's ever seen anything that strange. he was not afraid of it.","distance":"21-100

down to the beach and thought i would take a couple of pictures of the surf using my iphone 6s. even though it was dark out i wanted to see what if anything the camera would record of the surf. the live mode records a short burst of video (approximately 2-3 seconds of footage before and after the camera records the desired still image). \r\n\r\ni did not notice anything before and after but upon reviewing the images next morning i noticed that an unusual light had been captured. the light was apparently moving extremely quickly towards me. when i look at the still image that i recorded it shows the blurred path of the object as it covers a significant distance within the frame. the path of the blurred line is not straight.\r\n\r\nin looking at the video prior to the object appearing, i can clearly see the lights of a freighter on the water (extreme left frame) and several blinking lights in the sky which i assumed were receding aircraft. the beach we were on is located at the foot of one of lax's take-off runways. these blinking lights are visible throughout the video, both before and after the unusual event.\r\n\r\nas a point of context i have worked as a professional video producer, director and photographer for approximately 25 years. as i look at the images i see something that suddenly appears mid frame and it feels to me that the object/light is travelling towards me and away to my left. the light appears very briefly, goes dark and then becomes visible again.\r\n\r\nwhen i look at the surrounding area to see if this light is reflected on the water, i do see a flash. in a second image that i had taken, i can again see a flash but not visible trail of light.\r\n\r\ni would like to send the original live images to you, but they are only viewable using iphone 6s... so, i will send the still image recorded by live3 and two animated gif files that were converted, using an app called lively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
