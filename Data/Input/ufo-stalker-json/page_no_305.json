(i can no longer remember the exact date)\r\n\r\nwe were around 19 at the time, my brother 16. \r\n\r\nwe were sharing a spare room and each of us had a single bed on either side of it. we had stayed up late talking. \r\n\r\nat around 1 am in the morning, we heard the neighbour taking out the wheely bins. these bins make a very distinctive rumbling sound when pulled over a rough driveway or road. \r\n\r\nwe thought it was odd that our neighbour was doing this at 1 am, specially because he was elderly.\r\n\r\nwe went back to our normal discussion, but eventually noticed that the wheely bin sound had not stopped. instead it sounded like it was moving around our house. \r\n\r\nboth of us were puzzled, making comments like \"what on earth is he doing?\" \r\n\r\nthe sound continued for a few minutes continuing to encircle the house, by this point it was quite fast as though someone was running with the bins, doing laps.\r\n\r\nit abruptly stopped. i unfortunately cannot recall much of our conversations anymore. but i know by this point we were starting to get a little anxious, and making jokes about our neighbour and other things it could be. blaming my grandmothers creepy house etc.\r\n\r\nshortly there after - maybe 2 - 5 minutes passed before a bright light shinned into the window next to my bed. i could see the entire neighbours house lit up like it was under stadium flood lights.\r\n\r\ni think we just sat up in our beds and said things like \"what the hell\" in astonishment. \r\n\r\nat this point there were large sounds of banging on the roof, right above our heads. this is not unusual in australia as possums regularly run all over roofs at night but this was particularly loud, like a full person was stomping on the roof.\r\n\r\ni remember saying to my little brother not to worry and that it must be an extremely fat possum, or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nnext, all the light vanished from window next to me, and reappeared through the kitchen window on the other side of the house. i could see this window from where i was laying as my head was inline with the bedroom door and hallway, leading into the kitchen. i could see the other house lit up as if it were daylight. i remember i said to my bother \"its on the other side now, it looks like daylight outside\"\r\n\r\nit only stayed at this window a few moments, before vanishing and then shinning through again from the small window behind my brothers head, that looked out into the backyard.\r\n\r\nmy brother got up onto his knees and looked out of the window.\r\n\r\nhe then said \"omg, josh come here, look\"\r\n\r\ni got up and moved across to his bed, and also kneeled ontop of his pillow beside him, looking out into the yard.\r\n\r\nin the backyard, around 10 meters away from the house, where two car sized glowing white balls of light. it looked like car headlights.\r\nthough obviously much much bigger.\r\n\r\nwe could tell they were close because of all the shadows they were casting in the yard. the clothesline was on the object/s right side less than a meter away so casting a very long shadow.\r\n\r\nhere is where things get extremely weird for me, and bother me to this day (hence i am here writing this)\r\n\r\nmy first reaction when i saw the lights was complete calm and awe. i felt extremely relaxed and was in no way anxious or worried about it.\r\n\r\ni then strangely said to my brother \"oh, they are here\"\r\nand my brother said \"do you think we should go outside?\"\r\nto which i simply responded \"yes\"\r\n\r\ni don't really understand my motivations or thoughts here. when i think about this now. i assume that today and then, i would have been scared or concerned about that we were observing.\r\n\r\nwe both got up and headed into the hallway, \r\n\r\nto get outside we had to pass,the bathroom, my grandmothers room, go through the kitchen, down a few stairs into a laundry and then there was a final door to the outside, which was visible from the kitchen.\r\n\r\nwe walked into the bathroom and attempted to see if we could see the objects, we couldn't as it didn't have a clear view of the yard.\r\n\r\nwe then went into my grandmothers room as we noticed she had not woken, even though we were making a lot of noise talking. i remember my brother remarked it was odd that she wasn't awake. we tried to wake her up, but she was in a very deep sleep. (she was a woman who would wake up at the slightest noise and want to know why you were going to the toilet!)\r\n\r\nwe then went into the kitchen. we could see that it was very bright outside, but both of the kitchen windows did not have a view looking toward the clothes line where the objects were.\r\n\r\ni remember we kept looking out the kitchen windows trying to spot them, all the while getting more anxious about actually going out. lots of \"do you think we should really go out there\" comments.\r\n\r\nmy little brother decided he would still go out, but i became very anxious. i was pacing a lot trying to decide if i should go.\r\n\r\nmy brother went down the stairs from the kitchen and to the backdoor, i remember he said something like \"ok i'm going out\".\r\n\r\nmy thoughts at this point were also strange, i remember quite clearly thinking - i don't want to remember, i don't want to remember over and over while i paced back and forth between the view of my brother at the backdoor, and the hallway leading to the bedroom.\r\n\r\nthen i had another feeling of calm - with the thoughts: he is his own man, he can go if he wants, he will be fine they will take care of him. \r\n\r\nthen i am going to bed! \r\n\r\nthe last thing i remember is seeing my brother unlatch the door and then walking very deliberately to my bed. (the fact i did that really bothers me!)\r\n\r\nthe following morning, we realized what happened while eating breakfast and asking our grandmother if she heard anything.\r\n\r\nit took quite a while for us to really acknowledge what happened.\r\n\r\nmy brother says he remembers nothing about what happened outside.\r\n\r\nit was not until many years later that i also recalled another detail - \r\n\r\ni woke up to find my brother walking into the room sometime later i asked him \"what happened outside\" he just said \"nothing\" and climbed into bed, almost robotically. i asked him what time it was, i'm not sure how he checked but he told me it was 3am. so that was about 2 hours after we first saw the lights. \r\n\r\nto this day, the whole event bothers me. the way i acted and a few things i said don't really make sense to me. i really don't like that i abandoned my little brother to it, and was so calm about it that i got into bed and fell asleep! i don't think whatever it was, was malicious. the feeling of awe and calm i got when i gazed at it, is enough to leave me with the impression that - if it is something to be afraid of, it certainly doesn't want you to walk away remembering that.\r\n\r\nso this is how i remember the event. i am not sure if my brother remembers it occurring in the same order as i do, as we rarely talk about it anymore.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet

was 17 at the time.\r\n\r\n i was out one night with my (at the time) girlfriend, we were lying beside the thames when at approximately 8:30pm i saw a glowing orange, 5-point star shaped ufo spin cross the sky from the direction of the street behind us to the ne (above as we were laying down) and head over the water to the sw, passing directly overhead. i sat up to look but it was already out of sight behind the treeline across the river.\r\n\r\n the object was spinning fairly fast whilst flying in a dead straight line at high speed, i'd say it would have cleared horizon to horizon in around 10 seconds and although i cannot be sure of altitude, i would guess comfortably at around 15,000ft with perhaps 1,000ft leeway.\r\n\r\n though the sighting last just a few seconds, i believe that what happened next may be related.\r\n\r\n a few minutes later, having explained what i'd seen to my girlfriend, i began to feel uneasy; my head hurt, i kept feeling dizzy and i felt sick; i've never had a migraine but i know plenty who have and that is roughly how i imagine them though maybe it wasn't as bad since i wasn't incapacitated by it and it passed after around 10 minutes. but after that i got the most intense feeling of being watched i have ever felt, even to this day. i sat up and was looking around us, my girlfriend later said it was as if i 'knew' someone was there and was trying to spot them. i was scared, shaking, my breathing became erratic and i tensed up to the point she was unable to move my arm when she was trying to calm me down.\r\n\r\n after about half an hour, i suddenly stood up and said i was taking her home. it was only a short walk but the whole time i was tense and my arm was locked around her waist extremely protectively and i was constantly checking our surroundings.\r\n\r\n when we arrived back at her house, she insisted on calling my dad to come and get me as she was concerned for me and i couldn't stay at her's as her dad and i didn't get along.\r\n\r\n my dad met me at the end of her road, he asked what i'd been drinking or smoking. i hadn't been drinking and have never smoked or taken any other form of drugs. i relaxed as we walked home, it must have been around an hour and half from sighting to when i felt 'normal' again. the experience has stayed with me because although i was aware of my actions i wasn't in full control. not like i was being controlled, just as if i was on auto-pilot. i had never had anything like this happen before and have not since. the fear, the feeling of being watched were so intense i have nothing to compare them to.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

to my second storie apartment, balcony glass door and opened the vertical shades. my wife and i were confronted with the sight of 6 glowing objects, in a even spacing in a train-like configuration. at first i thought, it was a series of flairs, dropped by an airplane, but the pulsating lights were not descending, but were slowly moving towards the east. my wife grabbed her phone and tried to get a photo, i suddenly realized my ipad was in reach so i began recording the exact same type of object i had reported seeing a few years ago just a block away from where i was filming. in the video you can hear me recalling the experience i had. there was a realization that, made me feel calm and vindicated, because i was now able to give proof of this phenomenon happening when you least expect it. i can't recall the witness report number that mufon designated then, but i was contacted by an investigator a few weeks later. he told me that there have been several reports, in this region, of similar objects that were dubbed ( fire balls ) due to their orange color and scintillating pulsation. they all have identical color, intensity and each in turn slowly fades and disappear. i will submit the video i recorded, but demand, full rights of original content ownership. i wish i was able to help fund your noble cause, that of seeking the truth behind this mysterious experience that far more of us have had, but are unwilling to stand up and say, yes i also witnessed a mystery, that must be revealed.\r\n\r\nregards, todd r.

observed, recorded, and reported similar anomalies in this same south/southeast area of the night sky. close ups reveal a multi-colored \"chain\" or tube like anomaly that moves at random and appears to morph as quickly as digital photos can be taken. digital video shows a bright blue orb type anomaly, quickly moving about while appearing brighter or dimmer at random (possibly due to rapidly changing its distance from the observer). \r\n\r\ncoincidentally, on this same evening two years ago, i observed and reported an identical appearing anomaly, in this same south/southeast area. that

since there was a lot of vehicles going back and forth i rolled down my window to get a good look at it. just about 100 feet away i saw a hovering saucer in the shadow of the pine trees that were along the fence line on the west side of property.\r\n  the reflection of the object could be seen from the road, it was a bright moon so through the trees light was hitting the craft. the pine trees was casting a shadow and it was in it hovering above the ground, but i could still see it because the moon lite up the field behind it. a dark looking hovering craft could be seen clearly by me. it had an arm of some sort pointing and extended to the back of the trailer but not touching it.\r\n  there was no sound coming from it at all. it was 18 to 24 feet wide.It hovered 4 to 6 feet off the ground and i saw blasts of blue-red-orange-yellow short flames coming from ports around the mid section of it. these ports were evenly spaced around the furthest section, a little lower of its mid section. round and about 6 to 8 inches in size. the flames came out from left to right and seemed to go around the craft because there were bright flashes of light continuing as long as i could see it around-on the ground on other side. it wasn't light, it was flames. because the next time i saw the same ports facing me the fire it was a little different each time. i saw it was a hole where the flame came out of each time. this all took 5 minutes of viewing.\r\n  i played in this area all the time. it was an empty field with 3 foot tall dry grass. directly under the craft the grass was moving violently back and forth, but outside the craft the tall grass wasn't moving at all. i could make out small lines that went around one side and meet up with the other. this was a saucer like object, thicker on the bottom and with some sort of dome on the top. \r\n  now this left me seriously disturbed that night. it may of been great to finally see one but i was only 11 years old. my mom didn't know what it was, but she saw it. saw the lights, saw the grass moving and it hovering above the ground. we spoke about it a couple of times but she ended the conversation as soon as i started it.\r\n  my father finally returned from overseas and i couldn't talk about it again until the day he opened the news paper to the \"living\" section of \"the new mexican\" news paper and there was a picture of a ufo going over a farmers barn in the santa fe area that a farmer took and turned over to the paper. it was the same ufo that i saw, exactly, but taken during daylight hours. i told my dad that is what i saw and here is proof! i clipped it out of paper and saved it in my mothers scrap book, but it too has disappeared as well the paper. i never ever forgot and now that i'm 62 years old and i thought it time to tell my story of what we saw. my family have died and all i have is this memory of what was seen that night. i have a drawing but it's difficult to figure out how to send even though i have a b.A. degree in social science. \r\n  get back with me if there's more you can find out what i saw, i appreciate it.

the front passenger seat.  when we were approximately 1/2 way back home to port greville from parsboro which is about 19 km. distance. we were 10-15min from home in an area that provided a great view of the orange sunset\r\n  \r\nsthen noticed what appeared to be fireballs and we assumed they were a meteor shower but then we noticed something out of place as 3 orange globes were traveling at different speeds/altitudes/hovering amd were leaving behind a d trail which didn't last long and was more of a rocket type which appeared to be linearily attached to greater the speeds the longer the tails length, reminded me of a jets shock diamond \r\n\r\nspeed,greater matched their orange colour, the 3 orbs  there was 3 of these objects but i never saw the spidey object until i looked at the pics to see if they were any good. it stayed with us above the power  lines until we lost him when we arrived home.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the orbs but spidey went over us one final time and this is when it changed colour from grey to red, green white but i'm not sure if was the  body or the appendages that were changing colour. my samsung couldn't focus on it in time to get a pic of this event.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived home the 3 orbs were still racing around for a short time which i tried to capture on my nikon 3200 but distance became a problem as it moved west over spencers island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?  \r\n'\r\non the drive home we were commenting on the spectacular sunset when we came to a point where where the tree line hills and distance prevented us from locating them. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\nthat they were a meteor shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions\r\n\r\nthe objects raced erratically and contained the following events:?Hovering/speeding up/down/changing altitudes. the spidy one was overhead when it changed from grey to green, white and red.  however my camera t00k too long to focus on the object and we missed the shot\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions\r\n\r\nmy wife still doesn't believe in ufos but i'm convinced now. we initially were excited but when we went the final hill had to up a hill with fading light and spidy ufo right over top of us, we were geting a bit nervous, but we did get some fair photos even through car windows at 50 kmh and in hills and forest. \r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the objects\r\nwe lost sight of the objects when the were approxiamelty 20 kms disance as they proceeded in a westernly direction over spencers island\r\njecs\r\n\r\nnotes\r\n\r\nnasa unexplained segment that has an x-15 pilot described a ufo.  the grapic displayed in the that looks exactly like the spidey in my pics.\r\n\r\neven better are the recent infra-red ufo picked up by the chiliean navy chopper. it seems to emulate what we saw only cleaner.\r\n\r\nmain camera samsung 4 15 mpixels\r\n\r\nsecondary  cameranikon 3200d\r\n.\r\nat minute 53 i' changed over to thie nikon, and captured 4 events.  you will have to zoom in quite a bit from the orignal photos. i may not have picked up everything in thesee photos with my graphic s/w.\r\n\r\nno other winess only 32 bods live here.\r\n\r\nproceeded west over spencers island and then disappeared behind the

star seemed out of place and caught my eye. i recognized it as a possible pseudo-star and observed the white, third magnitude object, stationary, 10-15 degrees south of the big dipper handle, which laid in an e-w direction. i waived an orange light at it, and it immediately responded by moving a few degrees in my direction. it stopped, saw the light again, then the object brightened, and then crawled a little closer to me (moving west). as it was 7 degrees f. outside, i did not stay more than ten minutes, and the object remained in its \"position\" after my light had been turned off. these pseudo-stars look remarkably light real stars, but do not \"twinkle.\" this object was positioned in open space; many pseudo-stars hide in front of real stars. brightness increases with velocity. these objects stay in one position for most of the night, except for a few which run the length of the sky. i have learned to use other celestial objects to make sure that any movement i see which is small, is not due to optical trickery. i took a cell phone photo of this object; i don't bring out my dslr in this weather, but i have many other photos showing that these pseudo-stars are objects with bright light emitting from one end most of the time (sometimes multiple lights). this object may have been cylinder shaped, but the photo is not good enough to be certain. i have seen cylinder, \"saucer-like,\" and spherical bodies from other photos. i have seen these objects for nearly two years now, and almost nightly (weather-permitting) for the last six months. i am anxious to learn what these objects are, who is controlling the and why they have an organized, intelligent observation scheme over my city, north of detroit. i have had some light-related interaction with them in the past, some which felt quite threatening.

(see attached images for pattern as well as numbers i assigned to them). they were hovering motionless, with no noticeable noise emitting from them. these objects appeared round with a white and yellow-orange light in the middle, while the outer edges were a darker red-orange.There was no noticeable navigational lights (no red, green, white or strobes). object 3 began to move to the left (south southeast) towards object 2, object 2 begins to move in the same direction.  object 4 and 5 begin to move towards the right (southwest/ west-southwest), object 1 appeared to gain altitude and left towards the south southwest.\r\n\r\nafter the objects broke formation, you could see 3 of them through the tree tops heading southeast (roughly towards jber). then one of the objects became visible through the trees stopping at roughly appeared to be the same location first located at. a second one appeared a few seconds later, they both seemed to move around, changed direction 2-3 times then hovered again. once again there was no noticeable noise. one of the objects then moved quickly south southeast and out of sight. the last remaining one just sat motionlessly in the air, it was at this time, my dog began to get nervous, antsy and began to whine. my father used his flashlight (rigid industries halo 800) and pointed it at the last object, it did not reflect any light. i then used the strobe feature on the same flashlight twice. the object almost immediately left to the south. \r\n\r\ni did notice a small private plane, flying east to west at an unknown altitude. if i had to guess it was 500-1500ft.\r\n\r\ni used my compass feature to check the bearings of the sightings direction, with the house light and the moon. the moon was between 165-168 degrees and roughly an inch to an inch and a half above the treeline, the house light 210-215 degrees, from my observational position. the objects appeared to be an inch to an inch and a half above the house light.\r\n\r\nthere is a private airstrip that is part of our neighborhood.","distance":"501 Feet -
