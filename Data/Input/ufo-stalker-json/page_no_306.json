international airport. the orb did not move. initially, i thought it could be an airplane but my eye kept being drawn to it due to its unusual solid color - and it simply did not move. i soon saw an (unrelated) identifiable airplane and a helicopter, much closer to me and determined that the light i was observing was neither.\r\n\r\nso i began taking pictures of it, because ufos are not exactly unexpected in the area, and i thought it might just be one. it was soon joined by two other similar craft - which also hovered in place near to it. they simply appeared there, then hovered with the first craft, which began changing colors - and the other craft did the same; changed colors. after about 15-20 minutes i watched them disappear, rapidly but one after the other, in the exact same position they had been hovering. at no point did any of these craft move, and during this time i observed many ordinary airplanes flying (above and behind me) into sky harbor. the contrast between the actual airplanes, and these hovering objects far to the north east, was obvious to me; and i was glad to have taken the pictures i did.\r\n\r\ni originally wanted to keep these pics to myself, but a friend suggested i submit them to you. the exact area these appeared was over the mcdowell mountain regional park.\r\n\r\ni need to state that these 7 pics are the original images with a \"zoom\" of the lights open atop them in another window; which you'll clearly be able to see. i took the originals, opened them 2x in a photo-viewer, zoomed in on one... and put the \"zoom\" image over the original image to the side. i then screenshot each original image with its \"zoom\" atop it. i did this for all 7 photos. you can see vehicle traffic in some of the images... the vehicles have nothing to do with me, or the event; they just so happened to be in the frame when i took the pics.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

night sky during 2010\r\n\r\nfollowing a 2009 sighting during our spring field trip to the everglades, which provided the view of a pale blue vehicle streaking across the night sky from the constellation auriga to sirius, i was again watching the night sky in 2010 with two coach drivers, including one who had been teasing the previous year’s driver about witnessing a “ufo” on the that trip and laughing appropriately. this was one year, to the week, since that sighting. \r\n\r\non that night in 2010 i was pointing out, to the doubting driver, the location where the vehicle first appeared during the previous year. as i was pointing to the constellation auriga a very bright flash occurred from that exact area. we looked at each other as i am thinking “how does this stuff keep happening, more or less on demand?” so we sat down in our chairs and kept an eye on the area. that night we saw at least 12 bright white flashes coming from that location. these were not meteorites streaking across the sky. all of these flashes were pin-point events, no streaks or lines, nothing yellow (melting rock), not lightning or anything i had ever seen before in the sky. whatever those flashes were, they were records of something occurring some distance away - no sound of any kind, and no other effects around us. if those flashes were moving objects, they had to be going directly away or toward us... one maybe, but all of them and looking identical... probably not. we considered what we saw and came to the conclusion that these were probably explosions happening a long way away.\r\n\r\nat the time i didn’t make the connection, but it may be that these explosions were a light year away and the vehicle racing across the sky during the previous trip may have come here at near light speed and executed a turn that forced it into temporary visibility. seeing this activity prompted me to write up the previous year’s sighting and submit it to mufon after the following year’s trip. however, i didn’t make the connection, and besides the flashes were not other vehicles - so what am i supposed to report? with all the current buzz about the secret space program by corey goode, bill tompkins and others, who are now coming forward, it makes me wonder if one or more of our own vehicles were in trouble and were returning to bases on the moon. crossing the sky from auriga to sirius before disappearing could possibly indicate a course headed to the moon which rose late that night. was the vehicle dropping mines to hinder pursuit before jumping to light speed in the direction of home? i don’t know, but i’ll bet somebody does. \r\n\r\nby the way, the driver who was teasing the other about ufo’s saw at least 3 of those pale blue lozenge shaped ufo’s on this night a year later, but they were only exposed for very short distances. i only saw one of them and it probably traveled only a degree or so (near the pleiades)... just a blink of the eye. were they cloaking and un-cloaking... probably.\r\n\r\nin summary, none of those flashes contained anything that appeared in the yellow part of the spectrum, they were all brilliant white, flashing like aerial bombs that we use in july 4th pyrotechnics, but with no sound. so we saw twelve flashes over the course of an hour and a half but i don’t know how long the light show had been going on. i just know what we saw when we began to take notice.\r\n\r\ni would have submitted this earlier, but the file of the original submission was on an old computer that i rarely use. when i found the file, i decided to finish things, now that i have had a chance to connect the dots.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the sky. we were driving on our way to dinner when we saw a low flying, plane-like object. it couldn't be a plane though because of the shape, almost triangle like with light at all corners and ends. \r\nit first hovered over trees for a second about 500-1000ft away, then moved forward over an old bank less than 250 feet away from us in the sky. it was dark and we were only at a stop light to video it for less than 30 seconds, so couldn't make out details of the craft but only the lights. when we turned and continued onto the next road it followed our movements and \"jolted\" over us. it moved quick, i couldn't tell relative speeds because of the distance between us but seemed like it was moving much faster than usual speeds. it was overtop of our car while driving for a few seconds because we couldn't spot it and then it was on the other side of the car before we lost sight of it. we even looked at other cars while stopped to see if they were seeing anything and a woman in her car was staring at the lights and craft in the sky in awe like she was terrified of what it could be or was. overall a very creepy and cryptic experience and wish we had just pulled off the road to see what was going on better. \r\n\r\nwe have 2 videos in which you can see the light in the sky and something moving but do not want to post them yet unless much interest.

lumineuse pratiquement inexistante, nous observons le ciel plus par ã©merveillement que de faã§on scientifique.  nous ã©tions en vacances au mois d'aoã»t 2016.  les soirã©es ã©taient agrã©ables car nous avions le firmament pour nous.  ã€ force, on reconnait notre ciel, on voit les mãªmes ã©toiles, les mãªmes regroupements.  ce soir lã , une ã©toile particuliã¨rement brillante (que nous n'avions jamais remarquã© avant ) a attirã© notre attention.  il n'y avait aucun vent et nous pouvions voir que l'ã©toile bougeait lã©gã¨rement tout en restant stationnaire.  ã€ un moment, nous avons perã§u des ã©clats de couleurs.  je suis donc allã©e chercher mon cellulaire et une paire de jumelles.  je ne m'attendait pas ã  voir ce que j'ai vu.  ã€ partir de ce soir-lã , nous avons pu observer la mãªme chose tous les soirs.  nous sommes mãªme partis ã  sa rencontre, plus haut dans la montagne au bout du lac et sommes revenus rapidement.  la chose ã©tait trã¨s proche et semblait se rapprocher de nous.  nous avons eu peur. j'ai pris des centaines de photos avec mon cellulaire.  ã€ partir du mois d'octobre, les observations deviennent plus intenses alors que nous remarquons qu'il y en a plus d'un.  un soir de novembre, il y en avait 6.  tous ã©taient \"postã©s\" au dessus de lacs.  il y a plus de 40 lacs dans la rã©gion.  nous sommes repartis ã  leur rencontre, trop mã©dusã©s par l'ã©vã©nement.  nous voulions en avoir le coeur net.  nous avons l'impression d'ãªtre \"ã©piã©s\" depuis.  nous savons que ce ne sont pas des ã©toiles.  le ciel bouge d'heure en heure, mais ces \"ã©toiles\" restent lã .  s'il y a des nuages, on les voit quand mãªme, ce qui prouve que ces objets sont bas, en dessous des nuages.  fait intã©ressant: dã¨s qu'on commence ã  prendre des photos, l'objet change de formes et de couleurs, comme si elle nous faisait comprendre qu'il sait que nous sommes ã  les observer.  ã‡a semble fou, mais c'est comme s'il y avait une forme de communication.  j'aimerais avoir un bon appareil pour prendre des photos plus claires mais il suffit qu'on les agrandisse pour rã©aliser que ce ne sont pas des ã©toiles, ni des drã´nes, ni rien qu'on connaisse. \r\nma derniã¨re observation s'est passã©e hier soir (6 janvier) et je me suis levã©e plusieurs fois au cours de la nuit.  cette fois-ci, c'ã©tait une sphã¨res incandescante, comme un petit soleil avec des explosions de couleurs ã  la surface qui montait et descendait doucement.  ã€ 03h30, elle ã©tait encore au mãªme endroit. je commence ã  ãªtre inquiã¨te.  peut-ãªtre qu'il n'y a aucun rapport mais mes chats ne veulent plus sortir le soir et lorsqu'il le font, ils reviennent vite, comme pris de panique.  au dã©but, nous en parlions ã  nos amis et familles, mais tout le monde est trã¨s rã©sistant ã  ce genre de situation, certains ne veulent mãªme pas regarder nos photos affirmant que c'est dans notre tãªte....Bref, je sais qu'il se passe quelque chose dans notre ciel, je sais qu'on nous dit pas tout et que c'est plus facile de nous faire passer pour des fous.
