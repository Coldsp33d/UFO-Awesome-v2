almost directly above in the north eastern sky. it seemed a bit bigger and brighter than what venus looked like in the same evening. knowing that at this time venus was behind me in the western sky is why the object caught my eye. i thought to grab my cell phone to use my planets app. but that's when i then noticed that the object was slowly moving and slightly zig zagging. as i watched it i was calling for my parents to come see it as well. we thought it could be some type of plane, but i live under the tia (tampa international airport) flight runway takeoff/landing path and i see planes frequently.\r\n\r\nthe object started off very bright and large. i would say about the size of a highlighter marker tip. when it slowly moved in a north to north east direction it dimmed. i watched it move in a slight flicker to zig zag like motion as it continued to keep its north to north east motion. as it continued to move the object dimmed at the same time, (i timed my self after to get an approximate idea on how long we've seen the object for.) i would say we watched the object for 40-45 seconds wondering what could it be. the object kept going in slight zig zagging motions and headed to the north east until it dimmed out of site completely. it almost seemed to be going up and not north. the color of the object seemed to change slightly as well. at the objects first and most brightest point of sight it seemed to be a bright silver to white. at the objects dimmest point before disappearing it seemed more star like and golden.\r\n\r\nupon seeing the object i was pretty excited, due to i know that what i have seen was very unusual. i have lived in the same city all my life and i look to the stars and planets often, and i know the normal flight paths to the local airport and airforce base. so for me this was definitely something out of the normal sites that i see in the local sky. \r\n\r\nas i am not saying for sure by any means that i know what it was or could be. i just hope by you getting this, maybe someone else in my area has also seen the object and we could shed some light on what could have been in the sky on this night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:41","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

husband and i were living with his parents and his cousin was visiting, and there had been quite a big argument. i'd gone to our bedroom and the light bulb went as i flicked the switch. bulbs seem to go more when i'm in a bad mood, although this may be down to chance and it might be chance that the lights in the sky put in an appearance at this time too. but i'm including those details in case they're of any relevance. i'd only been in the bedroom a minute at the most when i was called to the back garden because there were \"ufos\". they were lights in the sky to the south, approx 20 degrees over the horizon. they were in a fixed formation and moving very slowly and soundlessly to the east until they gradually went out of sight behind a cloud. they were white lights with a smaller, fainter red light immediately above each of them as if attached to whatever the white light was attached to. the red lights were either flickering or flashing rapidly, i'm not sure which. my husband said the lightd couldn't be attached to planes or helicopters because they were moving so slowly and we would have heard them. later i found out my husband only saw/noticed the white lights, not the red ones, but he is long-sighted so he should have been able to see more clearly than i could. but he maybe just wasn't trying to take in the details. i'm still not on good terms with the in-laws so i'm not going to ask whether they saw the red lights! we were all curious about the sighting, just watching for about five minutes until the lights were out of sight. i was happy to see the lights because i like a bit of mystery, and as i can't identify them i can say i've seen ufos! i made a note in my diary with a rough diagram of the formation the lights were in, which may not be entirely accurate but it was done within an hour after the sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

diary that night: my husband called me to the back door (he'd gone there for a cigarette) where there was a light in the sky traveling to the north from the west, away from us. he saw it first right overhead, moving to the north. as we watched it stopped briefly, then resumed and got dimmer as it went behind a cloud so we couldn't see it any more. we were debating whether it was a chinese lantern but doubted it as it had halted briefly. then three more swung in from the east, that is from the right of the section of northern sky we can see between the hedges on either side of the narrow garden. the speed was like fireworks. they slowed right where we could see them, then one went off to the left so it was no longer visible below the hedge. of the two remaining lights, one got behind the other from our perspective. they moved slightly in our direction (south) then went north again and went out of sight behind the clouds. they looked like reddish-amber lights. the first maybe twinkled a little like a star but the others were steady in intensity. i thought of them as moving like ice skaters, smoothly and sometimes in arcs. they moved fairly slowly apart from when the group of three first came into view. i don't think they changed altitude. i took a few photos on my blackberry, i think some were with and some without the flash so not much is visible in a few but i'm including them in case they're of use at all. what looks like a light below the washing line is most likely a reflection from the shed window. i felt lucky to have seen the lights in the sky, although perhaps luck has nothing to do with it as my husband described the first light as being right overhead, they 'performed' right where we could see them, they at one point seemed headed straight for us, and this wasn't my first ufo sighting. i'm drawing no conclusions but it seemed as if me or my husband were meant to see them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

aliens but ufos stand for i identified flying object and i know for one fact: there were fifteen ufos in the sky that same night. we had even told a couple people before it got on the news but we

that was the brightest broke in three pieces and shot off.  \r\ntonight 1-4-17, it was out there again at 7pm.  my husband saw what i saw last night and then it disappeared.  my husband did a search with aircraft in the area...There was something there, but not identified as a plane.

on holt road in brentwood, tn. \r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\nthe two large lights on the bottom of the objects. there was a very large red covered light on the left, a similar sized green light on the right and a uncovered blinking red light in between the other two lights. the lights appeared to be equal distance apart as from each other and had a slight angular setup to where they was located on the bottom of the object.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\ni thought it might have been a commercial drone. however the size, stability and speed was too good to be a commercially bought drone.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\nas i was driving down holt road toward nolensville road i saw a red and green light in the sky just above the tree line. it was odd, because airplanes have the lights on the wings and have white lights on the front. this only had the green and red lights, and they was too close together to be on wings, this would have been on the body of the object. shortly after, a second object that is identical in lights come in behind the first object. they stayed in uniformed flight the entire time, even during the short turn they performed. the started out to the left of my car flying in a path perpendicular to the road. they then turned to about a 45 degree run to the road and passed over my vehicle. i lost sight of the objects after that.\r\n\r\nthere was computer like control of both objects, they flew in unison and very quickly. its difficult to size an object that can't be seen with the exception of the lights on the bottom of the object. \r\n\r\nmy gut instinct tells me that they might be military drones. they was too small for maned flight, and they was too perfectly controlled to be done without some kind of program behind it. one turned at a specific point and then 2nd turned in roughly the same location just like clock work.\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\nit truly is amazing what technology can do, i was excited to see something that i had not seen before. \r\n \r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\ni lost sight as they passed over my car.\r\n\r\ni felt i needed to report this as i couldn't identify the objects, however i do believe they are man made. but i'd love to know if anyone else reports this or if there is a way to see if something was going on.","distance":"21-100

a small plane following it.\r\n\r\ni was driving from stephenville to fort worth. it was a clear night without any clouds or rain. it was pitch black dark outside. i was on i-20 heading east. on the eastern horizon i saw a bright blue flying disk heading towards me and flying directly over the road. it was flying very high at a planes altitude. slightly lower and to the right of the blue flying saucer was a small plane. it was dark outside i could only see the glowing white-blue light on the bottom of the ufo and the red and white flashing lights of the plane.\r\n\r\nthe small plane had a red light on the left wing and a white light on the right wing. the plane's lights were flashing lights on both wings. it was much smaller than a commercial plain. it was triangular shaped and flying at a plane's speed while following this blue flying saucer. it was not directly behind it but flying slightly lower and to the right of it. the plane did follow the flying disk, going the exact same route.\r\n\r\nthe bright blue flying saucer was twice as large as the plane and flying higher. it was as bright as a star and was flying incredibly fast. the saucer came from the east and was directly heading west. it seemed like it was going as fast as a shooting star, but it had no light trail or haze. the saucer flew directly parallel to i-20. i watched it directly pass over me through my sun roof. i saw the bottom of the flying saucer. it apeared to be a perfect circle with a clearly defined blue rim. it was brightest at its center, a bright white-blue light that dimmed to dark blue on the edges. even though it was very bright it was not fuzzy around the edges like a light or a star. the saucer kept the perfectly defined circle shape. it seemed similar to a led tv seen at night from a distance. it seemed like it was glowing from within. it flew at an impossible speed, making it from as far as i could see on the eastern horizon to the western horizon behind me in 1 to 2 seconds. the small plane followed behind it, but at a comparable much slower plane speed. the flying saucer flew in a straight line and the plane followed directly behind it.\r\n\r\nthe bright blue flying saucer was so fast that i doubted if others on the road even caught a glimpse of it. it was too fast for me to get to my phone.\r\n\r\ni also saw what i thought was a meteor crash the last time i drove from stephenville to fort worth. it was on september 9th 2016 at 01:00. i was on 281 heading north to i-20 from stephenville. i saw what looked like an orange shooting star. that turned into a fireball. i watched to see were it landed, but it disappeared before it hit the ground, like it burned up. the center of the fireball looked like a black line before it disapeared.\r\n\r\ni witnessed
