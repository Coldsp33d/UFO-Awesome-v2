the front passenger seat.  when we were approximately 1/2 way back home to port greville from parsboro which is about 19 km. distance. we were 10-15min from home in an area that provided a great view of the orange sunset\r\n  \r\nsthen noticed what appeared to be fireballs and we assumed they were a meteor shower but then we noticed something out of place as 3 orange globes were traveling at different speeds/altitudes/hovering amd were leaving behind a d trail which didn't last long and was more of a rocket type which appeared to be linearily attached to greater the speeds the longer the tails length, reminded me of a jets shock diamond \r\n\r\nspeed,greater matched their orange colour, the 3 orbs  there was 3 of these objects but i never saw the spidey object until i looked at the pics to see if they were any good. it stayed with us above the power  lines until we lost him when we arrived home.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the orbs but spidey went over us one final time and this is when it changed colour from grey to red, green white but i'm not sure if was the  body or the appendages that were changing colour. my samsung couldn't focus on it in time to get a pic of this event.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived home the 3 orbs were still racing around for a short time which i tried to capture on my nikon 3200 but distance became a problem as it moved west over spencers island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?  \r\n'\r\non the drive home we were commenting on the spectacular sunset when we came to a point where where the tree line hills and

he was 25 yrs. old. he's an avid hunter, and knows the backroads and woody areas very well. late one night he wanted to go \"shining deer\". he plugged in his portable spotlight, and rode in the back of his truck. i was driving his truck, directed by him down the two track path, deep in the woods. then i'd drive slowly, and stop frequently so he could shine his light in the brush and look for wildlife. during one stop, i laid my back against the door with my head out the drivers window looking up at the stars because the sky was clear, and the sky looked so big! i saw a slow moving small plane directly ahead of me, i was looking at the stars, when i noticed a fast moving plane, flying higher up than the first plane, and the lights were colorful. i noticed it went higher, quite fast, i followed it with my eyes, it gained altitude super fast, as i watched i knew something wasn't right. then the craft just stopped! as it hovered, among the stars, i saw the lights were pulsating, the craft was round, i yelled at my boyfriend to look at this thing! it started again slowly, stopped,  made another couple of starts, stops, sharp turns. i yelled for my boyfriend to turn the spotlight off. the thing started again, but this time, went straight up, and it must've been at a very fast speed, because it went out of site. i was so afraid by that time, i remember my hands and body was shaking. my boyfriend jumped in the truck and we immediately headed back to our tent. i wanted to leave right then and drive home. (home was 4 hours south). we didn't leave until the next day, but it took me awhile to calm down. seeing that ufo was surreal. i've never seen anything like it since!  and it's been 40 years! the movement wasn't smooth. it's hard to explain. it has been burned in my memory, and i don't think we really talked much about the incident afterwards, and never told very many people. two years ago, i talked to that boyfriend, and i asked him if he remembers that night. he said \"yes i do\". i said, what do you think it was? he said,\"i know what it was\". and he is a man that is outdoors hunting and fishing year round. doesn't scare easy. i am a very skeptical type person, but that siting changed my life forever!

observing it, it continued to pulse. it then made a slow turn to our left and retreated toward the north.  it seemed to dissolve in the distance.  \r\n\r\ni considered both objects to be about a 'block' away from us.  if nothing else, i find it interesting to have a sighting like that going stealthily into neighborhood fireworks. i felt slightly amused by the experience because i have seen

our neighborhood and we thought it was romantic, so i parked my car at the side of the road, opened the roof window and stargazed. then all of a sudden we heard an extremely loud bang that sounded like a gun shot, but it came from the sky. my girlfriend and i was startled then we looked up to the sky. and that's when things got weird. we saw a multi-colored meteor of some sort but it was going far too fast for a meteor. the sound got louder, the situation didn't look too good so we tried to drive away, and that's when the impact occurred. the shock wave was intense and made my car, my girlfriend and i bounce probably a few inches off the ground. i asked my girlfriend if she was okay and she looked like she'd seen a ghost while starring at something behind me when i was faced at her direction. i turned around seeing a car sized, shinny, metallic object smoking about 3 feet under ground. we got out of the car to get a closer look and it had seemed the object had individual little plates shifting and attaching to the other plates. i never felt so scared in my life. then i realized it wasn't a meteor, or any type of craft, it looked like technology, but nothing i've ever seen before. the plates shifted to kind of a star shape but the plates were still completely visible. my girlfriend screamed in fear when we both saw the entire structure melt into what looked like a black liquid. we ran to the car and i tried to start it but it wasn't working, it didn't even make a sound we looked back at the object and it was growing taller but we didn't hear any noise from it, so we decided to get out of the car and run as far as we could. we looked back only to see the object solidify into a giant, mechanical, metal humanoid figure and it turned around and chased us down the road until we found the edge of the forest in our neighborhood. we climbed up a tree and hid there for about 7 or 8 minutes praying not to die while i was trying to calm myself and my girlfriend down. the giant metal humanoid stopped looking around and ran off just after i got down from the tree and snapped a photo with my phone. i questioned reality that day.","distance":"21-100
