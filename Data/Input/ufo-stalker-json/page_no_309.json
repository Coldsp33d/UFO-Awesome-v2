bedroom(she knew i was awake playing a video game) and rushed me to go out into the back yard with her(she was always a night owl and always watching the skies as she believed that she was abducted by et's on multiple occasions as do i and had seen many ufos throughout her life as have i) and at first i didn't see anything but she was pointing at an area to the southeast of our home which was in nh so i was watching and after about 20 seconds i saw a flash, and then another and another emanating from what appeared to be a cloud but it seemed so far away that imo it wasn't inside earths atmosphere, it almost looked like a lightning storm but outside earths atmosphere, so we were standing there in the freezing cold watching this for about 10-15 mins and suddenly something came out of this \"cloud\" we were watching and seemed to be spinning out of control and on fire, i could see that it was cylindrically shaped and clearly on fire and spinning end over end across the sky, we watched it spin across the sky until it was out of sight(it mustve been about 30 mins we watched this slowly spinning across the sky)i could immediately tell that whatever this was it was clear that it wasn't inside earths atmosphere but wasn't far beyond our reach and the entire time this \"cloud\" just kept on flashing every 15-20 seconds, i truly believe that my mother and i witnessed a \"star war\" between opposing factions that night( i really wish i had filmed it but was so caught up in what i was seeing i didn't even think about filming it until the following day), so after about an hour i told her i couldn't stand out in the cold anymore and went back in the house but she must've watched this for at least 2 or 3 hours, she has since passed away and was in support of mufon and et disclosure so i'm passing this experience on to you now because she's gone and i don't want this experience to die with me, take it as you will but i was there, i really did see this happen and i would be glad to take a polygraph test to prove it, its not the first time i've seen something inexplicable in the night sky and i'm sure it won't be the last, also being that i believe that i've been subjected to et abduction(having inexplicably urinated and thrown up lots of dried blood on multiple occasions with drs finding no trace of any reason for that happening to me and having a mysterious bruise on my stomach that just magically appeared one day about 18 years ago and it remains there to this day) all this being said i hope we as a race can come together and understand what exactly is going on behind the scenes here and come up with a solution to this invasion that we are clearly facing, thanks for reading and good luck to all of us","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

i felt drawn to a certain star in the sky so i stared at it for a little while. that's when i notice that there is a triangle around the star and the star is actually an eye, looking right at me. it was the 'all-seeing-eye'. it looked very life-like, i could observe little twitching motions in the eye itself and it was obviously looking right at me. this, more than any of the preceding events, was actually quite frightening to me. the triangle i could comprehend in some way, i understand the concept of telepathy, but this was just something completely different and made me feel very small.  \r\nin the next couple of weeks i observed some highly unusual things, that perhaps should go into a separate report. to summarize, i saw a white light hovering on the water and had another telepathic contact (this was about a week later). for about 20 minutes after i made contact it seemed that the laws of physics had completely changed, or that time simply didn't exist anymore. the experience is hard to describe, it was like seeing the connection between all things and that everything was just 'floating' and not actually moving on its own.   \r\nsince these events i have done a lot of research into similar experiences and sightings. i actually find a lot in common with a lot of the psychedelic literature out there as well as similar reports of telepathic contact with extraterrestrial (or extradimensional) beings. \r\ni would like to state that at this time i had only ever taken psychedelics once in my life (magic mushrooms, about 5 years prior to the event) but i am a daily user of marijuana. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":81283,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.30039017535215,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01022017-0006","longitude":-123.15071996686324,"occurred":1315270800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British Columbia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1483336074000,"summary":"Observed black triangle with red lights on corners and white light in centre approach. made contact.","tags":["sound","triangle","lights","floating","disc"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1483354391230,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"V6E1S7","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1945,"locationName":"Vancouver, British Columbia","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:38342"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Standing on roof of hospital i was watching the fireworks for new years around 1155pm i seen a orange spear floating over me heading north. then a second appeard ahead of the first i seen.  i then went to get a co worker to   witness and we seen 5 more. at further from first sighting. it was one to appear then four more two from west two from east they did a floating hovering pattern then fadded away. lasted at least a hour from my first sighting","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":81281,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6688674,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01022017-0004","longitude":-81.5118835,"occurred":1483228800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1483334117000,"summary":"Histanding on roof of hospital i was watcng fireworks for new years around 1155pm i seen a orange spear floating over me heading north. then a second appeard ahead of the first i seen.  i then went to get a co worker to   witness and we seen 5 more.","tags":["floating","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1483352591235,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:38343"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Cluj2","country":"RO","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I noticed later on this light on the photo. nothing similar on other photos taken before or after, same trip. even for me, not being a specialist, the light is not appearing as a reflection.

nuestra, esa luz de repente se apago y apareciã³ en un segundo detrã¡s nuestro hay se mantuvo unos segundos para volver a pasar a la parte delantera del vehã­culo, entonces se encendieron dos focos blancos muy potentes pero que no deslumbraban solo enfocaban al coche no iluminaban la carretera, esas luces de repente empiezan a realizar cosas para mi entonces extraã±as de los dos focos se apagaba por ejemplo el de la derecha mirã¡ndolos de frente luego se encendã­a el de la derecha y se apagaba el de la izquierda, seguidamente el foco que estaba encendido se apagaba que dando a oscuras para encenderse de nuevo pero solamente medio foco ejemplo desde la perspectã­va del coche se quedaba encendido la mitad derecha del foco la otra permanecia a oscuras luego la mitad derecha del foco se apagaba y se encendia la izquierda esto paso con los dos focos de forma independiente, luego se encendieron los dos focos y empezaron a parpadear de forma similar a como se comunican los barcos con los focos creo que como morse asã­ estuvo durante por lo menos 2 kilã³metros, al llegar a un punto concreto de la carretera se apagaron las luces y aparecieron a la izquierda del coche en el suelo como a unos 30 metros en un pequeã±o valle al que se podã­a bajar por un pequeã±o camino de tierra, seguimos sin parar y cuando creã­amos que ya no nos seguã­a al girar una curva de derechas vimos una luz muy potente que alumbraba en linea recta hacia el monte no a nosotros y en ese momento se veã­an al fondo como a un kilã³metro y medio o dos las luces de la aldea de valdemeca esas luces ya no nos siguieron se quedaron en la curva. en el coche estã¡bamos mi ex mujer mi ex cuã±ado y entonces su novia mi hijo de dos aã±os, todos estaban muy nerviosos las mujeres llorando mi cuã±ado le temblaban las piernas yo quise parar y hacer una fotografã­a pero no me dejaron, ya que entraron en pã¡nico cuando llegamos a tragacete fuimos a la comandancia de la guardia civil para decirlo y el policã­a que nos atendiã³ nos dijo que no era su zona y que no podã­an ir. otro dato es que el coche un crisler 150 no podã­a pasar de 60 kilã³metros por hora.\r\nen el momento del avistamã­ento yo personalmente no estaba nervioso, mas bien asombrado por lo que estaba sucediendo y por que no me dejaban parar el coche para ver realmente que era eso. pero no se porque motivo no puedo olvidar ese echo aãºn despuã©s de tanto tiempo.\r\nnota: no se si esto tendrã¡ relaciã³n pero unos meses despuã©s en la cara entre el pã³mulo derecho y la nariz me empezã³ a aflorar como si fuese una punta de algo que me ubiese clavado y al sacã¡rmelo saliã³ una especie de rectã¡ngulo con apariencia de plã¡stico de color amarillo y no mas grueso que un sello de tacto solido y rã­gido y un tamaã±o de unos 4 a 7 milã­metros de largo por 3 0 4 de ancho.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path

bunk in me and my brothers bedroom. i was scared to get back up there. well one night sleeping in moms bedroom i went to sleep and woke up floating at the head of her bed. my back to the her bedroom window. my vision was fixed on the brown panel wall across the room to the right of where i was sleeping. the bathroom is to the right of me and the light is on. that is how i am seeing the panel wall with the reflection of light pouring out the door. i floated and stared at that panel wall what felt like years. i was in like a daze or like coming out of anastesia feeling. i can see the bookshelf moms dresser makeup kit bed perfect in the shadows on how it would look at my angle and lighting. i didn't have any of my other senses it felt like. just vision and memory. it felt like time wasn't there or slowed way down. i watch as my brother walks from our bedroom to the bathroom. then it got dark forever. then the lighting was back and i watch him walk back to our bedroom. i tried yelling but couldn't. i continued floating and staring at that panel wall until i was being pulled back to where i was sleeping. my vision turns and i can see the hallway going to the kitchen. the bathroom light pouring out the door lighting up the linen closet across from it. then my vision turns to the hallway going into the living room close to where i am sleeping. that's where i see it ducted back in the darkness of the hallway. the way the bathroom light ran along the panel wall and dipped into the hallway. i could see a little past it's right shoulder. it was maybe 3 1/2 ft tall. it was pale grey in color with a big bald head. it had a big brawl or the top of it sockets was big and preluded a little off it's head. it had little to no ears and a small nose. it had skinny arms. frail looking thing. i got real scared because i thought it was a vampire. i woke up that morning thinking it was just a dream.It happened again not long after that episode. i was staying at my dad's 30 miles away. i slept on the couch in the living room. well one night i wake up floating across the living room staring eye level at this light green phone i usually looked up at on the wall. like the first episode i stared in a daze like feeling. i stared at it what felt like forever. like time wasn't there or slowed way down. dad had a pole light outside that poured a hazy lighting in the kitchen and part of the living room. i am finally being pulled through the rear entrance of the kitchen. i see the hutch china cabinet the kitchen table and table settings perfect at my angle floating and the shadows of lifhting. i am being pulled to the front entrance of the kitchen. i see the refrigerator the magnets stuck to it sink and strainer. i am being pulled through the front entrance of the kitchen back to the living room. i see the hot wheels i was playing with along with the pringles can on the coffee table beside the couch where i was sleeping. my vision went to the darkness of the closed in front porch. i get real scared because i don't see it but feel it. it felt like a vampire. i went back to where i was sleeping on the couch. i felt this thing come up from behind me but i couldn't turn around. it was like i was parrelized. i woke up thinking it was only a dream. it wasn't until 2005 that i realized it was more. i watched something on alien abductions or outer body experiences and i remembered those two events. well i told my mom kind of laughing that i might have been abducted or had an obe. i told her both of those episodes that happened to me. she looked at me and said that's crazy because one night she had a dream she was floating up in the linen closet. it gave me cold chills because that's less than 15 ft. from where i was floating. where i seen that
