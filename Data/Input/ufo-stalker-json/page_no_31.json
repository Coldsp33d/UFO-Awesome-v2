hours, approximately 3:30 am about february 12th or close to it, a flashing light was seen in the southwest sky at a distance by my roommate. he casually stated that every time he sees flashing lights in the distance at night he has always wondered if they could be ufos. from the living room i told him that he's probably only seeing an airplane since we are near both the wright-patterson afb and because the dayton int'l airport is not far away. he replied that he did not think this was an airplane. so, i went out and took a look to see what it was he was seeing. after some careful observation it was obvious that this was not an airplane.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it might simply be a drone, but it stayed in one position, was jiggling over a tiny area in the sky, was flashing various colored lights, and was very slowly descending. there was no noise that i could notice.\r\n\r\ni went to get my binoculars and we both took turns looking at the object. it was difficult to determine just how far away it was, but considering my perception of its size it would seem that it was approximately two to three miles away, otherwise the object would have been immense.\r\n\r\nalthough we did not have a tripod for the binoculars we tried to be as still as possible so that we could get a clear look. despite our attempt to eliminate any and all jitter it seemed that the object itself was jittering because even when we compared it with other nearby stationary objects which we were able to keep clearly in view, the object itself was in fact jiggling around like a bug over a light. it jiggled up, down, left, right, around in circles, but only over a relatively small area. in fact we could only see the jiggling when we looked through the binoculars because with the naked eye it appeared to be hovering and stationary. we are confident that the jiggling was not caused by us because there were trees in a nearby view in the binoculars and we had the trees perfectly still in the sight, but the unidentified object was itself jiggling. for the sake of comparison, if i were to have extended my arm and placed the tip of my pinky finger over the object it would be seen to have jiggled around in an area only equal to the size of the tip of that finger. in other words, it was not jiggling around over the entire sky, it was only moving this way over a very very tiny area. it was also alternately flashing red, green, yellow, white, and orange lights, although i do not remember the sequence.\r\n\r\nwe both watched it for about twenty minutes during which time it was slowly descending, all the while the lights continued flashing in various colors, and the object continued jiggling as it hovered. we both came to the conclusion that this was definitely not an airplane or helicopter because it remained hovering over one area for at least a half hour and made no noise. we also feel that it could not have been a drone due to its relative size. we have been searching the web over the past week to see if there were any other reports of this object but have not found any, to our disappointment. perhaps nobody else was awake at that hour and was not looking outside which means we were the only ones to witness this.\r\n\r\nwe both mused that this must be an extraterrestrial craft of some sort and spent the remainder of our time awake discussing the possibility of life on other worlds, what it would be like to interact with an extraterrestrial entity, whether we'd ever seen a ufo before, and expressing a hope to see it again, but alas we have not.\r\n\r\nthis is the first time in my life that i feel confident stating that i saw a ufo.","distance":"Over One

understand if this happens again. i've been visited again. this time, taken. i was also taken in this 2015 incident and that's just now come to light in my mind. every time they take me and try to make me forget what happened, something from a previous contact will surface, like my subconscious cant hold all the information in it's hard drive so it moves it to the desktop \"my conscious memory\" where i can view it again. in november of 2015 i witnessed a craft, a huge blinding craft. it was so bright it lit up my surroundings like it was the middle of the day. i could see the sun, separate from this object, on the horizon as it was setting. last time i reported this, i only remembered it appearing as i stepped into my suburban to go to a rehearsal for a musical i was in. i stood on the running board and observed it as it came brightly into sight and i was bewildered as to why the people across the street seemed to not notice. i remember why they didn't respond to it. they weren't even moving. they were frozen in place. i saw these two short beings, 4 ft tall (which may be generous) and a tall being (maybe 6 ft., not much taller than myself). they came walking from a grassy area. i don't remember what happened or how i was aboard the craft, but the next thing in my memory is being aboard the craft. the beings examined things i had on me at the time. my keys and the door lock remote, my phone, and my wallet. they were very curious about these items. the only tests that have been done on me is brain scans. they sit me in a plastic like chair attached directly to the floor, but on a raised area of floor and put an apparatus on my head. it's white, has no lights and no wires. has metal contacts on the inside that remind me of the ones on exercise equipment that keep track of your pulse, but these do way more. they study the scan and give me an injection in the lymph node area on the right side of my neck. the beings, theyre kind of blue-ish. very loving and warm. they pity us, it seems. the next thing i remember is standing back on the side of the truck where i was before. having not remembered what happened at the time and thinking i'm still just looking at this thing in the sky, i sit down and start the truck and drive off. it's still there at this point, it's not as bright, but clearly following me for a bit before disappearing.\r\nemail is

stopped...And it was pulsing, not flashing light lightening.  we then walked out to the back porch to get a clearer view and it was much larger of an area of lights than anticipated.  i pulled out my

just shut off the hair on my arms stood up like crazy.  we then contacted the local tv station to see if there was anyone else who reported and they said no.  i explained the situation and sent them the video. they reviewed it and said they thought it was lights reflecting from emergency vehicles.  i do not buy that as the light was so high in the sky and they also said there were no emergencies

understand better what is going on and if anyone else has experienced something similar.\r\n\r\ndate is between august 21st 2017 (solar eclipse) and august 31st 2017. \r\n\r\nmy husband and i woke around 3:00am to sounds outside our bedroom door. when we looked outside we found our dogs crying to be let in. but we had locked our dogs in their crate before going to bed and our backyard gate is locked as well. jokingly my husband said “i think aliens teleported the dogs outside.” and i said “i hope so, that would be awesome.” \r\n\r\nmy husband put the dogs back in their crate and we went back to sleep, but within a few minutes our bedroom door opened again and when i turned to look, two little beings floated into the room. as soon as they saw me looking at them i was instantly knocked into paralysis and could not move at all. this also shifted time into a super slow motion flow. i began to struggle and freaking out and that seemed to then knock me out of my body into another plane or dimension. i could now move and when i rolled over to look up at this being it had black colored wind moving behind and around it in slow motion. \r\n\r\ni never saw the second being that seemed to stand guard at the door, but i somehow knew it was there.\r\n\r\nit was hard to focus on it because time seemed to slow way down and it was as if my vision would vibrate when i looked at it. it had an extremely white head shaped like a chinese dragon mask. i thought it might be a mask at first with very protruding brows and forehead. \r\n\r\ni then saw it had a very slim neck and a collar at the top of the suit it was wearing. it was grey and form fitting with a belt or band in the middle. \r\n\r\nthe energy it was putting off was very unfamiliar to me and i did not like the feeling of it. i immediately noticed that i could feel myself outside of my body from above at the same time that i could feel it from below in bed. i could see and remember everything at the same time from both locations.\r\n\r\nmy instincts told me to create a protection field around my husband and i in bed and i pushed out this blue sphere of light around us from below. but as i was watching myself do this from above it looked like a flat blue circle instead of 3 dimensional. \r\n\r\ni was really struggling from below to move and wake my husband up. i could start to feel myself swaying and trying to shake. from above the energy was so uncomfortable that i wanted to get out of the room immediately. i started floating out my door and then hovering above my pool outside. it was well lit outside, not sure if it was close to a full moon or it was an artificial light from above.\r\n\r\ni felt as if my body inside could almost break free from this paralysis when i was sucked back into my room and  i shot up in bed. i woke my husband up and said “they were just here, floating around like peter pan!” \r\n\r\nhe could also feel that something was off and didn’t quite know what was going on. he ended up getting our 9mm out and stayed up in the living room for the rest of the night.  the time on the clock when this started was 3:23 and when i shot up in bed it was 4:14.\r\n\r\ni wrote everything down to try and make sense of it all and a few months later my notes disappeared.  i knew something was missing in that hour in-between the beginning and the end of the experience so i went to a hypnosis to try and recover my memories.  \r\n\r\n2.9.18 hypnosis session\r\n\r\nthere was an hour of time missing from the night the 2 beings came into my room and this is what came to the surface during my hypnosis session.\r\n\r\ni felt sucked out of my bedroom, and floated out above our pool outside thru our sliding glass door. i then remember being in an extremely bright white room that eventually turned into a large oval shaped room with a metallic table in the center. i floated over to the table and realized that there were other beings in the room with me. they were very tall with white robes on and they looked like preying mantises. there were 2 or 3 of them, very big looking heads. there is a strange hum to everything. \r\n\r\ni then felt a warm golden light start to shine down on me from above and it seemed as if they were scanning me, downloading and uploading energy software or information. and then there were all kinds of lights that formed into small bubbles that seemed to have movies or videos playing inside of them floating all around me.\r\n\r\ni then floated horizontally next to another being that i could not remember seeing (just knew it was guiding me) down a long corridor of openings, and then i remember being submerged into a thick gel like water. \r\n\r\nit was pulsing with electricity and i felt my body being pulled outward as if being flattened with the waves of energy. the hum in the silence was very loud and i felt myself being pulled into a wormhole or tunnel. it was pumping me thru it like an ocean current, 10ft forward, 3 ft back, and i felt like this light lead me back towards my bedroom. as i looked back up into this light there were 4 blue beings looking back down at me from above.\r\n\r\nand then i shot up in bed in my room again, knowing instantly that the 2 beings were just in my room, floating around like peter pan right before all of this happened. it was as if i had floated above my pool and then was instantly sucked back into my room and body before recovering these memories during my hypnosis session.\r\n\r\ni do remember other humans being in this place also, whether they were helping or being helped also. this place did not feel as if it existed in this reality or time or universe. it was somewhere completely separate and outside of everything. \r\n\r\nafter this experience i went to a float tank on oct 22nd 2017 and had memories of being in a craft and traveling thru wormholes out in the universe.  that night i woke up to a violent episode where my eyes were banging around in my head so hard that i couldn't move without throwing up for hours in the bathroom and had to be taken to an vertigo specialist that diagnosed me with bppv and i have had issues with it to this day still.\r\n\r\ni am an artist and i plan to try and draw or create images from what i saw this year.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:51:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":90310,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.145812078981145,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02192018-0013","longitude":-95.74969436651932,"occurred":1501471380000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

happened to see the blinking slowly flying object in the sky around at 9 p.M. at first i thought it was just a helicopter or something but to my surprise it didn't make any noise. it was so bizarre. after that incidence, in fact, i could often see the thing around 2 or 3 times a week on average.\r\none day i made up my mind to have a better look at it so i climbed up the mountain and succeeded to see it very closely. its shape is a black right triangle and three blinking lights on its three corners with a faint red light in the center. its size is approximately bigger than a helicopter but not that bigger than a plane. as i said earlier it shows up every night regardless of weather conditions - clear or cloudy, hot or cold, rainy or snowy. it seems like it is searching for its missing fragments or its missing comrades. it has a routine traveling course and rough time tables orbiting the town. it usually flies over the mountains or military facilities - especially u.S.A ones- laughing at human weapon systems.\r\nit may sound foolish, but i think it is conscious of me and watches my activities because it follows wherever i go. i always get a hunch it's going to be imminent wherever i am. i tried to let korean major news agency posted about this. but they are reluctant to go deeper. if you want video clips of the btu i'll be glad to send them. i have lots of video clips. it is not a mystical thing anymore but to me  is a daily matter of factual routine. if you don't believe me you can refer to korean ufo hunter on you tube. he has also witnessed it with me most of the

thought at first was a large redish orange star except it was moving. it was snaking across the sky like it was on a rollercoaster, undulating up and down going from southwest to north west. i wasn't scared but was wondering what the hell it was?! after about 30 seconds of this it turned abruptly upward and vanished without a trace like it was swallowed up by the night sky. it didn't look solid at all like it was made out of fire and was moving so fast it was leaving a slight light trail behind it. when i looked at my car's clock it was 10:52 pm. i come from a family of retired fighter and private pilots and so i'm used to seeing all kinds of civilian and military aircraft which this was nothing like this. there was no lights on it but updated as if it was just made of pure light, it moved at impossible angles and was too fast to be man made. it wasn't a meteor either because rather than fall to the earth it moved back upward towards space before disappearing and was moving too closely parallel to the horizon. i'm kind of sad i didn't get a chance to video it as it was brief and i was slowly driving.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

sure if it matters but it has been in the back of my mind since.\r\n\r\ni am sure i was sleeping for the night...School night,and suddenly i remeber vividly having a dream where my step father and i were driving down a road in my mothers 1990 dodge minivan. my stepdad asked me to grab a map from between the seats. then the bright white light hit the van and everything powered down but the radio. i could hear the music and see the digital clock on the dash. it was 01:01. i vividly remeber being unable to move or talk. i could make slight noises but no words, and everything was instantly in slow motion even the car. i remeber a slight warmth from the bright light. my stepfather seemed to be like a statue. then the light got so bright everyrhing went blank. i woke up in bed. strangest part was when i started getting ready for school i couldn't shake the weird electric feeling or sensation. i noticed in the mirror a black mark on my arm. in the center was a ellipse shape skin colour, kind of, with two almond shaped black marks on the skin tone ellipse. this was before the internet so we did not have camera's readily available, so i tried to trace it on a piece of paper. then i scrubbed it almost raw with no result.The mark looked like it was under my skin. like you could see a few layers of skin over it.\r\ni was scared to tell my mother due to several reasons, so i went to school. when i arrived everyrhing was normal. then i had a flash in my mind of my pencil rolling off my desk and falling in a very particular way. i was jolted by a classmate bumping me and asking if i was ok. i asked why and he siad i seemed spaced out. he kept asking if i was ok so i decided to tell him i had a wierd mark on my arm after a wierd dream. i showed him and he siad it looks like a tattoo. of course rumors started to fly that i had gotten a tattoo at the age of 13 and i was pestered by many to show them my \"tattoo\" which i didnt because now i was super embarrassed.   i left school early and went home very upset over the entire incident. i tried to scrub the \"tattoo\" off and no change. i was worried if my mother saw it she would be angry so i went to bed early to avoid her. to scared to sleep, because i didnt want to have that dream again, i decided to play witb lego. next thing i remeber was i woke up in my bed, next morning. had that confused feeling as to what happened the night before. went to the bathroom to get ready for school. thats when i noticed the tattoo was gone, all evidence of me trying to scrub it was gone, no scratches or redness. i was so happy but confused. i went to school quickly to show off my arm to those who made fun of me the day before , that it wasnt a tattoo and no one seemed to know what i was talking about. the original friend inshowed it to seemed to be distant now. so now even more confused, we carried on with the day. during science class at the exact sentance from the teacher, and time, during the lesson my pencil began to roll off my desk and land the exact same way i pictured it the day before. i figured i was going crazy, chalked it up to some voodoo dejavue....And never spoke of it again because of the fear of being locked up in an insane asylum. literally. i asked my mother if anyrhing was wierd and she thougbt i was for asking. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince then, i have had a constant feeling being watched, but from the inside. like a   scientist  monitoring and expirement in a petri dish. more on a reasearch level.\r\n\r\ni have also had wierd sensations of being drawn to locations for no reason at all and then feeling lime i was home even if home was several thousand km away. i use this to my advantage to this day wirh help determining where my next vacation is going to be.\r\n\r\ni have always figured it may be a dream, but i have recently seen a show on mufon and some cases or parts of cases resemble experiences or thought process i have. \r\n\r\nim sure its nothing but my curiosity is peaked. did something happen or did i just eat some bad meat before bed one night many years ago?","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":90304,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.0570151,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-02192018-0007","longitude":-114.0629359,"occurred":667699200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

over us, and very close. it soon departed.  within minutes after it departed, two men in suits drove up in a government-looking sedan, and began to question us as to what we saw.  they told us to forget the incident, as it was just a weather balloon.\r\n\r\ni have been living with this event for now close to forty years, and am writing a book about the series of events that happened that night and the following day.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
