was in a formation that made it at first look like a constellation of stars, but only brighter, and they glowed orangish-red.  i immediately stopped the car and turned and asked the passenger who is my cousin, \"what is that?\" i knew what it was even though i never  witnessed anything like this before. my cousin, said, \"i don't know.\" so we watched it for a couple seconds and noticed that the lights were moving around eachother. almost like they were changing into another formation. it was nighttime so we could see the stars and also airplanes around us. we knew that this wasn't an airplane or a star. the lights were brighter than stars, they glowed an orangish-red color. compared to the stars they were much bigger in size and glowed orangish red. they moved from left to right, open & down around eachother unlike the motions of a plane. we drove around and watched it for a couple minutes. then the lights started disappearing one by one. until there was one left. the last one stayed in the same place for a couple seconds and then disappeared like the other ones. there was no sound coming from the lights. i know people are going to think i'm crazy. but i had someone with me that seen the same thing. i wasn't scared, i was more excited than anything to be a witness to it. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

shapes. it may be that i am seeing these objects up close and personal.  they are relatively close in proximity. to see something in the sky far away is one thing but to see them so close as to identify them has me very concerned. where is this going? i did not even believe that ufo's existed until 2013. that was the first time i could actually identify one. that was when i knew that people seeing things in the sky, unidentified flying objects, were real. i cannot tell you or anyone else, where they are coming from or exactly what they are. i believe, you have to see one up close to become a believer.  i do live close to an airport and i know what an airplane looks and sounds like. these are not planes, or helicopters, weather balloons nor drones.  they seem to have very advanced technology. most have been huge in size and for the most part very quiet. shapes have gone from disk shape to a star shape (with one large bright light), to a triangle with smaller red lights along the parameter (flashing in sequence), most lights are flashing in irregular patterns (one big flash, usually white, followed by red smaller flashes). for the last few weeks the ufo shape has been square and usually more than one.  i cannot identify the smaller ones because they are further away, pretty high up there. the larger one has more lights and when they meet up they continue along at the same rate of speed and seem to connect and then the smaller one takes off on its own again somewhat faster than the larger one.  this exchange (?) happens at a distance so i am not sure what does happen. i also have seen 2 large objects meeting up and flying off together and then meeting up with a smaller object. tonight i saw a large square ufo flying about 500 or so feet in the air traveling north and it met another object at another 500 feet higher up and moved quickly out of my vision. they were loud and at first moving slow until they met up and then took off fast.  i am not sure what was or is going on but i do not like it.  so. about an hour later i heard more roaring sounds and this is what i remember seeing and hearing.\r\n\r\ntonight was the first time a ufo has changed its shape right in front of me. \r\n\r\nearlier tonight a square very large thing with flashing lights was traveling north through california. it was very low and traveling very slow. i watched it for some time before going inside my house.  can not report all of them.  it takes too long but they have been in the northern california skies almost every night. they are not trying to hide by any means. in fact i think they are taunting me.  they move when i move and stop when i stop and then lately they start traveling towards me. tonight i heard a loud roaring sound and i was not going to go outside again.  i had already gone out three separate times tonight and it is very, very cold and dark.  also, this ufo stuff is starting to scare me.  but then i heard a loud bark; just like my dogs bark but louder. i ran to the back and side windows to see if my dog had gotten out and at that time i saw something large overhead and i could see lights blinking and moving acto see what was so loud. i was shocked to see my dog right next to me and realized i could swear it was her barkalmost tripped over her because she was that close. i could tell she was afraid and did not know where the bark came from.  no other pets or people around! i ran outside and saw lights and a very large ? directly over the court where my house is, i saw what seemed to be something square with bright red lights flashing on the tips of the four corners. the red lights turned white and just as fast as i could blink; the object changed shape and the lights were now only on two ends of a rocket or missile.  two ends and it was like an outline  ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

was looking at the big dipper and small dipper and noticed the north star. being that it was christmas eve i admired it. i saw something in the corner of my eye at first thinking it might be a small cessna air plane and took a quick glance at it and after a second it changed its flight path instantly from south to north within a half second. i did take more notice of it at that point and observed it for a longer length of time. i know two people that have and fly drones as hobbies and have watched drones fly. i have never witnessed a drone fly that fast but was hoping i could hear the propellers spin as i've heard them before and to make the distance this thing did in the short span of time. it would travel about a hundred yards or so and make a circle or an area and makes it's way again and repeat its pattern again. when it reached a certain distance it stopped completely almost out of my eyesight and it stayed there for almost 20 minutes.Two things came to mind, one, it has the best battery known to man and the second was that this person flying this thing would have no idea where it went if it were in fact a personal drone. this object had anywhere between 7-10 red lights perfectly aligned with white lights along its opposite side. it blinking equally both red and white at least three time per second as it flew over me. i'd be relieved if it were a drone that i'm not aware of that might either have a high capacity battery or gps controlled. it was a bit unnerving to witness. i hope i'm not a damn fool that witnessed some dumb kid losing his christmas

love to watch the deer early in the morning and evenings.  this particular morning i noticed a light i had never seen before on my property. i watched it until the sun drown out the light.  i wasn't sure what it was. i brushed it off as the something to do with the sunrise. that evening i went to walk my dog before bed.  there again was that light. at this point it made me uncomfortable and scared because there was no way that this light was coming from a vehicle and if a person were doing it,  they were in my backyard using some special light that didn't have a beam or show any origin of where this light was coming from. these lights would come every night for a few consecutive days between 10 and 11 and would stay until the sun came up.It started a couple weeks ago. it stopped for a few nights but has started up again this being the 4th consecutive night. a large warm light that's round in shape moves up and down my yard. there's no beam to follow to find where the light is coming from.  it moves in a pattern as if it's scanning my property. it moves from the side of the house to the back and all the way around my house. i see bright flashes of light. balls of light in mid air that burst out making a flash similar to an old fashioned camera flash.  there's never any sound with this.  i also see small red orbs of light like an led light in random places in my yard. they fade in and out. if i turn all my outdoor lights on to try and drown out the moving ball of light scanning my yard,  i see shadows moving everywhere. tonight i actually watched a large orange ball come from the sky and disappear in the tree line. right after this happened is when all the lights and shadows started tonight. i know this all sounds so crazy. i am sane and alcohol/drug free.  i have been trying to get pictures and video for days but all i have is a cellphone to try and capture this on tape.  it always shows nothing but a black screen. i am currently trying to get a camera that can film in low lighting. i need help with this. i never believed in anything supernatural until seeing this.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500

always look to south area. the reason, when i was a kid my dad was in the rcaf and we lived at cfs baldy hughes which was a radar station on the pine tree line. being curious i listened to the service men bs, and occasionally they would mention an anomaly seen on the scopes up the hill.(where the radar sets were). anyways because of this and my having witnessed a ufo before i wondered if i would see one again. well that night it happened. sure enough a light appeared out of no where, it hovered for a few seconds then started to move in a random flight pattern, it seemed to revolve on it axis a couple times and it would go very bright, then dim to almost invisible. it reminded me of the experience i reported about i had in 1986 in comox. after a couples minutes i said to myself 'idiot get your camera!' so i ran inside and back out, it was still there just hovering so i started to record it. it started to do the same radical movements with the dimming and getting bright again. it continued to do so for another 3 mins or so then it went bright and disappeared. i have to search my media and hopefully i can find the recording to submit at a later date. i told my dad about it, and showed him the video. he was not surprised, and said the guys on the hill(radar techs) quite often, had an unknown visitor that hung out in the same area quite often. they scrambled fighters a couple times but by the time they got there it would be gone. so they stopped reporting it, as it was just there, didn't seem to do any thing but observe and move around a bit. i have 1 more sighting to report from a year ago in the same general area.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

having observed a star earlier from ground level i had supposed this was what i was looking at because my view from my doorstep is obscured by a bush. suddenly, as if it recognized i acknowledged its presence, it took a descending turn from left down to the right from a hover in the western sky, dropping a few degrees in a 'j' shaped maneuver. again, there is a star or planet in the sky reflecting light that can be seen very visibly tonight. the shape, size, and brightness were so similar i clearly mistook the object at first. as it began to move it did not take a straight line path. this ruled out a shooting star or a satellite. it slowly dimmed in light to a vanishing point just at the cloud cover. only other brightly lit objects can be seen. this took between five to ten seconds for me to witness. one to two minutes later the regular air traffic passes by far below the height of the object. two planes but more suspiciously a helicopter in the distance from the west moving rapidly but no noise.  the object was starlike and spherical in shape.  bright as any airplane lights and brighter.  but the way the light trail and light from the object dimmed seemed intuitive not to mention the flight path changing from a hover to an almost evasive descent to find cover.  this is my third time witnessing an object in six years. all three different objects in three different states. this is my first report.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:09","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

on the night of the 13th jan 2013. it was a clear crisp night (but the stars weren't visible due to the large amount of traffic light pollution on the motorway/freeway) when i saw an object in the distance that seemed to be flying low at about i would guess, 500 miles an hour (but that is a pure guess) and it had about five to six  bright red lights in a straight row. at the time, i couldn't make it out as an object, i could just see the lights. it could have been the tail lights of several aircraft for all i knew. being a former criminal investigation analysts and very aware of the sort of tricks our eyes can play on us, at first i took no notice of it just thinking it was the reflection of the red tail lights of vehicles passing us by in the opposite direction reflected in my window. however, as the red lights i saw moved in a straight path i then looked around from every angle from where i was sitting to see if any other car lights showed as reflections on the glass but all i could see was my five to six lights continue to 'fly' in a southly direction. at the time, the road was packed with traffic because the a1 motorway is one of the busiest roads in the uk. i felt no anxiety or fear but my curiosity was set into action. as the night was very black i could not see any shape but, then i saw two lights come on (at what i suppose) was the 'wing tips' and the shape now looked like a triangle but it was only a triangle because of the shape the lights made. i am a healthy sceptic about ufo sightings believing that mathematically we must have been visited over the course of the years but personally, i am very dismissive of most reports. however, i did mention it at the time to my wife and she will gladly confirm that i saw it but i have thought long and hard before reporting it because as you can see by the incident date, it was nearly two years ago, but i think it is the right time to come forward. i would be very happy to supply any details of my background to any investigators who might want to get in touch.
