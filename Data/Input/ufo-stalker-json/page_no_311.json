depois, choveu um pouco.\r\neu estava olhando para as nuvens e refletindo sobre aparição de ovnis (eu estava querendo saber se eles conseguem nos enxergar através das nuvens).\r\nfoi quando vi um ovni (ufo) do tipo estrela passando entre as nuvens acima de mim. daí corri para dentro de minha casa e contei para os meus pais. meu pai me pediu para pegar a câmera e voltar na frente de casa porque poderia aparecer mais ovnis (ufos). quando voltei para a frente da minha casa, fiquei filmando duas estrelas que pareciam ser ovnis (ufos), quando vi o círculo brilhante se abrindo do lado direito, bem abaixo das nuvens, e de dentro dele saiu uma nave vermelha (uma mistura de nave do filme star trek com nave do filme star wars) e passou como um míssil, muito rápido, indo para algum lugar desconhecido.\r\nfiquei muito emocionado ao ver a nave, pois parecia de filmes que já vi no cinema! não era nenhum ufo tradicional, tipo disco voador. eu consegui ver um pouco os detalhes e a cor vermelha, mas ele não brilhava quando se \"materialhizou\". se tinha alguma luz acesa nele, deveria estar pouco brilhante. ele só brilho na hora que apareceu como um ponto de luz laranjado uito forte saindo dec dentro de um círculo amarelo \"maior que uma lua cheia\". na semana seguinte, no dia 25 de dezembro de 2016, às 23:30 hrs da noite (11:30 pm) eu vi outra nave vermelha passando como um míssil e \"descendo\" (em linha inclinada), e parecia com a nave do han solo do filme star wars, mas sem a abertura na frente e vindo no caminho contrário ao da primeira nave que saiu de dentro de um círculo no dia 18 de dezembro de 2016.\r\nno dia seguinte foi encontrado vários círculos misteriosos (agroglifos) em um sítio (zona rural) de santo antônio da platina.\r\ne na noite seguinte apareceu a nave mais sinistra de todas (foi incrível) uma nave negra triangular que veio do lado esquerdo da minha casa, que deve ter passado por cima do centro da cidade, e fez a volta em direção a minha casa e desacelerou, fazendo uma acrobacia quase em cima da nossa casa (meu pai estava sentado no banco em frente da minha casa esperando junto comigo aparecer os ovnis) e deu para ver várias luzes laterais, dos dois lados, (pequenos círculos brilhantes) formando a letra \"v\" e virou, voltando a seguir o caminho que estava fazendo quando eu o vi aparecer. parecia que ele estava procurando algo quando desviou do trajeto que ele fazia, veio em nossa direção, fez uma acrobacia (ele desceu um pouco quando veio em direção da nossa casa e pareceu bem maior), desacelerou quando chegou quase em cima da nossa casa e virou para trás, desaparecendo logo em seguida (foi desaparecendo rapidamente seguindo a direção que ele estava fazendo quando ele apareceu). foi o dia em que eu mais me emocionei, pois eu achava que naves triangulares só apareciam nos estados unidos (eua). sempre quando eu vejo eles eu fico muito feliz.\r\nem 1996 foi quando uma nave apareceu no fundo do quintal da minha casa, há uns 30 metros do chão, e ficou parado em cima de mim e da minha mãe por uns 20 ou 30 minutos e depois desapareceu (tinha forma de diamante e era muito lindo, com luzes do tipo \"neon\", muito brilhante. foi um contato inesquecível!...\r\nestou pensando em comprar uma câmera com visão noturna para tentar filmar eles, pois acho que irão retornar.\r\neu gostaria de passar todas as filmagens para vocês.\r\ntambém, em 2001, eu tive um sonho em que fui abduzido, e quando acordei parecia que eu era outra pessoa \"melhor\" e eu me senti assim e todas as pessoas perceberam isso. no sonho eles me disseram que iriam me devolver assim, uma pessoa bem melhor, mas o efeito durou até às 21:30 hrs da noite (9:30 pm).\r\nestou enviando a foto dos círculos (agroglifos) que apareceram em um sítio (um tipo de pequena fazenda rural) e 2 fotos de naves (uma nave do filme star trek (do penúltimo filme) e uma foto da nave de star wars, de han solo, a falcon,que passou no dia 25 de dezembro, que coloquei cor vermelha para deixar mais parecida com a que eu vi. e achei uma foto de uma nave triangular no google bem parecida com a que eu e meu pai vimos no dia 26 de dezembro.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1. i was just checking a news report on my pc monitor in the home office this morning 12-30-2016 regarding the closing of the bob graham sunshine skyway bridge (bgssb) in pinellas county, florida on the outskirts of st. petersburg. i wanted to see if the bridge closing was due to relatively high winds with the dip in temperature starting last night. i did not know there had been a wrong-way automobile crash on the bridge causing the closing this morning.\r\n\r\n2. i had a previously subscribed flash email inbox notification from an online news service. it was about a fatal mv crash involving two (2) motor vehicles at mile marker 8.3 on the bgssb, with an attached news photo taken at 7:39 am est. the crash reportedly occurred at 7:34 am est. \r\n\r\ni was simply looking briefly at the brief news article and photo, which showed the two crashed cars, in unrecognizable heaps, near the cement retainer barrier wall of the bridge on the right. in the photo, there are also several blaring lights set up on the left of the crash area illuminating the scene for the police and emergency teams to deal with the situation and clear it. a road sign just beyond the a light pole reads south skyway fishing pier with a mile marker stated. \r\n\r\n3. i then noticed two (2) colored (red and blue) horizontal diamond-shaped objects apparently hovering about as high as a standard highway light pole just off of the crash area of the bridge to the right of the photo frame. the familiar shapes seemed distinct to me, so i saved a copy of the news photo for further analysis via expansion detail. \r\n\r\nas noted previously, these horizontal diamond shaped and fireball type orbs are not normally in our visible light spectrum for easy human observation. when briefly visible to the naked-eyes, these phenomena seem only illuminated by intense reflected light sources, rather than emitting sufficiently visible bright light of their own. \r\n\r\nthey also seem attracted to intense light and/or heat sources for apparently absorbing energy. the various colored orbs appear tasked with most of the intermittent absorption of energy efforts, while the colored horizontal diamonds (red or blue seen thus far) initially locate sources first, then observe the defined mission until they seem to disappear from existence. however, that may not really happen, it just seems that way. out of sight, out of mind. \r\n\r\n4. a closer inspection of the news photo, blown up larger, also revealed at least three (3) translucent white orbs with auras near the nearby light pole, streaking towards the vehicles crash site. i say streaking because there is a visible and captured light-tailing in the photo, of apparent motion i.E., as the 3 translucent white orbs are descending towards the bright lights on the bridge. \r\n\r\nadditionally, two more, very faint, red horizontal diamonds also seem to appear in the distance behind the clearly distinct blue and red hovering horizontal diamonds. one is positioned in the photo above the blue horizontal diamond and the other is to the right of the following red horizontal diamond. \r\n\r\n5. i was quite surprised in this discovery of yet another chance ufo sighting. i certainly wasn't looking for one, nor had such thoughts crossing my conscious mind at the time this morning. it seems that i may have become sensitized, both unconsciously and consciously, to recognizing such visual sighting anomalies in both digital video and digital photo formats. previously, i have viewed a number of related media and read several factual books/articles regarding the study of ufos/uaps during the past two years. it's a bit spooky, but i have always had excellent visual perception for detail as various age-normed tests have shown across time.\r\n\r\n6. the evidence provided is a professional digital photo from a local news source available online, which can be examined in great detail with digital various enhancements, area enlargements and frame cropping.

cross the u.S border these entaties are aware during my travel south of the border these entaties are already waching and following me all the way to my destination ,often its not only just one and on the way there during stops i great them and the entaties aknowledge my presence ,this has been on going for the past 2 years, when reaching my destination its common for me and a family member to go outside as soon as the sun sets and we wach as these many various entaties \"play\" in the night sky they have become such a regular thing to see ,anyone who comes and visits our land will see them aswell and some people do freak out, at times some of these entaties are friendly for they seem harmless but others make trouble and do make it obvious to me or other spectators that they are not approving of this activity ,i myself have witnessed difrent crafts from all sizes and ranges they seem to all make spectaculars in the sky from descending to ascending to dissapearing and hipper speeds ,some tend to travell in pacts but then the ones that seem to appear as a threat is a big craft that looks similar to a long pill and it normaly emits orangy red and yellow collors and it also releases other crafts from its inside they seem to guard this big craft and scare the other on going traffic away they are normally spotted in the direction where at sertain times mars is seen most, i have gotten to a point where i attempted communication and got answers back by the crafts themselves ,i know wich ones not to fear although there are blue ones crafts that do appear and diamond ones aswell that have me scepticle due to their percular behavior ,at one point i had unwanted contact by a being in the unoted states wich is rare because i noticed most of these beings will not follow me or contact me as much during my stay in the u.S although the ones i am familiar with will every now and then pop up and let me know they are there and waching almost as if in a protective state ,when i cross the border i have noticed they seem to be pleased of my return to mexico ,in dreams and visions during my stayes in mexico it has become apparent to me that they tend to communicate more and are warning me or updating me on world happenings aswell as other worldly dementions were they themselves have taken me in my sleep, not one has ever touched me they are mostly guides but the one that made contact with me in the u.S did hurt me,scared me and even made sure i knew of its obduction by awakening me in mid air over my bed before letting me go and yelling ,its a sound i will never forget ,the entaties in mexico are a sight to see,ive tryed to record them on cell fones but some will eather not appear and alot of the time there is no visible details other than orb like shapes, the best sightings are in person as i do not have the funds for more suffisticated equipment ,a thermal camera will be ideal since on the ranch during night walk with no light source other than small flashlights you will hear them in the corn or wheat field thrusting by and its easily apperant its not the wind ,some entaties will be so close to the ground they at times leave crop circles on our land ,they have never bothered pur live stock and other locals report seing them in near by mountains often ,its such a regular sight that it no longer causes fear but ony caution to not approach them ,respect them and let them be, in my theory is why they have not harmed anyone around ,the sightings are daily and are always spectacular a sight to not forget although the entaties are weary of american for what evet reason they are not to mexican peoples ,in my visions i am constantly beggining at a pyramid and then taken out of this demention most of the time i do not recall all details but am aware they were trying to tell me something,due to stress in my life i noticed it has made it extra dificult for me to remember a full vision but would love to know what these messages are, most i do know are of future occurances in the united states and they are all mostly bad, from invatios to political figures all the way up to important dieties that are aware of our worlds wrong doings ,most the messages i recieve are to do something about our planets economic downfall and our race extiction ,a buch of warnings and revolations , if you are wanting proof of ailien life or specifics on difrent ailien races and ships ,mexico on my land is the place i would recomend.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

adjacent to my view.Now, clearly above a timber yard ,it moved short distances ,to the left, right,down and up.After around 2 minutes from first sighting,the u.F.O., then stationary and still

similar ufo/uap's would show at dragstrip demonstration events where cars or trucks were modified with aircraft jet engines. this time, i was vigilant and ready for another sighting. \r\n \r\n2. at 0.31\" into the 2'35\" video clip, a fuzzy, translucent, red, horizontal, diamond appeared from the right part of the screen near the massive flames coming from the semi-truck's jet engine. i had seen this shape emerge first in a previous sighting report, but thought it may have been a lens flash (it was not when viewed more closely later). at 0.38\", two (2) red, horizontal, translucent diamonds appeared, then three (3) from 0.38-0.43\"/2:35 in a staggered stack on the left of my monitor screen.\r\n \r\n3. i do not know what these translucent, horizontal, red diamonds were, but this is the second video clip like this where one or more appear first before one or more fireball orbs appear. my sense is that the red diamond entities, which can vary in size, may carry or at least have control over the fireball orbs that seem to do the grunt work of energy retrieval and close surveillance of their target for energy assimilation e.G., heat, light, radiation. \r\n\r\n4. as once before, the hovering red diamond entities disappear before the fireballs show up distinctly. in this case, there were two (2) clearly defined green fireball orbs with aura fields hovering, then moving from right to left, towards the jet truck's blast of power flames with several light yellow orb fireballs on the periphery. they were rather hazy, more dimly lit, and moved from right to left, where the three (3) red, horizontal, translucent, diamonds used to be in the video frame. these ufo's are best observed and analyzed slowly, in quick start-stops, which freezes their momentary action and displays the time shown in the video clip duration. speed alone can make these objects seem to disappear when they are simply accelerating out of sight in a fraction of a second. \r\n\r\nwhen the jet truck's engine began shooting huge flames, exhaust smoke, and rear force turbulence to a high degree, the two (2) green orbs closed in towards the vehicle and hovered over it - then expanded significantly with layers of light green aura. that was a new discovery! when the jet engine's burst of energy subsided from the truck, they were gone, but reappeared a few seconds later on the right side of the screen at their previous hovering size with some overlapping and bobbing about. these may indeed be intentional recharging energy events with some risk of exposure in the human reflected-light range of vision for their ongoing purposes. \r\n\r\n5. once again, i was a bit stunned to see another example of these apparent ufp/uap entities, in two different countries, a year apart, at car/truck jet dragstrip events. they do not, of course, appear on every similar public event, but the entities seem to get around the earth to meet their interests and functional needs i.E., their attraction to mass amounts of energy, heat, light, radiation and speed of some objects. jet engines, rockets, nuclear power plants and active volcanoes seem to attract their intermittent interest worldwide. i'll keep looking for similar sightings for more details and understanding of their processes. i can perceive them more readily now consciously and unconsciously in video clips.  \r\n\r\nmy preliminary hypothesis is that these red diamonds and fast-moving fireball orbs have been absorbing energy periodically to 'gas up' and make energy conversions (which exposes them briefly electrically via photon discharge buildups to us) and then they return to their preferred spectrum of light and mass structure. as discussed by many in the field, i think this is a deep and winding rabbit hole we are just peeking into. \r\n\r\nsuch ufo entities, i too suspect, have been right under our noses for many centuries or even millennia, but often just out of our sensory grasp and evidence gathering techniques to understand what we are looking at etc. these longstanding, sneaky, cohabitants that silently speed off to parts currently unknown, disappear, or dissolve from sight may be actually occupying the same space-time continuum with us versus extraterrestrial in origin. by utilizing appropriate advances in technological assistance to aide the limitations of our normal senses, we may eventually lure them into enlightening exposure regarding their mission, methods and origin. \r\n\r\n6. the 2'35\" digital video clip with sound ended; however, the ufo/uap entities described above were visible to varying degrees for 2'04\" for further independent analysis. the posted video site online address can be provided upon request (file copy saved). unfortunately, it is
