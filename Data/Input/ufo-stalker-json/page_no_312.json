have i ever seen what i believed to be a ufo. i am 65 years old and am a retired agricultural scientist. i am not an avid star-gazer but i do enjoy watching the night sky on clear nights. i can identify at least 3 constellations--the big dipper, the small dipper (hard to see anymore), and orion's belt.\r\n\r\ni took my dog for a potty break out onto our south lawn at 6:05 pm on dec. 28, 2016. i live in a residential neighborhood in which the houses are fairly widely separated. street lights are minimal and there is essentially no vehicle traffic on the street next to my house. stars in the sky were clearly visible. the city lights dim the brightness of the stars mainly looking north from my house but the south sky is quite dark. during the time i viewed the object, the moon was not visible. the sky was mostly clear (many visible stars) with perhaps a few high clouds. there was no wind.\r\n\r\ni saw the object almost immediately. it was in the southwest sky, probably 25-35 degrees from vertical, and i am guesstimating that it was 1000-2000 feet in elevation. it appeared to be about the size of mid-sized airplane (10-20 passengers). what caught my attention was the motion of the object. i watched it for about 30 seconds and it made no directional movement. it appeared to be mostly hovering, but it frequently made small almost random movements (almost what you would see an airborne gnat do). also, it made no noise.\r\n\r\ni could not definitely discern the outline of a solid object but i sensed the object was solid and my best guess is that it was oval in shape. the most prominent feature was 2 distinct white lights. i believe there were 2 smaller red lights to the outside of each white light, but they were less distinct. the white lights for the most part were constant in brightness and not noticeably flickering or pulsating.  the lights appeared to give off a halo effect and also seemed to produce a slight beam (like headlights). i watched this object for about 10 minutes initially. at one point the lights nearly disappeared. this occurred over a 5-10 second period. it was not a gradual dimming. instead, it looked like a candle that is about to go out because it is running out of fuel (oxygen). but then the lights, when about totally out suddenly came back on. \r\n\r\ni watched this object for approximately 10 minutes. no one else was outside with me to verify what i saw. i then went inside for 10-15 minutes. when i went back outside the object was still there, except that it appeared 2-3 times farther away, slightly closer to the horizon but in the same direction. the only visible light was what appeared to be a single white light. it was still 3-4 times brighter than any star and also at least 2-4x larger. it was randomly changing in intensity--would almost disappear then appear very bright again. the motion was the same as before. this time i watched the object for another 5 minutes (approx. 6:30 to 6:35) and then went back inside. i went back outside at 7:15 and the object was still where it was at 6:30 and its lights and motion were as before. i went back inside to make this report while the details of what i saw were still fresh in my mind.\r\n\r\ni am not suggesting this was some type of alien craft. it was not the moon, nor a star, nor a planet. it was not a normal plane or helicopter. i am not sure what it was. i would like to know.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

strait of juan de fuca. i was in the passenger seat of an early 80s white ford pickup that had a canopy. we were driving along side grays marsh farms when i realized that i was gazing out the window at a green ball of light. it was pacing us perfectly, and was about 30 -40 feet from us at about 25-30 ft. off the ground. it was about 4 ft. in diameter in my opinion (i am a carpenter by trade). it was like staring at a green moon, and gave out its own light, not hard to look at. at some point i turned around and started looking around the vehicle for a green light that might be reflecting off the inside of the window. as if prompted by me looking away the object moved out in front of us into the other witnesses view. they apparently couldn't see it at the height it was at outside my window. my buddy who was driving yelled \"what the hell is that?!\" as i turned around to look, the object had advanced out in front of the truck, but still over the farm property. the large orb was on the other side of some wind break trees that bordered the road, but our view was unobstructed due to no leaves on the trees. the driver punched it to catch up with the object, but as we increased in speed the object did as well. we were rapidly approaching the end of the road, where it turned at a 90 and paralleled the strait. in the next moment the object took off at a speed so great it left a line in the sky that was still visible even after we had screeched to a stop at the water. we got out of the truck and just stared as the line slowly disappeared. we never talked about it after that night. it's funny now, because when i hear people talk about there being life \"out there\", i now have no doubts. one thing i left out is at some point i had rolled down the window to see better once the object had moved out in front of us, and i remember hearing nothing but the truck. whatever the object was doing, it had to have an \"intelligence\" behind it. to pace us so perfectly for so long, i will never forget it. i have never written about this experience until now, but remember it as if it were yesterday.","distance":"21-100

at first they appeared to be jets but the movement of the craft was far too irregular to those of jets and also seemed to be at too low of an altitude. for those who are not aware, it is literally impossible for any craft, at least known to us, to produce any contrails. the best way i can explain it is that craft were making maneuvers that seemed too sharp at close quarters. on top of that, the main object that brought up this curiosity was what appeared to be a cigar metallic shaped object just simply hovering in mid air. the amount of craft that i had seen on this particular date was 7. 6 small craft which, again, appeared to be jets, but then the large cigar shaped craft equalling 7. now, the photos that are uploaded do not depict the cigar shaped object, but instead depict another craft which i assumed was a jet. but, upon further investigation by sending in a foia request to investigate what i had seen, the faa reported back that there was no activity in the skies on that particular date nor the time that i had suggested. a copy of all findings and requests made is uploaded into this case. my purpose of submitting this is to see what other people think as well as what the experts believe it could be. it is possible i may have gotten 2 crafts in a couple of the pictures, however i think one of the potential crafts is just a bug that got in the frame. one other thing, as i mentioned before, i saw 7 total craft. of the 7, 6 appeared to be jets, but before they appeared to be solid objects, i witnessed them as simply white dots. it is possible they could have been stars and  i was just seeing jet aircraft, but in the pictures, especially the really zoomed in picture, you can very faintly make out a few white dots. if i could get a possible answer as to whether those are just stars/planets i picked up or if they could be objects, that would also be appreciated. i look forward to finding out what is found during this investigation. thank

station for some snacks. i was in a parking lot, with a basketball court right in the distance. i should note that i felt particularly good at that time, maybe even at the moment. the moon looked beautiful that night so i grabbed out my iphone 5s camera and snapped 3 pictures. 2 were taken with no flash and one with the flash on. 4 months later i go back to inspect the photos when i noticed that there three odd looking lights in a shape of a saucer above the moon. when i snapped the pictures i wasn't aware of any ufos in the area. i didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. only upon inspecting the photos did i notice the strange green lights in the sky above the moon. when you zoom in on the lights, it is almost as if you can see shapes of what might be the occupants inside. the

lights seemed to be stationary and were for about a minute. i still thought plane but then the star-like flashing moved quickly a short type distance to the south-east. it seemed to then move in a straight line, but faster than a plane would move, especially a plane that far away to appear to be a star. the lights were very dynamic as well. brilliant, clear and distinct flashing one atop the other with no green to be seen. the light slightly changed course again and then went pretty much in a straight line until it went below the tree line. no feelings felt, but; did note that about a year ago i saw a much different anomaly in the same trajectory. so i guess one could say i feel the irony. i observed the anomaly then came straight inside to file this report. i believe in ebe's and their crafts, or vessels, but i never thought i would observe either; and certainly not twice. like last time, i tried to explain away what i was seeing but in each case the behavior of the anomaly suggests something other than what one would normally see in the sky.

pulsated the static got more intense. then i heard a voice in my mind that wasn't my own, it sounded like a female voice and very soft in tone. the voice said they had ben watching me for a while, the

either the 17,18, or 19th of december 2016) i was driving home from a job that i had started in collingswood,nj. i was on a very busy 3 lane highway, route 130, stopped at a traffic light when i first noticed 3 red glowing objects which seemed to emerge from a strip of trees. the trees were right on the street line, and the objects were extremely low, no more then 10 ft off the ground. i thought it must be some kind of prank, lights attached to balloons by kids for fun, or some kind of toy drones. it wasn't until i was stopped again, at another traffic light that i was able to get my phone out and record what was going on. i have a 2 minute clip i posted to my youtube channel (but i unfortunately cannot figure out how to post to the media attachments below), but i will post a few screens hots from the video, and i am more then happy to give the url link to my video upon request). what i recorded was 3 red orb/plasma light ufos, they appeared to be pure energy, or light. the way they ascended into the sky showed intelligence-two of the orb ufos touch one another and the 3rd, which was lagging behind sped up as the other 2 hovered, eventually passing the 2 that converged on one another. i have recorded many videos of ufos, as i have been ufo/sky hunting for 4 years now. i have not turned anything into mufon, as i was waiting for a video that had undeniable rock solid proof of ufos. i believe i have that proof with this video, as it has silenced every skeptic i've shown it to.. one thing that i may add is a jet plane enters the frame towards the end of the video. this is a topic for another time, but i and many others have video proof that ufos are cloaking themselves somehow, appearing as jet airplanes/helicopters. so theven airplane in the clip very well may also be a cloaked ufo. thank you for your time and please feel free to contact me via email or cellphone regarding my youtube video documenting this event,  or any other questions","distance":"21-100

to left slowly and go higher in the sky. sometimes it would seem as if it would turn which showed me green and blue lights on the other side. it would take approximately 5-10 seconds for it to move higher in the sky. after several minutes of viewing and realizing this wasn't a helicopter or a plane, i went inside to grab my camera in order to take a long exposure so i could document the movements with a long exposure photograph. about 20 seconds later, i came back outside to see the object had moved all the way across the sky, now lower on the horizon, probably closer to 30 degrees. as i was getting my camera set up it began moving away. it took me a minute or two tops to get the tripod in order and my camera settings set and by then it had gone over the horizon. unfortunately, we have a railroad embankment in our back yard which obstructed our view of the low horizon. however, when i stood on my tail gate i could see that it had stalled over a red light on what i think is a tower. at one point it started to meander back towards us and i thought i'd get a good photograph of it but seconds later it was gone.

the centre of port phillip bay on nearly every monday night for 6 months or so.We have observed these craft from the end of beacon point road clifton springs.This road ends at a cliff face at the waters edge of corio bay which is a bay of port phillip bay.The craft we have observed are always in the same spot and approx 200 mts above the water.The activity that we have observed is very strange and occurs in a cycle.Sometimes we see only 1 star like object then other times 2 or 3.The objects are seen north of the end of beacon point rd looking towards melbourne.Usually after about 5 minutes of the star like object hovering it then moves off in an easterly direction at approx 50 mph.When in motion the star like light then turns into red and green and white flashing around the craft.L have observed these lights through binoculars.All the sightings have happened of a night time so its difficult to give accurate details of size and shape.My guess is the craft l see are about 5 to 7 miles away.When a craft moves off another craft moves into the same posistion and again after 5 minutes or so it also flys off in an easterly direction and so forth.L drive down beacon point rd 4 nights a week usually after 9pm and have not noticed these lights on any other night always a monday night until this last week when l noticed them on a sunday night which was christmas day.This is what has
