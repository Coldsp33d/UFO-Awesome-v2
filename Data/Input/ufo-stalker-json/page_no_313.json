growing louder/closer. the pulsing sound seemed to morph into what i can only describe as something trying to duplicate the sound of a light propellar air-craft. the sound distorted and changed over several minutes until it sounded like a small plane...Or rather a recording of a small plane. it just did'nt sound quite right.  i was lying on my side in our tent without the rain-fly on.  the roof is mosquito mesh. i rolled onto my back and sat up to see what this strange sounding aircraft was up to,since it was very late and we were in the middle of nowhere.  above me approximately 200 feet was a very bright, internally illuminated orb. i was so startled i swore. the orb then shot off to the north at incredible speed. moment later there were flashes of colored lighting(pink, yellow, green) where the orb and just gone.\r\nmy wife woke up to my exclamation, and also saw the colored lightning flashes that lasted about 30 seconds or so. there were no storms in the area according to

of the orange sunset\r\n  \r\nsthen noticed what appeared to be fireballs and we assumed they were a meteor shower but then we noticed something out of place as 3 orange globes were traveling at different speeds/altitudes/hovering amd were leaving behind a d trail which didn't last long and was more of a rocket type which appeared to be linearily attached to greater the speeds the longer the tails length, reminded me of a jets shock diamond \r\n\r\nspeed,greater matched their orange colour, the 3 orbs  there was 3 of these objects but i never saw the spidey object until i looked at the pics to see if they were any good. it stayed with us above the power  lines until we lost him when we arrived home.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the orbs but spidey went over us one final time and this is when it changed colour from grey to red, green white but i'm not sure if was the  body or the appendages that were changing colour. my samsung couldn't focus on it in time to get a pic of this event.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived home the 3 orbs were still racing around for a short time which i tried to capture on my nikon 3200 but distance became a problem as it moved west over spencers island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?  \r\n'\r\non the drive home we were commenting on the spectacular sunset when we came to a point where where the tree line hills and distance prevented us from locating them. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\nthat they were a meteor shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions\r\n\r\nthe objects raced erratically and contained the following events:?Hovering/speeding up/down/changing altitudes. the spidy one was overhead when it changed from grey to green, white and red.  however my camera t00k too long to focus on the object and we missed the shot\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions\r\n\r\nmy wife still doesn't believe in ufos but i'm convinced now. we initially were excited but when we went the final hill had to up a hill with fading light and spidy ufo right over top of us, we were geting a bit nervous, but we did get some fair photos even through car windows at 50 kmh and in hills and forest. \r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the objects\r\nwe lost sight of the objects when the were approxiamelty 20 kms disance as they proceeded in a westernly direction over spencers island\r\njecs\r\n\r\nnotes\r\n\r\nnasa unexplained segment that has an x-15 pilot described a ufo.  the grapic displayed in the that

because of today's weather is a little bit windy and cloudy. however i noticed a bright star-like spot up in the sky to my south-west direction, with a up angle of about 10 degree, where normally real stars won't be clearly seen under this weather condition. i thought it might be the sirius (alpha cma) but no, it was only 7:45 pm and i saw the orion was still up in the sky to my east. i hold my body steady enough against the wall, and kept staring at it and found it was mostly hovering there but with some subtle shifting movements especially to the left or right side. now it is 8:20 pm and i double checked that spot, it has descended a lot and it has less than 5 degree up angle to the same south-west direction. also it start to become reddish color but mostly still maintain a bright white color. small shifting movement is still observable, but not easy to be aware of. finally i have a phd degree so i do not want to fool anyone here, i'm seriously report what i saw and it does put a big question mark in my mind. i know there is a military base around here but it doesn't looked like a type of aircraft or drone. well, after several minutes, now it began to ascending and again hovering at exactly the same position where i saw that 40 minutes ago. given the bright light it emits, i personally would rather believe it is human-made thing, but still, based on my working experiences i cannot think about anything that can hovering in the sky for such a long time. ok, a final check, i lost it, cannot find where it is anymore. in total, it lasts about 50 minutes.

pull into a parking lot next to me a gentleman exit his vehicle and shouted and pointed for me to look up and see a light he was observing. it was snowing lightly and the cloud deck was low enough over kalispell that the city lights were causing the cloud deck to be slightly illuminated. what i saw was a very bright single orange orb moving slowly from the east to the west. after about 60 seconds it appeared to fade out. then i noticed another orb appear behind it moving in the same direction. it became very bright and after another  60 seconds it became stationary. it then appeared to either fade or maybe gain altitude and fade after another 60 seconds. i then observed another orb in the eastern sky moving south. it became very bright and then faded after about 45 seconds. the whole incident took 4-5 minutes. the man who was watching these with me said he had been watching them for about 5 minutes before pulling over and parking. he did film them towards the end with his phone camera. i know it's christmas eve but i don't think it was santa's sleigh.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
