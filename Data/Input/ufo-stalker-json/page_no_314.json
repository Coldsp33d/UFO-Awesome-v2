night work out.  i was feeling very hot and sweaty so i decided to step out onto our deck to get cooled off, we have a significant amount of snow here.  as i was standing there i looked up and saw what looked like several different groups of what look like black birds, hundreds of them grouping together and flying they way birds do. this was after midnight so i thought maybe they were bats.  i've never seen bats like that before but it's possible.  i started noticing that the \"birds\" starting lighting up.  i saw one group actually line up, they were in a line and they would stop at equal distances from each other, then the first one would shoot off and one by one they went straight up.  i saw another do a tight spiral downward and then an orange red flame came out the side of it.  another had a quick orange bright light up behind it.  \r\nthey were doing 180 turns and looping flying together than apart.  there were so many of them.  i watched for quite some time and i noticed that i kept hearing jets flyover, we live within 50 or 60 miles of an air force base so that's nothing new but there was a number of them that were flying over this area.  i couldn't see them, due to the darkness but i definitely heard them.  i started feeling apprehensive almost like i was afraid to be noticed and went inside.  our dog was acting strangely as well, like she was scared.  she's a big dog and no coward but she seemed strange.  other dogs across the street were also barking a lot, i'm not sure why.  when i went to bed it hard started to snow but the last time i looked i could still see them.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

spotted one glowing, pulsating circular object hovering close to a mile away at about 45 degrees from horizon. the object then began to sway, almost like a slow dance before it started to seperate into dozens of different but similar objects. all objects continued to sway in unison as the seperation continued to fill the sky over a period of 30 minutes. rhe movements were all similar, literally had the feeling of an aerial slow dance. moving closer amd further away, spinning, almost seeming to chamge shape, all simultaneously. the objects then stopped, rapidly got in-line back to the 45 degree inclination before desending below the horizon.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed the object my first thought was that it was either a star or a distant helicopter. that thought only lasted about a minute before i realized it was neither based on the movement and the fact that the objects were only visible through infrared.\r\n\r\nat first i felt worried that nobody knew what the original aircraft was. once it started seperating, i became less worried the object was hostile and just became puzzled. the feeling of worry was rekindled when the objects got in line because this was so

heights, nj, when i saw what i thought was a helicopter on approach to phl, at about 500-1000 ft agl. a second aircraft came zipping up from behind. i thought they were going to crash a few hundred yards away. the second aircraft, quickly decelerating, dove to the left under the first one, back to the right, back to the left again, like a fighter jet, and then made a sharp right bank under it and quickly disappeared towards woodbury. i suppose a helicopter pilot might be able to make those sweeping movements, but i don’t think it could bugout and disappear that quickly. i do not believe that a plane could fly that slow and do that. thirdly, you’d have to be an idiot to perform that maneuver so close together over such a populated area.\r\n\r\nit was fairly dark, all i could see was the large white light (acft #1) and a wing-shaped line of lights, about the length of a commuter plane’s wings (acft #2). this line of bright lights was on the rear of the craft, larger than your normal navigation lights and in the wrong configuration for any registered aircraft that i am aware of. there was five evenly spaced lights of similar size: white – green – white – red – white. normally, you would see red on the left wingtip and green on the right and i have not seen lights like that shinning from the back of any plane or helicopter i know.\r\n\r\ni got into the house less than 1 minute later and ran to an upper window. i could not see the acft #2, trees block the view. acft #1 was still visible a mile or so away and appeared to have stopped. i dragged my husband and son out to see the light, but that is all you could see. it was too far off and indiscernible from a large light such as venus. it was cold and i did not stay outside to watch it disappear.\r\n\r\ni’m wondering if anyone knows of any aircraft like i described or if a near miss was reported. i live about 5 miles from phl, on approach to runway 35; we see a lot of planes and helicopters.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

sky was clear and it was very windy outside. i thought it was a helicopter but it stayed in one place and didn't move at all. it had no blinking lights just a solid bright light. after about 20 minutes i went downstairs to tell my wife and i could still see it from my back door. i checked before i showed my wife and she thought i was crazy but when i turned my head to tell her it is still there when i turned back it was gone. so i went back upstairs where i could see more clearly and much further. i saw nothing, if it was a helicopter or a plane i would have seen some light in the distance but it was as if it got turned off or disappeared. i have not seen anything since.\r\nin the morning on the news i heard of a airplane that had to do an emergency landing at pearson airport and it dumped its fuel over lake ontario. but that happened around 6pm, the light i saw was after 10pm. the freaky thing was that it didn't move and then just gone.","distance":"Over One

rectangular object the size of several city blocks ,and shaped like a wing in structure, was sitting stationary in the sky. this object slowly turned on a cloaking mechanism that obscured its crystal clear appearance from the outside inward. the object seemed to be obscured by light twisting around it in a purposeful manner until it disappeared from view. there was an ovular pattern that changed it's appearance  as it stared on the outside and eliminated the view of the craft  until it reached it's center. the craft had three parallel structures that looked like poles down it's middle. after the object was totally cloaked from visible light, three helicopters rushed to the area that the object was sighted, my theory is that these beings had an instrument malfunction and that is if they were beings instead of machines only would never reveal their presence on purpose especially to electromagnetic radiation detectors, like radar, radio communications, or visible light and that is how they fool mainstream scientists and even people who don't believe and send information to m.U.F.O.N .Hey this is the real thing this time. my feelings was that maybe the pet theories of relativity may need revision in a way that is unacceptable by most physicists to allow faster than light travel and communications without warping space time. and that maybe the spherical probes that resemble the foo fighters in project blue book that were around the wright patterson area flying in triangular formation that i saw before, in the nineteen nineties,  this incident and before reading anything about bluebook may move through space without a changing in mass or experiencing any inertia to acceleration   ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

love watching the stars anyways. i noticed a \"star\" in the sky that was way way brighter than the others and had some unusual characteristics. it was slowly moving and rapidly and randomly changing color. i stood there for a few minutes in awe observing the heavenly mystical. i then walked to my girlfriends building knocked on her door and when she answered i said \"call me crazy but there is a very unusual star in the sky. come check it out.\" we then both walked out to the lot where we could see it clearly. we both sat there and stared at it for about 10 minutes throwing ideas out there as to what it could be. we were both stumped because of the rapid color chang pretty much omitted any rational guess as to what this could possibly be. it looked like a star in the sky but the longer we looked the more we thought it to be much much smaller and close to earth. my personal guess is it was no more than 2 miles away and possibly only several hundred feet in the air. we both went inside her house to try to research the stars in the sky after about 10 minutes of observation. it never landed nor wavered from its slow
