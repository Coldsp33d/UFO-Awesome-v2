intense orange in the sky behind our house in the foothills. at first it looked like it might've been a very, very bright planet mars because of the amber color. mars usually is not as bright as the moon or this large... or close looking. it had to be below the clouds because there was a pretty consistent layer of clouds all around the horizon at that level.\r\n\r\ni watched it to try and rule out it being plane or drone etc., for about 10 to 15 minutes and it didn't move. if you walk out in your backyard and seeing unusual planet or star just sitting there you definitely take notice. one this bright anyway. the light was stationary and very bright like a jumbo jet coming towards you level brightness but a very distinctive amber color. \r\n\r\nit hung there perfectly. just as i was about to go inside it started to get lower towards trees or the mountains in the distance depending how far it was away. a few miles in the distance it is what it looked like but hard to say for sure. i was raised on the navy base around lots of aerial activity. i am very familiar with how the light can play tricks on your eyes or cameras in the dark, and i am very comfortable identifying aircraft. \r\n\r\nthen i noticed lights from a helicopter or plane... probably just a small piper plane or. another civilian aircraft would be common. it could've been a helicopter - i don't know but it was coming towards the light and then all the sudden this light - that has now turned more of a whiter shade than the amber it was when it was hanging in the clouds started to dart fast, what looked like a mile at a time and then stop on a dime. as the plane or whatever would catch up with it. again, the light or craft would dart faster than than any known aircraft that i know of and then stop on a dime and wait for the plane like it was playing cat and mouse. it looked like it would move different directions sporadically or like it was scanning in the area side to side. i don't know but the movements were not something you would see with a drone or any thing known at this time. possible unknown military secret aircraft is always a very good possibility.\r\n\r\nafter the third time the light stopped, the plane or whatever was coming towards it kept flying away then the light turned back towards its original direction. after a little while it went down into the trees or behind a mountain in the distance. i was too in awe or something to go inside to grab a camera or phone because i knew as soon as i went back out it would be gone. \r\n\r\nit was really kind of beautiful to watch and definitely stirs a lot of different emotions in person. who knows but those are the facts and it was wild to watch.","distance":"Over One

shaped and was brightly lit by the sun.  i could not see any wings on this object even as the sun angle changed.  i could clearly see the wings of all three other aircraft that were at much higher altitudes.  object seemed to be unusually slow compared to the higher aircraft. the only distinguishing feature was a somewhat less reflective area at the midsection.  the object continued in a

2013.  i walked out of the exterior garage mandoor on the w side of my house.  i immediately heard a low rumble mixed with a hissing like noise above me to the west.  i looked up to see what i first thought was a passenger plane on fire.  there are many airports nearby and it was not unusual to see planes in the airspace this object was in.  within a second or two, i was startled because i had realized this was no plane.  it was a dull silver domed object with orange lights around its middle.  i thought i could see a small spire like portrusion out of the top of the object.  it was a typical domed ufo looking craft.  in fact, that was one of my first conscious thoughts... wow.  my first real ufo sighting and it couldn't be a more typical looking ufo!   it was obvious to me that this craft was in trouble. i saw no flame or intense burning/glowing but could see some sort of fluctuating vapor trail being left. the vapor trail didn't seem to be coming from any particular vent or place on the craft.  the vapor seemed to almost enshroud the craft and then slip off and fall behind.  the rate of the vapor coming off seemed to vary slightly.  it would leave a trail and dissipate withing a few seconds.  the color was both disconcerning and facinatingly beautiful.  my first thoughts were that it was highly poisonous or radioactive.  the rumbling hiss seemed to increase in intensity coinciding with the billowing emerald green shimmery misty vapor or smoke this craft was leaving in its wake.  i felt the object was approximately a mile from me when i first observed it.  it was directly above me and to the west when i first caught sight of the object, travelling in a south or sw trajectory.  it's speed was that of a landing passenger plane.  and it's size seeemed to be about as wide as a school bus is long.  maybe 35-40 feet wide at it's center.  it was a particularly clear and sunny, beautiful morning day.  i could see the object in very clear detail.  i saw no markings, windows or anything on the domed surfaces both on top and below.  i saw no markings on the central saturn-ring of the object.  i saw what looked like a dull orange light in the short (maybe 2-3foot) spire atop the craft.  it could have been the extream rush of adrenahlin but i became so overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing this object that i rememeber feeling very faint, and close to throwing up my breakfast.  fighting off the swirling thoughts (fear, excitment, shock, awe, worry, dread, mania, etc...) i remembered my cell phone camera.  i remember almost ripping the pocket of my jeans trying to get my phone out.  i brought the phone / camera up to my face level and shot three photos.  the first was my finger in the way of the lens.  the second and thrid shot are attached with this report.  i believe my phone at the time was a samsung s2... i may have had my s5 by then but i'd have to look that up.  i can if it matters.  the elapsed time between when i first noticed the object and when i managed to start taking photos was probably 10-15 seconds.  the object travelled in a straight line heading s - sw.  this would have been from my right to left.  it seemed to me to be flying directly above beach blvd/hwy 39, which was the major street near me.  it was flying towards the ocean which was approx 3 miles away to the south.  \r\n\r\nthe event left me dumbfounded.  it lasted probably 20-30 seconds.  i did not observe any planes or helicopters near the object.  but the sky above my house was always pretty busy with all th elocal airports near my home.  and the police helicopter for my city was common in the sky but it was not around at the time this event took place.  i remember looking for it.  the helicopter is so common it was becoming a nusiance.  i thought how perfectly murphy's law it was for it to not be around when we really needed it.  i walked out into my front yard area after the object disappeared over the southern treetops/horizon to see if any of my neighboors had seen what i just had.  there was no one i could see nearby.  i went back inside and upon entering my wife surprised me with an early birthday gift.  i'd intended to tell her what i'd just witnessed but the gift distracted me.  the rest of the day was so busy i simply never had the right time to share what i saw with my wife or anyone.  the next day i recalled what had happened.  even with the photos i took which were quite good detail, i made a desicion to not tell my story to my wife or anyone.  it seemeed impossible what had happened even though i had photographic evidence.  i simply buried the event away in my mind and tried to forget about it.  i had nightmares for days afterwards.  but soon the memory and bad dreams faded and it was forgotten for the most part.  i was gaining ground in a successful professional carreer and i did not want to rock the boat with some crazy alien story.  occationally i'd remember my event when i'd catch some ufo story on tv or youtube but i haven't told a soul about what happened to me until this day.  this morning i woke up and hunted for the old photos.  when i found them i decided to tell my story.  \r\n\r\nit is what it is.  i know what i saw.  i know what i saw was a real object.  i have no idea how it wasn't reported on the news being such a low sighting and such a clear sunny day as it was.  i assume the others that saw it must have decided to keep it to themselves as i had.  i cant imagine any other explanation as to why i never heard about the event on the news or even town gossip.  but i never did.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Louvres","flightPath":"Straight-line

 i noticed an extremely bright light in the sky to the southwest.  after confirming with my girlfriend that she had also seen the object i began to become suspicious after she told me that she had seen it in a different position in the sky compared to where i spotted it.  this indicated that it was moving.  at first i thought the object may have been a helicopter monitoring traffic over the express way just south of my home.  i realized it could not be, as the light emitted wasn't produced from standard navigation lights, landing lights, or a spot light.  there was also no sound from the rotors.  the light was pulsating.  it would become very dim to the point of barley visible.  it would then become very bright, brighter than anything else in the sky.  it appeared to change color as well from bright white and blue to a reddish orange color.  i then began to think that it was a drone.  this was also not likely as it produced no sound at all.  it was able to fly for over 1.5hrs as we followed it while temperatures on the ground were 8 degrees f.  while following the object it seemed as if it was slowing down and possible hovering at times.  these are extreme conditions for battery powered devices, especially if lithium-ion batteries are the power source.  i called two local airports (kvpz 12mi south of initial location & krzl 42mi south of final location) to see if they could see any lights in the sky or if anyone had reported this object.  both claimed they could not see any objects and had no reports of such an object.  after following the object from town to town to the southwest we realized it was traveling much faster than when we first sighted it.  we decided to turn back and head home.  i looked to the southwest after arriving back in the town that we started in and saw the light on the horizon but much smaller than before indicating that we were much further away from it now.  it eventually disappeared over the horizon.  after looking over the flight path that the object took i found that it traveled for at least 9.5 miles to the southwest from the initial sighing area.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

on the last floors of a building, so it has a  wide view to west, northwest and north regions of the city (this is approximate) and to some mountains that surround the city. for what i can remember, between 9h30pm and 11h00pm the event occured and it consisted of various circular objects/orbs/lights with star-like appearance but with different glow and color (i was standing in a balcony). the duration of the event was about half an hour. the objects were red/orange lights. i first notice these objects by looking at west/northwest, more properly to pico do jaraguá and the mountains in that region. they seemed to appear behind the mountains and did what appeared a constant flight (with small or no change of direction) from approximately northwest direction to west, above the city . so, from my position, their movement was apparently from the mountains to what appeared to be the regions of vila pirituba, vila jaguara, osasco (so, i was well over a mile from the event). they moved to this part of town, always in the air, and some stopped in the air (i guess hovering), and suddenly they started to eject/dropping other star-like lights of the same colors (i can't tell if the size was the same) in the direction of the ground (with vertical movement). they fell with faster speed than the \"main\" objects that ejected them were flying with, and their number was approximately 3/4 per \"main\" object. i can´t tell with accurate precision the number of objects/orbs/lights involved, but it seemed to be over 10. they clearly were not airplanes or helicopters, because of the direction of flying and the site of the two city airports, there was no noise coming from them and there were no flashing lights as happens with airplanes and helicopters. for what i can remember i did lose sight of the \"main\" objects when they came to the mountains; in other words they did the opposite trajectory. in relation to those that were ejected, after they desappeared in ground (i guess) i didn't saw them again. beyond the event, what impressed me the most was the fact that seems that only i saw these strange but fascinating happenings, because i was not alone at the time. maybe the other people were distracted talking to each other, i can't find other reason. i just watched the events with curiosity and attention (no fear) and said nothing to anyone, i just waited for someone else to speak. but apparently i was the only one to see, so i did not had any comment with any of the people i was with about what i had seen.","distance":"Over One

friend and i made a trip from cold lake alberta to edmonton late fall mid afternoon. we were late to begin our return trip; around 830pm. a half hour out we encountered a blizzard the likes those of us in northern canada rarely see. the winds were low; and while the snow left visibility at a maximum 20 feet, it hadn't yet accumulated to deeply for the small car. at several points discussion took place; continuing on was absurd, with no where to stop or hold over for the night we continued at approximately 40km per hour and hoped for the best. my friend; a professional driver, had managed to get us to my best estimation more than half way home when i saw something. unbelievably; in the distance. the snow may have lightened slightly; but it was at a distance three times what headlights would have penetrated if not more. i asked first simply \"you see that right?\" \"oh yeah\" he responded. \"k well what i'm seeing can't be real i responded; so you describe it to me, because i don't want you playing games with me\" (i though i surely had developed some obscure nighttime snowblindness, and he was liable to make a game of this) to my surprise me described exactly what i saw. \"there's a red light, a blue light, some orange lights...Kinds looks like it's going to swallow us up\" more accurately it appeared as if the highway led into a stargate of sorts. five lights, red, blue, white, and two orange. they spun in the nature of electrons circling a nucleus but with no centre. as we approached we tried frantically to call relatives at home with unusually no luck. a discussion ensued about what we would do. over the period of roughly two minutes while we approached; it slowely retracted in size; from slightly wider than the road, to that of an ice cream truck. it also moved from the centre of the road to just off in the ditch. we drove by at less than 10km per hour at a distance of 12 feet or less. i believe this was around 1am. i wanted out of curiosity to approach it; but the individual balls all appeared as though they were tiny stars. as they whipped in circles in seemed they were unsafe and while the snow around and between them seemed unaffected i had the feeling as though they would melt through any comprehensible surface on contact. we looked more, than close enough to rule out any emergency vehicles, or other signals of human requested aid. what we saw was unexplained. it clearly moved out of our path, and i believe was disoriented by a world record snow storm. we did not stop the car or disturb it out of fear of never being heard from again and disappearing from loved ones under bizzar and unexplained circumstances. in many ways i'm still curious; but i think whatever we saw was observing and simply incapable of interaction. it seemed to be a being; or group of beings, made of energy; electricity or chemical reaction; far outside the realm of our perceived understanding of life; and possibly unintentionally dangerous simply by chemical nature. i have recounted this event on a few events with my still good friend. it's always stuck with him, and is simply something he's uncofortable talking about; because things you can't explain are frightening, and they make you sound like a crazy person. for the same reasons i am also moderately shy about the whole incident. more importantly though i am curious if there are other descriptions of this nature? it doesn't match the conventional ufo profiles, and i have seen nothing like it on the internet; but i know what i saw beyond the shadow of a doubt; and i will know exactly where i've seen it before if i ever see something like it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering

around and saw about 10-20 chinese lantern-style objects in the sky, moving east to west.  i have seen one similar object before, on august 26, 2013, over eastern tallahassee, and reported it here.  this time, 50 to 60 of these streamed by over a period of about 8-10 minutes, sometimes in bunches, sometimes singly.  i recorded about three minutes of video on my phone camera.  unfortunately i missed recording a small propeller plane flying directly parallel to these lights, heading towards the tallahassee airport, i'd guess.  the plane was basically at the same speed and altitude as these lights, and would show that these lights were moving faster than the wind.  also, the wind was flowing south or southwest at a slow speed at the time, not west, so the evidence points to these not being actual chinese lanterns.  they don't seem to be drones since they made zero noise, and it would be probably illegal and not easy to fly dozens of drones from horizon to horizon.\r\n\r\nphone was

evening i very definitively saw an unknown craft...Twice. i will try and record this in as much detail as possible. at approximately 6:38pm,north st. augustine,fl, a very large, dark, cylindrical/cigar shaped craft \"moved\" almost directly overhead. it was about twice the size/diameter of the moon, and rotating/spinning...So very large. if i had to guess, i would say it was several times the size of a 747, about 10 thousand feet up. the first sighting of it was for about 15-20 seconds, and it moved in a straight trajectory, but was rotating as it moved. for about every 10-15 paces it moved, it rotated 180 degrees. so as it first came into sight, it was facing forward, and by the time it was overhead\r\nit had completely turned around. it was thinner than a cigar shape...More like a \"slim jim\" or dark, skinny pencil to relate it to something. i saw it in the early night sky, and it appeared darker than the sky, but the edges were lit by the moon. the tips of it seemed slightly more lit than the sides. it had no lights, was silent, and had a strange blurryness to it, almost like it was a bit out of focus in comparison to the sharp stars around it. i had the impression that it was trying to blend in with the sky, but because of the twilight/moonlight it was clearly visible. there was definitely a strangeness to it immediately, not only the way it looked, but the way it moved. as i said before it lasted about 15-20 seconds. the feeling i had as it passed overhead was not only shocking, but a bit spooky/ominous. if i had to relate it to something it would be like seeing a shark fin rise out of the water. however, it did not \"feel\" terrestrial. it had a \"way\" about it that just felt strange. the second sighting was at approximately 7:08pm. either the same craft was flying the exact same route overhead, or a different craft flew overhead on the same path/trajectory. the sightings were identical in every way, except the second time it was moving about twice the speed, lasting only about 7-10 seconds. i am still a bit in awe, and i understand speculating about its origin is only my opinion. however, i am leaving this sighting with the feeling that for the first time i am truly convinced there is something we don't understand in our skies. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,
