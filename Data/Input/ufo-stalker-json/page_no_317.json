kind of bubble around my head. the sounds were almost like trying to tune into a frequency but not quite on the right one. my head was off to the right and i was laying on my back still with my eyes closed but very much awake. suddenly my body was forced straight (still on my back) and my eyes forced open. i felt very much awake as though it was mid day. my body was retrained like something was holding it but it wasn't uncomfortable and the noise of the clicking a muttering increased not in volume but in intensity and the same time the crunching gravel noise outside the window was moving left to right as though something was pacing or swaying left to right. \r\n\r\nsuddenly the noise stopped and the hold on me was released and instantly some vomit/mucus entered my mouth. \r\n\r\ni

was afraid. i kept going back and forth to the window to look at them, the lights never made a sound or detectable movement. i decided to call one of my co-workers to tell him to go outside and look at it, but by the time i got him on the phone, the lights disappeared behind a cloud.\r\ni have one of those old phones that do not take very good pictures. i thought about calling the tv station, but

outside temperature at the time about 4f. from the very large windows of our home (ceiling to almost floor level), we are aware of the looks, shapes, blinking lights, movements and speeds of airplanes, helicopters, occasional hot-air balloons and blimps; we're also familiar with the positions and brightness of the stars and planets and have observed meteor showers. this was obviously different.\r\n\r\nmy adult daughter was saying goodnight when a light caught her eye in the sky and asked me what it was. when i saw it, it was a set of blinking lights of different colors, mostly white and bright, somewhat larger than the size of venus or mars we always see. my first impression was of an advertising blimp stationary in the sky with lights changing from red to blue to white to green in a rotary motion. no shape of the object was visible, just the ights. it didn't move. it was suspended in the air at a high distance from us. these windows of my house face south; in relation to our view, this light was in a southeast position.\r\n\r\n as we were watching for almost a minute intrigued by what it was, another similar \"set of lights\" came flying rapidly in a straight path from the west and then stopped very close to the first one (from our view, on a straight line as if on top, at a somewhat short distance). after about just two seconds hovering together, the first one (i'll call #1) rapidly flew in a straight line to the left (towards the east) and stopped over the tree-line (facing se of our view) again to hover; the second one (#2) just staid in the same position. my daughter and i just stuck to the windows to follow what was going on.\r\n\r\ni thought about going out on the deck to see better, but at 4f and wind-chill making it feel as -11f, we decided to remain inside. my daughter took out her camera, but it was too dark for the camera to capture anything.\r\n\r\nabout a minute later, all of the sudden a third one also came from the west. at first, #3 came slowly and low, almost disappearing from our view behind a hill in the golf-course behind our house, and then at a higher speed, it flew vertically in an upward direction and then east, and as it was about to join #2, #3 stopped and #2 took off towards the ne while #3 and #1 were still at the same spot stationary, all the time flashing their colorful lights. \r\n\r\n#2 momentarily disappeared from our view behind the house, but soon enough returned (i think was #2) with two more from the north, and stopped at a triangular formation to our left (east) for a few minutes. \r\n\r\n(could have been) #2 again disappeared behind the house in a northerly direction, while #4 and #5 slowly moved closer together, still to our east and stayed there hovering in silence. #1 and #3 had not moved from their last position.\r\n\r\nat certain point, we way a regular commercial airplane flying west to east; it was easy to compare the brightness of its lights (how dim!) and the speed of the craft (how slow).\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes, #1 which had been suspended over the tree line to our southeast view, suddenly moved vertically down the tree-line, where we lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nall of the sudden, #3 took-off towards west, first at a slow speed and then speeding up. when it was at our view, just about the club-house, it went down as if it would land on the parking-lot and then again sped away towards the west where we lost sight of it. {please keep in mind that i'm describing this from the perspective of our view; these lights were all pretty far away. i did not mean to imply that #3 would have been landing on the club's parking lot; it was obviously miles away}.\r\n\r\nas we followed in awe #3, we didn't see what happened to #4 and #5; when we looked back, by then these were already gone. it was just about 9:45 p.M.\r\n\r\nat that point, the bright moon (now waning) was beginning to show-up from behind the house, from an ne direction. the moon light was shining on the snow on the ground bellow, but it never interfered with the view of the event; the sky was sufficiently dark from our point of view.\r\n\r\nwe waited until 10:00 p.M., but there was no further activity. after the moon light began to hit the sky above us, we could see developing expanding-line-clouds in the direct path where #1 and #3 had moved.\r\n\r\nthrough the whole event, i only felt curiosity while i tried analyzing what else it could be. i couldn't identify any object that can do this; certainly meteors don't travel in straight lines in vertical or horizontal directions, nor i've ever seen stars, planets or even orbital satellites do that. yes; i've seen \"stars\" move in a straight path without stopping and my companions each time have said these are orbital satellites; these were way too different.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":81008,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.7933552,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12162016-0003","longitude":-83.2328512,"occurred":1481835600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1481894978000,"summary":"Upto 5 different distant/rotating-color lights moving/hovering/meeting and separating in various directions/speed. approx. 45 minutes;

you get to the i69 overpass in noblesville, indiana. it was december 15th 2016  about 5pm eastern time. the sun was setting but it was still very bright outside. i noticed the object because it was very bright. at first i thought it was maybe a space station but it was much larger than usual. it looked like a very bright star with blazing white light but it seemed closer than a star. it looked like it was about at the level planes normally fly at the highest altitude. it began to pulsate and that's when i realized it was a bit odd. it pulsated brightly for about a minute, got slightly brighter and then it began to fade while still pulsating until it was completely gone. i viewed this for several minutes as it was happening. i was very distracted, i was amazed at what i saw. i have never seen anything like it in my life. it seemed like it was just stationary but i was moving in my vehicle so it was hard to tell. if it was moving it was not going at a speed i could determine. i never lost sight of the object while this was occurring until it desolved. i nearly ran off the road at one point because i was drawn to the light. i didn't want to take my eyes off of it. i kept watching the sky in the same direction for several minutes after it disappeared to try to see if i could see it again. i didn't see anything again until a plane at about the same altitude came from the south heading north towards the location in the sky i saw the light about 5 minutes later. i did observe some other planes flying at different altitudes at about the same time as that plane but they were in different areas of the sky heading in different directions. the indianapolis international airport is located on the west side of the city so i am very familiar with what planes look like
