storm.  i was with my cousin who is a couple of years younger than \r\ni.  \r\ni was under tree near the lake and i kept seeing something shiny across the lake.  \r\nif i tried very hard i could cast across the pond. i was aware of the lightning and thunder.\r\nit was a rough storm with plenty of lightening.  i noticed that the shiney spots were large and an equal distance apart. i could see the beings better when the lightening made every thing \r\nbright.  i kept looking for a while until i realized what they were. there were more than i saw \r\ni am sure because they were all walking a path across from me.  it is rather bushy on that \r\nside except for a trail that comes over the hill.  we had parked about half mile from the\r\nlake because of a fence.  it was easier to walk than go around.  \r\n after i noticed they were real i called out to my cousin who had walked off a little ways.  \r\nthey kept looking at me than at him.  thier eyes still shining.  thier eyes were big and round \r\nand had slight oriental slant to them.  they were short and skinny, long arms, big heads,\r\nbut not long heads but large.  \r\ni called to my cousin and told him what i was looking at.  he came running and we picked up \r\nwhat we could and ran up to the truck.  when we got to the truck we looked back and \r\ncould see more of them but we were to scared to look for long.  we rushed off and decided not to tell anyone.  now that i am older i worry about my grandkids.  this is a private lake and is used by few people.\r\n i have no pics.  we did not carry cell phones at the time.

sky pretending to be a planet. i knew it was not, as it is way too close for one, and i looked at the charts and it isn't supposed to be there. i've been watching it for weeks, wondering what it is. there is a secret military place here that has increased activity in the last year. i live in a very rural area of new mexico surrounded by reservation land, and this secret military place. on december 5th, i went out with my dog, and as usual, looked up at it, but this time, it was not as bright and was dancing or hovering in the sky. it was doing what i call, a jig, back and forth, up and down, ever so slightly, maybe by my sight in half inch movements, almost like it was trying to stay in one place but didn't have full control. i was in awe and freaked out a bit as i knew it wasn't normal to begin with. it seemed to have three separate lights attached to it like a triangle but in a circle. i tried to record the event, but after 3min38sec my video suddenly shut off and could not get it back on. i watched as this light danced around for approx. 45 minutes, then it disappeared and 6 military helicopters suddenly appeared over the hill around where the light was and appeared to be circling. i went inside out of fear. we have a lot of military activity lately and they have seen me take photos of them. i'm not sure what i saw, but the light is now back to looking like a planet and rotating with the earth, bright in the evening sky. you can see it before dark even it's so bright. i don't know what to think to be honest. i'm attempting to upload the video to youtube now. i've also taken photos over the weeks of this light. i really don't know what i saw, but i saw something and i'm not crazy.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

towards me from just under orion's belt.I thought they were military as i heard the roaring of what sounded like an old 1960's jet engine at full throttle.As the \"craft\" got closer,i saw that there were two smaller escorts and one giant craft/object in the middle that was the size of a football stadium!As they got closer,they changed direction by a few degrees to head north east and i realized they were in some kind of force field that obstructed the clear view of the center giant craft.The escort on my side was in the alleged tr-3 triangular shape with one red light up front and two red lights in the rear at the base of the triangle. the escorts each had a forward facing red light and the giant craft had a row of three large red lights that all came through the force field. stars were obscured all around the force field for hundreds of yards the craft were in perfect formation,side by side with the giant craft in the middle.The force field must have absorbed the \"jet-noise\" because it went away completely when the formation passed over me and then it resumed once the formation was 2 miles past me.The entire rear section of the giant craft was lighted by a unusual yellowish color.There were no faa mandated white strobe lights.The giant craft seemed to be better cloaked than the two escorts.The jet noise seemed to come from the escorts only.\r\n as the formation approached,i was hit with a wave of nausea,felt anxiety and fear.One of my k-9's ran off back to the house and the other cowered behind me. both have been agitated ever since and hesitant to go out at night.I have felt ill and uneasy ever since as well. i later heard that there were an unusual number of ambulance calls in the area for anxiety or heart attacks the following day. i looked online and saw that another maine couple in windsor saw the giant craft that night and fell ill themselves.I am a trained observer and out every night with my dogs. i have seen many other \"craft\" but never so close as to be able to determine that they were not made on earth (that we know of). i am concerned about the health effects of whatever force field overflew us at such a low altitude to make us feel instantly sick.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional
