march, 2012.  the reason it has taken me so long to report it was because the thought never occurred to me until now, but i can still clearly picture the event as if it happened yesterday.\r\n\r\nat the time, i was living in a rural area near the town i specified in the report.  we decided to go into town and buy dinner from a restaurant rather than cook something at home.  i was with one other person, who was driving the vehicle, as we went into town as we so often did.  it was late evening and the sun was going down.  our order at the restaurant took an abnormally long time to prepare, so by the time we were heading back home it was dark out and we could see the stars above us.\r\n\r\nwe were driving back home to the rural area where we lived when the event took place.  we were driving on the highway specified in the report, and up until the event our view of the sky to the southwest was obstructed by tall trees.  then as we took a turn and the area to our left opened up, we could see what looked at first to be like a very tall radio or cell tower.\r\n\r\nwe both remarked to each other that we didn't remember there being a tower out there, and that's just the thing, there wasn't and still is not a tower out there.  upon realizing this, we both began to observe the object(s) more closely.\r\n\r\nthe main thing that drew our attention was a large, unwavering and immobile orange light that, from our perspective, looked to be about the size of a circular tablet of aspirin.  behind it were three smaller white lights which seemed to be hovering in formation.  the fact that the lights weren't moving or flashing indicated to us that we weren't simply seeing airplanes in the sky, and that was why we thought it was just a very tall aerial tower at first.\r\n\r\nwe observed the lights for at least five minutes as we drove on the highway, but because someone was rudely tailgating us we were not able to pull off to the shoulder and take pictures or a video.  this is the one part that i can't exactly remember; whether or not we were able to see the stars in-between the formation of lights, so i'm not sure if they were four separate objects, or if they were lights on one single craft.\r\n\r\nif it was one craft, it would have to have been absolutely massive.  the formation of the four lights made the shape of an almost triangular rhombus.  we both knew that we were seeing something strange, and although i can't speak for the other witness, i felt a sense of dread and anxiety, as if i wasn't supposed to be looking.  when we got home we talked about the odd experience for a short while before going to bed, and essentially forgot about the experience.\r\n\r\ni spoke with the other witness before making this report to verify what we had seen, and it seemed like he hadn't really thought about the experience again until i reminded him of it just tonight.  i've thought about it a few times over the years but never felt compelled to report the sighting until now.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the lights when we turned off of the highway on our way back home.  due to the amount of trees in the area it would have been impossible to observe the lights from where we lived.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":90300,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.243611,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02192018-0003","longitude":-91.73522349999999,"occurred":1330473600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1519008753000,"summary":"Saw

militar agustin armario a las 2:15 am se nos reflejo en el radar 5 objetos sobre las montañas que bordean el pueblo de borburata, uno de ellos era gigantesco del tamaño de dos boeing 747 y lo acompañaban otros cuatro objetos de menor tamaño, sin haber recorrido alguna otra trayectoria, no venian de ningun sitio, aparecieron ahi,nos intentamos comunicar por radio pero no daban respuesta alguna, esto encendió las alarmas y rapidamente pedimos asistencia aérea, pensabamos que era una filtración militar aérea extranjera por el tamaño de uno de los objetos,en la base habian 3 helicoperos mi 17 panare, así que partimos en ellos por orden del almirante, al llegar a la coordenada 10.409447, -67.949851 nos encontramos con algo que jamas pense que iba a ver en mi vida, era un objeto con forma y tamaño de un submarino de guerra plateado brillante como el mercurio, que lo bordeaba una luz blanca azul, tenia unas luces amarillas en formas de lineas a mitad de la nave que no se podia apreciar si eran una especie de ventanas, junto a esta nave lo acompañaban 3 naves en forma de platillos del mismo color o material que emitian una luz que los bordeaba de color verde y habia una esfera de luz roja junto con ellos que cambiaba de forma y de color, era redonda y cambiaba a romboide y laz luces cambiaban destellando colores rojo verde y azul y blanco, parecia una especie de plasma, luego comenzaron a descender cuando se estaban acercando 2 sukoi a nuestras coordenadas 10.409447, -67.949851 estaban aterrizando y cuando pensamos que habian aterrizado simplemente se apagaron, desaparecieron. mantuvimos el perimetro rodeado mientras sobrevolavamos los helicopteros y luego nos devolvimos una parte del equipo mientras la otra se quedo sobrevolando estabamos preparando al equipo de infiltracion terrestre y reconocimiento para descender a la zona, a las 3:30 am desplegamos el operativo y descendimos a 1 km del area del avistamiento, comenzamos la operación bordeando la zona hasta llegar a un área perimetral de 300 mts cuando comenzamos a desacelerar el paso, ya a 100mts del área del avistamiento empezamos a ver luces  verdes y azules en la zona, de los helicopteros no se podian apreciar bien porque era una zona cubierta por arboles grandes, las luces las vimos en la tierra, nos fuimos acercando poco a poco hasta que las luces se fueron desbaneciendo y se apagaron, , teniamos equipo infrarojo y de vision nocturna y vimos lo que creimos que eran unas personas por la forma que tenian así que le dimos la orden de alto, en el momento que gritamos la orden estos caminaron rapido y descendieron o bajaron por algun camino pensabamos, cuando llegamos ya al aréa nos pudimos conseguir con especie de cueva o crater en el suelo las linternas no alcanzaban a ver el fondo , ya que el hueco en vez de ser recto hacia abajo era en declive, así que como todos no teniamos equipo para descender bajamos solo 20 oficiales fuertemente armados , caminamos 25 minutos en linea recta sin ningun desvio hasta que empezamos a ver luz, era luz blanca ya se estaba iluminando la cueva caminamos 5 minutos mas hasta que la luz se intensifico y nos topamos con una especie de pared que parecian ondas como el agua pero de color blanco y emitian una fuerte luz como si se tratara de electricidad, no sabiamos que hacer no paso ni 1 minuto cuando comenzó a temblar y decidimos salir corriendo, temblo 3 veces mientras nos devolviamos, pedazos de tierra nos caian en los cascos, pensabamos que nos ibamos a quedar enterrados porque desde el primer momento en que temblo comenzo a caernos tierra encima, justo cuando salimos no pasaron unos segundos cuando se desplomó la cueva, bordeamos toda la zona mientras seguian llegando soldados hasta que se hizo de dia pero no encontramos mas nada en la zona, todo estaba en esa cueva subterranea, los cables de 3 torres electricas cercanas habian explotado, estaban en el suelo, ninguno de nosotros podia creer lo que habia visto, no era la primera vez que se habian visto avistamientos en el radar, esa zona ya la teniamos estudiada por multimes avistamientos en los ultimos 5 años, pero aparecian y desaparecian del radar en cuestion de 1 segundo siempre eran objetos pequeños, saliamos a misiones de reconocimiento pero nunca veíamos nada, pensabamos que el radar tenia fallas o se estaba averiando así que llamabamos a los tecnicos y siempre decian que estaba en pleno funcionamiento, el almirante por ordenes superiores nos ordeno no revelar los hechos acontecidos ya que era un secreto de estado pero ya me di de baja y estoy fuera del país, no pienso volver hasta que cambie el gobierno y decidí no dejar este hecho atrás y revelarlo al público.","distance":"21-100

was carrying me on its shoulder to my backyard, i saw 6 red-orange glowing objects in the sky and they were just hovering there making no noise, and the 6 glowing objects were in a v shape formation, but with no lead tip part of the v shape formation. i did some research online that day, and no ufo sightings were reported, and also no military activities on that day it happened. so anyways, a platform dropped and once thing stepped onto the platform, i blacked out, and everything turned white. from what i remember, i woke up with humanoid like figures looking down at me, and once i had woken up, i couldn't move anything but my eyes. then i blacked out again, and everything turned white again. i remember one more thing and that thing was waking up (once i waked up, i couldn't move any part of my body except my eyes) at what looked like some type of alien science fair with professional looking scientists. i don't think that they've noticed me whilst i was looking around. these

convulsions from the heart and brain. this is a chemical reaction and people have no idea they are doing it, even when you try to tell them - in order to get assistance. when you don't have enough convulsions and convulse weakly, people don't believe anything you say and don't want to help (as their chemical convulsions respond to your own convulsions like a scent, wireless message) their behaviors become predatory, some will chase you, remove your property. due to having a weakened field, i can't be around any living thing with a field, which is impossible where i live.If someone could suggest a particle physicist and bioengineer who could make a suit resistant to accelerated particle fields with convulsive neurocircuits and a magnetic field inside it, it would be much appreciated.If anyone knows of someone who could create a magnetic field to put over a living space, it would be much appreciated also. i also require a geneticist to (along with a physicist) to repair the damage done to my body and make me convulsive again. my condition can be proven with a heart and brain monitor, a device that senses and monitors particles in the body and the environment including convulsions (can compare convulsions of another person and myself). if you were to set the equipment up with me and another person, you would instantly see that my particles are being extracted by their field.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":90292,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"NZ-02182018-0007","longitude":null,"occurred":1489519800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1518973496000,"summary":"Propulsion system seemed to also be an accelerator with coloured orbs that shot out of the ship. ship hovered, didn't land","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"Pacific/Auckland","timeZoneName":"Pacific/Auckland","tweeted":1519008051168,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":340,"locationName":"NZ","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:646"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Miami","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ok...For the last two weeks, miami is being inundated w/ufo's and many nights see coast guard choppers and helicopters with no lights buzzing the ufo's, boats in biscayne bay w/no lights and i've heard military jets multiple times.  i live on 33rd floor of a miami high rise and look straight north over biscayne bay with unobstructed views.  starting two weeks or so ago we started seeing whitish orbs basically popping up in the sky out of nowhere.  for the past few days, they are popping up further north and sometimes northeast over ocean and moving very slowly to about 150th to 41st north and the middle of biscayne bay.  they then hover for 5 to 30 minutes at an altitude of approximately 2-4 thousand feet moving occasionally up, or in other directions when commercial aircraft are coming their direction then going stationary again.  when they move out of view they start moving from hovering position to the west towards the city or south over my building and climbing sometimes very high then out of view.  i have a ton of video and still shots showing this and from directly underneath.  from underneath, they show different structural make up.  maybe 3 or 4 different types disc, tube, boomerang, and some other shape i cannot discern.  never, never do any make a sound...Completely silent.  they only come out at dusk and continue throughout the night.  these are not lanterns as they hover then move in different directions other than with the wind and at times zigzag out of commercial traffic's way.  not drones either.  \r\n\r\nwhatever is going on is the real deal and needs to be investigated immediately!!  50-70 per night and only at night.  i'll send some video and stills but have much more if you need to see.","distance":"501 Feet -

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The following describes an initial light event witnessed on february 18, 2017, reported to mufon by phone, and was investigated by mufon’s special assignment team (sat). due to the fact that this location, board camp crystal mine, near mena, arkansas, has been the site of ongoing phenomenon and investigation since the february 18, 2017 mufon investigation, this event was not publicly reported online until now.  the reporting parties are the property owners and/or witnesses of the numerous ongoing events at this active location and are reporting for the benefit of public education and scientific research.  in recognition of the one year anniversary of this event, which was featured in the october 2017 issue of the mufon journal, as well as featured on “expedition unknown: hunt for extraterrestrials” episode 4 on travel channel, the witnesses (and property owners of the location) are officially publicly reporting this sighting as follows:  on the night of february 18, 2017, at the property known as board camp crystal mine, near mena, arkansas, the 3 eye-witnesses (2 of them being the property owners) were standing on a hill gazing out over the crystal mine property.  about 10 pm, about 900 feet south of where the witnesses were standing, the witnesses saw a glow of white light appear at the treetops of the horizon silhouetting the treetops from behind.  three large white vertical beams of light appeared out of the glow, seeming to be 30 feet wide and seeming to shoot up to about 300 feet high above the ground. the beams were described as being flat across the top, and appeared for a duration of about 10 seconds, then disappeared, and the glow receded back into darkness. there appeared to be no lights at ground level and no sound of a vehicle or animals. the witnesses were astonished by the sighting, thinking it was man-made, but not understanding how it could be, as it would be difficult for a vehicle hauling 3 large spotlights to enter the fenced rural 40-acre property without being noticed.  although a small airport is located about 8 miles west of the location, directly south of the event site, there is nothing but undeveloped land, no roads, etc. the next morning, thinking they might find evidence of a human visit such as footprints or tire tracks, the 3 witnesses visited the crystal mine pit where the sighting occurred. to the witnesses’ surprise, there was no evidence of a human visitation, but all metal objects such as fence posts and tools were noticed to be affected, characterized by movement of the objects from their previous positions. mufon was contacted by a third party and the witnesses were phoned by arkansas state investigator race hobbs. because of the credibility of the witnesses and the strong physical evidence left behind after the light event occurred, mufon sent the sat to investigate, led by chase kloetzke. race hobbs accompanied the sat. during the sat’s examination of the metal objects with various devices recording readings for radiation and electromagnetism (em), it was confirmed that the metal objects at the event site were not only magnetized but also polarized, and em and radiation levels were increased. soil and rock samples were obtained and all information was forwarded to various labs for professional analysis. mufon has since issued a full investigative report.
