taking some legal documents over to bakersfield to have a county judge sign.  i was traveling on route 58 west of mojave towards bakersfield and east of tehachopi in my 1957 chevrolet state car.  a state highway maintenance crew was repairing the westbound lanes.  traffic was stopped in these two lanes for up to 15 minutes.  i pulled right, off of the highway to a dirt and gravel turnout and backed up to a low level brush and rock area with no dirt roads behind me.\r\n\r\ni sat in the car for a few minutes and decided to take a look at the documents i was taking to bakersfield for the judge.  before i got the documents out, i noticed something in my rear views mirror and turned to see what it was.\r\n\r\ni was amazed to see a vehicle directly behind my car with two individuals wearing gray-white suits.  mine was the only car on the turnout.  no car could have possibly gone around the front or the back without me seeing or hearing it.  there was no sound at all.\r\n\r\ni continued to look directly at the car and individuals directly through the back window.  the car was maroon in color with a dark top; the grill looked similar to an older buick.  the license plate was light in color with no discernible markings.\r\n\r\nthe two individuals in the car as stated wore jump type suits with no buttons.  they were slender with no visible hat or hair and their bodies appeared to be smaller than the average sized man.  their eyes were very dark and semi oval; little larger than a normal human. they stared at me and never blinked.  they both had two small holes for their nose, very small mouths, no lips and i couldn't see any ears.  nor could i see their arms due to their car hood hiding over half of their bodies.\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of staring at each other, i noticed light traffic starting to slowly move on the highway again to the west.  so i drove from my parking area out to the paved highway going towards bakersfield again.\r\n\r\nthe highways west bound lanes were now open for the public.  i was driving about normal speed in the right hand lane, just west of where the \r\nstate construction was.  looking to my left i saw a maroon car driving at my speed, parallel to me with the same individuals i had seen at the turnout.  the driver looked continuously to the front.  i immediately noticed that he had no nose and he was bald.  the passenger in the car was again staring directly at me.  we drove parallel to each other for about 15 seconds.\r\n\r\ni didn't know what to do, so i waved my hand at them as if to say goodbye.  they immediately sped down the highway and disappeared around a moderate curve to the right.  i sped up to try and see the maroon car again but it had disappeared.  there were rather steep rock cliffs on the right side and no place to turn off the highway.\r\n\r\nthe next day driving from bakersfield to bishop, i stopped at the same turnout of my first encounter and went to the same spot.  i saw my tire tracks from the previous day but saw no other tracks behind mine.  wow!!\r\n\r\nas you might deduce i've never breathed a word of these happenings for decades to anyone for fear of being ridiculed.  i've mulled over this experience many times over the years.\r\n\r\nthis is my true story of a very strange, mysterious and profound event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

hamilton, ontario along the queen elizabeth way highway, moving west. just as i as i entered mississauga at about 7 pm, i noticed a grouping of lights up and to my front-right, about 75 degrees above the horizon. i noticed immediately that it was not moving, and in fact twice in the next few minutes a plane flew past much lower. the grouping of bright white lights were arranged in somewhat of a triangle, although it seemed some of the lights extended beyond the corners of a triangle. the lights did seem to be arranged in straight lines, but not clearly on a horizontal or vertical plane. \r\nthe shape created by the lights was a bit difficult to make out as they were quite high in the sky.\r\n\r\nas i drove along, after a few minutes i though maybe these were lights on top of some structure or tower, but they were not blinking, and as i drove the grouping never moved position in the sky, as they would have done if i were driving past a structure. after about 5 -7 minutes it became apparent that\r\nthis was not a structure at all. i drove for 30 minutes with this grouping still to the front & right of me, at the same elevation, and seemed to be the same size, and i drove a distance of about 35 km. this was not a constellation; the lights were too large and tightly grouped, and of uniform size. besides, i have driven this route hundreds of times in my life and have never seen this grouping of lights. \r\n\r\nthe lights continued to hang in the sky all the way to hamilton, as i drove along hwy 403 which continues west to hamilton from burlington, where the qew turns south to niagara falls. the lights faded out a couple of times for no more than 1 minute, but came back, and i believe this was due to cloud cover. \r\n\r\ni lost sight of the grouping as the 403 turns south into downtown hamilton, because i was no longer facing toward it.\r\n\r\ni have attached a sketch of the grouping of lights. the number of lights & arrangement is approximate, since they were so high up/far away it was difficult to be completely discernible.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":80922,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-12112016-0006","longitude":null,"occurred":1481328000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1481469341000,"summary":"Grouping

immediately opened the window to observe the object. it appeared just above mindbender ridge at about 22 degrees above the horizon off to my right moving slowly towards me from the west. the object was a bright pale orange color and was flickering-shimmering. as the object moved towards me for about a minute and a half it stayed at the same altitude which i am guessing was about 3000-5000 above me. when the object was directly above me i ran outside so i could continue to observe. moving very slowly the object seemed to be almost hovering and as i watched it i thought i could see it wobbling or wavering a little. just after i started observing outside the object started ascending, within 20 seconds it had become a small point of light still moving east but at an apparently greater speed moving  about like a distant airliner would appear.  after the object was out of sight, about 4 or 5 minutes after i first sighted it i went back inside and as i walked back into my bedroom i noticed another bright orange light being reflected off the east facing window. i quickly looked around and saw that it was another identical object in my south facing again. this second object followed the same path in the same manner. this time when the object drifted  overhead out of my view from the window i ran outside again but the object was gone. i now wish i had climbed out the window so not to have lost sight of the second object. time was 11:30 after second sighting. both objects were orb or disc shaped but i could not see any other features because of the brightness and distance of the objects, also they were silent and there were no other aircraft visible during or directly after this sighting. my feelings about this went as follows,i knew within a couple of seconds that i was looking at a ufo of some sort and was happy and excited to see it. i wanted to do my best to observe and describe it objectively thus leading me to open the window to view it with no distortion from the glass and then to run outside and stand in the snow in my underwear and bare feet. i was all that much more excited to see the second object. i was hoping to witness some utterly convincing burst of speed or abrupt direction change but what i saw totally convinced me of its unidentified nature. living in an area with a history of sightings i felt lucky to see this and possibly give more credence to what others have reported.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

military helicopter in the distance, so i moved to get a clear view of the sky because i wanted to see it.  it sounded extremely close and i could feel the power, vibrations, etc.  so finally it comes into view and it was hard to make out.  there was a red orb in the front, with the chopper in the back.  at first i though it may be top secret military craft with cloaking or reflection or something of the sort.  it was hard to make out in the night sky it being a black helicopter and all, but when i focused in on it i could make out a red/orangish orb shape which looked like it was glowing, producing and aura, and the helicopter behind it maybe. between 300-500 ft.  it was hard to make out and get a grasp with surroundings because it all happened so fast.  they were both flying in a straight path at what appeared to be high speeds.  i had to run around the corner to keep eye sight until it went over the tree line out of sight.  i had no means of following it and wouldn't have been able to with the speed and direction it was going , having to follow traffic laws and everything.  right after my father walked out the door because he heard the chopper from inside the house and came to check it out and also had to grab something out of the car.  when he was trying to lock it, he hit the lock button at least 3x and the car was still unlocked, so i'm unsure if it messed with the electrical system or whatever category you would place this in.  take note that he's not the best with newer technology though.  so i came on here to check if anybody else had reported it.  also take note there is military bases in the area.  fort dix and maguire afb.  i didn't see any reports so i figured if i would.  this is not the first time i've seen activity of this sort in my 20+ years in this area.  one was 10+ years ago, and one was over this past summer.  i made no reports of them or checked for any.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

4pm. i pulled up home from work and before getting out of the car i noticed the sky was full of chemtrails and i witnessed 3 planes at one time releasing in all directions. the atmosphere just felt creepy. i got out of my car after taking footage of one of the planes and i noticed flying was this glowing white orb or craft that was flying in and out of the trails. the beginning of the video and the end has the best focused shot but my camera just wouldn't zoom anymore. im hoping with image software you possess you can clear up and focus what we are looking at in this video. after i lost it in the trails i waited expecting to see it come out the other side and it never appeared again. i mean planes don't do that, right? anyway, let me know if you have any questions and i do hope you can at least clear up the shot well enough for a little more clarity. if you would like the short video i took of the chemtrails right before the sighting, let me know and ill send it. the second video im

noticed the blue orb and was changing positions on each frame. i after viewing the first pictures i took i went back out to the same spot and still not being able to see anything with the naked eye, i aimed my camera at the sun again and took a few more shots, went in the house and noticed the blue orb once again in the photos in different areas near the circle of the sun. i went out one more time again going back to the same area and aimed my camera at the sun again and went back in the house. after viewing the photos in order taken (approx 17 to 19 photos) i was amazed seeing this orb object seeming to be going in and out of the ring that was made around the sun. i hope this is to some value to you because i do believe we are not the only ones in the

of 2012 and asked me to go out to my pasture and tell her what i saw. i walked out my back door and could see nothing out of the ordinary. so i proceeded toward my barn and walked around some trees to a clearing and in the sky about 45 degrees above the eastern horizon was a large bright white light, i remembered screaming but i don't remember what was said between my friend and i. it was round and made no noise and no apparent craft was visible. after a few seconds the light seemed to flicker away and as quick as it disappeared two more lights appeared directly below where the first light had been. again i screamed but this time i noticed that the horses were running up and down the fence line and neighing all the while and i had an overwhelming erie feeling along with the sense that something was creeping around behind me. again after a few seconds the light on the left flickers away then the light on the right followed. this time three lights appeared directly below the previous lights and one by one from left to right they each flickered away. the whole experience for me lasted 3 minutes but as for my friend, she had been observing the lights for several minutes before calling me and the color of the lights that she could see were different than the lights that i could see. i regret that i did not take pictures or a video but in my defense i was paralyzed and in shock at that moment and not to mention that i was still on the phone with my friend. as soon as it was over i left to pick up my daughter just down the road, when i returned home i could hear several helicopters in the distance. my first assumption as to what this might be was the moon but it didn't look like it was
