i was with the same friend that seen something incredible just a week earlier,  and two other buddies, just a few kilometers or so from my first green bay rd incident, on crescent beach (still on the waters of green bay, just not on the green bay road). it was late evening probably between 10pm - midnight, and when we first arrived at the beach we noticed way down the beach what looked to be car lights flashing in an sos pattern (you can drive your vehicle right on the 2klm long beach). the four of us drove down the beach, to find a flipped vw jetta on its roof, and a very upset girl with a guy who had apparently been driving too fast and flipped the car in a sand rutt. we made sure they were ok, and gave them the number for a tow truck. we then left.\r\n\r\n\r\n   when we got to the beginning of the beach, one friend mentioned the guy saying he was going to hide his beer up in the rocks along the beach, in case the police come, and suggested driving in behind the beach on the road, till we were by the flipped car, and then hiding in the beach grass and rocks till they left, and taking their beer they left.  so we did. the tow truck was already there with its lights flashing and we could hear them talking.  the other two buddies were brothers and paired up and hid quietly together, and me and my buddy did the same.  maybe a minute or two of hiding in the beach grass,he whacked me in the arm, then pointed up in the sky over the ocean. coming from the south, heading directly towards the tow truck and us, i noticed a very long line of smoke or chemtrail that was quite visible even in the night sky. i found it incredible that the line of smoke stretched the entire way to the south horizon over the ocean. i then noticed the smoke line was slowly moving towards us, and when it got close enough i could clearly see a huge rounded front which had a slight but obvious reddish glow to it. the smoke itself was not colored, just the object that was creating the smoke. it then flew slowly directly over us, making no sound at all, and continued north until it passed the north horizon. we could then see the smoke or chemtrail very clearly stretching from the south horizon to the north horizon, which was quite strange. \r\n\r\n\r\n  we never did find the beer, but afterwards when we met up with the brothers we asked if they seen the same thing, they said they did not, but they made a good point after we described it to them. they said because we were able to see such a long trail of smoke, from horizon to horizon, it must mean that the object was flying very low. that would mean the complete silence of such a huge object would seem even stranger, if it was as low as it seemed.   i myself wondered if the flashing headlights of the car, or flashing yellow light on top of the tow truck somehow got the objects attention, seeing how it flew directly over us all. either way it was a very strange unexplainable event. not as incredible as the incident a week before on green bay road, but considering that event was so close and also so recent, it makes me wonder if the two different incidents are related in any way.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

first incident happened between midnight and 1:00am on july 15 or 16th, 2010. (the late evening of july 14th or 15th) on green bay rd. lunenburg county ns. \r\n\r\n\r\n    i had recently moved back home to the bridgewater area from halifax, and me and my friend had decided to grab coffee and head down to the beach and catch up on conversation. when we arrived at green bay we drove to the last turning point on the road, and parked in the parking area, my car facing roughly east towards the beach and bay. when we were driving along the road we were talking about space, the stars, other life, the universe, etc. and when we parked we were both looking up and out our rolled down windows at the stars.  there was a very brief flash in the sky towards the south, i only really seen it in my peripheral vision and it was fast. he had a more direct view and said ‘did you see that flash’ which i replied, ‘sort of’,  and really didn't think much about it as in my mind it could have logically been many different things.\r\n\r\n\r\n   we then stood outside the car and continued our conversation. he had his back against the drivers door, and i was facing him, looking south.  i'd estimate roughly 5-10 minutes had passed since we seen the very brief flash, when suddenly to the south, in the sky it just appeared. i pointed telling him to look, he turned around and seen it.  it was this large morphing ball of light or energy just stationary in the sky. the light was what i describe as very ‘dense’ in that it was just like very definitive, non transparent, and non luminous around the object. yet the light was incredibly bright. it's light was white, maybe with a very slight blueish tint, and the object had very difinitive edges, yet it was always changing shape in a sort of energised looking way. it was about the size of a full moon. these very odd characteristics made judging it's distance very hard, but i would guess it was at least a few hundred feet in the sky, and maybe a few kilometers out over the ocean to the south. putting it roughly east of the cherry hill area. \r\n \r\n  me and my friend were absolutely blown away but what we were watching. i remember saying ‘look! look!’. after roughly 15-20 seconds, the object stopped being so dense and intense, and shrunk to about the size and brightness of a big bright star, and then started to move towards the west and maybe north west basically parallel to earth. do to its distance, it seemed to be moving at an incredible rate of speed. after it travelled to our right (westward) about 10 seconds or so, it seemed to start to head upwards, towards space, and start to fade very quickly. i said ‘i lost it’ he said ‘i still see it… now it's gone.’ \r\n\r\n\r\n  i was blown away with excitement, but he was terrified, demanding we leave that very minute and go straight home. it was a very hard to describe, yet intense thing to see. on the way home we talked about it. we came to a somewhat fitting conclusion to the events we seen. it very much seemed as though there was something over the ocean, that had started to do some sort of charging or energizing, starting with a brief flash. after the intense charging phase was over, the object then seemed to use that energy to begin to fly, and leave earth. \r\n\r\n\r\n  i know our theory is just that, and that whatever it was could have been doing a million other things than what we concluded, but one thing for sure is what we seen was something. due to the many variables… being stationary, then moving, being huge, then much smaller, the shape, density, speed, timing, and the brief flash that preceded it all… it was truly something unexplainable, that i will never forget.  after that night, my friend would not talk to anyone including myself about what we seen, because he was so terrified. he has however briefly confirmed that we seen something that night when i confronted him in front of others that were curious of the story.  \r\n","distance":"Over One

outside to see how warm it was out and to see if there was any cloud coverage. i looked up into the sky, as it was very clear, checking out all the stars when i noticed one that appeared to be pulsating, and drifting from side to side. it would move to my right, hover a bit and then go back to my left. it would sometimes go up in a circular motion and then just set still for a short period. the object appeared to be a few miles away, directly sw from my position. if it wasn't for the pulsating light and it's movement, and maybe being just a tad bit bigger than the other stars in the sky, it would have  looked just like another star. \r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of observation i went inside to get my camera hoping to zoom in to see it better and maybe capture a short video. i observed this object for about 10 minutes overall. my arms started to get tired from trying to hold the camera up at an angle, while keeping it still, so i quit filming and went inside to see what i captured. i got a little excited that there was something on the video, and almost forgot to go back out to watch it. but after messing around a few minutes inside,  i went back out to see if it was there and i did not see it anymore. \r\n\r\nas you can tell from the video, everything is very quiet outside with an occasional dog barking in the background. it did not seem that the object made any noise. if it was a helicopter i would have been able to hear it. coming from the opposite direction, and much higher, are flight paths for jets that are coming in and out of the tampa international airport. when these go overhead, either taking off or landing, they audible. that pretty much sums it up.\r\n\r\nthere are two short videos i took. in the first one, the object is not centered due to my poor aiming, but it does come up in the bottom right hand corner of the picture after a few seconds. the second video is much better as i readjusted my aim to get the object centered. the object was a distance away, so it is pretty small in the video, and maybe a bit on the dim side. but you will clearly see it, and what appears to be flashing/pulsating lights and almost like it is spinning, or something. but that may be due to the lights. it also appears at times that there is color to the lights. sometimes they look blue, and other times it looks like a flash or reddish color. but the flash is so quick, as was the pulsating of the light very fast.","distance":"Over One

mo. when i noticed what looked like a star in the east. it was the middle of the day and when i glanced back to look at it again it had gotten much closer. it was obviously moving at a great speed. i told the friends and we all watched as it came within less than a mile from our position and came to a complete stop above some trees and sac river. it was cigar shaped and was completely engulfed in flames. the flames were lapping upward as it sat motionless and quietly. it sat there long enough for my friends to run into the garage and look out the window. i was amazed and stayed in the driveway watching it. after a few moments it tilted upwards then disappeared like a curtain had been pulled in front. i have always had the impression or the feeling that it just accelerated away so fast the human eye couldn't follow. there was never any noise. it's like when something travels through the atmosphere so fast that it catches or creates fire. that's what i felt was the reason it was engulfed in flames because from the first dot like star to where it stopped was only a few seconds. my friends were all freaked out and scared but i remember telling them that if they were going to take us, there wasn't anything we could probably do. ironically, all 3 of my friends are deceased. my best friend whose truck we were washing committed suicide. his little brother died of cancer and the other friend died in a car crash. i don't remember ever discussing it with them afterwards but have told my family about the experience. i have also discussed it with others thru out the years. i've considered it a privilege and a great experience and would love to have it happen again.  in the late 80's i also saw what looked like a mother ship, a tiny dot very high in the sky in daylight with no clouds. it seemed to set motionless while several smaller pinpoints of light flew around it. i watched this for an hour or so while i was working one weekend. this happened above springfield, mo. didn't have any binoculars or any way to see it better so this one was not near as profound an experience.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

companies up in los angeles to go up there and stay for awhile and work on a video part up there. basically a dream to a skateboarder. we decided to gather up some money to take the drive up to la! we left at 8pm from san antonio, tx. we decided to start the trip over late night to completely avoid traffic. it was me (luke), and my 2 best friends peter (second witness), and victor (asleep at the time). we wanted to get there next day so we did the whole trip in one sitting. about 12 hours or so in we finally left texas and the morning was coming so i definitely know we were in new mexico now at this point. i'm a ufo fanatic and have done years of research. i always keep my eyes on the skies in hopes of seeing something completely abnormal. i know what to look for in unknown things and known things. the sun just rose up at about 6:30ish cst time. at 7:00 we are on i-10 highway. there's absolutely nothing around and its complete desert and mountains now. i'm looking around from shear boredom (and trying to stay up as i'm driving). on my left side i notice what i thought was a storm cloud. the smallest lonesome storm cloud ever! i tapped peter,  who was in the passenger seat, and told him to look. i remember telling him \"do you see that dark cloud by itself?\" to which he replied \"luke, why do you always got to see ufos man!?\" i joke with them a lot when i see a light ina the sky just to annoy them for my entertainment. but this time peter took a double take. \"oh i definitely see that actually. that's in broad daylight dude\" he said. \"that's what i'm saying!\" i said. we watched this object for about 7-10 mins or so. i took a good long look. i basically confirmed it to definitely not be a cloud. it was very low but high enough to be distant. it basically looked like a goldfish cracker exactly! it was a very dull gray but still reflected the sunlight. it had no windows and i could not see a seam on the tail. no propellers or engines. it was a literal flying gray goldfish cracker. we had such a good view to see this exact \"thing\" i rolled down the window to see if i could hear anything and i didn't. (mind you though, i'm going 80mph plus so all i heard was wind. no vehicles either at this point) we watched at it was completely still. then started moving very slowly with us. keeping pace with us but not making a sudden movement in the process. as we passed the only mountain in sight, it tilted up at a 45 degree angle and moved to the top of the mountain, then straightened out. it hovered straight over the mountain then tilted downward at a 45 degree angle. it descended to its original altitude and straightened out and continued its flight path. i was amazed as we just watched this object navigate over the mountain so it was definitely moving. it's hovering so slowly that,  with us moving, it almost looks like it's not moving! when other oncoming vehicles finally started showing up in view, i couldn't help but notice it was getting smaller. very small. this told me that it was now moving away from us. i saw it starting to go upwards and as it got too small, i brought my attention back to the road. we watched it long enough to get a decent video of it. we tried to record it and photo it on my and peters phone but for some reason our phones could not adjust what's so ever to the object. i pulled my ipod out and that's what we got the video on. my ipod is an offline device with no service so it struck  me as weird that my ipod was able to adjust to it unphased. i sent this to mufon cause 1. i'm a huge fan and i'm hoping one of these days to contribute in any findings. 2. i know you guys will analyze the footage and i really hope you guys find out what i saw is. i just want to know did we see something strange or not so much? thank you guys so much. please excuse my language in the video by the way! i am a skater after all...The first video is the good video of the object. the second one is actually the first vid we took but we barely got it in that one. it's more of me talking about it. i was very excited so please excuse my foul mouth.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":80888,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12092016-0004","longitude":null,"occurred":1475824200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,  Missile","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1481253381000,"summary":"Driving to los angeles from texas. saw a goldfish shaped object in broad daylight. watched hover very slowly over mountain.","tags":["photo","video","ufo","light","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1481271914601,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":62,"locationName":"I'm not too sure honestly, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:41908"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Redondo beach ","country":"US","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Redondo beach california, north redondo to be exact.  i was spending the night with my cousins and wanted some candy.  so i told my aunt i was going to the liquor store mr.Bs market on artesia blvd/ slauson ave.  i left her house around 7pmish she lived on carnegie and slauson ave just two short blocks from the store i was walking too.  usually would only take me 15 minutes round trip at most.  \r\n  their was is a small alley behind the liquor store which leads to the store.   befor i got the the alley i caught a smell of a sulfer like weird odor in the air.  and i felt a strange static like almost \r\n magnetic feeling in the air,  very hard to explain!   \r\n  i felt a presents in the air and i looked up above me.  their was a black disc shaped object hovering directly above me.  it was just above the power lines and very close.  till this day i can draw an accurate picture of it.  it had lights strobing around the bottom edge.  turning on one after another like dominos.   colors red, green, yellow, white, blue,orange from what i can remember.   i stood their staring at the object.  i wanted to run but i was frozen i could even tell for help although i was trying too.   finally the objects grip one let me go. and i made a b line thru the alley and into the store.  i clearly remember telling the store clerk frantically what i saw.  he simply told me to calm down that i saw nothing.  he did notice i was so afraid to go back outside.  till this day idk what he was thinking.  \r\n i told him that if anyone reports a kid missing that it was me and that the ufo took me.  he probably thought o was crazy.  \r\ni ran fast as i could back to my aunts house.  she was very mad at me.  she told me i was gone almost four hours.  which i didn't think was possible.  how could i loose four hours of time ?

of activity in the skies here\r\nin pocatello, actually just about anywhere i go i can get pictures of what i call micro machines.\r\nthat's what i call them, the skies are infested with them, i have been photographing them pretty steady\r\nfor more than 5 years, i will leave a couple pictures in this letter for you. i have been doing my best to \r\nget the word out about these objects with not much luck, it would seem that most people are asleep\r\nat the switch. during the day i get pictures of many different types of craft some small some bigger,\r\nat night i get a totally different experience, i photograph and video these white light spheres that move\r\nover town very slowly, some less than a thousand feet up, others way up about 10 and 12 miles some of them.\r\n  \r\n back to the micro machines, i call them that because they are not organic, they are some kind of an ai probe.\r\nyes, artificial intelligence, the only other person i have ever heard mention them in any kind of context is a guy named \r\ngeorge adamski back in the 1950's, in 1952 he said that our skies were flooded with these probes that ranged \r\nin size from a few centimeters to a few meters, i have photographed them all, like i said i will leave a few pictures \r\nfor you. i have always noticed these objects flashing out of the corner of my eye but when i turned to look, they\r\nwould be gone, finally i started setting up a tripod with my camera set to high speed continuous shutter and i would \r\nrip off about 20 frames at a time, i would do about 5 sets like that in different directions, then i would study my\r\npictures on the computer, i would notice these little objects moving threw the frames at a pretty high rate of\r\nspeed, it was no wonder i could not focus on them. i got pretty good at it after a while and i was able to establish\r\nareas where they would be more often than not. soon i would get better cameras and lenses, then i moved across town\r\nand it was still happening. it got to the point where i am going out 5 and 6 times a day and catching these objects.\r\n  \r\n but what really got my attention is when i would photograph a bird of prey flying and i would notice a bunch of \r\nthese objects around the bird, that's when it kind of struck me that these objects are monitoring the wild life, \r\ni take short drives out into the farmlands here and take pictures of big birds flying over the fields and there will \r\nbe dozens of these objects flying all around the birds. i have a facebook page and i do a lot of posting there, and\r\ni make it a habit to only post pictures that i take, it's my way of keeping ufology pure. i have posted a few thousand \r\npictures of these objects. i do not alter my pictures, i enlarge them and crop in photoshop, i wouldn't know how to \r\nenhance them or fake anything. at present i am using a nikon d800 w/ 50mm f1.4 lens for daytime stuff, and at night\r\ni put on a 300 mm lens. \r\n\r\n  i have learned a lot about these objects from photographing them, i know when they are just looking around, i know\r\nwhen they are looking at me, sometimes i get people in my pictures and these little craft will be checking them out.\r\ni don't like having people in my pictures, but if the scenario is right i will let the people in the picture but i won't\r\nmake them the center of attraction, but that's when the objects will show up. i call them ai because i am positive \r\nthey are not man made yet they are performing a function. the camera i use now, the file sizes are huge so i usually \r\nonly take 4 frames at a time, in that time i can establish or rule out objects in the picture, at 4 frames per second\r\ni can tell if an object is a bird or an actual craft, a bird will only cover so much ground in a second where these little craft \r\ncan cover 150 yards in one second. i don't take many videos because i don't know how to process them, and i don't\r\nlike sifting through hundreds of frames. doing 4 frames per second is like a mini video. i don't like to speculate about\r\nwhat i think these craft are doing or who they might be doing it for, but that doesn't mean i don't think about it. as far as\r\ni know i am the only one talking about these objects, i watch a lot of videos of people speaking at the conferences, and\r\neveryone seems to be focused on the larger sightings and et experiences.\r\n\r\n  i tell people that you could not walk out to your car without being seen by at least 5 of these objects, \r\ni don't say that to scare anyone, i say it because it is true. these little craft are watching everything that is\r\ngoing on, and i have pictures that will prove that, they are not malicious, they just seem to show up when needed.\r\nok, so the pictures i will leave, i will leave a few, you will get the idea of what is going on. if you have any questions\r\nplease feel free to ask me, i would really like to find a way to get this info out there, like i said, no body is talking about it.\r\n\r\n  i guess what i really want to report is a phenomena rather than just a single sighting, i take pictures of them everyday, and that's why i don't fill out reports everyday. i observe these objects high in the sky and cruising in and out of people's yards, over rooftops and trees. especially during the warmer months i see hundreds of them everyday, winter months seems to bring on different types like orbs.

flying through a cloud (it is slightly cloudy tonight, but mostly clear) or possibly due to emissions from the object itself. the object was moving at a steady pace and in a straight line from nw to se. there was no discernible noise coming from the object that i could hear. there was also typical air traffic in the area as well heading to/from bwi however, this was not like any airliner i have seen and it didn't have the typical aviation marker lights flashing. upon realizing that this is possibly a ufo, i ran to the house and called my wife outside. i pointed out the object to her and she

rural town surrounded mostly by farms. my family and i are moving to a new residence, so yesterday i was following closely behind my father in my car to make sure nothing fell out of his truck, driving on backroads. right as we were leaving town, i noticed in the distance what looked like a plane coming in for a landing. it was in front of me to my right. it was dusk so there was still some light in the sky. i then looked harder and saw that this object was much closer and lower than that and it appeared to be either hovering or moving incredibly slowly. now noticing that this was strange, at the next stop sign, the lights were behind a tree...Which i used to gauge if it was moving and how fast. it appeared to be moving very slowly to the right, maybe 5 miles an hour. as i was getting closer to it i slowed down and kept watching it. the closer i got was the closer i realized this object was. it was at a height of about two tall trees on top of each other, more or less. i then began to notice the shape. it sort of looked like a stubbier telephone pole, or cigar shape. as i said, there was still a little light out, so i could clearly make out the shape and color of the craft between the two lights. it was jet black, no wings, no blades, no holes, no windows. nothing. and i rolled down my window to listen but it didnt make any noticeable sound.  just looked like a black metal tube with a bright white light on each end. i drove right by it so i got to see it at all angles and this was definitely its shape. at one point i was almost right underneath it, to the left of it a little bit. i could see it pretty clear as day, and this was without a doubt abnormal. i kept watching it after i passed it, glancing back and using my mirrors, and one glance it was there, the next glance it was just gone. there was nothing to block it from my view. i had only looked away for about 2 seconds before it disappeared. i would have stopped to get a video but i couldn't, as i was following my father. had i gotten the video, it would have been very good because it was still a little light out and it was really close. when we made it to our destination i had asked him if he saw anything and he confirmed that he saw it and that he had no idea what it could have been. the whole sighting was probably about 2 to 3 minutes.","distance":"21-100
