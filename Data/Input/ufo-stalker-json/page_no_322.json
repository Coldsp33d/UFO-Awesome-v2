get my binoculars as my son was a pilot.   i am very familiar with planes. at first i thought it might have been a larger plane.\r\n this object was moving so slow, a normal plane could not stay up in the sky given the speed of this object. no sounds.\r\n by the time i got my binoculars, it was moving past trees, headed towards avon lake. \r\ni saw another report made earlier from someone that also saw  a light over the lake the same day. i am not sure what time this person saw the object they reported but my sighting was between 8-8:30 pm.\r\nyesterday, december 7th, i was looking out my kitchen window and noticed how pretty the clouds were. i grabbed my camera and took a few pictures to show my husband. \r\nattached is one of the regular pictures i took with nothing in it but the clouds. i took several more and then noticed an \"object\" appeared on one of the frames. i did not see this object when i was snapping the photos but it is there. looks like a round classic ufo...I tried to blow it up to see it better but the camera i had in my hands was a small cool pix. \r\ni have seen numerous sightings here. i also have another video of one we saw a few years ago.\r\nwhen you view the picture, look at the top left hand corner. you may have to blow it up to view but the picture prior to that, you just see the clouds, nothing else. i didn't want to upload all the other

there watching in amazement. - it's not everyday i see anything like that. it seemed to float through the air. kinda like a blimp, but slower. anything that huge, traveling that slow would just fall

it's brightness. i told my friend about it immediately, which he agreed it was not the normal size and very orange. i tried to locate venus to confirm it was not that planet, but did take note that the glowing object was below the feet of the orion constellation. it was vaguely noticeable that the object was moving, so we stood by a palm tree to gauge its movement. we could see that it was slightly moving westward. the orange orb was occasionally changing in intensity. just before it disappeared completely, the glow had a noticeable flicker, than it vanished. we were able to take a few pictures during the time (different phone models), but the orange color showed up in the pictures as white. we walked around a little bit more to walk-off our dinner that we just ate and talk about

towards the back of my house. \r\n  i heard the faint chop - chop- chop of a helicopter and just a few seconds after i heard the first \"chop\" i saw a red light (i assume it was a running light from the helicopter) in the sky emerge heading southwest. this is a fairly common occurrence here as we see news and traffic choppers fairly often. \r\n  the chopper proceeded south for approximately 30 seconds. i didn't give it another thought and went back to enjoying the tub. within another 30 seconds, i started hearing the chopper again but this time (even over the noise of the 6 hp tub jets) it was getting considerably louder. i leaned up and looked towards the sound and the red light was coming back towards my way on a north/northeast heading and moving fast, very fast. \r\n  at this point the rotor chop was getting so incredibly loud, i reached over and turned the tub jets off because i couldn't believe what i was hearing and now feeling in my chest. the chop was so powerful that i then realized this has to be a military chopper. i couldn't see the chopper itself yet but i could see it's red running light (the only light visible) as it approached.\r\n  a few seconds later, the chopper passed right in front of me just above treetop height. when it passed by, the chopper was completely black as in there were no lights emanating from the cabin, just the red running light.\r\n  this is were it gets interesting... just in front of the chopper, about 50 to 70 feet, was a tubular shaped glowing white object silently screaming by. i know it made no discernible noise simply because the chopper thump thump thump is intermittent. if this was a jet or a missile going that fast, i feel very confident it would have made a loud jet engine or rocket sound. it was silent.\r\n  i reported this to mufon because of the following reasons:\r\n1. it was an extremely fast and powerful military style chopper\r\n2. it was flying way below legal altitude (just above treetops)\r\n3. it was obvious to me that the chopper was chasing something due to        it's very fast and erratic flight path\r\n4. right as it passed in front of my line of sight, i saw what it was chasing as decribed above.\r\n5. when the chopper abruptly changed course, it was now coming towards me and did not have a white light coming out of the front of it.\r\n6. and finally, because this all happened over a residential area.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
