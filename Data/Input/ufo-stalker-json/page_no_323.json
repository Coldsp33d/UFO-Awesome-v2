live in a country type of area. the tv was down low as not to disturb my wife. i heard our front door open (it makes a distinctive sound as the lower seal rubs the step plate ) it had my attention, but i thought it was our son who has the only other key to our house. now i hear walking in the living room but sounds like more than one person. my wife looked at me and said you know someone just came in the house dont you. so i answered yes i know, it has to be our son, he's the only one with a key. and she says,what if it's not. she was right, so i get out of bed, go to the closet and get my gun. we leave a small light on in the kitchen just to be able to see if someone is there, but they can't see us well. i go through the house carefully cause i still believe its my son. i call out his name and say that i have a gun not to be joking around, but no answer. so i start going through each room turning on the lights as i go. i looked in every room, ieven looked under beds and in closets cause i know i heard someone enter our house. i found nothing. front door was double locked.No windows open or unlocked. so i go back to my bedroom and tell my wife that nothing was there. she said, i heard someone are you shure.I said i heard someone too, but the door is locked and the house is safe.I told my wife that while i was up i was going to go outside and smoke before going back to bed.I took my gun with me and went out on the front porch. i usually sit on the steps and smoke, but i wanted to look around the house, in case someone was outside or home. our garage is about 30 feet from our house,with a sidewalk joining themso i slowly walk tward garage. i get about half way when i notice lights at my neighbors house. hovering above his house was a ufo. it was sitting still and it was glowing different colors. it was made of metal.But the lights were the most vivid beautiful colors i have seen. glowing green then red then blue. i know my wife is terrified of these things cause we see them quite often and she remarks, i dont want to see them. im the opposite, i want to put my hands on one and look it over, iwant to talk to them and know what they know. i just hope they are friendly and dont diesec me. i see ufos a lot. and its worthless to tell someone without proof they pat you on the head and say they believe you. so i walked to the door and said, hey honey, can you come outhere for a minute. she said yes, so i walked back out on the sidewalk and waited, i remember thinking, i hope she gets here quick cause these things dont stay still for very long. she came out and right to where i was and said what do you want. i said, look at louis house. she seen it. she knows what it was too. she grabbed my arm and lets get back in the house. i said dont be afraid,its over his house not ours, and its not doing anything but hovering. she was still scared so we went to the edge of the garage and just watched. we had a real nice 12 megapixel camera but it quit working 3 days earlier. it was killing me to see it this close and not able to film it. we watched for about 15 min and it started moving. it went above the trees and slowly went out of sight.  about a week later i saw my neighbor and told him what we seen. he said, i know which night you mean.I was in bed asleep but im a very light sleeper. i heard someone come in my house, so i reached under my pillow and got my 44 pistol . i just stayed in bed and pointed the gun twards the door. i could hear someone going through my silverware drawer.Opening cabinet doors, and walking around. i just listened. after a few minutes it got quiet.I got up announced that i had a gun and started through the house. i found nothing or no one. my door still locked. so at least i know what i heard coming in my house, but i never heard them leave by the door.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

wife, 22 yoa daughter, and 15 yoa son were in the process of exiting their house to enter their vehicle. son alerted pepe about a bright light hovering above near the zenith. pepe saw the light and remarked it was not only too high over the horizon to be the planet venus, but also brighter. the object was stationary and to pepe¡¯s eyes it seemed to consist of two lights in one. pepe asked wife to bring camera from the house and asked her to take a photo of the light. wife took the first photo. camera is an old sony digital camera, model dsc-hx200v, with an integrated zoom lens made by carl zeiss. wife handed over the camera to pepe. pepe took a photo. he waited a few minutes and when he tried to take another photo could not locate the object in the lcd screen. his son advised the object was still in the same place and after reacquiring the object he took another photo. pepe advised the three photos had different zoom settings.\r\n\r\nafter approximately 7-10 minutes a large cloud hid the object. after realizing it would take a long time for the cloud to pass they decided to enter vehicle and departed area. from time to time pepe pulled over the vehicle in order to try to locate object, but the cloud was still hiding the object. when the cloud finally moved away the object was gone. \r\n\r\npepe regrets he did not try to take more photos of the object at different zoom settings. he thought at the time the object lacked any features and was not doing anything. his overall impression of the experience is that whoever controlled this object wanted for him not just to see it, but to take photos of it. \r\n\r\n\r\ndate of sighting: 10sep16\r\ngeographical location of sighting: san juan, puerto rico\r\ndescription of area/ surroundings: urban\r\ntime of sighting: shortly after 6:20 p.M.\r\nweather conditions: clear\r\ncircumstances for becoming aware of object: son alerted his father (pepe)\r\nnumber of objects: one\r\napparent size of object at arm¡¯s length (subtended angle): similar to planet venus\r\napproximate angle of object from horizon: approximately 80¢ª\r\ncardinal orientation if other than zenith (directly above observer): west\r\nestimated distance to object: several thousand feet\r\nestimated altitude of object from ground: several thousand feet\r\ncolor of object: white light. appeared as two lights close together.\r\nshape of object: rounded\r\napparent solidity of object (translucent or solid): solid\r\nopaque or bright: bright\r\nbrightness of object if applicable: brighter than planet venus\r\nlights observed on the object: the object seemed to glow. no additional lights observed.  \r\nlights observed coming from the object (beams): none\r\nany sound detected: none\r\nany observed rotation of object: none with the naked eye. only by looking at the photos.\r\nobserved behavior of object: stationary\r\nduration of sighting: approximately 7-10 minutes\r\ncircumstances for losing sight of object: cloud \r\nnumber of witnesses (adults/minors): four (three adults, one minor)\r\nphoto or video recording attempted: yes. three digital photos taken.\r\nif photo/video obtained, provide brand and model: sony dsc-hx200v\r\npersonal/subjective impression of this sighting by the witness(es): pepe felt the object was posing for him\r\nother sightings in the past by the witness(es)? (yes or no): yes, all four\r\nif yes, determine approximate number and frequency: a lot and very often\r\ndoes/do the witness(es) wish to remain anonymous?: yes, at least for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto analysis: a detailed photo analysis is currently being conducted by one of the foremost experts in the world. results of same will be released at a later date.  \r\n\r\nauthentication of photos: principal investigator have personally known pepe and his family for many years and he can, absolutely and categorically, vouch for the reputation and trustworthiness of witnesses. \r\n\r\nevaluation of photographic evidence by principal investigator:\r\nmaximum optical zoom: 30x\r\nmaximum combined optical and digital zoom: 120x\r\nexif data recorded by the camera for the focal length is regrettably incorrect. the camera records all photos as 144 mm of focal length. pepe advised his camera is old and meant for amateur photography. he has a friend who owns the same model camera and it also records all photos as 144 mm. \r\n\r\nphoto #1: photo taken by wife. exif data shows a digital zoom ratio (dzr) of 3x, meaning the camera magnified the optical zoom by three times, for a total zoom setting of 90x. wife advised she used a zoom setting a bit lower than the maximum allowed by the camera. object appears as a somewhat flattened and very bright balloon, with a dark and thick horizontal band in the middle. also visible is a little bright ball underneath the object. on the left side of the object one can appreciate at least three well delineated horizontal dark lines. unable to determine whether these lines are painted or they are part of the infrastructure of the object. \r\n\r\nphoto #2: photo taken by pepe. dzr = 4x. this is indeed the maximum zoom capability of the camera, providing a combined optical and digital zoom of 120x. pepe advised he used the maximum zoom setting. one can observe two large semicircular apertures, or cavities, or windows in the underside of the object. the inside of these two apertures are bathed with a very intense white light. of particular interest is the aperture at the 4 o¡¯clock position, which appears to show two opaque figures silhouetted against the bright background. the figure on the right side appears very humanoid in shape and slightly leaning to the left. some parallel dark lines are visible at the edges of the dark thick band. \r\n\r\nphoto #3: photo taken by pepe. dzr = 1.25x. the combined optical and digital zoom was 37.50x. pepe advised he used just a bit of the digital zoom. in the third photo there is no light coming from the inside of the object, thereby revealing many features. this is consistent with pepe¡¯s statement that he had a hard time trying to reacquire the object in the lcd screen of his camera. this photo gives the impression the object rotated approximately 180¡æ along its vertical axis. (bear in mind the object is not in the zenith (directly above), even though the photos give the impression pepe was directly under the object. the three photos were taken with the camera always facing the object from the same angle, meaning towards the west.) the aperture with the two figures previously located at the 4 o¡¯clock position now seems located at the 11 o¡¯clock position. the apparent humanoid figure that was leaning to the left in photo #2 is now more clearly visible through it. what is more, this figure seems to be resting its arms on the border of the semicircular aperture. to the right of this figure there appears to be another humanoid figure. in photo #3 one can clearly see the closely-spaced dark lines are not painted, but are ridges or striations running parallel and towards the center of the object.\r\n\r\n***************************************************************************\r\nnote: please note the similarity of pepe¡¯s sighting with the ufo filmed on 17aug16 after 6:00 pm in rochester, ny, mufon case number 80167. the parallel lights observed beneath the ufo in the video matches the parallel lines observed in the three photos of the ufo by pepe. \r\n***************************************************************************\r\n \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface, Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":80837,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":18.4655394,"location":null,"logNumber":"PR-12062016-0011","longitude":-66.1057355,"occurred":1473531600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"San Juan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1481053670000,"summary":"Three adults and child observed very bright stationary object. three photos attempted. photos revealed internal light and possible occupants.

wings, a tail, a front or a back and have no idea what way it was moving. thinking to when i took the pictures i know i heard nothing but the object looks pretty far. i decided to put the picture in photoshop, tried different filters, flipped it to black and white but nothing made it any clearer until i \"solarized\" the original and the forth picture is what i got. now i'm looking at what to me can only be a ufo. i got a magnifying glass, enlarged the picture and it almost looks like a cookie. i also noticed the hole in the cloud directly below this object. i was freakng out! all i could think was i got a picture of a ufo coming or going through a port hole or some cosmic worm hole. i showed the picture to friends and family and get all kinds of coments against and for it being a ufo, but to me it's kind of strange that it's only in 1 out of 3 pictures taken with in seconds of each other. obviously i've been sitting on the picture for a few years but i finally figured i see what

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am reporting this at the recommendation of investigator, jack nicholais. \r\n\r\nthis event was almost completely forgotten by me until about three or four years ago when i was in contact with an ex-girlfriend. the conversation was difficult due to the fact she was very upset that i didn't remember what she and i experienced on one occasion and very little of another event. i'm reporting the event i recall bits and pieces of but i will describe the entire conversation as best i can. i am no longer in contact with her and i have remembereded more since speaking with her but due to how upset she was, i only received a limited amount of details. \r\n\r\nwhile conversing about paranormal topics, i had mentioned to my ex that during the time i dated her, very little happened out of the ordinary for me. she became very disgruntled and said that when she dated me was the weirdest time of her life and that it was just like me to forget what she described as \"the scariest things\" that ever happened to her. she frequently commented that due to that fact, \"she always knew the relationship meant more to her than it did to me.\" this made it difficult to get information at the time. she asked me if i remembered my car dying on \"death shade road.\" i replied that i remembered the trip but i certainly would remember my car dying late at night on shades of death road since my civic never broke down. she said it wasn't the civic but my first car to which i said that at that time i didn't have a cellular phone (pre 1999) and would've had to walk up and down a dark spooky road knocking on doors to call a tow truck and i would definitely remember that kind of thing. she was very frustrated and asked me how i could forget the lights. i have no idea to this day what she was talking about but she said the car died, i got out of the car, walked to the middle, then the side of the road and then was \"ensconced\" in a bluish-white light. at this point i'm thinking that if what she's telling me is true, there's probably a good reason i only recall the trip itself. i pressed for more information, but she said i got back in the car and it started and we left. i don't know at which point i was no longer blue and i had mentioned that it sounded like a ufo event and it's quite well known that people forget these kind of things but i didn't get much further than that. i only recall the fact that we did go to this road but nothing more. \r\n\r\nthe second event she described is the one i remember more of but not quite in the same way she did. in fact, this whole event is a mixture of things i specifically remember, things i thought happened elsewhere or in dreams, the information she provided and recollections of conversations i had after the fact about certain details. even at the time of speaking with her, i didn't connect some of it together but i am fairly certain everything i'm about to describe occurred as one event. i will describe what she said first and then what i remember. \r\n\r\nshe said that we went on a road trip to south jersey at night and drove down a very long highway. eventually, we got off the highway and drove down a dirt road. she said there was a fog and at one point both my passenger and driver windows fell into the door. the windows were both broken and were held in place with pieces of cardboard wedged against the door. she said that i said, \"there's the reservoir\" after i presume i pointed it out. she said the car died, at which point i ran out and \"scrambled\" up a hill. she said red, white and blue lights rose up off the water and hovered over my head. the lights went out, i returned to my vehicle and it started up. i asked if i said anything and she said all i said was \"it was a hoax\" and i wouldn't speak any further about it. \r\n\r\ni remember the trip, specifically the part where she commented about how long the highway was. i am 99% certain the road is 195 from trenton to the shore although i do not recall the reason for the trip nor what the destination was. i would frequently drive to places highlighted in weird nj or just drive around trying to get lost but south jersey was very far from home and besides the legends of the jersey devil, i don't know why i would go there at all. the pine barrens are littered with dirt roads but i do not remember a dirt road. i do remember telling someone at the time about the doors falling in the door and i'm assuming it was because the road was very bumpy. i vaguely remember this because it was amusing to me since she didn't want me to stop and fix the windows but the road so narrow and we were driving so slowly that it still freaked her out because something could reach in the window. again, that is vague and i remember it as a funny story and not a direct memory. the fog i do not remember at all. the part where i pointed out the reservoir i do recall although i remember it being the wannaque in notth jersey. i also remember a long, thin bridge that sat directly on the water. it was lit up for a holiday that had passed which i believe was the 4th of july. i do not remember the colors but it was lit up with multiple lights all the way across. when she had mentioned the red, white and blue lights at the time, i thought she meant three individual lights but now i'm fairly certain the bridge and what she described are the same object. there aren't many holidays associated with specific colors besides christmas and the 4th, so even though i don't remember which colors, it stands to reason it was red, white and blue. i do not remember the car dying but i remember being very excited to check out the bridge because it looked really cool. i do not remember it rising in the air nor hovering over my head but i think it made a clanging sound which made me think it was a drawbridge about to open although this memory is more dreamlike. i do not remember anything else about that night. after recently visiting the wannaque reservoir i could not find the bridge nor a vantage point that matched what i can recall. there are few dirt roads in that area as well and none that run along that reservoir. \r\n\r\nthe bridge did remind me of an old picture of dam that no longer exists at the wannaque but after searching countless lakes and reservoirs in nj using satellite imagery, i cannot find any that have bridges that sit directly on the water. the thing that i saw was huge but not wide although it may have been partially submerged. it almost looked like a walkway to me although the way i remember it would make it too thin to be a craft that long. it may have been v shaped as well, i'm not sure. \r\n\r\ndue to other experiences throughout my life, i am concerned this event was far more than i remember. i do not recall missing time mostly due to the fact i never kept track of time on these type of night rides. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

before 9:00 pm i heard a loud helicopter approaching. this was unusual so i hurried outside the side door of my house to see what was going on.  it was pitch black out and besides some scattered clouds the sky was relatively clear.  i heard the helicopter coming from ene direction but it was still behind the treeline and i couldn't see it yet.  a few seconds later, something caught my eye to the east at about a 45 degree angle.  i thought my eyes were plying tricks on me but i swear i saw a dark \"something\" moving through the sky in a sw direction.  i was able to detect the movement because it blocked out the stars in the background as it went along. i didn't think much of it and my attention turned back to the approaching helicopter which i still couldn't yet see.  just as the running lights of the helicopter came into view, a pale red/pink light appeared to my ese (same flight path as the dark \"something\") and i thought it might have been a satellite. then i looked back at the helicopter.  i couldn't tell what kind it was but it was big and loud, shaking the house, and flying at what i'd guess an altitude of 500-700 feet. i turned my attention back to the pink ball of light and i realized that it actually couldn't be a satellite because it was moving across the sky too quickly and the flight path was slightly curving to the south. before they went out of view behind the treeline to my south, i could tell that the helicopter was a few hundred feet behind the light and it appeared to be chasing or following it.  even though the pink light was small, it definitely had mass to it.  almost like it was another aircraft that was running dark and not using any conventional navigation lights.  besides the sound of the one helicopter, i didn't notice any other aircraft type sounds.  i'd estimate that both aircraft were flying at around 80-100 mph. why would a large helicopter be flying extremely low over a residential area at 9:00 at night? the pink light obviously had something to do with it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

personal past of knowledge of sky objects, drones, aircraft, military aircrafts, astronomy, and the like)\r\n\r\n    after midnight location: downtown old hollywood area near 101 fwy and franklin junction. i pulled my car into the 101 cafe on franklin blvd back parking lot which has a 30 degree and up view of a clear night sky with a west, north, and east. as i parked my car i quickly sighted a large blue white object in the nw sky about 35 degrees up from horizon through my wind shield. my iphone read 2:17am. instantly i jumped out to investigate and questioned to my partner what was in the sky. at the same time as i spoke this question, a female  witness at her car behind us joined in with us to question the same object as she just had spotted it as well. nw west toward the hollywood bowl in the hollywood hills- mullholand drive region an object was gracefully flying over those hills which was a clear mile distance from us. the object was flat. it's underbelly was a soft, radiant, blue white light in a honey-comed patterned shape. very faint aura around the object. the object's speed, resembled the grace of a blimp, very directional and straight, yet very gradual and slow in shift of direction overall through the experience. the object was heading east towards us and it's speed was cruising, causal, slow, yet the light detail resembled a superstructure in a blue-white, honey-combed pattern that was entirely luminous. no landing lights, no blinking lights, no conventional aircraft resemblance. this was a solid, luminous shape that did not pulsate or change intensity in lumination or brightness. it moved gracefully without abrupt turns. just smooth, clearly indicating behavior of a large craft, like a aircraft carrier or blimp would, and like these examples, one realized it gained distance in a short amount of time. we were now 3 witnesses trying to identify the craft. we quickly agreed the craft was not anything we were ever familiar with, as we all have much flying experience. iam a drone owner as well, and this was not the behavior of a drone with zig zag action or it's type of lights. about a minute of observation, we agreed the craft with this behavior easily was in the measurement of 100ft across at least as it dwarfed the structures below on the hills at an 1500-2000ft elevation above the hills. slowly and gradually the craft turned easily north east gradually gaining altitude as it flew over the 101 fyw cahuenga pass. about after another minute it was clear the craft was gracefully gaining extreme altitude, and due to elevation it's craft detail was getting smaller as it finally settled over the hollywood sign mountain. the craft peaked about 5000ft above the mountain and paused it's ne direction. it hovered still perfectly without a bump for about another minute. through this time again the craft was gaining more altitude. about another 30 seconds of this slow climb, the craft slowly flew southward to our direction. the honey-combed lit pattered was so tiny from it's height, yet still identifiable. it's movement and behavior resembled that of high space satellite. the craft eventually was now spotted by two more witnesses as they were entering the cafe, as we were all in agreement of tracking the craft. the slow path and acension ended directly above us about 7000-8000ft as it hovered in place for another 5 minutes. as the craft paused, to our view it parked itself near two stars creating an even triangle constellation of sorts. these two stars' location are the first pair ne of the orion left shoulder. after this pause the craft gained an altitude in where it now resembled that of a tiny satellite, or the size of the neighboring stars, and like a slow satellite it traveled directly west over west hollywood as it's slow path was just north of the orion constellation. the object was exactly star size as it faded westward gaining altitude, yet still identifiable well past west of hollywood blvd & fairfax. the entire event was about 27 minutes as it was slow and gradual as stated before. i then cell phoned west hollywood sheriff to report the sighting and the officer stated there were no reports of the event. i then contacted the next major airport at burbank which was about 12 miles away. by this hour the airport has stopped it's regular commercial airline service at 10pm that night. i got through to burbank tower security who accepted my story and he then transferred me to the actual tower. a stand by night watch tech took my call. i asked if anyone was watching radar in the south direction of 2:17am. he stated he wasn't watching radar at that time. i described my sighting to him, he sounded interested, but after he claimed he still never had evidence on radar, nor looked, therefore he stated he had to go and hung up on me. this craft had no similarity to the usual police helicopters or commercial aircraft that we see by the dozens daily in the area with our 3 major commercial airports. we do have edwards afb but it's a 2 hours drive north. but this was no stealth plane outline nor was it the dark large air force x-baloon triangle ship. we haven't had lighted blimps in years since goodyear stopped that action, nor could a blimp fly that hight out of sight or hover in place. it was not a large manned drone, as it would have been way too small in dimension, also the guide lights on a drone were not the same. nor could a drone have scaled that altitude for that duration and without one single abrupt zig zag kind movement. our sighting was a big luminous craft, with smooth acceleration, ending in high altitude without a flinch. lots of citizens in la, please respond if there are any other eyewitnesses. sighting was 2:17 -

due to the slow flight, appearance and size, i did not recognize anything about it that i could say it was even near conventional. the object was flying low in the sky, in a valley and below the tree line and surrounding mountains. it was very slow, yet it appeared to me that it was bobbing up and down slightly. it seemed to be flying towards my parked direction while also making its way towards the north. i was excited to see the light object, but was a bit frustrated that my wife was not enthusiastic as i was, almost dismissive that it was just a light. realizing in my wife's impatience and the distracting cars driving on the highway behind me, i decided to drive about 1 mile more to our house so i could watch it from there. when i got to my house , i went inside to grab my ipad and continue to watch it. when i went out, the object was moving closer, but was still slightly obscured by some pine trees. about the same time it started moving out into view, i was trying to manage a camera & my ipad at the same time. as i was-taking  a picture with a flash, the object seemed to phase out. the light object became very dim and although i could still see a dull light downward, i saw what seemed like a row of vertical lights-- 3 dull lights above where the original bright object had just phased out or dulled. as this was happening, clouds were moving in to the area and spotty clouds were around where the object was. after the main light phased out, i watched it for about 2 minutes before i lost track of it.\r\n  i do have video files and more pictures, but am unable to submit as i only have cellular data with spotty connection.\r\n  additionally, although this is an amazing sighting, i had a sighting on 11-11-16 that was far more impressive with lots of pics and
