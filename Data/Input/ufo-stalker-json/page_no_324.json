would have there view obstructed by trees on the horizon. after a while they migrqted back to the larger light where they originated. once all the small lights had returned to the large one it then

local pokémon hotspot. it was a crisp fall night, approximately 8:00pm, and for a night sky, the sky was bright and full of stars with no clouds or precipitation. at approximately 8:20pm we turned and began walking up a street with a slight incline, and my youngest child stopped to catch a pokémon and had lagged behind. i noticed he was no longer with us and i turned around to call to him to catch up, and right behind him were two huge black triangular craft, larger then the houses they were above, flying slowly and approximately 20 feet above the one story houses across the street, approximately twenty feet away. the second craft was flying at the same height as the first craft, immediately behind it. the two craft were black with three unwavering bright white lights at the three corners of the triangles, with a solid bright primary red light in the center of the craft. the craft were completely silent; they were almost on top of us and we never would have known they were there if i did not happen to look behind us. the two craft came from a western direction and were heading east. we observed the craft silently shift direction southeast before disappearing behind trees and we lost visual contact with the craft. we continued walking up the road away from the craft headed north, heading home, for approximately ten seconds, when i looked behind again to where we had sighted the craft. two more triangular craft were flying in the exact same direction in the exact location where the first two craft were sighted, and they turned and headed southeast in exactly the same spot that the other two craft had turned. it was as if we witnessed deja vu; as if we viewed the event again but this time at a slightly different angle, as we were slightly farther away from the craft the second time around. we walked back down to the location where we spotted and observed the first craft, this time from a farther distance away, as the craft were heading away from us, and at this point my eldest son managed to snap two photographs of these second two craft with his phone.\r\n\r\nwe turned east and onto my road, when we looked up into the sky and witnessed a patch of sky with between twenty and thirty balls of light, exact number unable to be determined, that looked like stars, except that they were moving. some of the lights were moving very slowly, almost imperceptibly, but other craft were moving so quick that they would leave a light trail behind them, as they shifted position. the lights were different colors, from red to bluish white to orange to bright white. we walked towards this activity in the sky, however, these lights were high up - like stars - and to the east of our location. our vision would occasionally be obstructed as we walked on our street due to street lamps, but the activity continued unabated as we reached our house. we ran inside and i asked my wife to come out and check out what was happening in the sky. approximately three minutes later, just after 8:30pm, we walked back outside and there was nothing in the sky where we had just observed the lights; not even observable stars.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

same time (unlike an aircraft, whose lights alternate blinking) and it wasn't moving at all. it was hovering at about twice the height of the highway's street lamps. as we got closer and the mist thinned we saw there were about five lights, at first they seemed to be in a row but as we got closer we saw that they were actually circular, as if they were on the edge of a disc. as we passed, i looked back but it was gone. i checked the time (9:25 pm) right after we passed and even though i don't know the exact time before we saw it, i checked the time stamps on some texts i sent and there

was the night of friday, sep 2, 2016. after a long day of work, i retired to my bed and ready to sleep. i also had a lunch meet-up appointment with my buddy on the next day so i went to bed by midnight, which was earlier than my usual friday night sleep time.\r\n\r\nperhaps sometime at 1 or 2 am, i was awake but still in my bed. there was a bright white light emitting from my 4 o'clock (my head is at 12 o'clock position as a reference). the light came from a white ball of light. it was so bright that my eyes were filled with tears and i had to turn my head slightly to the left to avoid it. the light was so white and bright like it was coming from either a high power flood light or the sun. it must be noted that although the washroom light was on during the night and it was in the vicinity of my bed, it was a energy saving light bulb and its colour was yellowish dim.\r\n\r\ni remember that right before i turned my head, there was a tingling sensation in my breathing tube traveling upward between my collar bone to my jaw. it was itching and i remember that i brushed my neck with both hands downward.\r\n\r\ni dont remember seeing any entities or physical contacts during the entire event and i was laid down on my bed the entire time; i also dont remember if my lower body was immobile.\r\n\r\nthe next day, i got up with the sense of a bit restless but didnt give much thought. my friend later noticed that i was behaving a little bit agitated while i was looking for a parking spot at mall. it could be the result of the event or perhaps it was stress related.\r\n\r\nbut our lunch was the last meat i have eaten for the past three months. somehow that encounter changed my diet habit and i dont find red meat and chicken appetizing anymore. my diet has become almost vegetarian. i do eat fish and seafood from time to time, but i know i can also live without them. my weight dropped and i felt more healthy and my brain more active for all these months.\r\n\r\nwhat really blew my mind was a physical evidence that i cannot simply treat this as a dream or human psychological response to stress. this event had left a physical mark on my chest. i found it very similar to the scoop mark left on some of the abductees' bodies. it has been three months since the event and that mark still remains in its original shape and colour. there is no other physical symptoms, pain or itching coming from it. of course, it wasnt there before and no scratch cannot heal in three months.\r\n\r\ni dont sense it was a malevolent encounter and i have not had another one since then, or at least any that i can remember.

during the day. as we were getting closer to the object it was getting larger obviously but it didn't look like a cylinder anymore. at  this point it was starting to look like an airplane because it took more of a triangular shape. now it was huge and no longer looked like an airplane because of its massive size and obvious triangular shape. i start taking snapchat videos and sending them to my friends without saving them. now it's so huge i have absolutely no idea what's going on and all of a sudden it kind've turned a little bit like a plane does and then it went back to it's normal,

did not land or touch ground so it was not a meteor as it maintained its elevation. we have always discussed it in the family and readily admitted the sighting although most people probably don't believe it. my dad died in 1992 but my brother is still living and we mention it every couple years but i never thought to report it until your tv show i watched today. it would be amazing if someone
