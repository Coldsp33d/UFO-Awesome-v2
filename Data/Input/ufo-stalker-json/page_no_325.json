regularly step outside of early mornings to star gaze and did so around 2:20am.  the sky was lightly overcast with high clouds but stars were visible through and between the clouds.   was looking at sky above at stars when movement to south lower to horizon caught my attention. i noticed a craft moving from west to east over downtown blue springs.  it appeared saucer like and only the bottom was clearly visible as it was being illuminated from the city lights below.  the color appeared to be  a dull metallic gray though muted due to the dim light and the craft appeared to be on a bank to the southeast making a larger portion of the bottom visible. the upper craft that was not illuminated was too dark to distinguish any further features.  the craft completed it bank and leveled off and heading away to the southeast at an approximate bearing of 160 degrees.  as the craft leveled off, less of the bottom was visible and the upper portion of the craft became visible though too  dark to distinguish much other than shadow.  the craft overall appeared to be saucer shaped with a thicker midsection tapering off to the edges.  the flight of the craft was smooth and totally silent as it moved away swiftly disappearing from view.  it maintained an estimated altitude of 2,000 -3,000 ft never changing for the duration of the event.  the craft itself i would estimate as 200' in diameter.\r\n\r\nwe live in an area in close proximity to whiteman afb in which i have witnessed the b2 stealth bomber in flight on several occasions.  i would say the flight of this craft was similar to the b2 but the features of the craft itself were different from the b2s i have seen.   most notable differences are the color, the silent flight (as b2s are quite audible when flying away) and there were no lights visible on the craft during the entire event which was quite curious to me.\r\n\r\nwhile watching the craft i tried to debunk what i was witnessing by rationalizing that the craft i was seeing could be a cloud, flock of geese or a know type of aircraft (b2).  as far as the cloud or geese, the craft was moving too fast and the shape did not change as i would expect for either.  as for other aircraft, the lack of noise and lights excludes the craft as being \"normal\" aircraft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ohio. driving on new moorefield rd away from the village, c.J. brown lake to the right, i noticed 2, sort of orange in color, lights. i went past grant rd. then turned around and went back stopping at grant rd and new moorefield rd. i noticed a red blinking light ascending at a high altitude maybe 2000 to 5000 feet. the orange tinted lights on the 2 craft went out and red blinking lights came on and they ascended. seeing 2 more craft, orange lights, i proceeded down grant rd. going up hills and after getting to flat land i noticed that it was a fleet, paired in 2's, separated by a few miles, and all orange lights. i drove grant rd at a high rate of speed. crossing columbus rd maybe 7 miles later, grant turned into redmond rd, the road became 90 degree turns where i lost sight. as i came out of the turns one craft dwarfing a state patrol post just flew over the top of it. it broke away from the straight line of travel going west on st. rt.40 stopping over the parking lot of the silver swan diner at 200 to 300 ft. i pulled under it rolling down the window. it was without motion, silent, stable, no wind, no flame, no car trouble, flood lights in 2's on the belly, and not man made. it was too dark and blinded by the light i could not see the craft. the bottom lights were about the length of a 737 jet. i tried mental communication which did no good for me. pulled my head into the car and told my girlfriend we had a ufo above us. she looked up through the windshield, started crying, screaming, and hitting my arm so i would leave. i drove away and the craft started to follow, looked like it did a mild banking turn at a very low speed, and went towards it original line of travel, south and a small degree west. later that night i returned with 2 male friends. we noticed 2 men in a field with coveralls on and hardhats with lights built into them. they said they were looking for a lost coon dog. maybe 2 or 3 nights later a search light was in the area. the 3 of us spent much of the summer searching the county skies. once we saw a craft descending 400-500 ft away at a low altitude into a crop field in heavy fog. it was a bright light, no sound, coming straight down as to land. the light was maybe 50 to 75 ft in diameter. as this was happening an elderly male drove from the complex to the left of the crop field in a 1966 light blue ford galaxy. the craft,or big bright light, then went straight back up. he asked if we had car trouble, we had beer, said no, and left. facing the property on upper valley pike to the left of the field a farm complex and to the right a small airport and to the left of it the landing strip. many strange things have happened in my life since. recently within an enclosed room a red laser light appeared on the floor to the left of my daughter. within 2 minutes, i hadn't told her about the light, she said how did you do that? she had a red line (light) appear on the right side of her, a space, and small line. this room has both blinds and heavy curtains. i have had to stop my truck, while traveling home around 3 a.M., as a red transparent globe of light passed in front of the vehicle. it was 6\" or 7\" in diameter and i think the year was 1999 or 2000. the globe came from a woods at treetop level and having passed the truck followed the contour of the land,up the curb across grass, at about 6 \" off the ground. it went from red,at ground level orange,yellow,and then vanished. after the sightings in 1974 and in the year of 77 once a month an extremely high pitch amplified noise in my only good ear would put me in pain as i slept. i would clinch my jaws shut because of the pain. after about 8 months of this i would fight to wake my self from my sleep always waking to sweat soaked sheets. my wife who was beside me, also my companion in the 1974 sighting, was untouched. i had no medical problems or disease. around the late 90's this happened about 3 more times, and as an alarm, i would wake.

installer. i was on the roof of utc mall, welding refrigerant lines and finished my task.I smoked a cigarette and happened to look up and saw a falling star. i watched it for a minute as i have many times. as i was watching it,my eye caught sight of another falling star behind it, following the same path.This seemed unusual. i have never seen 2 falling stars in the same place at the same time. i kept watching.Then i caught sight of another one behind the second one. they were all in a lone one behind the other.I began thinking i was seeing meteor showers. as i kept watching,there was a third, fourth,fifth,sixth then another and another. by this time i couldn't believe what i was seeing.I thought where are they coming from.As i watched,the string of lights i looked back to where they were coming from and it appeared they were popping out of a black hole. i keyed in on that spot and pop, another,then pop,another. there were about 12 falling stars all in a straight line falling to earth a what appeared to be a thousand miles an hour.Fast and all were evenly spaced one behind the other.They were in the northwest sky high over the pacific ocean.They were falling at an angle and i was waiting for the lights to burn out like a meteor or falling star.They did not disapear. they slowed and slowed until they changed direction and headed southeast all in a row evenly spaced. when they were falling they were all white. after turning and headed s.E. they were on a path that brought them right at me. the were now on a horizontal path and kept slowing. as they got closer to me i was freaking out. i knew they were duo's and i was feeling anxiety as i kept watching. i couldn't take my eyes off of them. as the first one got closer and closer to me i could see colored lights on them.I ran to the roof access yelling down to a co worker to come up.He never responded. he was supposed to be inside the building welding equipment.I went back to looking at the ufo's.As they got closer within a mile time seemed to slow or stop.This string of ufo's was about a mile or two long. their path seem to come right past me over the parking lot of the mall.The first one had colored lights in a specific pattern and the ship itself was invisible.I could only see the lights.Every ship had different colored lights in a different specific pattern.Every one was different.There were 5 or 6 ships that had passed and they were all silent.I heard nothing. then the ship in the middle was a mother ship,it was huge,it encompassed the entire parking lot at the mall.It was the only one that made noise and it was a frightening deep rumble as if it was the power source for the entire train of ships.As the mother ship approached i ran to the other side of the roof looking over the parapet wall down to where people were as i tried to yell to get their attention to show them i couldn't speak.I don't know why.It was like i was being controlled.I saw people below but i couldn't tell.I then went back to the other side of the roof where the ships were hovering over the parking lot.All of the ships were maybe 1/4 of the parking lot in width but the mother ship seemed to cover the entire parking lot.I could almost reach out and touch it as they were at an altitude of 40 feet off the ground.The lights on all small ships were stationary and there were 4 blue lights slowly rotating on the mother ship and as it passed right in front of me rumbling and slowing seeming to stop time.I was closely watching the 4 blue lights trying to see the ship itself but it was invisible.All 4 blue lights were visible at all times,they did not disapear as they should have when they rotated to the back side.\r\nalso after about the third ship passed me i heard 2 military jets taking off from the aibase behind me and they flew right over all these ufo's.I thought stuff was going to hit the fan,and scared the stink out of me but they just kept going and didn't come back.\r\ni thought the military has got to know this is going on.\r\nafter the mother ship passed there were 5 or 6 small ships brought up the rear,every one with different colored lights and different patterns or shape of the ships and all silent.It seems like there was a time gap. it was about sundown when i first saw them and when it was all done the mall was closed and no one was around.Parking lot was empty.After passing me they were headed southeast maybe 15 miles, then turned east and descended one at a time in the populated area of san diego. near the airport and i believe they landed at the military base. that instantly frightened me that they are involved. seemed like about 2 hours but in real time about 4 hours. that's roughly it but minus a lot of details.I have no proof but someone else had to have seen it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1 Mile","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

watching birds through my binoculars. where i live in florida there are large black birds, probably vultures that fly aloft for long periods of time in the currents. \r\n\r\non this day i noticed one lone bird at a very high altitude and i scanned over with my binoculars to watch him for a bit. as soon as i saw him i also observed five larger objects at an even higher altitude flying in circles similar to the black bird. i was amazed at these and finally noticed they weren’t birds and were at a much, much higher altitude. they were white and faceted, almost diamond shaped, although i have to admit they were too far up to discern anything else about their shape. later on i saw some commercial airliners flying a path that looked to be the same altitude and i could make out their shapes and wings clearly, so i am left to theorize the objects had no appendages.\r\n\r\n\r\ni watched the objects for approximately 6 to 8 minutes as they continues to move in sweeping circles like the birds and also move in a north to south direction.\r\n\r\nin all there were five of the objects, however for of them appears to be linked in pairs as they moved in unison and always stayed the same distance apart. there was nothing discernible connecting them. in addition, and most importantly, and how i am 100% certain they weren’t some type of birds, during one of their movements a couple of them reflected back silver line an aircraft might do when the sun hits it a certain way. \r\n\r\nnear the end of my observation, the objects flight patterns, although still circular in movement, became much tighter. they formed up in a tight formation, the two pairs in line with each other and the fifth fell in line behind both pair and centered. at this time they flew off very quickly or otherwise disappeared to the south or up. they were gone. \r\n\r\nat no time could i get a photo because they were way too high and i could only see them through my binoculars. i have no other witnesses because although i was calling to my wife to come look she was in a part of the house where she couldn’t hear me. i know without any evidence it’s just my word, but i know what i witnessed and was not under the effect of any alcohol or drugs. i am also aware it’s basically impossible to determine size and distance. all i can say is they were very high and looked to be the size of that black bird but they were very high and maintained the altitude the whole time.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

might be. as it got closer we noticed a bright beam of light oriented down and forward. i thought it was a helicopter using a searchlight, but the beam did not shift around. it was slowly moving north along the east side of marsh rd. i pulled over and got out of the car as it arrived near our location. it suddenly made a 90 degree turn to the west right over us.  it pivoted without banking.There was a low cloud cover but the object was just below the clouds. i could clearly see the outline of the craft as it passed directly over us. my wife immediately said it looked like a huge triangle. i agreed. i also noticed unidentifiable markings on the underside. not us (i spent 23 years in the military as an officer) and not any other recognizable language. although it was only a couple hundred feet overhead there was no engine noise....Just a rush of air and a low rumble. it disappeared approximately 5 minutes later as it travelled west and was lost in the cloud cover. my wife and i compared observations and we both agreed on what we saw. we were startled and amazed. the next morning i checked with the lansing capital city airport control tower (a friend of mine had a friend that was an air traffic controller on duty the night before). they said no aircraft of any kind were in the air in that vicinity at that time frame. i also checked w michigan state university (my place of employment) to see if there were any blimps covering any sports events the previous night. there were none within weeks either way from the time of our siting. even though we did not think it looked anything like a blimp, i checked anyway since it moved slowly and quietly and was huge. although i told friends and family, we did not make an official report. now i am retired and recently became
