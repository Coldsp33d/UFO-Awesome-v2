through the window it was night time and i had woods across the street and i saw a long white light headlights back then where a little yellow so it didn't look like car lights from may be on a road past the woods as i kept checking now and then it was getting closer i first thought well it's an airplane didn't give it a second thought would look again and it was getting really close and still very low well i finally walked out of my door down a small hill right to the curb it broke right over head over the trees it was in front of me about two hundred feet or less above me making no sound the lights were now right in front of me and they were light emitting windows not clear windows white light emitting windows with dividers segments and i did not know until this thing was passing over my head going by me that i now saw it was around but it was a mothership maybe for 500 yards around the windows went clear around it it was moving approximately 10 miles an hour my jaw dropped my tongue was hanging out and i actually ran down the hill and down the street following it the street ended in a dead end so i had to stop and this craft headed towards new york city. we checked with the local airports they had no reported sightings then was done talking to a friend of mine on the phone he did not believe me and i started going down the street walking i was heading towards a watering hole, a bar i only got thirty feet down the street and a policeman was patrolling driving by and he stopped i knew all the police in edgemont new york he asked me if i needed a ride i jumped in the car his name was officer rasmussen as soon as i got in the car i said you're not going to believe what i just saw he said don't tell me it was another flying saucer i don't want to make out another report! the next day the local scarsdale inquirer had an article that their police department in scarsdale their phone was ringing off the wall and there was a large good size article in the reporter dispatch of paper i believe that a white plains that described an incident that this was simply a cessna with a broken display sign which of course was not the case at all. 7 years later i went to a ufo convention in brewster new york and told my story. other than that there was nothing in the news i was shocked. there is no question it was a ufo we have nothing in this world that could make a craft like that it was truly a mother ship; the windows as i call them were about maybe 15 feet wide by 20 feet high and they went all around the ship possibly 3 yankee stadium size in 1. unfortunately i was alone when i saw it when i came back inside i told my father who was a pilot private pilot and he called all the powers of the local and reports and they reported nothing i was in shock.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"01:02:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

had no nav lights. since i was driving i didn't get a very good look at it, so over the next 5 days we continued to see this light and it never appeared to be moving or it was moving at a very slow speed. so after my mom got out of the hospital i never thought any more about it. i am a smoker and i don't smoke in my house so on november 29, 2016 right around 7:15 or so i went out on my front porch to smoke and i look out and i see this bright white light object again. i mean this thing was just super bright , so i go back in the house and get my binoculars and look at it and it is very bright white and i know this is not a aircraft and it has like some kind of vapors that show around it, and am i am watching this i see like the center of it open and separate from the bottom for a few seconds and then close back up. i didn't see anything go in or come out of it when it did that. what ever it was moved at a very slow speed and seemed to follow a west heading. i did go back into the house and got my cell phone and took pictures of it and a short video, and the video was a bit shaky so isn't moving it is just my hand. there were also other people who saw this and they were from the recovery home where mom is, the driver of there vehicle were out looking at christmas lights and they noticed it and observed it for a while also. i lost sight of it when the view became blocked by buildings. i know what i saw was a ufo, there are no planes, helicopters or craft that look like that due to how bright it was and there were no navigation lights on it and it had also changed shape from almost round to a saucer shape as you can see in the photos. i had a few more pictures and a short video but no space to attach them   ","distance":"Over One

shark fishing from shore with great success until it suddenly stopped. i noticed what i thought was a very large sailboat, but quickly realised that it was a boat. there were lights on the water line that i initially thought was the deck and mast lights of a sailboat. the lights started to bounce around what i had thought was the deck, but then they shot up into the air. it got incredibly bright and lit up the sky and the beach. it the sated to move slowly towards shore towards us. it after a few minutes shot out a whit artificial light into a beam focused onto the beach like it was scanning around. my friend and i were initially not scared and we're very interested until it kept coming closer and the beam of light was on our feet. my friend jumped in the car and was scared, then he jumped out again and we kept asking each other if we were both seeing this actually happening. as the ufo got close you could see it was a triangle shape with three lights underneath the ufo. the sound it made was the weirdest thing of all because i have never heard that sound ever again. the ship finally was right above us and we could see very clearly the three light and the triangle shape of the ufo. once it got directly over us it seemed to disappear, but not because it shot off. it just disappeared. my friend and i were very shaken up and jumped into the truck and tried to talk about what we just saw. the weird thing was that we both fell asleep in less than five minutes. when we fell asleep it was somewhere close to 1:30am. i woke up at 4am by the sound of the ufo very close to us. i looked out of the window and woke up my friend to show him the ufo was back again. the ufo was maybe 150 yards down the beach from us and was 50 feet or less from the ground going back out to the water where the lights we thought was a sailboat was still out there, but just kind of appeared. my friend and i didn't talk about the experience again for over ten years, but when we did talk about it we remember everything the same.

ontario. the sky was completely cloud-covered. i was admiring the silvery color of the day as i drove along.\r\n\r\n10:20 a.M. is not the exact time but it's close within 5 minutes. i can tell by my shopping receipts what approximate time i seen this disk.\r\n\r\nabout 2 miles away from leon's furniture, i noticed a luminous disk in the sky peeking out of the cloud cover. it was pretty big. it looked like an average night-time moon size that was luminous.\r\n\r\nexcept this was day-time and the disk was luminous and featureless. i have never seen a luminous moon in the day-time. i've seen the moon in the day-time and it has never been luminous. the day-time moon looks kind of faint, white with grey features.\r\n\r\nthis disk looked very close, much closer than the moon but i couldn't judge distances. it looked too big, too luminous and too close.\r\n\r\nso for about 2 minutes, i drove the speed limit of 80 km and watched for this disk to peek out of the clouds. it peeked out a few times.  the road was unusually clear for this time of day. it appeared that the girl in the car behind me was watching this object as well.\r\n\r\nthen, i stopped at the stop lights right by leon's furniture.\r\n\r\nthe disk came out of the cloud-cover and it just so happened that the sun came beaming through this same cloud right behind the disk. even as i viewed this beaming light, i was thinking that this sun was too low in the sky to be the sun and it seemed like the bright light was coming from a much closer place than the sun. shouldn't the sun be higher at 10am?\r\n\r\nthe disk did not turn black like the moon does in an eclipse when it passes in front of the sun. instead, the disk became transparent and the light shined right through it. it was a blindingly bright light. the disk was still visible.\r\n\r\nbecause it was so bright, i had to not look and when the stop light turned green, i squinted to see the road because my eyes had got so blinded momentarily from looking at this disk in the light.\r\n\r\ni turned the car right away into michael's store driveway and didn't notice where the disk went or the bright light went, if they left or not.\r\n\r\ni didn't get scared. i was actually talking to the sky, thunderbirds, and telling it how pretty it was, how nice the grey looked and i had a feeling that they could hear me this time. sometimes, \"they\" don't hear you talking to them. i wasn't surprised when the disk showed up. it was an enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\nthat area on highway 40 where i started to see the little disk is a weird area. i seen endless rainbows about 15 years ago in a row and then a few months ago, i seen a lone cloud being sparky and making lightning all by itself on a sunny day in the same general

to go almost straight up.  as it flew over me i could see three distinct equidistant lights that perfectly formed the shape of a triangle.  it never made a sound and i have 3:49 of video on my iphone

views from there and was looking at the silhouette of the mountains and clouds. sunset was probably 40 minutes earlier and the new moon was nearing the horizon to set over the mountains to the west. \r\ni leaned against the rail, looking south-east. i came from behind the eaves of the porch. a solid white light, bigger than a star, slightly bigger than venus on a good night.  first i thought it was a meteor, and it might well have been. \r\nwhat got my attention though is there was no tail, no change in brightness, no breaking-up or flaring-out. \r\nand it visibly slowed down twice. then it went behind a low cloud and was gone. it appeared to be going about the speed of a meteor/shooting star. but again, slowed down noticeably twice. \r\ni was a watch-stander in the merchant marine for 5 years. i've seen a lot of meteor showers from many oceans, aircraft of all sorts, and it was my job to be an observer. my eyesight is better than most. i've never seen a meteor quite like this.\r\n

still remember it like it happened today. my friend and i were playing in his back yard in the afternoon at approximately 2:00-3:00 pm. it was a sunny day with no clouds. his house/yard was in a small neighborhood on the north side of richmond. his house sat adjacent to a large open grassy field with no trees. across from that field was a large single story factory building. while we were playing in the back yard, i remember looking up suddenly across the field and spotting something moving slowly through the air that clearly wasn't normal. the object never changed speed or trajectory. it just traveled at a slow and steady speed until it was out of our sight. i would estimate the object was traveling at only 10-15 mph. we could see this object very clearly because it was only 100-150 yards from us and flying right above the tree tops. this object was disc shaped with the size and thickness of a medium sized car. it was all black with no shine what so ever, like it was painted with a flat black paint like what you see on a stealth fighter jet or bomber. there were no visible lights, windows, doors, antennas, or any other appendages on the object. i could however see some detailed seams on the body of the object. there also was no sound or emissions coming from the object as it traveled past us and out of view. it was as if it were floating on the air. my friend and i just stood there watching in amazement as it traveled past us. we were both speechless. this clearly was not any balloon, air plane, or any other object that i have ever seen to this day.  it was definitely an \"unidentifiable object\". to my knowledge there were not any other reported sightings of the object that particular day. my friend and i were the only witnesses.
