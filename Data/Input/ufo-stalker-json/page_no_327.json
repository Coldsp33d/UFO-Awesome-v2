overlooking the ocean about 7:00- 7:30 pm and a bright orange light was over the ocean (i was looking northward over ocean). i first thought it was mars and remember thinking wow that is huge and bright tonight, when it suddenly disappeared but the same light, or same kind of light, instantly appeared over the ocean looking south now. so, it moved or reappeared in another spot completely. i then called my 12 year old son outside. he arrived in time to see that orb vanish and reappear yet again, this time straight out in front of us. at that point, the orb split into two orbs then vanished completely. the orbs were visible in each spot for about 3-5 seconds. it was also very foggy that day and evening.\r\ntonight, (12/01/16) i watched the sunset and stayed outside on the same balcony, talking on the phone when the orange orb appeared again in the same spot. this was right after sundown, at 6 pm or shortly thereafter. tonight, it was much brighter and seemed larger, or closer. i again called my son outside, thinking it would be a repeat of last night, it was very similar, they were definitely the same color and suddenly appeared and vanished, however this time it didn't go way across to the other side of the ocean. instead there was one, that vanished, then reappeared closer to where it started and then a second one appeared, then a third, larger one appeared in the center of the sky. we could now see plainly see that the large one was shaped like a 3-sided star- a center point with 3 spoke-like parts like a throwing star, or ninja star- type shape. the ones to the north disappeared and the last one, split into two 3 sided stars and abruptly vanished. my son says he saw it split into 3 stars and i have to say, i feel like it is hard to remember it right. i know i said out loud it split into two again (i was still on the phone with my friend) but when i was writing this, i felt like i had remembered it splitting into 3. which is odd. i can't explain this. so i am saying it split into 2 because i know that is what i said, i do not know why i want to remember it in 3. for the next couple of hours, the orbs randomly appeared and vanished every 20 mins or so until i came inside about 8 and i have gone out a couple more times to smoke a cigarette and have not seen any since. i snapped a couple pictures of the random ones. none of them were as big and bright as the first set we saw tonight. also, the ones we saw tonight- after they vanished, we would see much smaller, white lights around where it vanished, acting the same way (vanishing then reappearing in different spots) until they just stopped. i will include the whole original digital file of the pictures where they are very faint and far and also include what it looks like if you zoom in on it. in the second picture, it appears that it is moving. i do not know if it is camera shake or if it really was moving so fast we couldn't see it with our eyes. also, there was a slow moving ship on the horizon tonight but not last night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":80714,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.683381100000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12012016-0016","longitude":-78.8999742,"occurred":1480615800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South

around the area near my home,also at the cabin in the country. i got a dvr for my scope and started filming these things. also wittnessed a large group of them out in the country, in a v formation,i shinned a green laser on them,they started changing into different shapes, double v,and v,the a t, or a cross,then a circle that collapse on itself and disappeared.Have seen large groups of them several times,moving real high and real fast.All were with thermal except the first time.  at first when i seen them i shinned a green laser on them,they would stop come back and hover around for a while.1 morning when i went out in the woods to go hunting,at 4 am, i notice 1 was following me,it scared me,i stopped shinning laser on them,they took notice of me.  they also could make my thermal scope have static on it,like they could jam it somehow. i could over come it by turning it on and off. i also cause a strange beam of light on 1 of my deer cameras the same day they followed my into the woods. i also got some strange  pictures on my deer cameras, was almost all grayed out,like it was done with a strong magnetic field. but while the picture was a small icon on the computer it was not grayed out,it only became grayed out when you clicked on it to make it larger, there was also a strange beam o light on the pictures,i thought figures below,but not sure.  i know these are not bats or birds. i have seen these things make intellagent moves,and symbols in the sky. it almost like an invasion out here. i can go out any night and see a couple of these thing to dozens of them. i

when we thought the police helicopter was flying over as they often did, so we panicked and started hiding but then i realised there was no noise, then i noticed the orange yellow glow and then noticed it had stopped not far from us, we were at edge of field, ufo was in middle. fast forward it had been silently hovering there a few hours, i was taught ufos weren't real and i'd just left school so never thought about going closer to inspect after, was too scared to go under craft. i did want to run home to grab the video camera but i thought it would be a waste of time and that when i got back it would've gone boy was i wrong, so massive regret still to this day. anyway so we carried on just hanging out and trying to figure out what it was because it sure wasn't a plane or helicopter and living under the flight path of both, i know!!  then later on in the night as you could just see the sky turning from black to dark blue we noticed another ufo to our rights, this one was a vertical cigar shape and was decending vertically silently then stopped and two black things came out the bottom kind of on a slant like landing legs except it was way up in the sky, then they went back inside and it started moving up then stop, then up then stop then i looked away for a minute n it was gone. so i swore i wouldn't miss this main one just infront of us. then again to our left really high up, was a boomerang shaped one it looked like it came in through the atmosphere then behind it two boomerang then behind them three, then behind four then five. but they were visible for seconds, they appeared to come into the atmosphere then straight back out. so then we watched this orange glowing one because now it was getting light but the sun hadn't rose (whitburn is a coastal village) the sky's were clear blue not a cloud in sight, so then this main one slowly started moving, up, back, stop, up back stop then it got about 100ft above the field and this huge random cloud floated infront of it and slowly passed, and when it did pass, the ufo was gone. it didn't fly up over, sideways or under the cloud it just vanished.  then the cloud broke up and no other clouds were about. the next night at my home i was searching the night sky hoping to see it again when i seen something else. i thought it was a star at first, but then it started zig zagging all over the sky then the most amazing thing happened i seen it go to what looked like another star and speed around it so this ufo started getting really bright and the star dimmed until it disappeared then the ufo shot off and disappeard. then i've seen other star like ufos zipping all over the sky. my two friends were in denial and frightened to speak or think of it, but ever since i've watched ancient aliens and your hanger 1 and everything else and will teach my son the truth. of course no one believed me except my dad who said he also seen ufos growing up in whitburn and my aunty was chased by one on the high road, a long dark road leading out of whitburn.  whitburn has beach and oceans at the front and farms and fields at at back, and not much street pollution,  then main towns and cities either side. it's a unique beautiful place in tyneside. my family still live there. unfortunately i haven't seen any ufos in years. well except the ones that came to my flat a few years ago but don't think i should go into detail with that. oh and we did try and record the night on my friends phone but camera phones had just come out and quality wasn't good, plus the phone wouldn't work properly until the main ufo had gone. thanks for listening.X","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"08:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

course two times slightly but went back on course. i watched as it passed right over me and kept going. i kept watching until i could no longer see it for the treeline. very odd, but exciting. i have been interested in the subject of ufos since i was 13 years old and have even had a few investigations of my own during my college years but never thought i would see something like this for myself. i would have given anything to have a bright spotlight or powerful green laser to attract the attention of this object. i highly recommend not doing this because it might turn out to be a man made aircraft and laser pointing can get you into trouble, but personally i would have taken the risk if i had the chance this night.
