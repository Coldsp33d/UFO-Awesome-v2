2 on each wing (1 @ front). the craft was a very dark metal color (charcoal) and triangular/boomerang in shape. i could even see the raised ribbing on the wings. the nose of the craft had a somewhat rounded front. as it flew directly overhead i could see that the rear of the craft was bridged wing to wing approx. a quarter of the way down the wing span. it seemed to me that viewing from inside the craft could also be done looking in the opposite direction of travel as there were viewing panels at the rear.  the craft made absolutely no sound whatsoever as it traveled directly over me and our backyard. i had a very good visual of the craft and had to lean over the deck to see the entire craft due to our covered deck portion on the south end of our home as it flew overhead across the boulevard - over the next row of houses until out of sight. the altitude of the craft was very low (a couple of hundred feet or less). it was larger than a military jet yet resembled the shape of a stealth bomber. my estimate of size is approx 100 feet wing to wing as i was directly underneath the center of it and one wing was over our backyard fence and the other would have reached past the front of our home.  what struck me the most was the silence of the craft and the lights which seemed be electro-magnetic swirling/sparking inside each housing. i did not take my eyes off the craft during the entire time, then went inside and drew a picture of what i had seen.  i continued to search the reports on the net for a very long time and continue to do so even today. and i did find someones graphic that depicts what i had seen almost identically.

in a chair on the front deck, which faces due southeast.  they often sit outside on this deck and watch for eagles, which are fairly common in the area. she had her back to the northwest.  she saw a shiny object that appeared to be to the east above the house at 10249 nightingale st.  it slowly moved in a westward direction and to her left.  at one point it appeared to be above the front yard tree of the next-door neighbor to the ne.  this tree is about 42 feet tall and the object appeared to be about 40 feet above it, or at an altitude of about 80 feet.  this would have been about 100 feet from the witness.  the object never paused in its steady flight until the roof of the witness’ house cut off her view of it.  the object made no sound, had no wings, left no vapor trail.  it was in sight for maybe 3 to 4 minutes.  to the best of her memory, the object was about as wide as 5 thumb widths at arm’s length. the shape of the object was unusual and unfamiliar – see witness sketch.  it could possibly be described as shaped like a double hamburger.  it had three shiny regions and two dull regions.  the husband of the witness was raking leaves in the back yard on the other side of the house and heard and saw nothing.  the witness had a cell phone with built-in camera with her but did not think of taking a picture.  also, she did not think of calling to her husband in the back yard.  the witness states that she is clairvoyant and able to read people’s minds, which she generally avoids doing, but in this case she tried to read the mind of any being in the object and came up with nothing.  just after the object passed out of sight, she had the feeling that it had turned and was moving north.  she also received the impression that the object could “collapse on itself”, that is, it was capable of folding together so that the shiny regions would hide the dull regions.  then it would have been an oval shape.","distance":"21-100

noticed a bright redish orange hue in the sky. i sky watch on a regular basis & the location of this object was nothing i'd seen before. at first i thought it was the planet mars, given it's color, i checked my app to see if it was indeed mars or a star. the app showed mars had already set behind me relative to where i observed this object. i immediately contacted the local mufon number on the website & left a message. i originally reported the object in the southwest sky on the message i left, it was actually in the northeast sky. i observed it for about 3 minutes, in that 3 minutes, it began to get noticeably get brighter, but, no movement. i was in a state of disbelief & \"this isn't real\" kept going through my mind. realizing what it might be, i went into my apartment to grab the binoculars, when i came back out, it was gone (unknown direction of travel). i went back & timed how long it took me to walk inside, grab the binoculars & return back outside, that time lapse was around 35 seconds. it was nowhere to be found. i texted my brother & informed him of what i saw. the only other thing i noticed was normal air traffic coming from the east, turning south to land at john wayne airport, this was after i went inside to grab the binoculars.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":80661,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.769568577425794,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11292016-0004","longitude":-117.87621028158298,"occurred":1480373700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1480387784000,"summary":"A

very frightening for me i never thought of seeing a big tall white alien looking man, well the night before that on november 26 there was a party i went to and i didn't have a ride to go home to so i decided to go home walking approximately 5 miles i started walking home but when i was like half a mile away i started hear some dogs like if they were fighting or killing another dog but in my head i didn't think nothing else i just thought they were fighting a fat or something but when i walked like another 120 feet the dog stopped barking for like 20 seconds so i kept on walking and the dogs started bark super loud again like if they were gonna die or something that's when i turn around to my left and i got really scared what i saw , i saw a big white tall man more than 6ft tall and it was running threw my left really fast with long legs it didn't seem to see me but when i first saw it i thought it was a ghost or something but ghosts are that big and ghosts aren't that white so i knew it was made of skin cuz i could see it well the big tall man seemed to be running away but idk from what maybe the dogs cuz they were barking after that i didn't want to find out what it was my phone was dead i couldn't take pictures and i was sooo scared i just ran away as far as i could and i was turning back and forward making sure it wasn't following me all i could hear was the dog barks getting more and more agresive as if the being wanted to like touch them or something after that i went home and i couldn't sleep after what i saw then i was outside looking at the stars and i saw an white obejct it couldn't have been a plane because it only had one light and also it moved straight and then to the sides so ik from that kovement i just witnessed a real life ufo & the next day i investigated what could it have being and all i found was the tall whites and now here i am telling u what i saw hopefully someone goes out here and investigate in the nights .","distance":"20 Feet or
