because of how abnormal the light looked. planes were flying around the sky at the time due to liverpool airport being close but this object was far bigger then any of the planes in the sky. the light was im the sky for approx 4 mins and did change shape until it eventually vanished. on a personal level i would just say i was intrigued to find out what the light was because of how abnormal i was acting.","distance":"Over One

was seven at the time (25 years passed)and laying in my bed wide awake. i could hear a strong oscillating \"thumming\" noise coming from outside. i sat up in bed to hear more acutely. the thumming was moving from the west direction, which was the bay side of the waterfront property we lived on. there was dense vegetation surrounding the west and east sides of the house so this noise confused me. i was tucked into bed as it was well passed my bedtime. the aluminum blinds were down but light was always easily cast through them, so i can safely say this was not a car or helicopter of any sort. i could hear the thumming at a distance, and it sounded like it was coming up the path we carved down to the lake. it moved from the western side of the house and came around the contours of the house, stopping outside of my second story bedroom window, which was on the northern face of the house. the noise was accompanied by a brilliant green light that began to fill my room with the same intensity as the sound. it wasn't just a light, it illuminated everything, like a radioactive green. i felt compelled to leave my bed and go to the window but i fought this compulsion and pulled the blankets up to my eyes. i watched and listened for 5 minutes expecting something to happen. i became afraid after some time because the object wasn't moving, so i pulled the blankets over my head but i could still see the bright green through the cloth. it felt like they could only take me if i willingly came to the window. every fiber of my being was fighting the urge to look. i knew it was an alien craft and was confused why my parents or brothers were not waking up to the loud sound outside of our house. with the same pulsing thumming, the craft went straight up and i could hear its ascension and the slow fade of the oscillating thumm. the bright residue of light remained in my room until it began to fade away very very slowly. it was about another 5 minutes until my room had returned to darkness. the next morning i was eating breakfast and coloring and told my mother about what had happened. part of my wanted to keep it a secret but i had said \"aliens came to my window last night to visit me, but i didn't want to go away from my family so i stayed\". my mother was shocked and all she said was \"oh that's cute dear, that et came to play\" she laughed the story off and went about getting ready for her day of teaching. my story was always looked at like a dream or a tall tale.  i would like to conclude, as it may help, that i am the only daughter, and also the only member of my family who can claim psychic encounters or spiritual visitations. i can also claim losing a stillbirth, but during a time period when my partner and i were experiencing a long distance relationship. it is quite common for me to see lights moving in odd patterns in the night sky.","distance":"20 Feet or

fields either side. not sure what made me look to the west- it was a very reflective object,so perhaps it just caught my eye.There's a gliding club in the village not far from there,so i did wonder if it was a glider but i couldn't see any wings...I was walking at a brisk pace and it was like the object was travelling alongside me but at some distance.I tried to take some pictures whilst it was still to the west of me but thought i had only taken pictures of the sky...Tried to record it as well...And then i just couldn't spot it anymore- it had been difficult to relocate the object once i lost sight of it trying to take a photo etc. at some point during this time a helicopter passed- but the object was much higher than the helicopter.The object reappeared more or less directly above me, still on mitchery lane, around 7/8 minutes later (when i took a better picture)...It was like it was hovering at this point and then once again it just disappeared (as in, it was like it turned invisible rather than 'took off'; at least i didn't see it take off).I passed a man and woman walking their dog not long after but didn't inquire as to whether they'd seen it...I think you would have had to have been looking hard to have noticed it though, just because it was so small/far away- that said, i felt like it was watching me throughout the sighting. i wouldn't say i was scared though, just very curious.\r\n\r\ni've always wanted to see a ufo, and for this reason i think i just convinced myself at the time that it was wishful thinking and that the object was probably something identifiable. when i got home i thought i saw that i had only taken pictures of the sky- i knew that i hadn't  been able to see the object well on the phone screen- it was like i'd just been aiming randomly,so i forgot about the event almost immediately, until a week later (today) when i started thinking about it when out on the same walk; i also saw a ufo documentary that showed me something that reminded me of what i'd seen. i had another look at my pictures and to my surprise i realized i had actually captured the object three times...Very tiny and very close to the frame in each shot...It's an old samsung phone,so not the best camera,but when i zoomed in on the object- in one of the photos, it looked bulbous at the ends...Like two white balls stuck together side by side and elongated slightly...It looked shadowed underneath in the zoom too.The other two pics are less pronounced, but the object still looks a bit bulbous at the ends when you zoom in. definitely not a

for several minutes as it slowly moved down edison street in falconbridge towards the highway and it stayed very low above houses and eventually became stationary over the woods off the road. i watched for about ten minutes total but had to continue trick or treating as my kids  were getting restless and my wife a little nervous.
