the sky an object which looked like a star. it was about 12:20pm when i first saw it. it flew in from the east to the west, towards the area of marina del rey or santa monica, and was north of my position about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon. it flew in a very straight line, slowly, then suddenly stopped. it sat there, hovering, for nearly a minute it seems, and the began to fly what seemed like straight up, gaining altitude. then, suddenly, it seemed to change direction and made what seemed to be a right angle turn and began heading east again. it flew in that direction for a little bit, maybe twenty seconds, then suddenly made another right angle turn and began to look like it was descending, losing altitude. then again it stopped. it hovered there for about a minute again, roughly about nne of me, in the direction of hollywood. then suddenly it took off, no acceleration, just immediate speed, towards the ne, it what seemed to be an acending direction towards, i guess, the valley and disappeared. that event lasted very short, maybe only 3 or 4 seconds at most.\r\n\r\ni would like to say that this is the third time in the last 6 or so months i have seen the

my girlfriend and i were being escorted on a sightseeing drive with friends. my girlfriend was taking random pictures of homes in the area and i asked to see some of her photos. ironically, i had watched a documentary on the phoenix lights a month or two before after stumbling upon it on netflix. it seemed suitable prior to my first visit to arizona lol. after glancing through some of my girl's photos i noticed a peculiar thing in one. in the picture, taken at approximately 4pm, is two houses with a clear blue sky in the background. above the house on the left is six white spots in a slight vee pattern in the sky. after seeing the photo we looked around the inside of the vehicle to see if something could have cause a glare on the window and have simulated that in the pic and found nothing. i asked my girlfriend if she had ever heard of the phoenix lights before and she said she hadn't. my friend, who was familiar with the lights (not firsthand) and had friends that had seen other similar phenomena, looked at the photo and was immediately intrigued. after showing my girlfriend a photo of the phoenix lights sighting (found on google) and comparing it to the on she took we noticed similarities. we have no idea what is in the picture, but it is quite obviously something. i have examined this photo many times an am no further ahead in explaining it.\r\n\r\ni should have sent this to you sooner, but i wasn't aware of your organization and only found out from a friend while telling this story. i was hoping you could offer some insight and explanation to what's in this photo. unfortunately, my girlfriend never never noticed the objects when taking the picture and so only took the one pic. \r\n\r\nalthough this report is made after the fact, the date and approximate time of the event have been determined based on the image file's date and time stamp. the photo was taken on a samsung g3 cell phone with no filter. nothing has been done to alter the image and you are more than welcome to thoroughly inspect it. it is just as i received it and originally viewed it. i regret that our geo-tagging feature was disabled because we had our phones switched to 'airplane mode' to avoid accidental roaming charges. i have no way of telling you the exact location the photo was taken other than it was the fountain hills/phoenix area. i hope you can keep us in touch with your findings. if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me. i ask that, if used, credit be given to the owner of this image, thanks

on our way back to mariposa from a trip to fresno. coming from oakhurst ca, theres a simi long bridge you cross then head towards mariposa. as we were coming down this road (hwy 49), we noticed a very bright area just off to our left. we started to wonder if a fire had started again where the stump field fire had burned through. as we got closer, just before the bridge, we could see a very bright “light” in the sky. i was driving and after crossing the bridge i decided to pull over and observe the object in the sky. i placed the vehicle in park, shut off the engine and we watched. we had the windows down and could clearly see the object. it was a very big, round, bright orange sphere that just seemed to hover in mid air. we could see a trail of “smoke” or “steam” but whatever it was was white. as the craft moved closer to us we could see perfect smoke rings each time it would move and i recall 3 smoke rings indicating to me that it had moved closer to us 3 times. i remember very clearly looking out a very big window or a computer screen. this screen was over 50’ long and what seemed to be 50’ tall. i could see where we parked, what was around the vehicle and even inside although it was dark inside. i remember watching the craft for what seemed to be an hour and while it moved closer to us it never got close. at the very end of the sighting, the craft spit out another o or smoke ring, moved forward a bit and then went straight upand was out of sight within 3 seconds. as far as we could see it went straight up into space as it did not move nor did it change course. we waited there for a few minutes to see if it would return or if anything else would do the same but nothing else showed. i started the vehicle, put it in gear and tried to turn on the lights but the lights would not work. i was able to drive home with my brights on. we took the vehicle to the dealership to be checked out and they said the circuit or circuit board had been fried and needed to be replaced. i have never seen anything like that before nor have i seen anything similar since. at the time my wife and her mother witnessed the whole event and we still talk about it to this day. we don’t know what we seen but we know we seen something! i never reported it to anyone or any authorities because most people write you off as insane or making up stuff but i am hopeful that telling my story here will help others come forward and hopefully we can figure out just what it was we seen.

Kilbride","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was walking up my street to my house with my then pregnant ex girlfriend coming back from the shops, it was about 10pm, then we noticed multiple bright white lights (about 16 of them) dancing and shimmering and moving about the sky. it was really weird and at first it reminded me of something i'd seen when i was younger, when i was about 10 a nightclub was opening near where i lived and for their opening night they pointed a strong strobe light at the sky which gave the impression of some sort of craft spinning in the sky. that event was even in the local newspapers at the time saying many locals had been shocked and confused as the lights from the new nightclub's opening night were mistaken for a ufo. i then thought it was maybe someone pointing something out their window, some sort of toy or something but the longer we stared at it dumbfounded the more it was becoming apparent that what we were seeing was not of this world or known to science. it appeared to be intelligently controlled but more than that it appeared to be independent, more like an energy than a craft. it was so bizarre yet it was one of the most beautiful and amazing things i have ever seen.\r\nthere were about 16 small lights all moving about, jostling, dancing and as daft as this sounds there was something mischievous about the way they moved about. they would be waltzing about each other then one would shoot out then move back in to the main cluster. the biggest difference between what i seen when i was younger and this was the human made light machine all the lights moved in sync but these things we seen all moved about independently. \r\nas we walked up my street the lights which were probably about no more than 30 metres above the ground moved away from us down the street. it could have been coincidence and the lights could have been going that way anyway but as we moved towards them they moved away from us. we got to my door and the lights had moved to beyond the bottom of my street and were above a clearing of trees. we stood at my door and were treated to a beautiful display of these lights dancing and shimmering in the night sky. my girlfriend agreed that it was amazing and beautiful and she also had no idea what it was though she was a little frightened by it, i think probably just the unknown aspect of it. i felt the opposite, i felt that it was benevolent and it made me feel at ease.\r\nafter watching it for about 10 minutes the lights started to disappear one and two at a time, when there was about 10 left a much bigger white light just appeared out of the blue and the smaller lights started to go into the bigger one. it got down to about 4 or 5 small lights left dancing about for another few minutes then they went into the bigger light and the bigger one over the space of about a minute got bigger and brighter then just disappeared. just like that it was gone.\r\nmy girlfriend and i couldn't believe what we had seen, we went into my house and spoke about it all night while i stayed glued to the window hoping to catch another glimpse.\r\nwe just couldn't work out what it was but both agreed it was intelligent and probably an energy but maybe a craft of some sort. we didn't think it could be man made therefore wouldn't be secret military technology. \r\ni believed in ufos beforehand but this experience definitely cemented my belief, there is no doubt in my mind now that extraterrestrial and/or inter dimensional intelligences are visiting this planet. it kind of frustrated me at 1st because i always thought that if i ever seen a ufo it would be a nuts and bolts craft but as this was lights its much harder for me to comprehend what it was. though now i am just grateful to have witnessed it.\r\ni'm glad my ex girlfriend was there as i would probably doubt myself and explain it away if it was just me who seen it.\r\ni think it is worth mentioning that this happened just above and near a wind farm and was about 30 minutes away from a nuclear power station. i don't know how relevant that is but i think its worth mentioning. also less than 2 weeks later though i think it could have been under a week later the british army conducted military training excercises off the west coast of scotland, very close to where i live and where this happened. i don't think there's any significance in this as i think the drills had been planned long before this date.\r\nthe full event lasted about 15 minutes. it is mine and my ex girlfriends 1st and only sighting. we shared a phone at the time and had left it in the house we didn't get any pictures. obviously i prefer people to believe me but if they don't then that's up to them. \r\ni have seen 2 videos of similar ufos online but different in the fact that the ones i seen all moved about whereas the ones online are all static and flashing on and off etc.\r\nit was the most beautiful and amazing thing i've ever seen.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

woke up i some of my belongings were knocked down). i ignored the vibration and went to sleep when i suddenly felt my body shake very hard and tense up, i was paralyzed and couldn’t move. what i remember is me trying to move my body and to turn the ceiling lights on because i was very afraid of something but it was if my body was tied down by gravity. what i believe i saw were some humanoid(what we know as greys) and or reptilian being that we’re surrounding me doing who knows what. it was as if i was conscious of what was going on but my eye sight was very cloudy. i felt my body shake again and become very tight and all of a sudden i could move my body and wake up. what i remember is hearing my truck and neighbors cars alarms going off and my body was very soar. i have

very bright light. being a stargazer and extremely familiar with aerospace vehicles, i knew this was not anything the general public knows about. confirmed this as it did not move for over 40 mins. ended with it dimming to almost nothing or all off back to extreme brightness. was mostly yellow the whole time except for when it became active. after being stationary for so long it began to blink off for 10-20 seconds and reappearing elsewhere in same area of sky. it did this about 3-5 times before it disappeared. took on red color during its maneuvers.\r\n\r\n\r\nat the end of the day its either human technology \"we\" dont know about or extraterrestrial. either way awesome sight. so fortunate this is my second witnessing of this in same spot with 2 other people. also have a third
