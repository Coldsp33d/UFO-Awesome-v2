from landing a very bright light was observed off our aircraft left side slightly behind and above a straight line of view out the window. our altitude was approximately 36000 feet with a speed of 500mph.My first impression was that the light was on our wing but i realized that the wing is not visible from our seats (737). the next thought was of venus in the early night sky but at 4 to 5 times the size and brightness as i have ever seen it. a few moments later the wife said it was moving and now below our aircraft. i leaned over and sure enough it had dropped a good distance to the point where it appeared similar to the regular brightness of venus. again, within a short time my wife informed me that it moved. leaning over again to look out the window it was now located slightly above and forward of our seat and probably off the pilots cockpit window. a few moments later the pilot calls on the cabin intercom to prepare for a steep decent and to prepare for landing as per pending turbulence. this sent the flight attendants into a hectic prep mode. the wife then suggests we take a photo and we did. its not a bad shot considering its dark and your shooting through double layers of aircraft windows.We started decent at a pretty steep angle as to what i normaly experience when flying. i at this point continued to lean over and observe the object for the next minute and a half. the object appeared to stop and maintain its altitude while we continued decent. because of this the object became smaller. finally, we flew through a thin layer of broken clouds which ultimately covered up the object which at the last moments again appeared like a very bright venus. our flight was a five hour trip and i     intended to ask the capt. if he planned to report the incident but

(note: at the time of the incident, i had not thought about the fact that it was very breezy that day, and that if the object was a balloon, it certainly would not have been so still. this time i did not take my eyes off of the object–not even to blink. i noticed it reflected light, was quite shiny, and had some reflections of pale blue, pink, and light purple. as i kept my eyes on it, the object shrunk in size or disintegrated and disappeared. for a while i told myself it was one or two balloons that i must had seen, but knew that it was not possible for balloons to sit still in the wind, so i decided to finally make this report because the incident has been nagging me.","distance":"Over One

village cornwall. i have done this many times i walk with the hurlers on my right an siblyback lake on my left\r\nheading  nw. it is an old mining area of bodmin moor with sink/pot holes.\r\nit started to rain so i wanted to get out of the wind i new of a near by ravine when i got to the top it was only about 30ft deep with steep slopping sides with long grass hiding sharp boulders. i noticed a semi-circle oblong greyish object which i thought it to be some kind of feeding area for the local wild horses it looked just like a pigshed. i walked down but as i got closer about 20ft away i noticed that it was not touching the floor there was no markings or windows riveting or weld marks.\r\nwhen i moved closer there came a loud buzzing noise which hurt my ears. i started to panic turned and  i climbed out at a different spot cutting my hands and bruising my knees as i climbed straight thru a black berry nettle bush. i turned to take a look at it but it was gone! but the grass beneath it was totally dry. back on the path i scanned the sky but nothing \r\nthen i caught site of it north of me about half a mile away on the horizon.\r\nmy ears had popped and i had a bad head ache then things got very weird \r\non the horizon right where the object had been seconds ago there was a chinoock helicopter but it had the tailgate down and was flying backwards\r\ni stood there watching for a few minutes i remembered i had by binoculars \r\nin my rucksack  they are x30 with x100 zoom i could see very clear there were soldiers on the ground and one standing in the open back door of the chopper there was no numbers or badges on the chopper but i could see it was a new model with a long aerial sticking out of the nose. for 15-20mins\r\ni watched then there was a very loud rota engine noise i stopped looking thru the binoculars there in front of me there was a lynx type helicopter fly towards me, standing on the path/public right of way i thought i was ok as the chopper came closer i stood my ground thinking it would pass overhead but instead it stopped just front of me the suddenly put its nose down so the rota blades were pointed towards me in a very aggressive way i started to walk backwards it followed me so i walked as fast as i can to the car park area \r\nnear the hurler stones and drove off. i was shocked and angry i live near plymouth which has a large navel/royal marine presence so i'm used to seeing helicopters but never on bodmin moor everyone knows the m.O.D uses\r\ndartmoor. i was troubled by these events i thought i might be in some kind of trouble so i told no one. however the car i was driving belonged to a friend a few days after the event he said strange and weird things were happening like waking up with his car being broken into, even weirder coming home with all the clocks/tv// dvd and hi fi needing re-setting as if there had been a power cut at only his house not any of his neighbours.\r\nhe is a self employed builder he told me very recently that his laptop files have been viewed at a time when he was at work and that all his archive's files of finished work had just gone? also been receiving junk mail about hiking/camping magazines people calling at strange hours  for a survey of lifestyle and interest when he watched them leave they didn't knock on any other doors. they got into a car when the started it up he said blue police style lights flashed once behind the grill?\r\ni will never tell him of my experience i am worried for him i am hopping it will all die down.   \r\n i never believed in anything like this before i haven't been back to the hurlers just in case i'm recognised.\r\n\r\n   ","distance":"21-100
