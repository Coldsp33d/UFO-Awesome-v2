alone at my place, feet up, at my outdoor farm table, sipping a ginger ale. i live in the mtns, a forested rural area. i suddenly saw a rectangular bright light with distinct crips edges illuminate (8 inches by 36 inches) 8 feet from me. it was very very bright, it sparkled in the middle of the light. it was where i had potted plants, and the leaves seemed to become transparent where this light was.It was very bright. i looked around for the source of this light. i live in the middle of a forest. i can see for hundreds of feet around me. i got up and waved my hand near it to see if i could cast a shadow and find the source. it disappeared in a instant. the odd thing was that it did not illuminate the surrounding area being as bright as it was.  i sat down wondering what i just witnessed, walked around a little bit looking into the woods. sat down after three minutes in the same place at my outdoor farm table. withing a minute, at the foot of the farm table, 8 feet up i saw a round illuminated area, somewhat like illuminated fog, but no light source. within a minute it was a dense illuminated orb 4 feet round. i could not see through it, nor did it cast a shadow.I was strangely calm, and sat observing it. about 45 minuted later a plant about 10 feet way, to my right illuminated, as if there was light on it, but there was no shadows! this was about 5 feet above the site of the rectangular bright light. i walked up to it and studied it, no shadows but i could see everything illuminated. this faded away and i sat back down to view the huge 4 foot illuminated orb. i could see through the parameter of it, but not through the center area. i rubbed my eyes, i stood up and walked around it, then sat down again just studying it and my surroundings. i decided to shine my flashlight onto it and it did not reflect the flashlight light beam. i then decided to drive to my brothers place up the street and bring him back to see this \"orb\".  within 3 minutes we were back, and it was still there, but not as bright.  we both sat and looked at it for 5 minutes. my brother took my flashlight and walked around it and looked for a possible source.  he also shined the flashlight into it, no reflection.  it started to grow dimmer as it did this it pulsated. eventually it faded away and we could not see it. the whole event took approx. 45 minutes.  my brother is a professor, and a skeptic, but he admitted we saw something very unique.","distance":"20 Feet or

planes. i watched it for 30 mins. it hovered in the same spot and didn't move for that entire time. after 30 mins i saw two shooting stars fly over top of the object and then it began flying sideways really quickly and then switched and flew to the other side really quickly. after those quick movements side to side, it went back to hovering in the same place again. after it hovered for a few more minutes, it started to appear as if it were flying closer to me, and that's when i began trying to take videos of it. after a few minutes of trying to record it, it seemed to hover down much lower and then started flying away from me towards the ocean. \r\n\r\nat this point, my neighbor michael was pulling into his driveway, and i ran over to his car and asked him to come check out this object i had been watching so that i could get someone else to be a witness with me! we watched it for another 45 mins or so. we watched if fly low, and then get much higher. we watched it fly slowly to different spots in the sky and then hover for a while. we decided to walk over to the beach to try and get a closer look if possible. when we got to the sand of the beach, we were able to stand almost directly underneath it. it was much higher than airplanes. we could see airplanes fly underneath it. and the airplanes looked like tiny specks compared to the ufo. we were able to faintly see the shape of a ship. you could see the nose of ship was white. and then there were many blue and red lights going down the side of the ship, and they were blinking in a pattern. while we watched it from the beach, it mainly hovered in the same location, flying back and forth just a small distance in one general area. \r\n\r\nat one point we met another lady on the beach who was walking her dog, and we pointed the object out to her. she is a flight attendant on american airlines and she was completely fascinated by this object as well, and confirmed that it was absolutely not a plane, helicopter, drone, etc. it was so high in the sky, way higher than any planes, yet it's size was massive in comparison. \r\n\r\nwhen we left to beach to walk back home it finally started to move again. it almost seemed to be following us! when i got home, it hovered straight across from my apartment for another 30 mins. i finally stopped watching it as i needed to get ready for an event i was going to that evening, but after about 30 mins i walked over to my window to see if it was still there and it was finally gone, or at least moved to an area where it was no longer visible to me.\r\n\r\nin one of the videos i am attaching, you can see a plane on a flight path below the object and it flys straight like a normal airplane would. and you can see the blinking object flying fairly low (just above the airplanes flight path) and then it seems to start flying straight up and goes much higher pretty quickly.

was hunting at my property in ws.  i stayed in my trailer and came in to camp at about 1730 each night.  the first was a very bright white light covered craft.  it was at about 500 ft up and moving from south to north.  i noticed it at about 3qtrs. of a mile away.  in front of my friends house,it stopped  and i started listening for the sound of a helo.  it was very quite.  when i first noticed it i thought it was the dnr or cops.  after it stopped,  i knew it wasn't.  i ran into the trailer and got my flashlight and cell phone, went back outside and pointed the light and started flashing.  after about ten flashes, the very bright lights went out and a small, weak yellow light came on at the leading edge of some kind of craft.  it wasn't a plane or a helo.  it turned about 10 degrees and came straght at me.  it was still at the same alt.   it was across the marsh , to mthe south and it hovered.  i flashed the light at it and an array of small white lights formed a curve, like a frown on what appeared to be the front edge of the craft.  i couldn't make out the full shape but did see a downward curving leading edge and a rectangular glow above the curve.  no other lights were seen relation to that craft.\r\n    i hit speed dial and called cl who was going to az.  i was telling him what i saw and looked to my right and saw another small, yellow light at about the same alt as the first craft   the 2nd craft was about 350 to 400 yards from me and  was on the other side of the road, above the trees. c said to take a lot of pix and we said i should ge closser to the marsh, to my south.  i turned tword the craft to the wast and flashed it.  i lit up it\"s frown curve and i headed south.  when i was bout 20 yds. rrom the marsh, the object i was walking tword wene black and turned on 2 very bright, red lights one on each side.  it started to drift downward and i watched  it through the trees untill it was below what i could see.  it appeared to land. and i did 180 and ran to the trailer.  i was trying to tell cl about it but i was very shook. he had to get off the phone so  i just watched the 2nd craft and flashed at and took a short video of it.  i \"played with it for while and turned to watch the 1st craft as it came back to about 500 ft. and hover.  it was now about   1930 and i had not had lunch.  i went inside and had a meal..Duriing my rest time i made some calls to friends in tn and mn and told the situation.  i helped calm me down and fired them up.\r\n     cl called later and ask if i still could see the 2 craft.  i stepped out on the porch with the phone and looked south i said tha they weren't there butas i looked east. i sawthem and i flashed.  they both \"frowned\" and i told cl,  they're back...I flashed them a few times and noticed another one to the northeast.  it looked the same in all ways but the light presentation was different.  it had many more lights on and made a left turn by turning to the right and descending i went behind the trees to the east and moved right to left.  i got the  feeling that this could go bad so i went in the trailer and phoned several numbers to try to calm down.  i tried 911  but no one answered.  i finally got ufo hotline at midnight but he said i wasw watching alterra sp.  we said our cheery goodby's and i went to bed.  i am going to send this much and start another later.  my server keeps going out and this is the 4th time i've done this.. i have more posted on my facebook page.  i will send the drawings later.  oh yes, i did not sleep well for the next week.  i was

fillmore on oct. 18, 2016. we stopped to take some photos of the sunset. \r\n\r\nneither of us is sure whether we noticed the glowing object at the time. i recall that on our way home, he mentioned that he had seen a light in the distance, which he assumed to be a parked car. his photo does include some car lights on a distant highway, but it's unlikely they would have appeared stationary or that he would have remarked on them. \r\n\r\nwhen i noticed the object in my photos, i found it curious and joked that i had photographed a ufo, but i assumed it had a mundane explanation. several days later, my son showed me his own photo of the object. when he zoomed in, we saw what appear to be distinct lights on its surface. \r\n\r\nwhen i zoomed in on my own shots, i could see the lights, but less clearly.\r\n\r\nmy son and i took our photos with our smartphones -- identical samsung s6 galaxy models. i searched online for similar images, but when i failed to find a convincing explanation, i decided to send these shots to mufon for evaluation.\r\n\r\ni have labeled my photos no. 1 and no. 2. my son's photo is no. 3, and a zoomed-in version of that image, revealing the lights, is no. 4.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":80555,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.4034139,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11212016-0010","longitude":-118.910754,"occurred":1476748800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1479750347000,"summary":"Glowing

bright light in the sky.  it was after sunset and dark and the light was very bright and not a from a star, don't know how long the light was there before we noticed it.  the object stayed at this location for the entire duration.  using binoculars the lights changed from horizontal approx 1\" in width to horizontal approx 1\" in length, this happened 5 times and a couple of times the light just went to a small round light then changed to either a horizontal or vertical light. the light was exceptionally bright like an led bright light and it did not change from white light to any other color nor did it pulsate just kept the same brightness.\r\n\r\nboth my adult kids also saw the light and saw the same things and we watched for over an hour and 10 minutes and we left and came back about an hour later and the light was gone. there were no stars seen in this area after the light was gone. there were a few commercial airplanes headed to san jose international airport in the area as this is the normal flight path.  before and after the sighting i have not seen any lights in this area.\r\n\r\nwe has a discussion about what the light was and did agree that it was not a plane (no blinking light and didn't not move), it was not a star or helicopter and there was no sound from where were (again no blinking light and didn't move) we also didn't see and aircraft leave from moffett field, not even sure if there is any military aircraft there anymore. we regarding the bright light as not being man-made and possibly a ufo.\r\n\r\nlastly the bright light was over the hills and the only thing near this bright light and approx 2-3 miles was an old military radar station mount umunhum which closed in 1980.","distance":"Over One
