object. almost like 2 black rectangles flying horizontally with a slight distance between them. i then thought this might be a drone but it was getting darker about 4:40 ish and i could not see any lights on this thing. then above, way above this black object i saw a plane with its lights on flying near cloud height and this object appeared to speed away in its direction very fast and i almost lost sight of it. at this point i knew this was not a drone and was not an aircraft by the lack of lights. the black rectangle stopped flying in the direction of the plane and seemed to resume its path it was taking. this object seemed to head in the same direction as the freeway, and not always staying in a straight line, either that or the freeway veered more and i was not staying in a straight line. \r\nafter about 18 minutes the freeway i was on turned to going more north than northeast and the black rectangle object was still heading east. at this point it appeared to rotate sideways and looked more like a big black rectangle. i was about to loose sight of this and decided to try and get a photo. i pulled off 3 photos. 2 of which were a little distorted by tree limbs.

at the clear nighttime sky.  i noticed what appeared to be a bright star in the northern sky.  as i watched this \"star\" i noticed that it appeared to be moving slowly.  as i kept my gaze fixed on the \"star\" i could see that it was moving directly toward me.  it grew larger as it moved.  i had the distinct feeling that this object was aware of my presence and was deliberately moving directly toward me.  it continued to grow in size until it appeared as the size of a full moon.  then it stopped, as if it were studying my presence.  it was completely round and white; just as if i were looking at the moon.  it remained stationary for what seemed like minutes, but was probably just a few seconds.  then it rapidly moved at a right angle.  it traveled faster than light and was completely out of sight within a fraction of a second, perhaps 1000th of a second.  at that period of time, ufo sightings were considered figments of the imagination.  i knew if i reported it, that i would be ridiculed.  i told only my wife and a few close friends about it.  the next day i listened to the radio and they did announce that a police officer saw a light in the sky the previous night.

lot of images with my nikon professional camera of the city and its cathedrals dotting the skyline.  as i always do, once i returned home, i cleaned up some of my images using photoshop.  i had already cleaned up a lot of my photos(i sometimes get a dark spot or two on my images), but only last week (11-18-2016) did i notice a foggy section on one of my untouched images.  i hadn't noticed it before because i am usually more focused on the subjects of my images rather than on blue skies or cloud formations.\r\n\r\n  i was about to clean up and crop more of my images (that needed cleaning up) when i noticed a disc-shaped objet on the upper left corner of one of those images.  as i zoomed in closer, it was clear that i had captured something unusual; a disc shaped, cloud-like object with vey clear outlines.  i was completely surprised.  i wondered if i had more pictures of this objet, so i then jumped to the next image, and sure enough, there it was on the next image.  on this next image, the disc-shaped object had straightened out somewhat and had now moved more towards the center of the image.  it seems the object was coming in at an angle and then straightened out as it flew over the city.\r\n\r\n  i have to admit, when i see something unusual in my pictures, i can usually attribute it to something \"common\" or \"normal\".  not this time.  i immediately thought of mufon.  this is the first time i have been compelled to report a possible sighting as my curiosity was piqued, and hoped that your staff might be able to identify this object.\r\n\r\n  i am attaching

showing up on my security camera equipped with infrared illuminators. i got out my night vision goggles to see if i could see it that way, but could not. i then took a picture of my security monitor with the object. later i took another with video. i checked earlier video from the prior midnight and saw the orb hovering in front of my picture window. that is the video i posted on fb. i was in awe

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Downtown memphis, south main district, saturday night (11-19-16) into sunday morning (11-20-16). i was stargazing with a polaroid 4.5x super telephoto lens, the only way to view full constellations in downtown memphis where low-flying helicopters and jets are even underlit at night. orion now rising earlier - i like orion, enough to bear last night's cold temp. did not report what i saw a few years ago. in fact, told no one until last year and, then, only friends and family.  didn't report what i say this summer either. but, what i saw last night i simply have to talk to someone about. it was just too much - blew me away.\r\n\r\n11:30-ish pm: spotted darkened, dull brown triangle (larger than a 747) approaching from nw - speed guesstimate: 35mph.  no lights, no sound - underlit by downtown lights and crystal clear through polaroid lens. object banked left (sw) at about 85 degree elevation and continued, passing out of sight beyond buildings. if it's been further north, it could've hit the 100 north main building. i don't shock easily but could least assimilate the odd dull brown color - like mud. do these things come in that color? it's not even an option in your report selections. went inside to warm (settle) self and went back out later, wishing i had had some kind of camera with night vision or something. was gone too quickly to run in and grab my little kodak easyshare, though it likely wouldn't pick up anything.\r\n\r\n12:50-1:00am frame:  observed a constellation to the north before turning about toward the south. dropped jaw and stood dumbstruck, trying to understand what was moving in a direct line from se to nw, against the wind, approximately 40mph, about 75 degree elevation. this will be hard to describe, but here goes: saw a series of some dozen, clearly solid, golden, glowing spheres, diameter of each equal to a passenger jet, if not larger, at a height of about 300-400 feet. all of these were encased in and conjoined by a translucent \"tubing\", equal diameter, with the spheres equally spaced along its length. length, if stretch out, would've been equal to between three or four 747s, but it wasn't stretched out. this thing was \"undulating\", like a snake slithering on a vertical, though the \"tubing\" did not crimp or bulge. the closest analogy i can think of is a see-through worm that swallowed a dozen gold beads at regular intervals. again, there was no sound, none at all. i even got a look at it through the polaroid lens, proving to myself it was really there, but there was no real need - this thing was as huge as it was outlandish. i swore, but not loudly - couldn't breathe deeply enough for that. i watched it pass out of view and was still watching empty sky two minutes later when two darkened discs (same color as the earlier triangle, no sound, seemingly only feet apart with one offset just forward the other) went zipping along behind it at about 60mph or better - again, no sound. half an hour later, shivering and neck aching from looking for the nothing that came after, i went back inside. i could not sleep.\r\n\r\n3:00am-ish: had stepped back out, hoping the sight of good old orion flying high, as constant as ever, would settle me enough to sleep. i enjoyed about 10 minutes of unchanging stars before what seemed the same pair of earlier discs (same speed, same altitude, same color, still no sound, and in the some positions relative to each other) came out of the nw, passing directly overhead, to continue to the se, as quickly gone. i actually whined and just went back inside, giving up.\r\n\r\ni didn't get much sleep last night, making today a bit rough, but maybe exhaustion is kind. don't know how many people might have been awake and outside in south main at 1:00am-ish last night, but if they'd looked up, they could not have missed seeing that \"worm thing\". i'd like to meet that person - i need a hug. oh, yeah, wish to note that i've been stone sober since 1988, though i'm actually considering a drink now. i hope i've described this experience in a way that's easily understood, if that's even possible. thank you for providing at least that much. wish it made me feel better. wish i had some answers to too many questions.","distance":"101-500

bright orange light in the distance from my upstairs bedroom window traveling in a steady straight line from the southwest to the north east. the light was unusual because of its size and color. the light was larger than an airplane headlight, had no blinking directonal lights and was orange. i observed the light traveling toward my home so i went outside to get a better look. when i got outside i saw the light appear over the rooftop of my neighbor's house. by this time the light was very close and about 2000 feet in the air. it was not traveling very fast and was making no sound at all. i ran to my back door and called for my daughter to come and look. when she got outside we both watched the orange light continue on a steady path toward the north east then turn slightly more toward the east. the light was clearly under intelligent control as it slowed down, changed directions then hovered. as it moved toward the east, it slowed further then cam to a stop and hovered in the sky. we watched it for about a good minute or slightly longer as it remained stationary. we then noticed a small orange orb shooting out of the right side of the object. it was much smaller than the object itself and curved around and went under the object toward the ground. next, it emitted another larger orange orb from the bottom of the object. this orb fell quickly from the bottom of the object and fell downward in a straight path and disapeared. we watched as this happened three times. when the third orb fell from the object, both the falling orb and the object itself just disappeared. it did not shoot off out of site or move away, it simply appeared to disappear. this was witnessed by both my daughter and myself. if it was observed by others we would like to know. based on what we saw and how the object moved, we are certain we saw something under intelligent control. we just don't know what.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

because it had started to drizzle out. it was just starting to get dark out, but still fairly warm. walked up my road, turned onto another road in the neighborhood, walked about100- 200 (?) yards until i reached another intersection. as i reached that intersection i turned and saw the object floating above the houses and trees heading towards me. i looked to see if anyone on that street was out; ( it is a res. neighborhood.) ; no one else outside. i thought, \"well that figures,...\" lol . i realized that i had no camera to record it, -and no witnesses to corroborate, so just decided to enjoy it. i stood there, motionless, as it approached. i was determined to remember everything i could, so i started taking mental notes. color- gun grey/ black. shaped like a giant metal slice of pizza; sharp corners, no obvious welds or marks. completely smooth exterior. as it approaches me closer, i realize there is some kind of window to the front ; unsure if one was on the other side as well..I judged the height of the craft to be about 20' , tall enough for humans to stand inside of easily, and depending on inside mechanics for propulsion,etc., perhaps large enough for two decks, maybe... i looked up at the window and thought, \" i know you bastards are laughing at me right now...\" , (no matter if human or alien. )  that is really when i took notice of the metal color, no markings at all. \r\n it floated by me as if in slow motion, completely silent. i was sure to note that there was absolutely zero evidence of noise, like a giant helium ballon that probably weighed 100 tons. it was very slow, which i found odd, because if it is indeed some kind of top secret project then why allow it to fly so low and in a residential neighborhood?? yet there it was, drifting by me without a care in the world it seemed. anyhow, as it went past i paid attention to what kind of propulsion system i could guess it might have. my answer: unknown. it did not have any kind of ports for emissions that i could see, nor any kind of heated elements either. no smell of exhaust either. all i saw on the \" back\" side of it were large red/orange lights. they didn't appear to be anything other than lights, either four or five total. lights were maybe 8-10 feet in diameter, opaque (?) bright glow.  i can remember the lights, but the exact number is foggy. as it floated away i realized that i had either missed a lot of details, ( like the bottom of it), or i already forgot them. it again flew right over the houses and trees and into what is my neighborhood.  i wanted to run home as fast as i could to get my boyfriend to go look but realized i would never make it in time. i headed home, but only at a quick pace. lol  sadly, he was inside when i got back and had missed it...As did all of my neighbors, i presume. &#9785;&#65039; \r\n i still look for it to return, but nothing yet. i have not seen it on any youtube videos, and only slight  resemblances on the internet. i don't care if it is govt project, i just want to be able to point and say, \" that's what i saw!!\" why won't the damn thing come back?!? lol \r\n i will try to provide a map and sketch next time i submit. i didn't report it earlier because of ridicule from friends, but it is still bothering me to this day. my hope is that someone else can relate or explain what it is.  it is not the

strange hovering metalic craft hovering over the corner of our apartment in circa 1985 (where my room was located - on the very sw corner of the building). later as a teen... \r\n\r\n1993 time: 22:00 duration: 20 minutes witnesses: 5 shape: fireball number of craft: 2-9 description: i've seen at least two ufo's. i was with two girlfriends the first time, and my friend and his sister the second time – none of us were on hallucinogenics either time; we were about 15-16 years old (1993-1994) – the date might be off by a year (1992?); all of us witnessed this very real phenomena that occurred just as it is read; one, a very intelligent daughter of a doctor (md) recently told me she has seen them again since. the other three are now parents. i think (based on the drake equation etc.) that there must be life out there, but still i would need to see it for myself - to really know if these lights that we saw were piloted by alien beings; all i know is i - we - saw these ufo’s - and they were not gas, weather, planes, satellites, meteors etc. either way, whether aliens or man-made, it's incredible to think of the speeds and mobility and hovering abilities these ufo's had. the first one was seen on a starry night. it was located really far up, at about within our atmosphere; seen from georgeville, quebec. it moved incredible distances in swirly figure-eight-type seemingly random patterns in the sky. for such high distance relative to us, moving almost as if, either testing it's maneuverability, or maybe even just wasting time, as if at play with nothing to do, or deliberately trying to attract some attention to itself (this is my intuition about the flying patterns that it made); but then stopping on a dime, making right angles, even 180 degree changes in direction - it looked just like a star, a bright white orb, but moved like one of those super fast shinny green flies you see in the country, only, this was happening over great distances at about within or near to our atmosphere, hence the estimate of it moving great distances (100-500+ km? in a single second) at great speeds (1000 km/hr?). it lasted over 20 minutes, which, even as teenagers we got bored of looking at it, went back into our tent and we eventually fell asleep. the second time, within the same year, or possibly within two years of the first sighting, my friends and i saw another ufo, appearing as an orange-multicoloured orb, about 2-3 km off the earth, and we saw it from about 5-7 km away, up on a slight hill, looking north over the magog river valley; it was maybe… 30’ or more in diameter – if it was only just one, as we saw it 'disappear' and then light up again from the dark of the night sky, hovering there for about 2-3 minutes at a time, then going out (disappearing/turning the light of the orb ‘off’) and then reappearing in a slightly higher, and off to the side new position (assuming that it was the same orb) and repeating this pattern several times, before one last time when it directed an arch-like orange laser towards the ground (depicted graphically as one would draw radio waves emitting from a radio tower) and this laser then reflected off the earth and back up to the orb – and then a loud sonic boom followed a few seconds after it disappeared. description: orange orb directs arch-like laser to earth which reflects back up to the orb, followed by a sonic boom. lights on object: yes aura: yes emit beams: yes changed color: yes sounds: yes abduction: possible (time lapse/forgetfulness). and, it might be that because my dad was a vietnam war marine, i might have become subject to a secret monitoring program which leads me to conclude that i have a microchip which was inserted in my right shoulder - either by black-ops nurses doing the night shift at the hospital where i was born (think about it: screaming baby at night in the hospital, can't express to anyone what is happening to him while microchips are being inserted into his body - soft cartilage, muscles, tissue etc. - sounds crazy, right? of course it does!), or... it could have just been aliens. just saying - its real. i also think that i might have another one in the top left pallet of my mouth. freaky, right?\r\n\r\nso, if i could talk with someone who can relate and who actually take a real interest... that would be unspeakably nice. it really sucks to be in this position, socially speaking, because most people simply just don't care or won't even bother to here me out (even some of the witnesses don't want to talk about it). kinda really is rough having no one to just talk to about this... been trying to reach out to the ufo crew that i have known of for a few years now but still they don't seem to care much about it. \r\n\r\nany feedback or ideas or referrals would be greatly appreciated (i have tried contacting you guys before but to no avail)! \r\n\r\nthank you.
