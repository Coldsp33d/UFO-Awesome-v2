couple of seconds from the position where i started watching it moving maybe a couple of degrees. it then changed direction and speed rather abruptly and then moved west (left as i was watching it from south of its position) at very high speed. there were a number of planes in the area but the object appeared to be moving maybe 10x faster from a near stationary position. when it flew west it moved very smoothly and at high speed. until it changed direction and moved west i thought maybe it was a balloon. as it moved west i was really focused on it and it was definitely not a bird or anything else with wings. the whole event lasted somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds. in researching this i've seen a similar report in the same area on the same day.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

flying helicopter. i dismissed it because fresno's police have helicopters that frequent the area. as the stars came out and the sky darkened, i still noticed the helicopter flying over the same radius of about 4-5 blocks in a circle, sometimes right over the e. side of our neighbors back yard not 200 ft above. that's when i became interested so i walked to the back n. side of our yard to look down the alley way towards the sky in the direction the helicopter was circling. i watched the helicopter and now a small white,maybe two passenger plane, that had also been circling the area before the sun went down as well, flying towards two red objects that were abruptly changing direction in what looked like evasive maneuvers to avoid or distract the helicopter and plane. the two objects were bright solid red and were changing directions quickly as we watched them and the helicopter and plane chasing them or observing them, disappear out of vision to the ne.  \r\n\r\nthey disappeared and we went inside to watch the video in awe! i uploaded it from my husband's phone and the still image of the video was literally zoomed in on the two red objects. shaking, adrenaline pumping, having just witnessed something like never before,i heard the helicopter return! so, i bolted back out with my husbands phone and proceeded to capture the helicopter circling around the blinking red and white, hovering, moving objects that are constantly changing direction abruptly and disappear and reappear as the helicopter gets closer towards them.  i continued to record multiple videos showing the objects hovering and blinking and proceeding in a nw direction until out of vision. to the naked eye, i could only see blinking or solid light emitting objects. however, as i uploaded and watched the videos to my computer i noticed something very strange. \r\n\r\nwhile the helicopter is circling, whatever is seemingly directly above the power lines that in the video is present that i did not see outside. a triangle shaped object with a red misty hue,resembling a jet with a blinking small white light at the tip of it and larger ball of white light on the middle lower side of it. as the helicopter circles in the video you can see it actually pass behind the object showing its shape and as this happens the smaller white blinking objects surrounding disappear and reappear as the helicopter directly seems to pass them. \r\n\r\nafter i uploaded all of the videos and watched and analyzed them last night. the initial video that had the two red objects being chased by the helicopter and plane was nowhere to be found. not even on my husbands phone. fortunately though i did take multiple videos that can be pieced together for evidence.

video, i will explain this odd event, i did not want to modify the video in any way to make it not credible. \r\n\r\nin september a week or 2 after coming back from las vegas nevada my fiance and i experienced alot of bizarre events. during our trip to las vegas, being interested in the truth in ebe's we drove out to rachel nevada, visiting the \"black mailbox\" i left behind an old student id card (not valid with an old address) after visiting the black mailbox we continued on our way to the back entrance of area 51 and got as close to the gate as lawfully possible. as we walked to the gate jokingly i said to my fiance, little do they know that we know the truth. we then came back to wv and just a week or 2 after our trip. my fiance was on the back porch at night (approx time at top) she saw these very low triangular orb set glide across the sky, she then yelled for me to come out. i can describe the object or objects too low to be an airplane and absolutely silent to be a helicopter. usually helicopters have red flashing or white flashing lights. this was just 3,4 or 5 solid white lights in complete silence. they orbs did not hang around too much and the video was a last second record, so its a bit shaky. the orbs slowly disapeared behind a wooded area, twords the end you may think the lights are flashing but its just the lights shining in and out of trees. *****now let me explain the sound*****, after we got done recording it i decided to upload it to facebook and after uploading it to facebook, because i like to educate the public best of my knowledge, for some odd reason, facebook added this most bizarre sound i've ever heard. facebook cant integrate sound into videos you upload.. my fiance and i are very serious on this topic so neither of us would be so arrogant to crack a joke. to this day i still cannot figure out how the audio got added to it or why, to make it a bit more credible, i'm a systems engineer, i live, eat, breathe technology. \r\n\r\nsome unrelated bizarre happenings few days later after seeing this ufo, for 1 day and 1 day only, talking on the phone with my fiance, almost seemed like some staticy noise with odd sounds in the background, almost like two phone lines crossed over like the old cordless phones. we were using cellphones. it never happened again after that day... i feel like (not being paranoid) i was being profiled some how and some way by the id i left back at the black mailbox.. \r\n\r\nif you have any questions please let me know, i'm happy to help disclose the truth to better mankind.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
