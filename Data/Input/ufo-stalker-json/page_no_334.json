(using the theodolite app on my iphone, i measured it to be about 10 degrees elevation from horizontal). \r\n\r\ni estimate the speed to be about twice to four times walking speed. \r\n\r\nwe observed each object for about one to two seconds and lost sight of each when it passed out of hotel light beam. \r\n\r\nwe talked about it for a few moments, trying to decide what it was. \r\nwe waited about five to ten more minutes for another of the objects to appear. i had my iphone camera set to video with maximum zoom, but unfortunately we didn't see any more of the objects. we gave up and decided to walk back across the bridge toward the nevada side of the river. \r\n\r\nwe decided as we were walking back across the bridge, that we would each write down our descriptions of the sighting before we discussed it further. we jotted quick notes on the sighting as we ate dinner in the mexican restaurant across the street from the riverfront casino. this is my description from my notes that night.\r\n\r\n\r\nwitness 2 description (copied from her notes)\r\n=====================\r\nobserved two objects passing over the riverfront hotel. \r\nat the time of the sighting, we were about a half mile from the hotels standing on the sidewalk along st. hwy 163 near a stoplight just across the river on the arizona side. we stopped to take photos of where we were staying.\r\n\r\nafter the starworksusa conference ended, around 5pm, w1 and i took a walk along the river walkway. the moon was full and the temperature was in the 50's. i wanted to see the small helicopter that was landed (displayed) along the river walk. the helicopter was not there but we decided to keep walking. \r\n\r\nthe path led to the state hwy 163 bridge over the colorado river and we decided to walk across it. on the bridge we passed a man on a bicycle who appeared to be homeless. after we crossed the bridge i turned around and noticed the nice view of the hotels, we stopped walking and took pictures. then i noticed something moving above the riverside hotel/casino in the light and pointed it out to w1. he saw it as well.\r\n\r\ni saw a dark, curved boomerang shaped object. what appeared to be the back underside was clearly defined but i could not make out the far side of the object against the dark sky. the lights from the top of the hotel lit the underside and front edge as it moved down river. the edge was well defined and easy to see. then as we watched, another one appeared a bit lower and moved in the same manner. there were no lights or sound. \r\n\r\nwe observed a helicopter landing at the airport about 2 miles away, 10 minutes prior, and also saw two shooting stars after seeing the objects. we later observed other air traffic but nothing was as low as what we saw.\r\nvenus was also in the sky. \r\n\r\nnote: there was a man in the riverside park below us walking his large dog, where we stopped to take photos. he may have seen the objects as well.

thought i was observing a jet plane flying a slightly unusual route, but what really caught my eye was that i couldn't see any wings.\r\n\r\nother than that, it looked like a slightly narrow passenger jet, even thickness from front to back, (no bulges in the middle – it wasn't a blimp, and was moving too fast to be one) flying steadily west at conventional speed and altitude. i stared, thinking it was just the angle in relation to where i was standing, that prevented me from seeing the wings, but in the moment or two i watched it fly across, i never caught even a glimpse of the wings. because i was initially so sure it was conventional, i didn't bother setting down my groceries to snap a shot with my cell phone.\r\n\r\nit's sad, because moments after it passed from my field of vision, i realized one other thing: there was no tail. a tail would have been obvious no matter what the angle. that's when i became certain that this was an unusual craft.\r\n\r\ni also noted that i didn't hear a typical jet plane sound, but with ambient street noise in a big city, that wasn't a major factor in assessing the normalcy of the event.\r\n\r\nconclusion:\r\nthe appearance was more or less

down again to see if i would witness the orb again or any other incident. since no one has been at the camp site in a quite awhile i had to retrieve the shovel from the cabin in order to dig out the fire pit. as i made my way back to camp i heard from behind me to the right, \" belong\" i stopped looked to my right then to behind me in a full circle manor. i got the sense that something said that doesn't, or you don't belong here. later that night between 11pm-12am i awoke to my camp being illuminated in a very bright white light. i exited my tent to notice that almost as if the ground was covered in snow as how bright this light was. it was a full moon out but it doesn't seem that the moon was big enough to cast such a bright light and was to high of an angle to cast the shadows. since the light seemed to be behind me rather then above where the moon was. soon after going back to bed, i heard a distant noise which sounded like a growl. this noise came from the right/east of me same area as where i orb in 2014. i looked out my tent to notice that this light seemed to be brighter. between 12am-1am. something hit my tent from where my head was. this did not hit my tent from above my head but rather behind my head(side wall)facing the direction of where the bright light seem to illuminate from. i immediately exited my tent in fear to raise the fire and began to pack up my gear and leave. i was in full survival/ get out of here, get home mode. i left at around 1:30am. it took me 5 hours to get back to my vehicle. and i was in such terror i did not look back and took brief less then 1 minute breaks to drink water on the way back. i was not safe and was focused on getting home. i reached my vehicle around 6am and begin to leave. since i was so exhausted from the hike out, the winding road leaving the trail head made me sick to which i had to pull over to vomit twice. this incident terrorized me. writing this out gives no justice to the fear that i felt. the light that illuminated my camp was so bright that it resembled the white of snow or paper, and seemed to be projected as a beam upon my tent rather then light from the moon. it was almost as if the ground shined or reflected the light back.\r\n\r\ni have included a map and drawing of where the thud hit my tent and angle/direction of light in the

light (as planets don't twinkle like stars since they reflect, not generate, light).  the horizon above the mountains was just beginning to brighten with the approaching dawn and a waning moon was beginning to set in the west but was still very bright.  the temperature was around 38 degrees and the air was clear and still.\r\n\r\nthis has some similarities to 2 previous sightings i've had in the past few years.  one sighting was of a star like object at about the same place but earlier in the morning and was reddish colored.  the other sighting i actually took several photographs of and

5th, 2016, at 4:45 pm, in broad daylight. i was walking up to my apartment above my workplace, when something inside me said i should look up, and that is when i noticed a military jet, with a long contrail. i believe it was one, as the whole plane is white with the exception of what looked like a orange-colored structure attached to the underbelly of the rear of the aircraft. it reminded me of refueling tankers. the jet was heading northeast as it was coming from southern ca and heading directly over the center of the las vegas valley. i watched the jet for a few moments before i realized there was something shiny white paralleling the jet at an apparent distance of (43) plane widths to the west of the jet. seeing that object raised my curiosity, so i continued to watch it. then, i realized i needed to take a picture of this event. i quickly took out my smartphone and took the picture. i didn't know what i thought it was as first, however, it did not seem to have any wings to help identify it as a plane or drone. the object definitely displayed spherical characteristics. there was no contrail or wake in the atmosphere while this craft moved across the sky. the object itself followed the exact path of the jet for about 30 seconds, then it turned abruptly to the east and crossed either through, above or just below the con/chem- trail the jet was leaving in its own wake. during the change of direction there was no evidence of any wings , it just turned on a dime. i decided to actually film this object just after it changed direction and i caught some video. i got a hold of my wife as well and she also took a short video that catches the last few moments that we could see. the object continued to head east, and it started to get to a part of the sky which had some light wispy cloud cover. it was during these moments that the object seemed to just disappear. after we took our picture and videos, we came inside our home and downloaded the picture to my pc. i then opened the picture on 32\" tv and i look at the object for a little while, in wonder of what this might be. then much to my surprise i noticed that there is a strange looking shadow, above the jet, just about top-centered in the photo, that really caught my attention. so, i expanded the photo as large as i could, and lo-and-behold a disk shaped object (a silver gray color just barely a different shade than the background sky) with a dome on top of it is staring me right in the face. now, if this object was at the same altitude as the jet, then this object would be approximately 600ft. across. if the object were right in front of the moon in this picture it would be 1/3 the width of the moon. it could be larger, of course, if the disk was at higher altitude. or conversely, if the disk was at a lower altitude. i did not see this last object when i was taking the picture. neither object made any noise during the witnessed event.","distance":"Over One

it did not appear to change direct or get larger from approach. when i realised that the object was behaving contrary to normal aircraft principals i searched for my cellphone to record the event. no sooner than i had starting looking for the cellphone when it just started to fade away to nothing, or at least i could no longer see it glowing. it did how ever not change position as if it was landing such as a helicopter would or change direction as a fixed wing aircraft would. it just faded away and was no longer visible, almost as if it knew someone was going to record the event. this may seem like an unusual statement but that is how the object appeared to act, but i am in no way saying that in fact in knew i was going to try and record it, it just seemed that way. the whole event frightened me as there might be some unresolved issues relating to the ufo phenomina. i admit i did not sleep that well that night for fear that it would come back and very much closer to me, but am unaware of any further observations or events. when the object just faded away i have no idea where it went or any other observations.\r\nthis end my observations..\r\n\r\np.S this is my 4th ufo

snowing lightly and i was going about 40 mph. i then noticed a very bright flash in the northwest sky (similar to the flash when the ship \"jumps\" on the battlestar gallactica tv show). after the flash a bright light was visible. after a few seconds of remaining stationary, the light moved a long distance (at least a mile) in an arc motion. this movement only took a couple seconds to complete. the light was now a visible solid object hovering above a factory building located about 200 yards southeast of the intersection of hwy 81 and zachary ave. as i drove about a mile to reach this intersection the object moved the 200 yards to reach the intersection. i calculate that means that the object was only moving about 10 mph. when i reached the intersection the object was directly over the southeast side of the intersection. i then stopped in the right turn lane, rolled my window open and looked at the object. it made absolutely no sound and it was only about 100 feet overhead and about 50 feet southeast of me. it was rectangular in shape, about 100 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 15 feet high. it had 3 dull round lights (one on each end and one near center). it also had a number

was fully aware and i began to seem to float up like i was being levitated. i began to see a craft and was very slowely levitated toward it. it looked gold and had pipes and various things on the surface. it was very dusty like it had been in space a long time. i was in space not near the earths surface. the craft looked somewhat like the millinea falcon but was much smaller only about 3-5 feet thick and had an aperture like a camera about 3-4' in diameter. as i was floated near the ship the aperture opened and i was laid on a cold metal slab. the door shut and everything went black. i had no other memory of the event. i woke up the next morning late maybe about 10 oclock. i had a fever and felt like i was dead or very dry . after thinking about what had happened i noticed an itching on my right ribcage. i lifted up my shirt and found i had 7 burn holes on my ribs about a 2 inch circle like cigarette burns. the burns were perfectly symmetrical like 3 down and 5 across. it made scabs and the scars are now nearly healed but still can be seen.\r\n after the encounter i felt as if i had been particaly replaced by something. i experienced high voltage in my body. i destroyed computers of my frien just walking into the room. i could do things like read minds and use esp and it really flipped out a lot of people. i no longer needed to use speech to communicate with anyone even people on tv and at any distance anywhere on earth.\r\n  there were roaring sounds around me. like an earthquake happening. i twice took photos of a green globe about my house and also at my new apartment i have the photos. each time i saw the lights an earthquake occurred within a few days.\r\n  i began to see visions at night and sometimes could not sleep. i began to have living dreams as i lived other lives in color and as realistic as living in every way. i could not control or direct the episodes and it still goes on.\r\n  the story is long. i only recently found out about mufon. there were no places that i could report to as far as i knew when the first encounter happened. i took a blood sample and it looked really weird. my girlfriend had normal blood but mine did not look like human blood. i have been a scientific type all my life and had a 99th percentile score in hs and made the top score ever recorded gatb for tva nuclear division. perhaps that's why the alien ship wanted me to study. i have not done well since it happened. its like the alien changes me into different people. it make normal life nearly impossible but i get visions of mechanical engineering components one is a reactor that runs on water by high temp cracking nearly a nuclear reaction. on and on---- what do you think. it would make a great
