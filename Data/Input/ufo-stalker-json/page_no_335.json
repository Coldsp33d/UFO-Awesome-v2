7:15-7:30 pm, and i heard a noise, which turned out to be a helicopter.  now, we have plenty of air traffic in our neighborhood, especially with a hospital down the street, but this was louder as it was closer and much lower to the ground.  i'm always fairly alert and curious, but didn't make much of it until i looked out my dining room window, which has a clear view looking west/northwest towards lake pleasant.  what got me out of my seat was white lights that were unaccountable by sound.  i saw the red lights of what was clearly a helicopter and could hear it plainly, but it was following an object that appeared black and had three, constant, white lights in a very obvious triangle structure.  the two came from behind our unit making their trajectory coming from the ne heading sw, but they were very low (maybe 100-200 feet, hard to tell at night).  the object itself was maybe 50 ft from one light to the next, and it was an equilateral triangle.  the triangle made absolutely no noise that i, or my fiance could hear as we were both watching at this point with naked eye and binoculars.  they were moving very slow, even for a helicopter, maybe 20-30 mph.  they moved this direction, toward the i-17 freeway, before turning nw heading towards ben avery range or just slightly east of that where it went behind the small mountains there.  we followed them as they reappeared heading s/sw toward the peoria/glendale area.  at this time they were likely over lake pleasant rd. or close to it.  the object was still moving at the same slow pace, still being followed closely by the helicopter.  during this whole thing, a couple more helicopters came into the area as well.  we followed them as long as we could as they disappeared behind the mountains to the s/sw of us.\r\n\r\nthis was definitely the closest and largest encounter i'd ever had and wish i was on my patio at the time as it would've been right in front of me and could've provided more details.  honestly, i was quite excited the whole time and i'm still stoked today as i never felt like we were in danger, at all.  i'm constantly looking out our windows and this time it paid off!  i don't have any pictures, but since i'm an artist, i could probably make a drawing or two if need be.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

unheard of i live about 50 -70 miles from whitman air force base and there are military planes and stuff that fly over from time to time that i notice. i never saw the object in the pictures until a

last report - 56 going west.  as i turned from black mountain road onto the 56 west, on the ramp before even merging i saw the craft at a very low altitude just south of the highway.  as i was heading home from work, at a little before 9:30, i saw a black triangle hover and incredibly slowly proceed almost directly above me. i could see it perfectly as i lowered my driver's side window.  it was a little sw of me and then proceeded across the highway really really slowly with no sound whatsoever.  this craft is about the size and shape of the stealth bomber, except that it has a different set of lights, it moved at about 5 miles and hour and an altitude of approximatly 500ft.  \r\n\r\nwhat's truly bizarre for me is not so much the craft but the no other cars reacted.  truly people are blind to things right infront of their face.  no other cars even slowed down!  it was glaringly obvious if your eye just glanced at it. and it was not hard to notice.  the triangle had two white lights on two corners and inbetween the two lights what looked like a set of three highbeams that made it glaringly obvious.  the triangle was not leading the pointy side of the triangle bit with the back part.  like it was going \"backwards\".  clearly it can move in any direction. so it looked like the edge of the triangle, with a white light, a set of 3+highbeams and then another white light

and i-25. the lights first made me think i was looking head-on at an airplane coming in for a landing in my general direction. i observed the lights for about two minutes before realizing they were not getting any closer to me. at that point i texted a friend also staying at the hotel to look. he did not. \r\n\r\ni began to wonder if the light source was something on top of the mountains that are west of the city, but the lights were far above the horizon (60 degrees or more), and when i looked at the mountain vista in the morning, the peaks were far too low, and no buildings or roads were visible on them. \r\n\r\nafter observing the lights for another minute or so, i spotted a red strobe light closer to the horizon, traveling from north to southwest. this moved very fast, and i thought (and still think) that this might have been the navigation light of a helicopter or other aircraft, not associated with the object further out. the red strobe seemed much closer to me than the three lights. \r\n\r\n\r\nthe lights were nondescript, yellow lights, not unlike the landing lights on a commercial aircraft. they were unwavering, and non-blinking. some rays were visible, as if the lights were very bright - like helicopter searchlights - but smaller, higher, and further away. \r\n\r\nafter approximately 5 minutes i figured it must be some kind of helicopter, possibly from nearby holman afb or the nasa facility at white sands. i walked away from the window i was looking out of. when i checked back about 10-15 minutes later, the lights were gone. \r\n\r\ni find myself skeptical about most ufo sightings, and i still believe i saw an aircraft (built on earth), but if my account corroborates any other sightings from the same area and time, perhaps it can help your organization figure

their property. i then saw another orb in the distance making the rounds further out just around the treeline. two people with drones, scouting property in the dark at 5:00 a.M. made sense at the time. i watched the orb closest to me for over an hour. as the sun began to rise, it began to move less and less. i couldn't wait for sunrise to see from what property these drones came. as daybreak progressed, the bright ball of light seemed to get further and further away. by now it was the only thing visible in the sky for several minutes after the other stars vanished. it slowly and steadily shrank  in size until it simply disappeared. i have no idea what it was. this was the third time in the last four years i have seen orbs in the sky and along the treeline. if it was drones. they were super quiet as i was in the woods in the country..Dead silence. i am still perplexed.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

(i remember being afraid that if i looked away from it it might disappear.  and i really wanted my wife to see it.)  she heard me the second time and came from the front of the house.  by the time she got there it had already started moving to the north and as such was a lot smaller in the sky.  but as soon as she saw it she recognized that it was something other than the normal craft around there. it moved beyond the branches of our neighbors trees.\r\n\r\nwhen it started to move away it was a bit deceptive as to its speed.  i thought that maybe we could jump into the car and catch another good close up glimpse of it, so we took off. i think we went about a mile but it was apparent after that it was moving fast.  i disappeared into what i think was high level clouds to the north.  \r\n\r\nit was a clear night for the most part we could see planes around every where (commercial airliners that is.) \r\n\r\nhere is a more detailed description as best as i can give.\r\npulsating red lights above below and all over.  it seemed to be diamond shaped but i could not tell for sure as the light pulsed and changed so rapidly that maybe the shape was just glare in my eyes. it seemed to me that there might have been a horizontal division across the middle of the diamond. like a spot where there were no lights dividing the diamond into a upper and lower half. but it is hard to state definitely. after looking on youtube the closest appearance would be the orbs in pennsylvania. \r\n\r\nmy wife had her phone and attempted to get a picture but it moved away to quickly beyond the tree branches.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":80427,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.99380037011393,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11152016-0003","longitude":-96.718003714588,"occurred":1479064500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1479197064000,"summary":"Red diamond pulsating brightly.  did a quarter of a circle around me then moved quickly to the north while ascending into high level clouds.","tags":["sound","lights","pulsing","flash","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1480418393111,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":69,"maxvism":21,"maxvisi":13,"meantempm":17,"meantempi":62,"meanvism":18,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":69,"maxvism":21,"maxvisi":13,"meantempm":17,"meantempi":62,"meanvism":18,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"75075","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Plano, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:46947"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Fort Worth","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"@1:05am woke up suddenly, went to porch for cigarrette, immediately saw massive triangle in sky, and not tr3b like, more of a spear head??
