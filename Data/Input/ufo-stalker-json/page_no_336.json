with him. nice day, looking above the trees at the blue sky. noticed several white dots to the north, growing larger, approaching my position more or less. geese was my first thought. dots grew larger, solid white, in a line, so not geese. no wings, just white. four, maybe five bright white dots in a staggered line, fairly low to my horizon (looking up a hillside). all disappeared for about 10-20 seconds behind a nearby tree as i moved to a better position to see. a bright white egg-shaped light passed beyond the tree to the northwest, flashing like a plane less than a mile off (unless it was huge). now i'm thinking of davison army airfield a few miles away. then a second and third object followed a few seconds later, these also bright white, but not flashing like the first. the sun was above and behind the objects, so they were not reflecting but seemed to generate their own light. there was no sound. i saw no sign of the one or two more dots i'd originally seen, but while watching for them i noticed a commercial jet with contrails emerging into the same field of view. also, i could hear the jet. for comparison, both the objects and the jet seemed to be moving at the same speed, but the jet seemed to be at a much higher altitude. as far as i could tell, these were not meteors, birds, or aircraft from the army airfield, nor commercial traffic. wish i'd had my camera or cell phone with me. 24 hours later, i'm already doubting myself about what i'd seen.","distance":"Over One

daughter move house,so was totally exhausted & sleeping heavily i think.I suddenly woke up with a start by a bright light that was flashing through my bedroom & going on & off,this light was a reddish/pink colour to start with but then it became a kind of white light flashing on & off.I sat up in bed with my heart racing as i was quite scared,the light seemed to be coming from outside my bedroom window i would say it was kind of pulsating on & off very frequently.I was quite annoyed as i was so tired & wanted to sleep,i decided to try to go back to sleep so lay back down pulling the duvet over my head.The light was still in my face however & i sat up & turned on the light...By now i was really scared,not sure what to do.I wanted to look out of the window but was scared,i decided to open the curtains & was totally amazed by what i saw...There was a silvery sphere/disc hovering above my back garden & it honestly seemed to be very close to my bedroom window...I am not sure how far away it was about 8feet away or something & only about tree top height i think.It was spinning or pulsating kind of but somehow not moving off of the spot kind of hovering i would say.There were rosy & whitish coloured lights all around the bottom of it that were pulsating & a strong white beam was pointing in my direction.It was silvery/chrome/white coloured & looked seamless i could not see any windows or anything.I was very shocked & afraid but i have seen something similar back in 2012 only that time their were six of them in two rows of three.I was half blinded by the beam of light that was flashing on & off so i may be lacking in some detail of the object & i was terrified.I did not take a picture or video as my camera battery was flat but i felt glued to the spot anyway.I wanted to scream or cry out so that my son in the room next door might come running into my room but when i opened my mouth no sound came out.I am not sure how long i stood there but i know that when i went over to the window it was 4.10am & dark outside,to be honest i am not sure how or when it went away as i woke up in bed at 7.30am,but do not remember going back to bed.I am sure that this was not a dream as i kept on slapping my face & pinching myself to make sure that i was awake.Through all of this i did not hear any sounds at all like an aircraft would make it was just silence,i kept on wishing that i would hear the noise of a helicopter or something as that would then explain it. i do not want this to be a ufo sighting as it terrifies me,because i have had two other sightings in 2001.2012 & this on sunday morning 13/11/16 & that worries me greatly as it feels like i may have been tagged or something.","distance":"20 Feet or

got off work in sherbrooke at 6:20pm. i started off home and saw a large light in the sky when i got to goldenville, 6:23pm. i pulled over and looked at it for a couple of minutes, taking a photo of it before it disappeared over the horizon. the color of the light seemed to slowly fade in and out between yellow and orange, while maintaining its brightness/size.\r\n\r\ni saw it again over a clear cut area in liscomb, just past gegogan brooke, at 6:30\r\ni have seen many odd things in the sky over the years, so i was not afraid.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the light appeared to be over the highway, moving towards the right over the horizon. of course, this light was way off in the distance, but was bright. i have no idea how far away it really was or how large.\r\nwhen i saw it again over the clear cut,moving from left to right in the sky. i pulled over and watched it, took some photos. as i was watching it, the light quickly changed direction and became smaller and smaller as if it was moving quickly away from me. it disappeared completely and was gone for about a minute(?), when it came speeding back to full brightness! there was no cloud cover. i figured at that moment that i better continue on my way down the road. i was not afraid, though a bit uneasy when i saw it come back.\r\nmy camera is not high tech, but i was able to get a clear photo of it over the highway, and then again when it was over the clear cut area. i zoomed in best i could for a couple of the photos.\r\nwhen i got home and zoomed in close on the image, i was surprised to see a \"saucer\" shape.\r\nalthough i was alone when i saw this in my car, when i posted this on facebook, a lady from further down the shore said that she also saw this light in mushaboom while traveling to murphys cove.\r\n\r\nthe next night, november 11th, i saw this light again (or a similar light), only from my living room window. i live in moser river, approximately 45 minutes from where i saw the light the night before.\r\ni was sitting here watching my pet bird, whose cage is by the window, when i noticed the light. i ran outside with my room mate to look at it.\r\nhe did not think anything of it, as it was hovering stationary for about 10 minutes until it zoomed out and disappeared out of sight. when it sped off he was a little creeped out. but as usual, i was calm.\r\nas mentioned previously, i have seen a lot of weird things in the sky during my lifetime. this is the first one i am reporting officially due to the fact that the shape came out clear in the photos. most times i never think of getting my camera out, or i don't have time.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

bright white but also had an odd billowing bulbous shape to it. it was more dull than a star or plane. no faa lights or pulsations. wife ran in the home to grab her mom to witness. after they both came to the yard, the lights both intersected in front of us and slowly both objects came to a stop. we took multiple photos. they remained stationary for a few minutes. as they were stopped, another fast moving bright orb moved from south to north, and passed overhead until it was out of view. green pulsating light slowly starts moving again. goes east. a few mins later, white orb starts moving north, slowly periodically starting and stopping. after a couple mins it turns and starts heading east seemingly following the same path as the green orb just took. after it has moved away from our view due to trees, another bright large white orb appears moving from south to north. it's bigger than the other 3 and intersects with an overhead plane. it steadily moves over the house and stops in the far distance. you can tell it's not moving anymore due to it approaching tree tops but then is still being able to see it for about 3 mins. there was a very dim circular  pulsation being admitted from it. it sat there pulsating softly until it started moving again northward out of sight.Photos are not great as i only has my iphone 5s camera available. but you can see the movement in relation to the silhouettes of the power lines.

trees. one of the lights was higher up in the sky, and after observing them for a while we deemed the lower light to be a plane. then from the garage light behind us we noticed a shadow and we thought it was my friends mom, and she doesn't like us smoking so we got nervous for a second, but it turned out to be a leaf. we then brought our attention back to our cigarettes and conversations when i noticed that the light that was higher up in the sky was still there, but the lower one was not (because it was a plane). we were trying to figure out what it was when all of the sudden it completely vanished into the clouds that were way above it. it was unlike anything either of us have seen before, as it appeared to have been sucked into he clouds. it left no trail, made no noise, did nothing else besides move extremely slowly across the sky. it had orangish-reddish lights being emitted from all apparently spherical parts of the object. we were in complete amazement and were so excited to have seen something we can actually call an unidentified flying object. during our excitement i move my eyes back to where we saw it, and noticed another slow moving object that was exactly identical to the other ufo in every way. moved slowly, glowed, and about 5 seconds later it also vanished into the clouds the same way as the first.
