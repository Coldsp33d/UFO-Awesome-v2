north, all leaving contrails. suddenly i noticed a bright silver spherical object that was stationary that seemed to be at about the same altitude as the other airplanes, maybe a few thousand feet higher. it had no contrail. about 3 seconds after i first saw it, it dimmed, then brightened, then moved slightly left, then abruptly to the right at an incredible speed for 1-2 seconds. it then stopped for 1-2 seconds, brightened again, then moved straight up at a very high rate of speed for 2-3 seconds before completely disappearing. i did not see it again after that. i have been very interested in aviation for almost my entire life, and love watching them. in my 34 years of life, i have never seen anything like what i saw that day. i never saw any object move as fast or make the abrupt turns that this object did. i was absolutely stunned and amazed at what i saw. i tend to be fairly skeptical about anything abnormal i see or experience, and i look for known explanations

thought it was a drifting balloon but then i saw it had straight edges so maybe it was a drone? then i noticed it was sort of white, but a really dim white (almost like a faint glow or reflection), barely visible against the night sky (fyi it was a full moon) so i sought maybe it was a small airplane without its lights on. i opened my sun roof just as it passed over me. it was triangular in shape with the left and right sides longer than the back (based on its flight path nw to se) and it seemed that at the 3 points of the triangle there were white lights that were distinguishable but not much brighter than the whitish surface of the object. i immediately rolled down all my windows at took a right in hopes of intercepting it at the next mile road. i lost it, though. there were too many trees and nowhere to get a clear view of the sky.\r\nso it flew a straight and steady path nw to se over rochester and avon. it wasn't really fast but it wasn't slow either. also, when i looked

not have a sound? its' shape and closness to the ground ruled out some type of balloon. at the time we figured we could throw a rock and hit it. the irregular shape was supported by tiny varying-colored lights which look like little \"porches\" or dents in the structure. the ground to our west was illuminated by 'spot lights' coming from the craft. i remember we decided we needed to quickly leave the area leaving our lights off (to this day i regret that).  personally, i have never experienced that level of fear. we continued rush to my destination (a family i knew from years

make out the airline) following the landing path towards ft. lauderdale/hollywood international airport. i'm including the landing/arrival schedule for the flights in hope that someone else saw this object from the airplane. i also included a map showing an \"x\" for my location, the word airplane showing the airplane location, and the path of the object. i didn't get a change to take a picture because my traffic light changed and i didn't think it would have come out on the picture because it was so

plane could manage making it impossible for them to be planes. they flew silently down my street and then abruptly changed direction to the right. as they turned the orbs started to glow with much greater intensity, turning to a more pure green color before vanishing at an incredible speed.\r\n\r\njust a few minutes later another craft came on the same path, this time a much larger triangular shaped craft of the same color as the previously seen orbs. the bottom had smaller lights that were also whitish-green in color. the lights pulsated, changing in intensity. as it flew overhead it

but as i continued to drive toward the lake as i lived on the west side of town, i could the light appeared more and more to my right.  so  knew it wasn't but was probably a helicopter.  \r\n\r\ntwo nights later as i was driving home from class, i noticed the same light again.  since as i wasn't sure if it was a helicopter or something else, i thought i would check it out.  \r\n\r\ninstead of going home, i drove over the bridge at lake waco and took the first exit to the right which led into speegleville park.  i could see the craft was over the west side of the lake in a stationary position with a white light pointing east.  as i approached the craft, it turned off the light and started moving to the southwest.  \r\n\r\ni could tell it was a black triangular craft.  it crossed over the highway, and i decided to follow it.  i got back on the highway and watched the craft cross over the highway and settled behind a clump of trees on the south side the highway.  i then took the next exit and crossed over on an overpass to the area where i saw the craft go down.  \r\n\r\nas i drove slowly past the trees, i could not the see the craft.  the road curved back to east; and i pulled up about 100 yards, turned off my lights but left the engine running.  \r\n\r\nlooking in my rear view mirror after a few moments, i saw the slowly rise from the trees and started coming toward where i was parked.  it then pulled up to where i was on the other side of the fence. it turned facing me and stayed motionless, making no sound.  it was on the other what appeared to a telephone line about 10 feet above it. \r\n \r\ni could definitely tell that the craft was black, triangular in shape, about 20 feet wide and 30 feet long.  it had a cockpit with a greenish hue inside, and i could see the shadows of 3 small heads peering down at me.  after about 4-5 minutes, a green light shined down on my vehicle, causing the engine to die.  i tried to restart it to no avail.  i tried turning on my lights and then the radio; but nothing worked.  getting nervous, i locked my doors. \r\n\r\ni sat there a good 15-20 minutes, trying every 2-3 minutes to start my engine.  finally, the engine turned over, and i drove down the road about another 100 yards where i turned on my lights and turned around.  \r\n\r\nas i drove past the craft on my left, it hadn't moved.  when i got back on the highway heading east, i could see it was still there.  \r\n\r\nabout 3 years later, i saw what appeared to be the same craft above the lights at the south end of the la vega football field, apparently observing a football game.  my family and i were headed toward my wife's family for dinner.  and i wanted to drive over and show her what i had seen years earlier; but she didn't want to go. \r\n\r\nhaving served two years in af rotc and two years in the us army with a top secret clearance, i can say without any doubt that this craft was not one of ours.  \r\n\r\n   ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":80361,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.552023000000002,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11112016-0020","longitude":-97.1417095,"occurred":117936000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478897082000,"summary":"Craft hoovered motionless, making no sound.","tags":["sound","lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1480414193875,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":22,"maxtempi":72,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":69,"meanvism":11,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":19,"mintempi":66,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":22,"maxtempi":72,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":69,"meanvism":11,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":19,"mintempi":66,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15751,"locationName":"Waco, Texas","triangle":true,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:47663"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82750,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":337}
