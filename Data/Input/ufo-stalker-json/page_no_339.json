possible gunfire also than nine ten oclock the mother of explosions like a missle hit so i ran in the house from shed alerting family and girl agreed was oddly loud we than heard a house shaker and i went out immediately takeing notice to a greenish orb or lit sphere directly behind me about thousand feet up miles away i than lost sight turning to the moon seen an unfamiliar coupkle of stars that i know weren't stars because i look up a lot especially at the moon, i took a few photo went back in seen something i felt was intrigueing so spiraticly over the course of a few hours i went out took photos even though i visually wasn't seeing anything i sensed them i than put camera on burst mode and that's wher the strangest thing appeared it looked as if it was stone it seemed to shape shift gradually and in some shots it almost looks like a creature of somesort or the stone faced statues typicly built by the myan possibly inca im just blown away also the boomerang ,triangle,chevron shaped bright reflective craft and the dumbbell were kinda strange just casually doin ther thing it looked to me like giant birdlike craft and all moveing moonward at a lower altitude of the moon... the stone figure seemed out of control with its patterns it was bobing down up forward backward accending forward though at the same time.. i did speak with a friend who informed me of a military style engagement between a guy we know a survivorilist x marine who lives secluded on a farm and has many weaoponry as far as details on that my girl snapped cus i was going to be briefed and i decided to abort going to find out exactly what the situation actually was but ther was a rather constant exchange of explosions, id say missle ,grenade launcher something to that affect def fifty cal. and several other rifle ,and small arms.. im blown away this has me stunned after i fell asleep the next night cus i was up due to this my girl said she heard gunfire really close and was afraid it would wake me and id be bird doggin , myy term so than last night im watching the election around 1am and i was startled b a loud real close huge gun maybe fifty call rifle it was across the road within a hundred yards down the road a lil and this gunfire went on once every five min for the first hour than around six within a minute id say.... i went outside to see if i could see any disruption i did see faint light occasionally behind the clouds but nothing concrete to say.. the man i spoke of earlier is infatuated with the moon has a very expensive telescope he reviews the  moon and mountains near his home the appalation mountains, ive seen aircraft photo ,video, transparent alien entity he has documented and shortly after i started i feel being aware of them watched communicated with i also have a lot of photos on my phone of alien entity that look to me as reptilian , greys, small, and tall, and hybrid human alien my phone just had around three hundred pictures on it one morning of all type of blurry ghostly alien and all in under three mins which a person could not do and burst of about 100 same pic my phone only took burst of 8 i think so ther it is if

and continued to observe.  as i passed around a small mountain top which took 5 seconds i then lost complete sight of the object.  i did not see the object go west or east.  i did not see it go up, it just disappeared.  maybe it flew down into a tunnel in the mountain but i just dont know.  i am a former california highway patrol sergeant of 15 years.  i am currently a junior high school teacher.  i am not an expert in flight technology but i have never seen anything like this in my life.  i then saw a black airplane and black helicopter imediately respond to the area where this object had been.  the helicopter was being flown in an aggressive manner in the area where the object was seen.  this is to the best of  my recollection","distance":"Over One

called sepulveda but which changed to north hills in the 1990s; the town is located in the central san fernando valley in southern california.\r\n\r\ni was visiting relatives for a few days. it must have been in summer, as it was very hot. the house is located on dearborn street, north hills, ca 91343.\r\n\r\nit was an extremely hot night and my cousin and i couldn’t sleep so took sheets and pillows to sleep on the floor in the living room near sliding-glass doors facing southward to the backyard and beyond toward the major cross streets of balboa blvd. and nordhoff street a couple blocks away. everyone else was in bed asleep.\r\n\r\nas we lay chatting, we both suddenly noticed a pulsating, round red light (about the color of a red traffic light, slightly more orange) in the sky directly in our sight line, facing south toward the cross streets of balboa blvd. and nordhoff street (where the balboa nordhoff shopping center is now located). (see map attached.) \r\n\r\nat first we assumed it was a helicopter, given that it was hovering at low altitude. but quickly we realized the light was too large to be a running light on an aircraft, plus there was no aircraft, only this round light by itself. also, it was perfectly silent as it maneuvered up, down, diagonally, stopping still, changing directions quickly on a dime as it hovered, not moving in a forward path, but constantly moving around. not moving in a jerking motion but smoothly and easily.\r\n\r\ni remember the object was behind a telephone pole, which was occasionally silhouetted against the red light. looking at a google map now, i think the telephone pole was on nordhoff street, a major boulevard lined with telephone poles, as i do not see any other telephone poles in the neighborhood between the house on dearborn and nordhoff street. the red light was some distance from the pole, perhaps in the vicinity of what is now the balboa nordhoff shopping center (but was one department store surrounded by cornfields at the time) or just south of that location.\r\n\r\nthe pulsating or flickering red light flashed sequentially most of the time but would also flash randomly. \r\n\r\nthe light seemed semi-transparent, a perfectly round disk without distinguishing marks, features, protuberances, or anything on it or around it. the shape undulated slightly when it changed directions, trailing light slightly as it shifted direction, which could have been an optical illusion, i don’t know. otherwise, the edges of the circle were sharp and clear. \r\n\r\nthe disk looked 2-dimensional, flat, rather than a round, 3-d, balloon-like object, as there was no curvature. again, it was semi-transparent, not 100% solid, but a well-defined circle.\r\n\r\nmy cousin and i were surprised and remarked that we’ve never seen any aircraft with the ability to move that way. it scared us a little too, as it seemed only the object and us were awake on this late night observing this light-disk in the clear, black sky. it almost felt like the object put on this display just for us. \r\n\r\nwe watched for what seemed like about 15 minutes. then the object simply descended, drifting silently down in a perfectly straight line, until it was out of sight behind the rooftops of the houses between us and it. it must have landed or disappeared. and never reemerged.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":80299,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.235516505936644,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082016-0011","longitude":-118.50405194900269,"occurred":-170812800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478643476000,"summary":"Large pulsating red light hovered over neighborhood and descended is if to land.","tags":["flash","light","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1480410593461,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/80299_submitter_file1__UFODearbornSt.jpg"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":-25399.75,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-55573,"maxtempi":-99999,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":-55573,"meantempi":-99999,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-55573,"mintempi":-99999,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":-9999.9,"snowfallm":-25399.75,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":-25399.75,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-55573,"maxtempi":-99999,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":-55573,"meantempi":-99999,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-55573,"mintempi":-99999,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":-9999.9,"snowfallm":-25399.75,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"91343","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":19090,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48785"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82750,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":339}
