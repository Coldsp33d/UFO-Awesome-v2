it happened. \r\n \r\n\r\nit started one evening in the summer i think it was june 1963 or 1964. i can't remember if i was 11 or 12. my cousin and i were the same age and we were on our way to our grandmother's house who lived near the lake of the ozarks in missouri. to the best of my recollection they were also two adults in the front seat of the car both of them were my aunt's, one was my cousin's mother and the other one was her sister our other aunt.\r\nwe were on our way from st.Louis to spend time at my grandmother's house. my cousin lived with my grandmother at the time but she must have ridden up in the car to pick me up i can't remember how that circumstances happened. i just know we were both in the car and i believe there was two adults in the front seat and we were driving down highway 21 heading toward lesterville missouri. i don't know the time i just know it was very dark outside this is a country road very windy with no street lights no lights of any kind so it's totally pitch black. we were the only car on the road that we could see and there were no other lights until this bright light appeared from behind us. we could see out the back of the car a bright bright light coming toward us and it just kept coming until we were engulfed in this bright light. we could not see any shape only bright lights, everyone in the car was totally silent it was like we were floating and in a trance of some sort. no one was talking, or screaming and no one was afraid. it doesn't make sense to me  why we would not have been talking or afraid or something. w\r\nwhy was everybody just silent and in a trance-like state. it was really strange. it was just like we felt numb or something. and then right next to us close enough that we felt like we could reach out and touch them there were two greys which we could only see from their side view from the shoulder up. then they both turned and looked at us in unison. i don't understand why we weren't afraid and everything was totally silent.\r\n\r\n i don't know how long we were looking at them or they were looking at us. i don't know how long because we were in limbo of sorts, because we were not driving on this curvy road anymore and because i didn't feel the car moving. nothing really makes sense. \r\nafter the grey's were done looking at us they turned in unison again back to the position they were in before they turn to look at us originally.  it was almost like they were  looking out the front of something. \r\nwe had to be up in the air or something because otherwise we couldn't have been at the same level as the greys were.  because we were in a car on the ground it doesn't make sense. so i'm assuming either the whole car was lifted up or just we were. i just know we felt like we were floating.\r\n\r\nat some point we were then driving again still no one was speaking about it, no one acted like anything had happened.  then we saw the bright light go in front of us. this bright round light which took off really fast going straight in front of us then shot up to the side and then when at another angle and then went straight up and disappeared.\r\ni have no idea of the time lapse how long anything happened. i don't really know  if we were in the same location  after the incident happened as we were before it happened or if we were  closer to the house  we were going to. but when we arrived at my grandmother's house nobody talked about it nobody mentioned it no one acted afraid it was like it really never happened. then either the next day or the day after we started to talk about it a little bit and one of my aunts aunt's drew pictures of what we saw. back in those days i had no idea what an alien was, or what  a grey was.  the pictures that my aunt drew at the time which i don't have access to now, looked exactly like a grey. i had no idea what an alien or grey looked like at that time in my life. i don't think aliens or ufo's had ever been mentioned to me before this, incident but i know what i saw and it looks like exactly what grey's are depicted to look like now. it was a whitish grey smooth type of skin with big slanted eyes barely any nose and very small mouth no ears. i don't remember the expression on the greys face ever changing.\r\n my family discussed it a little bit throughout the years but i don't really think that most of them believed us.\r\nbelow is the account of my cousin who was there too.\r\n\r\n\r\nhello, this is my account of what happened on one summer night in the year 1963/1964 (not sure which year).\r\ni was either 11 or 12 depending which year. my grandparents and i lived in lesterville,mo. \r\n63654. on route 21 cross street is county road 362. we had a 2 1/2 acre lake in front of the \r\nhouse, it was about 4-6 miles east of the town of lesterville. \r\ni believe the encounter took place during that summer at night ( not sure what time but it was dark out) on hwy 21 the roads are curvy with some hills. passengers in car were my aunt( has since passed) and i believe my mother( has since passed) was driving, our aunt didn’t drive, also my cousin and myself were in the back seat, not sure if i was on the driver side or not. there was no traffic out on the hwy keep in mind the population in lesterville at the time was around 240 give or take a few.\r\n it was dark in the car at the time. then there came a bright light from behind our car, so i’m sure we all thought it was another car. the light came up very fast from behind and then inside our car it became lit with light and the car we thought was coming up from behind was next to us, i think it was on the passenger side. i didn’t see that it was a car but saw that we and they were in a light ( it seemed like we were both in a \r\ndome of light). it seemed like we just floated a little with them above the road i don’t remember anyone talking or moving inside our car, it was like we were in suspended time and in slow motion, when i did turn my head to look at the light to my right all i remember seeing is two shapes that looked like smooth heads with big oval eyes, neck and shoulders. both turn \r\nsimultaneously to look at us and just stared as we in turned stared back at them, not sure how much time had passed. they \r\nturned simultaneously to look away. i don’t remember moving at all. after that we saw the light go in front of us and disappeared. we were silent all the way to the house. i don’t know what time we arrived at the house and i don’t remember driving the rest of the way to the house. when we got to our grandparents house no one there said anything to us that we seemed different, so i can only assume we appear normal.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

as if you could step off of the back of the boat and walk on the water. about 45 minutes into the watch 5 captains and 40 crew notice a red white and green(blueish) light blinking to the sw(cuba keys

in a triangular motion under the water and then resurfaced about tree level. the captain once again called the other captains and sa are you seeing this.All agreed.That's when he decided to call the coast guard to see if there was anything going on that they knew of.5 minutes pasted and they replied nothing that they were aware of. at that point the lights started getting closer at least to our boat. we all agreed that this was really weird and something none of us had seen before.All the captains agreed that we recall the coast guard and report a possible boat in distress. coast guard said they would send a plane out and check it out.  15 to 20 minutes later we could hear the plane approaching and the lights disappeared underneath the water. the coast guard scanned 1800 sq miles and reported back to us they had found nothing.  we told them when they showed up that the lights had quit. they return to the base.   15 minutes after the plane had returned the lights reappeared but

mail, vu avec directeur national.\r\n\r\npremier ã©vã©nement :\r\netant enfant, j'ai plusieurs fois vu un \"petit bonhomme\" dans ma chambre lorsque je dormais. je n'arrive pas ã  me souvenir prã©cisã©ment de son visage, jusque sa forme ã©tant celle d'un enfant dans le noir et qu'il ã©tait trã¨s fin.\r\nil me montrait des choses que je ne comprenaient pas, mais qui me faisaient peur, ã  travers une sorte de \"bulle\" entourã© d'un halo. \r\nlui n'ã©tait pas dans la bulle, il ã©tait un peu devant et ã©tait prã©sent dans la chambre et ce que je voyait ã  travers cette bulle semblait bien rã©el (pas comme s'il s'agissait d'un ã©cran, mais plus comme une fenãªtre).\r\n\r\nje comprenais ce qu'il me disait quand je le regardais dans les yeux, il n'ouvrait jamais la bouche. \r\n\r\nje me souvient parfaitement ne pas aimer du tout ce que je voyait dans cette bulle. il me \"faisait penser\" ou plutã´t me martelait dans la tãªte qu'il ã©tait bon et que ce qu'il me montrait ã©tait mauvais, je me souvient ressentir qu'il ã©tait bon, je me sentais bien quand il ã©tait prã©sent. \r\nune fois, cette bulle ã©tait trã¨s grosse et j'ai pensã© \"je ne veux pas ãªtre seul avec ce mã©chant\". la bulle est devenu plus petite et le petit bonhomme c'est mis devant, il ma regardã© et j'ai entendu dans ma tãªte \"ne t'inquiã¨te pas, s'il revient je serait lã , tu n'as rien a craindre\". il me disait souvent que je n'avais pas ã  avoir peur.\r\n\r\nil voulait parfois que je rã©agisse ã  ce qui se passait. je pointais des choses sur la \"scã¨ne\" qu'il me montrait en pensant, \"il va faire ã§a\", il va arriver ã§a\", etc.\r\nle petit bonhomme semblait trã¨s attentif ã  ce que je pensais. je m'en souvient car il avait une sorte de tã©lã©commande dans la main qu'il pianotais ã  chaque fois que je dã©signais quelque chose.\r\n\r\ndeuxiã¨me ã©vã©nement:\r\nvers 23 ans (j'en ai 31 aujourd'hui), j'ã©tait en foret, la nuit, avec mon tã©lescope et j'ai vu un point lumineux venir vers moi, j'ai alors pensai ã  un satellite. mais en se rapprochant, je l'ai trouvã© rapide et plus gros qu'un satellite, je me suis alors dis que c'ã©tait l'iss (quand on observe les astres, on s'habitue ã  voir des satellites ou l'iss briller dans le ciel).\r\nmais j'ai vu un autre point de la mãªme taille le suivre, je me suis dis \"deux satellite qui se suivent ???\", j'ai trouvã© ã§a ã©trange.\r\nle premier point s'est arrãªtã© d'un coup presque au dessus de moi, lorsque le deuxiã¨me l'a rejoint, le premier est parti ã  toute vitesse ã  90â° et le deuxiã¨me l'a aussi suivi et les deux ont disparu au milieu du ciel.\r\ncela c'est passã© trã¨s vite mais lorsque j'ai regardã© ma montre, je me suis rendu compte qu'il me manquait une heure. je me suis dis \"pas

morning hours of october 5, 1979, mr. aldo natoli (38) waked up like every morning. he worked a dustman and street-sweeper in varese. at 3am he washed his face, got dressed and drank his usual coffee. round 3:20 am he left his house, trying not to slam the entrance door avoiding to wake his little daughter and his wife, still sleeping. then he walked out toward the garage where there was his motorbike, a vespa 50 motorcycle. once he reached the garage, he pushed his motorbike without switching it up to avoid any noise that could wake up his family members. he took a look around his garden and walked for few meters with his motorbike by his side until he arrived at the beginning of his private short road made of stones. he took from the pocket the rest of a cigarette he didn’t smoke the day before and put it on his lips and he started up his motorcycle. half way of his private road, between two pine trees, on the left side, he saw two dwarfs 70 or 80 centimeters if height. they looked like puppets and they hovered 20 centimeters from the soil. they were meager and very agitated, jumping here and there, floating in the air. and appeared to be colored in blue, their faces too. their face was skinny and human. their human eyes were staring at aldo and he could not figure out anything about their intentions. meanwhile he realized his motorcycle switched off even if front light was still on illuminating the little thin men. he tried to take couple of steps toward them but when he was about to touch them, they suddenly disappeared. he then went back inside to tell his experience to the rest of the family. his daughter and wife suggested him to notify everything to the police. he was not afraid but only curious to know who were those little entities in blue.

three quiet steps in the snow. so i was really scared because i thought there is a person on my property so i yelled \"hello!? is somebody there?\" and noone reaponded. i was listening with my window open for about 5min until i noticed an orange light on the left side of the church in my town. i thought it was an airplane but then i remembered that they only have green and red lights. so i was like \"what the hell is this?\" i watched alot of alien documentaries so i was really scared because i think that is a ufo then the light moved a little bit right i could tell that because of the

living room. i got up to let my two dogs out in the backyard which is paralell with interstate 20 in weatherford tx, as i approached the backyard at around this time of night it is almost pitch black outside because of nearby bussiness's that turn off their lights completely to save money i'm geussing.. almost every light except for a few in every mile is off around this time including the big advertising signs that are across the street from my house so the night sky is very beautiful at this time, being able to see constellations very clearly. well right before i was going to open my sliding door to let my dogs out i had noticed two strange pulsating lights traveling towards me, because as i stared at them i was in awe and also trying to figure out if they were just airplanes or maybe choppers but then i noticed that these objects had pulsating lights that seem to have changed colors from a white to a orange then from orange to a red and from red to gold it was pulsating but strangely turning colors at a very slow rate like nothing i have seen before, so as i was in awe just watching them i saw the object to the left started to change direction in a zig zagging pattern and all of a sudden it went from being close range to the other object to almost immediately traveling a great distance to the west and descending as it traveled then it just hovered and slowley traveled west and then came to a stop and hovered at a distance while the other object was traveling toward my house as i focused my attention on the closer object it started to take shape because of how close it was getting. again i was in complete awe so i just stood there watching this object pulsate the same kind of lights as the other one and was zig zagging at slow rate till it got closer then again this object came to a complete stop and hovered about 40 degrees from my sight i could tell it completely stopped because it was on the the other side of a electrical poll in my backyard so i could tell if it was moving or not about a couple minutes of just standing there watching i started to notice almost like a faint beam come down from the bottom of the top shape object and about four or five white orbs started coming out of the bottom of this object at that point i was getting kind of freaked out because i have never seen anything like this before in my life. i was in the marine corps and had seen my fair share of aircraft,flares and explosives etc.. so as this was happening i ran in the house from my porch and got my phone to try to capture what was happening i was only gone for about a minute, but when i returned i could only see both of the bigger objects but none of the orbs that had dispersed. so before these were gone i wanted to get some pictures on my phone. unfortunately i thought my camera and video camera would have caught a decient picture or video but it just was not suffient enough to get good details or shapes just little dots in the sky if i tried to take a good photo but i will still include them below. besides the camera i actually had gone outside and was able to continue to observe these objects at a hover in the sky for the next 15 minutes or so before disappearing completely from view. after this first sighting i saw only one object within the next week or so in the same part of the sky with the same lights and shape but in different directions and altitude.
