(i did use my flash, but the inverse square law would negate any issue as it drops off to 1/100 the power after only 10 feet). i took a few in the exact spot, and took a peek. i suddenly saw this bright light in the top left area! it was not there 1 second prior, nor after. (there were no airplanes or helicopters or drones, and even then, they flash a red warning beacon, not as bright as the moon. it was not a meteor as there would have been more in the photos. i cannot explain what this is! in the photo, you see a cloud and if you look close, 2 orb like reflections, and 1 small one near the bright white light. i have included a photo i took to show the same area w/o the light. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":80298,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7224937,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082016-0010","longitude":-73.9982813,"occurred":1478628300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Saturn-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478631735000,"summary":"Sudden bright light appeared in photo ","tags":["photo","flash","light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1480410593290,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/80298_submitter_file1__DSC0050.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/80298_submitter_file2__DSC0052.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"New York, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:49422"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Compton","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am a keen amateur astronomer with every chance i get i am looking up at the night sky, i've had a great interest in space since being a child, and have always believed our planet can not be the only planet to have intelligent life. i'm 34 years of age now and i can tell the difference between satellites, shooting stars, aeroplane's in the night sky.\r\ni feel that i should explaine this first before i described what myself and a ex work colleague saw this night.\r\nthe time must have been about 9:30pm i was stood on my front porch having a cigarette looking at the sky as it was a very clear night. i was looking three stars in particular not for any particular reason tho. they was positioned in a vertical line with centre star off side slightly to the left as i started to look elsewhere in the sky for a few minutes i looked back at these three stars and the central star i noticed was not in off side to the left but  more to the right thinking it must be a different star come in to view but then thinking it's a very clear night and it didn't look right. as i was thinking this the same central star moved to the left then stopped for a few moments and moved again to the right but a lot further this time and stopped again. i knew straight away this was no star despite looking like one when stationary so it's undoubtedly that this object was in space and not in earth's atmosphere.\r\nbe totally amazed at this i looked to see if this was the only object moving like this and i spotted one more quiet a distance away it looked the same a small white light moving very fast then slowing down moving zig zagging but this time i could just see a a dim light next to it moving as if it was two objects flying in formation. this was shortly followed by more lights coming in to view and within a hour of myself looking at all this there had must of been over hundred of these lights maybe even more, but what must be understood is that these were not separate sightings this was a mass sightings with all in view together.\r\nsome lights had more emerging from them there would be a few grouped together with six to ten lights in formation moving very fast. knowing that i needed to show someone what i was seeing i phoned my friend that lived locally i told him what i was seeing and he come to meet with me 100 yard's from my house and he also witnessed this event, this hole events lasted until the morning as it became lighter due to day light it was then that these mass moving lights became harder to see, i know this event happened through out the whole night as i stayed outside looking at these until the morning.\r\nthe following afternoon it was said on the evening news that this was a mass meteor shower witnessed by thousands of people, if this was the case a  meteor shower will all travel in the same direction and will burn up in the atmosphere! this did not happen with these lights i believe that this reason was suggested to stop people from thinking different,my only regret is that i had no camera good enough to view this but on more research i found that a lot if people in the uk did film this event and has been posted on youtube.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:59:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":80297,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.508316181668356,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-11082016-0009","longitude":-1.2409144456884025,"occurred":1352156580000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478628134000,"summary":"Mass sighting over hundred lights out of the earth's atmosphere","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":1480410593109,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"RG206NT","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1463,"locationName":"Compton, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:49423"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Roseville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving down a suburban area, talking on the phone(bluetooth), and as i was talking and driving i looked up and noticed this odd looking dark rectangle shape in the sky.  it seemed small to me because it was  high up , looked like 1/2 inch big .  it didn't seem to be moving, but stationary...I wondered if it was a kite...But it didn't move like a kite...I just kept staring at it the whole time i was driving, yet i had to also keep my eyes on the road, so i went back and forth watching the road, and staring at this object, that seemed so odd to me...Then when i ended the conversation , i looked up and it was gone...And i looked around as much as i could while driving...But didn't see it again....Then when i got home i googled rectangle shaped ufo's, and found all kinds of these rectangle shaped sightings reported .","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:07:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":80296,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.0060767,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082016-0008","longitude":-93.15661070000002,"occurred":1478364480000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478627461000,"summary":"I was driving, talking on bluetooth, saw this dark rectangle shape high in sky, it was daylight..","tags":["ufo","light"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1480410293497,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":22,"maxtempi":72,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":13,"meantempi":56,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":8,"minvisi":5,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":22,"maxtempi":72,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":13,"meantempi":56,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":8,"minvisi":5,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Roseville, Minnesota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:49424"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Crumlin","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on the phone with work out my backyard. it was about 5.30 - just hitting dusk for the time year here. i looked up to see a large black diamond/cone shaped object flying from the direction of the airport near by. a few miles away it seemed, maybe more. it appeared to wobble as it moved. it suddenly changed direction and flew nw anyway from me into cloud cover which is when i managed to take picture after trying to end phone conversation!

 :)  here is the story....\r\ni was driving in my minivan with my two daughters, dropping my 9 year old son off at swimming at 6pm. it was dusk, but still light outside. we noticed a plane with a small trail traveling west very high..There was a bright star-like light underneath it. i told him it could be a star, or a planet...Not necessarily a ufo.  we figured it was not a plane, because it did not seem to be moving and did not have any blinking lights.  my son suggested i take a photo of it \"just in case\", so i grabbed my phone, however when we both looked again 2 seconds later, the plane with the trail was still there, but the star-like light  was gone.  i thought it odd that the light disappeared so quickly.  (that it didn't fade first or move to a different direction)\r\nlater that evening when we picked him up from swimming at 7:42pm, it was dark outside.  after getting him in the car, i purposely drove to an adjacent parking lot where we could get a good view of the west horizon, to quickly see if there was anything \"going on\" in the sky.  as i turned the vehicle around, i saw something bright in the distance out of the corner of my eye.  i continued to turn my car so i could get a good view and could not believe my eyes when i saw multiple very bright lights huddled together in the far, distant horizon.  they were low, just above the distant treeline.  we were facing sw.  while they look small in the video, you could tell the lights were covering quite a large area, spaced apart, and very bright...They seemed to be pulsing slightly (maybe?)...They definitely were not static.  they lit up the whole area where they were located.  they were making the triangular and chevron shapes and i literally could not believe this was happening.  when you hear the audio you will laugh at both of our responses to what we were seeing.  i continued to film them.  some moved to the left out of our site around a distant building.  there were any planes in the sky that night, as it was friday night in chicagoland.  my thought was that these lights looked exactly like many of the recent ufo videos i have been seeing lately...Charlotte nc, and others that i have looked up online in the past few years.  my son agreed...He could not believe his eyes.  my other thought was that they were stacked up planes flying toward us.  i do believe a couple of the outskirt lights were actually planes flying in to land at midway or ohare, maybe at first coming toward us, then circling around.  but as i kept watching them, they were just too strange looking and too stationary for too long of a time.  my son started dying of thirst and my girls were getting antsy, so i had to finally reluctantly leave the scene. but by that time, as you will see, the lights had pretty much left my sight or were fading away.    \r\nwhat was making this whole event even more strange to me, was that i have been extremely interested in ufo's for the past month or longer.  i've always had an interest as a child and teen, but my interest (even more of a recent obsession) was rekindled a month and a half ago when i watched a documentary on netflix, and with the recent releases of wikileaks emails from john podesta.  i have been researching recent reports and sightings on the internet every spare moment i had, and believe this or not, but i felt like \"something was going to happen\" for the past several weeks. (it has been my experience that when i have this feeling about anything, something does happen) but this feeling was not necessarily a good feeling...I have been kind of unnerved and weirded out by this feeling and this new/old obsession.  anyway, it is because of this, that i had to literally blink several times during this sighting, because i just could not believe i was witness to this so early on in my obsession!  :)   if it was stacked up planes, so be it, but i do believe that the more i look in the future, the more i will find, and that is very exciting to me!!!!

startled. omg what's that pointing up. when i looked up i saw a fire ball. coming from roughly the nw area. first thought was a ufo. as i have seen many videos and documentarys about sightings. i immediately remembered seeing other videos about the same thing i'm witnessing. as it comes closer i try and quickly grab my camera to record. as i get my phone out it it just about above us. watching on my phone while recording it looked more like a firey plasma ball rotating and pulsating wihile moving sort of se strait over head. no noise no trail no planes or helicopters. the sky seems silent. there were some clouds in the sky not to many. besides, this object was well underneath the clouds. as the object was just about out of view the guy who checked the doors comes back out. as the girl and i are starring up in total shock and awe on what we saw. he was only able to see the last few seconds. it was a very peaceful , beautiful and surreal moment. i myself am and always have been a
