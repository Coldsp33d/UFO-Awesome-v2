houghton and old vail road tucson arizona. son prior to entering the vehicle just happened to glance at altitude of aircraft  and notice an object sitting there just hovering. he pondered for a moment and then he told his mother what he was seeing. his mother also looking in this same direction. (as a side note; after coming to the united states, taught wife to just ponder the heavens viewing satellites, falling stars and other objects for which she would be literally stunned, opening up a whole new world, often bringing to my attention objects of question). \r\nwife & son then departed walmart in direction of valencia & old vail road. they headed towards kolb. the object suddenly appeared on the northwest side of the intersection above the gas station (cannot remember the name of the gas station). family pointed out, they sat there at the light just in shock and amazement at this object. also too, nobody in the local area driving even noticed this object. family turned left at the light, and soon after turning onto s. kolb rd, pulled over; perhaps a block on the right hand side gravel lot in front of an rv consignment business. this large object also appeared in front of them and lowered to within 40 feet of the vehicle.\r\njeep remained running, no electrical fluctuations in, nor other issues. the object which was now about 40 feet in front of them (i don't know altitude exactly), son said it was 40 - 50 feet in altitude, with strobing white lights. he said it looked like it was all in a pattern (row), but pulsating at the same time with two rows of lights an upper and lower rows, close to each other. they said it was alternating but the lights were not together, only both rows alternating in same pattern but not in exact same distance from each other. t\r\nthe object then inverted itself in a 45 degree angle and it then shot to the right which is on the right hand side of the road, on side the rv business nestled within the treeline, heading in the direction of pima air and space museum on wilmot road on valencia after ddisappearng below the tree line. family could not see past this business, nor the departing altitude only the it had to be very low over the desert floor. to the right side also\r\non site, is a ravine down to the desert but is a minor grade. \r\nmy family sitting there dumbfounded and shocked to what the just witnessed. upontiac arriving back at the house i questioned whether anything in regards to video or photos; anything to explain what they had just experienced, only shock & awe about the whole event, just so amazing but little apprehension what the experienced. \r\nhe did roll the window down but that was as far as i know. stated object approximately school bus size, only a sillowett as to what it looked like. this event was within 1.5 miles of davis-monthan air force base. my wife stated she

highway (pch), just south of john wayne airport (orange county california). i was driving nissan truck with one seat. almost approaching pch,  we had clear view of airport.  all 3 of us noticed strange object floating with bright colors emitting from it  just south of and very near airport. \r\n\r\nit just caught our attention because of the way it was behaving.  not moving like normal aircraft.  i asked \"is that a helicopter?\".  by this time,  we are at pch.  so i stopped at light and turned off radio,  while we watched object come towards us.  it approached at slow speed and kind of floated and wavered.  we were excited and scared at the same time. asking \"what f is that?\"  i mean we were freaking out but couldn't take our eyes off it.  we  just stayed in the truck at the intersection in utter amazement while watching the event unfold.\r\nthere was no other traffic around so we were by ourselves.  the craft eventually almost directly floated over us.  it was huge.  i would say about 100 to 150 ft long.  it was an elongated diamond shape with extraordinarily bright lights of varying colors emitting from it.  it did not affect the vehicle in any way because i left, of course,  truck running.  it was eerily silent which made it more frightening. \r\nthe ufo then floated over to the coast and just hovered in the same place.  in a couple of minutes,  two fighter jets coming from the south up the coast heading towards ufo. when the jets got close enough for them,  i guess. in a split second,  the ufo went way up in the sky, looked like almost leaving atmosphere and stopped.  the ufo left like a tracer light behind it so we could follow it with our eyes.  stopped for a couple seconds then went off into space.  made the jets look like little toys.\r\n\r\none of the people that was there,  is a friend that i grew up with and known since 8th grade.  he was also roommate.  when we got back to apartment in newport beach,  my brother and other friends were there.\r\nwe were all amped up and told the story to them,  not sure we were believed.  the other occupant of truck was in denial and didn't want to talk about it.  in fact,  said \"i didn't see anything\".  i honestly didn't know what to do.  i wanted to report it but at that time in the mid 80's,  had no idea who to report it to.  i was in early 20's myself and kind of shy.  i almost called the orange county register but my friends didn't want to back me up.  so i lost my nerve...  i checked paper and watched news for the next couple of weeks and there was no reports on it at all.  while i realize this will be almost impossible to verify,  it feels good to write this down and report it.  it's a relief.\r\n\r\nthis sighting definitely had an impact on my life and certainly opened my eyes to new idea's and belief systems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

jets.\r\n\r\nit was at that point in the late day, when the sun is just starting to go down, so it was still very bright outside. the sky was extremely clear, and there was not a single cloud in sight anywhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nas i was driving south on route 1 in northeast philadelphia, i was passing right at the area of route 1 (roosevelt boulevard) and oxford avenue, and i was in the far left lane of the middle lane. i just happened to look up at the sky in front of me and to the left, when i noticed what i right away assumed to be just a white cloud stationary and not at all moving up in the sky.\r\n\r\nafter passing oxford avenue i got stuck at the next traffic light. i kept looking at the object and noticed that it was not moving at all, and that there were no clouds anywhere in the entire sky. as i kept staring at it, i thought it was a very starge looking cloud, and then very quickly realized it was not a cloud at all.\r\n\r\nwhen i realized this was not a bird, cloud, or an airplane or helicoptor, or any known aviation object i have ever seen before, i asked my passenger, \"do you see that up there?, what is that?\" he was amazed just like me and we sat in traffic for about 30-90 seconds just staring at it. it was not moving at all, niether were we. that is how we know it was not moving.\r\n\r\ni was driving, and because we both were staring in confusion at just what exactly we were looking at, it never occured to either one of us to get a photo of it with our phones. i'm not sure it would have turned out anyway. we started driving again, and i could see it starting to move downwards, or in the direction coming closer to  the ground. but it was very, very high up in the sky, and it was oviously very big.\r\n\r\nin front of me and to the left there were high trees, and we both lost sight of the object for a few seconds, then we saw it again after passing the trees off the side of the road. we came to another traffic light and were stopped. and then thats when we could see it more clearly, and we had the trees as an eye-sight-marker, as the object was in back of the foreground trees in our sight.\r\n\r\nso once we were stopped we could clearly see the object more visible in detail and how it was movong and traveling using the tree as a marker. it kept moving downward in back of the trees, and as soon as we started driving again, when we got out in the open more where the sky was more open and visible, thats when we saw them. 3 more of the same exact kind appeared out of nowhere to the left of the first object we saw.\r\n\r\nwe dont know if they were already there and were just obscured by the trees or not, but i only saw the one at first, when the viewable sky was all open for my vision. and like i stated above, it initially was not moving and was actually closer. the more we drove in it's direction (south) the further away it became. it was oviously movong very fast.\r\n\r\nthere were a total of 4 objects in the sky, and they were all the exact same shape and white-brightness, still not known if it was the sun refecting off the object making it so bright during that time of day, at least thats how i percieved what i was looking at. my passenger said that the other 3 to the left just dissapeared and then reappeared right in the air. i did not see that myself.\r\n\r\nthe description of the object:\r\n- it was a very bright-white, possibly from the sun reflecting off it's surface, and it was either the shape of a cigar, but it was tilted. and when it moved, it stayed titled, no matter which direction it moved, the tilt stayed. im not sure about the cigar-shape, but i would describe it more like this: if you took a frisbee and looked at it directlyin front of you looking at the side, so you not seeing a circle, but the other way, it would look like a sstraight line, but slightly ovaled, but then on top of that, tilt it so that the left end it pointed down and the right end is pointed up.\r\n\r\nthere were no colors or visible features, but it was also very high and far away to be able to clearly see it. when i thought it was traveling downwards closer to the ground, i really think it was traveling further away. that is how fast it was moving. it, and the other 3 just kept getting smaller and smaller, you could tell they were moving very fast. and as it moved, like i mentioned, the \"tilt\" of the object never changed.\r\n\r\nstill driving, i looked to the right up in the sky to see if there were more of these things, and that's when i saw, very, very high up, 3 jets/planes of some kind, looked to be classic silver/metal in color of a jet, traveling in the same direction as the objects. all 3 jets were moving what seemed to be slow compared to the other 4 objects. each jet was leaving a clear small air vapor behind itself which quickly dissapated.\r\n\r\nas soon as i turned my head away from the 3 jets to the right sky, i watched the 4 objects to the left start moving extremely fast, as if they just caught wind of the 3 jets coming their way. if these were, oviously, military jets sent up to observe or chase these objects, they would most likely have been sent from willow grove air force base in warminster, pennsylvania, which was roughly 20 miles away from our driving location. they must have gotten there quick, because when i first looked around after seeing the first object not moving at all, i saw nothing else anywhere. and the 3 jets were pretty high up.\r\n\r\nat this point we both observed the 4 objects, which seemed to be each about 2 miles apart from each other, and the other 3 further ahead now from the 1st object we witnessed, traveling at great speed, still with the \"tilt\" not changing at all, all 4 objects within 3 seconds, just took off southbound at incredible speed, and then they just dissapeared over the horizon.\r\n\r\nto describe the 1st object, as it was stationary and not moving in better detail, it just hung in the sky, like a cigar, tilted, shining very bright white, as if the sun was reflecting off it, i am pretty good at judging distance with my eyes, so just a guess, i would say it was about 1-2 miles in length, and roughly about 5-6 miles away. i really wish i could have got a photo of it when is was just sitting there in the sky, but i was driving and it all happened to fast.\r\n\r\nthis was the first time for both of us ever seeing an object we could both say was a ufo for sure. if it was a black-project type object, who knows. but we are absolutely both sure of what we witnessed, and this was not a mistaken known aircraft. and also we both have never seen such a thing, or expected to ever see such a thing in this area of northeast philadelphia where we were at the time.\r\n\r\nthe entire thing was very strange. we did look around at other drivers to see if they were looking up at it too, and we did not see anyone looking at it. although, people were driving, it would have been hard to have witnessed it, unless you were stuck at a light, and just happened to look up.\r\n\r\ni even had my window rolled down with my head out the window, so i know my vision was not obscured in anyway. that was it. the objects vanished once they took off southbound at an incredible high rate of speed, staying at their \"tilt\" in the sky, and 30 minutes later, the sun was gone and that was the end of it. we witnessed nothing else afterwards as we drove in the opposite direction going home.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

puerto vallarta. our state room was facing directly west and we were off the southern california coast at the time of the sighting. it was about 12:45  am the morning of november 5, 2016 when i had gotten up to use the bathroom. i looked out our balcony window and noticed fog all around us - we were going through patches of fog. \r\n2. there was suddenly a clearing in the fog, when i noticed  a dull orange light to my left with two red streaming lights shooting upwards from the orange light that seemed far away. mind you, we are out in the middle of the ocean at almost 1 am, so there were no other lights up until this point.\r\n3. at first i thought it was another boat shooting off flares, so i just went back to bed.\r\n4. i didn't see any more action from the object since i went to lay down.\r\n5. i felt confused because i didn't know what i had just seen, and scared because i knew what i had seen wasn't supposed to be there. the feeling i got was it wasn't \"normal\". about 10-15 minutes later, my wife woke up to use the bathroom. she then looked out the balcony window as well. she stood there for a couple of minutes, then called me over to \"come look at this\". when i looked out the window, i saw the same orange light along with 1 other light to the right. my wife saw three lights that formed a trinangular shape to her left and another light to the right, that seemed to be moving toward us. i was in disbelief so i wasn't trying to pay too much attention to detail and i had not said a word to my wife about what i saw before she woke up. we both were in disbelief and also a little freaked out so we decided to stop looking and lay back down. i got back up after a few minutes out of curiosity to see if the lights were still there. this time i still saw the same two lights as before, but now there was an enormously bright row of white lights moving towards the cruise ship. it was so bright that i couldn't tell what shape it was, but it stopped about 100 feet away from the port side of the cruise ship. it seemed to hover but stay along side the ship as the ship was moving, and also slightly hover to the left and right of the ship but still within my view from the balcony window. at this point, my wife got up again and looked out the window to see the same thing when we both started hearing a strange sound that we can only attribute to the strange lights. it sounded like layers of several different noises at different pitches - something similar to what you'd hear in the movies but nothing like what we've ever heard before. it seemed odd that we could both hear this strange noise, but we could not even hear the ocean outside our balcony door because of how well insulated the room was. the noise was loud but didn't even wake up our 2 daughters sleeping next to us. this really freaked us out so we went back to bed and decided not to get up again, although we could still hear the noise. by this time it was already close to 2:00 am. keep in mind that from the time of the first sighting around 12:45 am to the last sighting around almost 2 am, the lights were still within our balcony view meaning they were moving with the cruise ship as we are making our way up the coast. \r\ni'm almost certain there were others that had to have seen this as well.\r\ni would highly recommend pulling the surveillance video from carnival miracle between the times of 12:45 am to 2:00 am on 11/5/2016.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

appeared to be coming my way. it was pretty low but also pretty far away so i assumed it was a plane or a helicopter in the distance, especially since it appeared to blink ever so often.. i sat down and lost sight of it, only to then see it rising up over my fence. i scratched the idea it was a helicopter or a plane because it was moving too slowly and kinda straight up like. i thought oh wow i'm actually seeing the stars rise. but no, stars don't rise like that and it was brighter than all the stars/planets i could see and while it was moving in a straight up fashion, everything else in the sky (minus the actual planes and helicopters) appeared still. i photographed the object while it was still pretty low. you can see a couple stars in the photo with the object. the object is super bright. after i took the photo i started recording. i recorded the object fly straight up into the sky. unfortunately my phone was going to die so i had to stop the video, but shortly after i did,  it hovered over what was a star/planet and then it just disappeared. i felt like it stopped because it knew i saw it as ridiculous as that sounds. the only thing i could think it could've been is a drone with a bright light attached to it that maybe flew as high as it could before malfunctioning and crashing  or losing its light, or maybe a rocket being sent to the space station (supplies or whatever), bt if it wasn't one of those things then it had to be aliens or some advanced craft the general public isn't privy too. whatever it was, i've lived by airports my whole life, i live near two now, and march air force base isn't too far away, but i've never seen anything do what this object did. it was actually pretty terrifying.\r\n\r\nthe first uploaded file is the video, the second
