witnessed 3 red lights in a straight line from left to right taking up about one inch of space in the sky and another light about half inch in the sky below it. the three lights stayed stationary while the light below it drifted off to the the right slowly. the line of three lights slowly went dim to blackness and started reappearing while the little light slowly went black. this happened about three time til the line of lights completely disappeared and did not return. the little light went out and came back a few times. then remained dark for about 5 seconds, then reappeared and floated off the right flashing a few more time then completely disappeared. i would say the objects were a few miles away from us to the south, maybe 3 or 4 miles at the most. we drove to the south to pursue but never saw the lights again.  \r\n\r\nwe live in the flight path of columbus airport and there were planes off to the east coming into the flight path at the time. we are very familiar with

slowly. that object actually got within 300 or 400 feet from us and made no sound as it traveled very slowly past us. we witness that for atleast 8 minutes above the fairway on the golf course. the 3

a cigarette and was watching an object that was a white orb with blue pulsing or blinking lights at random times and what looked to be a constant red light to my se almost above the centennial area of gresham oregon. it was very high up in the sky so at first i thought it was either an airplane or a satellite, but after watching for a few minutes the airplane was ruled out because it seamed to just hover in the same area, making small variations (as i could see them being 3-4 inches up or down, left and right, or in a circular motion at times from my perspective) after watching these movements it then entered my mind it could be a satellite or some such space object.  but as i continued to watch it starts heading up and in a more southern direction almost like it was leaving the atmosphere, and it was starting to get smaller so i went inside to continue watching tv.  then i went out about 2 hours later around 5:40am for another smoke, looked to the same spot and it was gone, so at first i thought nothing of it, but as i walked down my driveway and looked back over my right shoulder at my neighbors house i noticed the same object and it had moved off more to the right of where it had been (moved more to the south) and continued the strange hovering motions i had observed hours before.  seeing it the second time made me think ufo finally because as far as i know satellites do not move such distances they either orbit or are geosynchronous and don't move in the night sky (but i might be wrong). now i didn't watch it in the hours i was inside but even as of right now writing this it is still in the same section of sky i last spotted it at. i'm not exactly sure if it was really anything or not but to me it definitely was an unidentified flying object.","distance":"Over One

pch in encitintas, ca. it was around 7:45pm, very dark outside. we were on the way home from dinner. my father was driving, we were headed south, and i was in the passenger seat looking westward out of my window towards the ocean. we were listening to music and i was admiring the way the ocean looked at night... i was day dreaming and zoning out a bit and noticed there was a beautiful light being cast on the ocean from the moon just like you see in paintings... but then i snapped out of my day dream and started thinking about the fact that it was a new moon, and there's no way the new moon could be casting a light like this! so i looked closer and the only thing above the light that was being cast over the ocean was a very bright, orange looking star type object. i told my dad to pull over because i was really confused and wanted him to see what i was seeing so that he could help me make sense of it.\r\n\r\nmy dad pulled over along pch, and we got out and walked onto the beach and just stood there staring at this thing. the object was an orange-red light... it was pulsing. the reason i thought it was a star at first was because it definitely seemed like it was pretty far away. but as i was observing it i realized that it was way too bright to be a star. so then i thought \"maybe it's a planet that is really close to earth right now.\" so i checked my \"planets\" iphone app and there were no planets in that part of the sky that night. besides, it was way too bright to have been a planet anyways, but these were just different steps in my thought process of trying to figure out what i was looking at.\r\n\r\nwe stood there completely perplexed by this object and the light it was casting over the ocean. there were no ships, oil rigs, airplanes, helicopters, etc. it's really difficult to even tell how far away this thing was. it felt like it was really far... like the distance of a star or another planet... but it didn't make any sense that it was casting such a bright light on the water just like a full moon would! and there was no beam of light shining down onto the water (like a search light)...Rather, the light being cast on the ocean seemed to be a reflection of the object, which once again, did not make any sense considering how small this object was!! to the naked eye, it was probably about 20x brighter than the way one of the brighter planets would look. it was orange and the light/reflection it cast on the ocean was orange as well.  i tried to take a photo with my iphone of the light but in the photo it wasn't really showing up, it just looked like an all black sky and a small orange dot.  and it was so dark outside that the light being cast on the water didn't really show up in the photo either. \r\n\r\nwe observed it sitting completely stationary for over 30 minutes. it was about the same size the entire time except that it was pulsing and once in a while it seemed to get brighter for a few minutes. it did not move at all. it didn't drift or get higher or lower. but right at the very end it (i would say for the last minute) it starting pulsing more obviously, and seemed to be fading/dimming as if it were moving farther away. in the last couple of minutes the light /reflection being cast on the water also started to fade a bit. and the suddenly  it blinked one time and completely vanished. me and my dad stood there in the dark on the beach so confused by what we just watched. it did not make sense. we waited for a few minutes to see if anything else would happen or if the light would come back but it was gone. \r\n\r\ni've been searching online to see if anyone else has posted anything similar to this but i haven't found anything so far! i am someone who pays pretty close attention to the moon and the stars and i'm always looking up at the sky. and it should also be noted that i've lived by the beach my entire life in this same area. i've never seen something like this. i'm a really logical person and my natural reaction is to rule out all the logical explanations before even considering that it could be something supernatural or extraterrestrial. but i'm at a loss and just wish i could find someone else out there who saw this as well!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":80194,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0460067,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11042016-0005","longitude":-117.2836418,"occurred":1477856700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478231966000,"summary":"Orange

flanking the object on either side. they appeared smaller than the first thing spotted. i was repeatedly telling my friend to speed up so i can get a photo of the object. after turning onto a different road that rose on elevation the first object dipped below the ridge line out of sight. but one of the other objects started to come closer into view. i kept telling the my friend to stop the car and said he would once we got to the campground further out the road. once there we pulled into the parking area and i jumped from the truck to try to take a pic... once out of the vehicle the object stopped and began hovering in place. i failed to see the object on my cell camera. so i just stared until something told me that i better leave. the hairs on my neck started to stand up. once we pulled back on the road the object began moving again. which was crazy... it continued moving out in front of our vehicle... we stopped again and again the object stopped as well!!! at this point my friend said let's go to your place and we'll be able to see it better. i told him he was crazy that there is no way we would be able to see it from my house. so we turned off the ridge road and began descending down the ridge toward my place. i tried to see the object out the back window but didn't see it.. after turning around a bend in the road i noticed the object up in the sky and it appeared to be following us. we made a left hand turn at the bottom of the road and continued on to my house... once there the object proceeded to move a little ways past my house and once again stopped in the sky. at this point i ran inside to grab a pair of binoculars to see the object better. i noticed something drop from the bottom of it looked like a small light. i then went into the house and woke my mother for her to see the object and also grabbed her cell phone. i was able to take pictures and video of the object and believe i also captured the small light that descended from it. the object made no noise whatsoever and continued hovering in the sky for well over a hour before we lost interest and went inside. now i've continued seeing strange lights in the sky almost every

(like one of these cheap fans you get at fairs that open and span out.) the red light was not blinking and was not strobing. and it fanned out more than once as we watched it before it went over our house. it almost seemed like it was scanning something. light was on the back of the \"thing\" moving left to right.  all we could do is just stand there and watch. sayings wtf is that. it was really quick by the time we saw it, it was going over our house. i ran up to the front yard and it hadn't moved slow once i got to the front yard. it was probably 1-2 miles away by that point. so it wasn't moving to fast over our house and hovering at moments. and it didn't take me that long to walk quickly from the back yard to the front yard (and i was walking fast) it was way off in the distance moving northwest.  it would have been moving parallel to hwy 75. i watched it as it became a black dot on the horizon- like a speck of black. it had to be 10-20+ miles away. i was facing north so we will say 12o'clock, it was at what would be the 55 on a clock on the horizon. there were clouds moving in at that time and it was on the side of the clouds where i could see it and then it looked like it shot upward at a high rate of speed. and was gone. i didn't see any cars following this thing. it was so far off in the distance i don't see how a drone could go that far on its own with out having something following it. and we don't have any drone delivery services in the dallas metroplex yet. because i have spent hours looking for this on the web. it did not have the structure of a drone. we have seen drones. and it didn't have the look of a drone - didn't have \"arms\" of a drone. it was not a drone i have ever seen or could find on the web. and the red \"searching light\" - couldn't find anything like it on the web either. \r\nthe entire thing was really weird and really eerie. i couldn't find examples of a boomerang or (i kept saying) it looked like a mini stealth bomber shaped thing. because that's what it looked like . it made no noise at all. the dogs in our neighborhood were barking and going crazy. our's were too. it was all really weird and i don't know how anyone couldn't have not seen this thing. it really didn't look like a drone. and the red light on it - couldn't see any red on it once it got over our house. that was one of the strangest things i have ever seen. and there were a lot of flights in the air that night. we aren't close to an airport. but not to far either. so our house seems to be in the direction of the flight path every once and while which i assume has to do with weather. there had to been planes that saw this. even tho it was much lower- seems like someone would have seen this. i saw planes off in the distance not far from this thing. i have spent hours looking for drone videos and nothing like this. which is really weird. i have no idea. maybe it was a drone. it was just an odd shaped one. truly unidentified.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":80182,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.800642161087744,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11032016-0010","longitude":-96.77532475454818,"occurred":1477247400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478193605000,"summary":"Saw solid black stealth bomber shaped ufo over my house no noise watched going nw  then miles away shot straight up and gone","tags":["video","sound","ufo","lights","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1480403693103,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":81,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":69,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":81,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":69,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"75214","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10,"locationName":"Dallas, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:50637"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Euless","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"   so i was watching game 7 of the world series last night, when i stepped outside for a smoke break during the rain out in the 10th inning. thats when i noticed a red light flying in my direction at a speed faster than a typical plane, i knew it wasn't an airplane because it had no flashing lights, it made no noise, it was a sphere glowing a bright neon red color. \r\n   the object stopped and the light went off. thats when i started recording in the vicinity where i last saw the ufo. i only had my cell phone, a samsung galaxy 6 edge + with a 16 mp camera. \r\n   suddenly the object reappears at 0:27 seconds into the video. it's stationary and goes off on on a few times. at 1:20 in the video you can see many other objects flashing on and off briefly around this red orb ufo. they kinda looked like glitter, in person.  to give an idea of the size and proximity of the object at 2:50 in the video i zoom out and zoom into a big passenger airliner that was taking off from dfw airport. the object looks big compared to the plane in the video, and much higher too. it looks like it could be hovering over the airport, or close enough to the airpot to not be a plane or a drone. i continued to record it until it started decending and moving north until i lost it over the tree line.

it didn't just appear. however, there was no apparent movement. it was also tough to guess its altitude or distance, but i would guess it was 1 to 3 miles away.\r\n\r\nwe thought it was an airplane landing light or a military flare, but it remained completely stationary. at some point i thought it might be a helicopter hovering over the ocean with its landing light on, but the wind was blowing directly from the east and we heard nothing except the waves breaking, and the light did not move at all. i believe that if it was a helicopter, we would have heard its rotor noise, and the light would have some movement because of the wind.\r\n\r\nthen, after approximately 2 minutes, another light came into view, just below, to the right and about a hand's width away from the first. it also appeared gradually and was completely stationary.\r\n\r\nwe stood looking at these two silent, completely stationary lights, and discussing what we thought they could be. it was somewhat eerie, and my daughter, 9 years old at the time, started getting scared and wanted to go back inside.\r\n\r\nthen, after a couple of minutes, the first light appeared to move back into the cloud bank and was no longer visible. the second light remained stationary for another couple of minutes, then it too disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe time interval between the second light appearing and the first light disappearing seemed to be equal. \r\n\r\nthe remarkable thing about these two lights were their complete lack of movement. i have seen parachute flares over the ocean, and you can clearly see them descending, and airplanes and helicopters are easily discerned after just a few seconds due to their movement. these things never moved an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":80179,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.99230842368108,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11032016-0007","longitude":-80.51080084857833,"occurred":1342382400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478177279000,"summary":"2 lights emerged from and retreated into cloud bank ","tags":["landing","lights","disc","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1480403393584,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":87,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":74,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":87,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":74,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"32951","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1571,"locationName":"Melbourne Beach, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:50640"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Rochester","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My brother and i witnessed this strange glowing object moving slowly through the sky above our house in rochester new york on aug 17th 2016. it appeared to have a ring of lights pulsating and circulating around the main structure of the body. the objects flight pattern was very slow and controlled. it did not look like it was blowing in the wind.\r\n\r\nthis clip is part of a series of recordings we took of this object during it's 45 minute appearance. it was such a large and unusual mass in the sky that we expected we would hear coverage on the local news or websites about a new drone test or weather balloon experiment, but nothing was ever reported and we couldn't find any local explanations.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

pollution.  as it was a very clear night sky and freezing i was looking at the sky.  i was walking along our lane, which runs in a due north direction.  there was the usual heavy air traffic which i was ignoring.  i noticed what i immediately assumed to be a satellite traversing from the north heading east. my 1st idea was to think it may be the space station but it was smaller and less bright than when i have previously seen it. so i then immediately thought it was a normal satellite and watched it with declining interest. after about 1 or 2 minutes i began to think that the light was travelling in a variable manner, changing transversing speed. this initself i did not think was odd. i have often been out with the dogs and when star gazing if i focus on a single star it often begins to appear to move about a little. just an optical illusion. however, the speed did seemed to becoming slightly more variable. this was sufficient to refocus my attention to it. very shortly after this i began to think that the object had stopped. the cessation of movement was not immediately obvious but after watching a couple of minutes it was definite that the light had stopped moving and was static. ( i am absolutely familiar with an aircraft changing its heading to that the lights appear to be static and it was nothing like this.) i became intrigued by this and stopped watched it stay in exactly the same position for more than 10 minutes. there was enough time for the dogs to stop sniffing about and settle at my feet. but have walking difficulties and it was freezing so after about 10 minutes i continued with toileting the dogs. the light remained in place. when i went back out at 2200 hrs the stars were still there but the light gone. i really felt this was odd so i went on the stellarium website.\r\nthis suggests the light i watched was coming from below polaris (this is the only star i actually know) and between cassiopeia and miphaak, heading toward almaak. stellarium indicates the track of the satellite sl-6 r/b(2) and luminosity are very similar to what i watched. it does appear to be almost spot on. the problem is satellites do not just stop and stay in the same position for 10 minites plus.  \r\ni am not reporting an et type sighting. but that i watched a light that appeared in space, travel below the star polaris and then stop. watched this for at least 10 mins before i had to move. the stars all visible later but the light was gone. i wish i had watched it longer but it was freezing, the dogs got bored and i have mobility problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n     ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":80173,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.74330399999999,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-11032016-0001","longitude":-2.013021,"occurred":1478110200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1478133363000,"summary":"Watched what i thought was a satellite but it stopped between cassiopeia and mipaak","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":1480403093292,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"HX7 ","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Hebden Bridge, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:50646"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Rochester","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We recorded this strange object over our house in rochester ny. it was moving very slowly and looked almost star like. once i zoomed in with my camcorder some unusual details emerged. the first clip shows the object at high altitudes and at various focal ranges. the trees serve as good reference points to how slow this appeared to be moving. the second clip shows the anomaly much closer just above the tree line. it looked like there was a ring of orbs or some mass circling within the object and pulsating. it was such a big mass in the sky we expected it would be covered on the news that night and speculated it was a new type of drone or weather balloon experiment. but nothing was ever reported and we couldn't find a local explanation to account for it.

the diamond. the 5th light remains the same distance from the formation in all there photos. these photos were taken seconds apart from each other within a 15-20 seconds period. i had no idea i had captured these lights until today, i just happened to show a friend some photos and i noticed what looked like an airplane but after further inspections it appears to be what i would describe as a

moving across the horizon to the north from right to left. i wasn't sure what the object was, but it didn't seem like a plane because there was only one light, and there were no blinking lights or other colored lights. the object moved slowly in a straight line. it appeared to be moving over the aep gavin power plant across the ohio river. however there was no real way to know how far away it was.  as i was watching the object, it suddenly went out/disappeared, and the low rumbling noise stopped immediately. this was the most disturbing part because it was obvious that the noise was associated with the light. if the noise had continued, i would have just assumed that the object went into cloud cover.\r\ni didn't get any video because it was so small, and i would have been
