was at my boyfriend's home and we had just had dinner. after that, we decided we wanted to do some stargazing, so we got a blanket and lied down. after maybe 5 ou 6 minutes i saw a light, which appeared to be a star, moving in a straight line. i asked my boyfriend if he could see it and said yes. after the first one appeared, we were absolutely astonished to find that there were about 20-30 similar lights following the first one. they all kept the same path and direction and didn't change distance between each other. in the \"middle\" of this line, there was an object that had a triangular shape. they flew through the entire sky for about 4/5 minutes and we lost them.\r\ni was in complete shock after the incident, but my bf calmed me down, we talked a bit about what we had just seen and kept looking at the sky. it was as if something wanted me to keep looking - at least that's what it felt like.\r\na few more minutes had passed when i saw what appeared to be a constellation that formed a line with about 4 stars, that stood very far from us and its light was very weak. i kept my eyes on it and then realized the line was moving. once again i showed it to my boyfriend and we were speechless. the line kept moving across the sky and the \"stars\"started to appear bigger and further away from each other, still in a line. then, the line \"broke\", because some moved to the sides. then, they just... multiplied. at first, one or two lights came out of each of them, but then we lost track because there were literally hundreds of lights, maybe about 200 or 300. they all blinked in a pattern, like christmas lights. then they slowed down and eventually disappeared. this lasted for about 20 minutes.\r\ni spent the rest of the night and the following day feeling uneasy about the whole thing, but eventually stopped thinking about it and got back to my normal life.\r\ni am a skeptic, for the most part, but this was quite the experience. the first encounter i can maybe attribute to some air-force training with maybe some high-tech planes, but the second one is unlike anything i've ever seen and i can't honestly understand what it was.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:21:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

house on a hill with the trees behind the house all lit up. i thought they were having a big party. as i went down the hill and closer to the house i saw the lights slowly move from the top of the trees to the field across the road. my first thought was that the people are losing their lights then i saw that the house was now completely dark. i saw the light had the shape of a cigar that my uncle used to smoke. i noticed that two cars and a truck were on the opposite side of the highway also stopped in the road obviously watching this light. i realized i needed to pull my car off to the side of the road in case someone came along. at that point it occurred to me that this light might be a ufo so i tried to remember everything i'd ever heard about them. first of all i had to make sure i was awake so i pinched myself then slapped myself as hard as i could, yes, i was awake! next, i turned the radio off then back on, no problem. next, i hesitated but i turned the engine off then tried to turn it back on, if it was really a ufo it probably wouldn't turn back on so i was afraid, it turned back on, no problem. i was a little disappointed but even more confused, what was this thing? i sat and watched it for another minute or so then i got out of the car. i stood in front of the car and looked at the big blue light hovering about 100 yards from me when it started answering my questions. after another few minutes it told me they had to leave but they would be back one day but it would be a long time since they had a long way to go. then they told me to watch and not to even blink. i watched while the blue light rose straight up several hundred feet, stopped for a few seconds then took off and was out of sight within a couple of seconds.\r\n","distance":"21-100

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"(note: this is part 2 of 2 total sightings that i experienced within a few hours of each other. the first sighting was submitted before this.)\r\n\r\nabout two or three hours had passed since the first occurrence. at this point i am inside my apartment sitting down. my state of mind at the time was relatively normal. i am calm and relaxed and had already concluded that the first occurrence was nothing too out of the ordinary, and i was very far away from thinking that i had witnessed something of extraterrestrial origin. so all is fine, and i am sitting at my desk working. then i start to hear something. i was unsure what it was initially, but soon realized it was growing louder, and coming closer. it was a loud roar that eventually started to rumble. i could feel the vibrations in the ground. i then recognized the sound as a helicopter. i first thought this is relatively normal because law enforcement does fly-overs this time of the year looking for illicit crops. i don't know why exactly, but for some reason i decided to go outside to look at it, perhaps because of how unusually loud it was (loud enough to wake people up when sleeping). so i open the front door, walk outside, and a few seconds later i see the exact same flying objects pass over as before. except this time they are within 200 feet of me. first the orb of solid white-yellow light, then the aircraft following it with at least 3 lights on it: 1 red, 1 green, 1 white; some of which are strobing. the following aircraft was close enough that i could easily see the outline of it. it was a helicopter. about 100 feet in front of this helicopter, was the leading object. this object was nothing more than a light, but the light had no source other than itself; it was literally a ball/orb of light. if this orb of light was coming from an aircraft or if it had any kind of physical structure, then i would have easily been able to identify it, because of how close i was to it. it also did not have a sound either, at least none that could be heard over the roar of the helicopter.\r\n\r\nanother odd thing i noticed is that the distance between the two objects was completely unchanging. the orb of light maintained a perfectly static lead on the helicopter. it's as if any slight change in acceleration by the helicopter was instantaneously measured and compensated for by the orb.\r\n\r\nafter both the orb and helicopter flew out of sight, i immediately felt sick. my mind could not comprehend what it had just witnessed. my heart raced, i began to shake with jitters from the adrenaline. after realizing this couldn't be explained, i began to question my own sanity. i had never seen a ufo before that night and suddenly i had seen two? was it trying to follow me? seconds after they left my view, i ran back inside to talk to my sister. i needed to know that i wasn't hallucinating. i was relieved to hear her say that she had heard and felt the roar of the helicopter, which helped calm me somewhat.\r\n\r\nafter that i quickly grabbed my camera drone and put it in the air as fast as i possibly could to try and get footage, although i was shaking so bad that i couldn't do so in a timely manner. by the time i had lifted off, they were totally out of sight. i did end up taking it up to about 1600 feet and spent the next 20 mins taking pictures of the night sky hoping to be able to find something. so far i havent seen anything out of the ordinary on them.\r\n\r\neven after all of this, i still had my doubt about the orb of light's true origin. but then the final nail in the coffin for me is when later that night a friend came over. i hadn't told her about what happened because i didn't want to seem crazy, but i did ask her \"have you noticed a lot of aircraft flying around recently?\" to my surprise she said that she didn't want to seem crazy but that her and her friend saw a flying disk hovering about an hour earlier with different lights on it. i was shocked and proceeded to tell her my story.\r\n\r\nokay, i'm going to stop typing now because this is getting to be excessive. i hope someone believes me because most of the people i've told so far just laugh in my face, but i do not care. i know what i saw, and i am not crazy nor have i ever been. hopefully there will be an explanation some day.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

experienced within 2 hours of each other. sighting 2 will be posted immediately after this.)\r\n\r\ni was driving home from charlotte, nc on i-85 heading northbound (actual direction is ne). it was dark, i was driving alone, and all seemed normal. as i was passing exit 70, a flying object appeared over the tree line to my left (north). a few seconds later, another flying object appeared from the same spot on the horizon. both objects were flying along the same flight path heading se. when i first saw the objects i did not think much of them, until i noticed the leading object did not have a strobe light. it was a constant white-yellow colored light that did not change in intensity. however, the following object did have a strobe light, among 1 or 2 other lights that were on that object. it appeared in every way to be a legal, terrestrial aircraft. the distance between the two flying objects was approximately 400-600 feet. both objects maintained this distance the entire time. about 30 seconds later the objects flew over the horizon (east of my position). \r\n\r\nmy overall impression of this first occurrence was that for the most part everything seemed normal. the thought of extraterrestrials only crossed my mind for a second, but i quickly dismissed this because of too many unknowns. although i could not understand why the leading object did not have a strobing light attached to it, as all aircraft that i have seen flying at night have this. this was what peaked my interest, and prompted me to do some research when i arrived home. with the help of the internet i found that the faa, an entity with supreme authority over america's airspace, requires all aircraft to have a strobing light turned on at night. i was puzzled, but continued to go about my usual business as i tried to put the occurrence out of mind.\r\n\r\nabout two hours later, a second incident occurred. this was when i knew for sure that something wasn't right. i am posting it as a separate report since it was at a different time and location.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

that is attached to me and it is not human. it (or they?) has been attached to me since i can remember. as i get older it is getting more and more aggressive. i wake up with very large bruises and welts consistently often in geometric shapes or patterns,this is not my concern though. my concern lies for those around me. people are beginning to notice unexplained bruising, scratches, night those errors, rashes, and ultimately becoming violently sick in my prescence. i've had instances where physical harm was done to those around me, such as being pushed on stairs or having doors slam on them. it comes and goes in long periods, but once it has made its presence known and it knows i know it's there, things get bad. i have many witnesses to attest to this, and at one point physical proof (all i can provide now is photographs). i had a very large un-human handprint burned into my bedroom door at my old house followed by another one, exactly the same burned into the wall next to my headboard. both the door and the wall had to be sanded down. i went as far as to ask for help from the catholic church, they wouldn't even pray with me and seemed disturbed by my prescence instantly. this thing has never made me feel personally threatened until recently. i found my picture of my family and i from when i was a baby fallen from my mirror and laying face down on my dresser. when i picked it up to put it back assuming it was a draft or the wind, i discovered that my face had been scratched out. i asked everyone in my family (grandparents, my mother and uncle) if it was them and they had no idea what i was talking about until i showed them. i am terrified to sleep at night, because i go into these fits of convulsions and screaming that are difficult to wake me up from and calculated sleep walking, neither of which i have any remembrance of afterwards. and by calculated sleep walking, i mean unlocking doors, undoing restrains to keep me from leaving my bed, and most concerning is leaving my home. i also went to a psychologist to talk about this problem in hopes that they would tell me that i am crazy but to my disappointment i was told in fact that i am completely in my right mind and that what is happening to me is very real. i have had a government based opinion(s) on the matter as well, those details old have to be discussed exclusively in person.
