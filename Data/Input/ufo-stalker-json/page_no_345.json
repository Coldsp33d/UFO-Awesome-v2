woke up approx dawn, and sat upright in bed. at the bottom of which was an oval shape filled with a gaseous/smoke approx 4ft x 3ft. inside this oval shape was what i can only describe as looking like a mirror ball only stationary but with the reflection of colours ranging from white to silver, light grey, pale blue pulsing in and out. the orb was reasonably bright but did not light up the room (i new it must have been near dawn as i could make out the faint outlines of things in the room). thinking i had something in my eyes i rubbed them then when that didnt work pulled my top eyelids over my eyes to dislodge anything that may have been in my eyes ( maybe an old wives tale) but that didnt work either the orb was still there.  then for some reason just laid back down to sleep .The vision would have lasted no more than about 30sec. when i woke up in the morning about 2-3 hours later i remembered nothing of what i had seen.\r\n\r\napprx 2-3 days later just as i was about to leave for work my wife said that she had something unusual to tell me and that she had seen something strange.That is when my experience came back to me.I told her not to say anything else and that i would talk to her about it when i got back home but that i think i know what she meant. when i arrived back home that evening straightaway i told her not to say a thing but to follow me, wherase i led her to the bedroom and said right here gesturing to the bottom of the bed while making an oval shape with my hands. she said exactly and told me that she had woken up and had seen this oval shaped gaseous thing.\r\nwe thought about what it might have been but excluded everything we could, even went to a catholic priest to perform an exorcism. the priest went through all sorts of rubbish and wasnt helpful at all. not long after we moved house.\r\nmy wife has (and still is)reluctant to talk about the experience.It was only about 3-4 years ago that i found out that she did not see an orb in the gas but that she saw a shape inside it or the gas made a shape. being scared she put her head under the blanket and said a few hail-marys(she is not religeous either)and when she looked out the vision had gone.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

am the national director for iran and speak fluent farsi and i took the report from the witness by calling her home number in isfahan iran. \r\n\r\nthe witness is a 45 year old woman, married with two sons. her husband travels a lot and is not always home during the week. her sons are ages 17 and 18.\r\nher oldest son was the one that spoke english and reported the incident to mufon.\r\n\r\non october 27th i was assigned this case by the ceo of mufon and was given the witness phone number in iran which i called. i spoke with the witness herself for about 17 minutes. \r\n\r\nshe stated the following: \r\nit was 7 years ago when the witness had her first experience.\r\n- things around the house started moving and hovering in the air. \r\nonce she had made dinner in the kitchen and her husband was taking a shower. she walked into the kitchen and her dinner still int he pan was hovering in the air. she screamed and ran tot he bathroom and asked her husband to quickly come and see this site. her husband didn't believe that could be possible so he ran outside and the dinner had crashed into the ground. they both just stood there and watched their dinner smashed to the ground. friends told her that perhaps their house was hunted but she never felt that was true.  \r\n\r\n- she saw 7 or 8 orbs  of many colors (colors of rainbow)started appearing and hovering in the air, inside the house.\r\n\r\n-about 6 years ago, her husband was not home and she was all alone int he house with her sons. the witness had her first encounter with the non-earth beings. \r\nshe first heard sounds that seemed to be a humming and then louder sound. it appeared that she had to tune in to the vibration or some type of frequency of that sound that always woke her up and made her aware that something was there or getting close. from that first time she always heard the sound first.\r\ntwo tall beings skinny and looked like wearing silver astronaut clothes. their eyes were big and black and she noticed that there was a light that kept switching off and on and kept staying on as if they were videotaping  wherever they looked. \r\nthe witness asked them who they were but they just looked at her. she felt no fear. the next day she would completely forget her experience from the previous night. \r\n\r\n- her visitations continued to twice a month. \r\n-once she asked her husband if he saw the being who just was in the room because she thought maybe she was dreaming but he said that he saw it too.  \r\n\r\n-once she saw someone in the corner of her bedroom dressed in white/silver clothes and a hat with glass in front. he looked like  a soldier. he started walking from her bedroom toward her sons bedroom. the witness decided to follow him but to her it felt like it was taking a long time- maybe hours. everything slowed down for her as she passed the hallway and she could see details of things as she passed by them. \r\nthe being went to he front yard and witness stayed behind the window. hours had gone by and she was gone for about an hour and half. missing time she can't account for. \r\nthe next day she noticed that she had a scar that went from her belly button all the way to her chest. (photo is included.) the scar is now light after so many years.\r\n she went to the doctor and examined and he said that it was nothing. no x-rays were taken. it was just a simple exam. she also started having scars on her face that would not go away. even after going to the dermatologist. \r\n\r\n-few nights ago on october 24th witness heard a sound again. she knew something was coming for her again. she woke up feeling a pressure against her chest. she said out-loud what is going on? she slapped herself in the face making sure she was completely awake and that she was not dreaming.\r\nthat's when she saw what looked like a boxed jelly fish with lots of  short legs,  half blue and half red on her stomach. it looked like a sea creature. it was right on top of her and then it got up and sat on the floor. \r\nthen disappeared after a few minutes. the next day she saw a scar few inches long on her abdomen ( photo attached). it has been itching  and burning from inside out. witness is very worried. i told her that she needs to get x-rays right away, draw a sketch of the beings in her room as well as the jelly fish looking creature and take more photos of the scars. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

experience with estimating distances, vehicle sizes, etc.\r\n\r\ni was traveling south bound on interstate 75 near camp grayling when i noticed a large, but low set of lights (green and red, west/east respectively) on the horizon (at this distance it was approximately 20-25 degrees from the horizon). after getting a mile or so closer i gave it more attention as i thought it was an aircraft landing at camp grayling, or one possibly training. another mile or so closer, and i remarked to my self that it hasn't changed altitude, and now i could see an alternating set of strobe lights blinking. i again thought to my self that maybe it was a helicopter. as i closed the final mile between my self and the craft i began to get a better sense of its size as the gap between the red and green lights grew. it was as large, if not larger than a ch47 chinook (the reason for the 2 sizes specified, this craft did not change size). also another light became visible, a solid white light. just as i was within the last 100 meters to the object i still could not identify what it was against the night sky. i slowed the car a few mph and rolled the window down. the craft was directly over the north bound lanes of i75 and approximately 500 meters north of highway old 76. as i passed underneath, yet another light became visible, but this one was much smaller than the 3 corner lights, larger than the strobe lights, but was much dimmer, a clear, crisp border to the craft could be seen as it was darker than the night sky (conditions were clear and unlimited). unbelievably it was a triangle. the lights again from a distance appeared to be red and green, when i was directly under the craft the color was closer to red-orange, and blue-green. the white light that did not strobe was located on the \"point\" of the triangle facing south, bluegreen was west, redorange was east. the alternating strobe lights were located between the dim center white light and the two flanking lights, oriented east east west. the corner lights also appeared to be \"fuzzy\" or have an \"aurora\" to them. estimate of its altitude would be between 125-200 meters. seeing all this made me do a double take from the shock of what was a hovering craft in a shape and configuration so unfamiliar. approximately 100 meters past (south) of the object i lost sight of it. followed quickly by the exit sign for old 76 (exit 244) as i realized what i had seen i began taking notes of all pertinent data, including time (10:01 was when i began taking notes), size, altitude, the color and orientation of the lights as well.","distance":"21-100

is about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown ellijay.  as i started traveling down heading west i noticed a big ball of light in the sky.  i thought that it may have been an airplane or a helicopter at first.  after looking at it, i could tell that through the bright white light there appeared to be colored flashing lights.  a helicopter nor an airplane would have a bright white light like this with colored flashing lights that were flashing like this while it was hovering.  so, i proceeded down roy and rounded the 90 degree curve and then i noticed that the bright white light was still off to my left, but then lost it behind the trees a bit.  i continued traveling down roy rd, now heading north west.  i got just past river hill rd and roy rd and i pulled over to the side of the road where i snapped a few pictures of the bright glowing object in the sky and then i noticed it changing colors through the still very bright glowing white light.  after sitting for a few minutes, i sent a facetime request to my wife who observed this with me via a facetime video chat.  i had just left her at her parents house just about 5-10 minutes previously to me seeing the object.  the odd thing about it is, her and her mother seen the object last night and that is what prompted me to observe the sky on my way home when i noticed this object.  i snapped several pictures of it and before i could capture some video of it, it backed up over the mountain and out of my view.  while i was observing it for the 5-10 mins the object was stationary / hovering and was not moving, other than flashing lights.\r\n\r\nafter it got out of my view, i sat there for a few minutes about 2-3 to see if it was going to return and it did not, so i continued my travels home (i was enroute to blue ridge).  as i got down to holt bridge rd, i observed the object again to my west still.  i pulled over on the side of the road on holt bridge rd and was on facetime with my wife and continued to speak with her as i observed the object in the sky.  the object them seem to have continued to move a little and i wanted to see if i could get a better and closer view and the object appeared to the path to my travel home, so i continued my travels.\r\n\r\ni got almost to the end of big creek rd and hwy 52 and i could then see the object in the horizon, but as i got to that intersection, the object was behind the trees and out of my view.  i then continued my travel down hwy 52 toward downtown ellijay heading west.  as i continued my travels i observed the light had moved a little bit further away from me now and seemed to me more distant than previously.  i continued my travel down hwy 52 to r&a orchard at the intersection of hwy 52 and ridgemont dr.  i pulled over onto ridgemont dr where i spent several minutes observing this glowing object taking video of it at this point for a period of about 5 1/2 minutes.  while observing this object i observed what appeared to be 2 other stationary glowing objects that had a similar bright glowing appearance that seemed to be a little bit further away.  the other 2 glowing objects appeared spherical as well but were so far away it was really hard to tell.  after observing the other 2, they maintained what appeared to be about a 1 mile separation from each other and approximately about a 3-5 mile separation from the larger object that i was previously observing.  i continued to observe these 3 objects for several minutes, then identifying what appeared to be an airplane fly in the vicinity of where the larger object was, traveling what appeared to be n in the sky, which the large object continued to remain stationary.  i observed all 3 of these objects with no movement from any of them other than flashing lights for a period of about 15-20 minutes.  on several occasions, it appeared that there were 'jets' of some sort flying in the vicinity of where the larger object was at.  i'm not sure if they were military jets sent to seek this object out or not.  but, they appeared to have come and gone as quickly as they showed up, their flashing green and red lights disappeared within a few seconds of them showing up in the vicinity of the larger object.  at that point, the 2 smaller object separated and one travelled in a w nw direction toward where the larger object was, but never appeared to make contact or interact with the larger object, but continued in what appeared to be a straight path.  the other object took a north pattern and headed directly toward me, both objects traveling fairly quickly and gaining ground quickly from where they were at.  it took the object just about 2-3 mins to travel what appeared to be probably about 10 miles.  as the object got about 2-3 miles away from me, it turned off it's bright white light and flashed some lights and the object appeared to have a boomerang shape to it, as it continued flying, it passed direction over me and the object then appeared to be a square shape and i observed lights on 4 sides of the object.  it was covered with flashing lights on all sides of it, that were flashing red, green, blue and white from what it appeared.  if trying to guess about how hight the object was, i would guess to say about 10,000 feet.  jet airlines usually fly at about 30,000 ft and are just usually a very small speck in the sky.  i saw a lot of planes this evening and these objects were all at about the same height, except the first object, which appeared to be a little bit lower, maybe at around 8,000 feet or so, but it was off in the distance a bit and it was really hard to tell, but it didn't seem as high as the other 2 i observed.  as the object continued overhead above me, it continued to move and did not stop to observe me.  at this time, i was standing outside of my vehicle watching it and the other 2 objects.  when i turned to capture some more video of the larger object which i had been observing for quite some time, i observed the object 'jump' back to what appeared about 10 miles away from me in the blink of an eye.  at this time, i got back in my vehicle and continued my travels home, not observing any further objects.  i continued watching the sky on my way home and appeared to only have observed what appeared to be commercial airlines on the way home with a height of about 30000 feet on all of the other objects passing through the night sky.  when leaving r&a i looked at my clock and it was about 8:44 pm et.  i observed these objects over a period of about 40 minutes, my wife also observed them via

outside on what was a warm night.  roughly 1/3 were dismissive, another group thought the lights were chinese lanterns and the balance were unsure.  the lights moved together on a roughly south to north trajectory.  there was aircraft traffic in the area (bna is ~10 miles away); they were not airplanes.  the lights were relatively large.  they eventually faded away; two together, three separately within a minute or so.  the picture does not do justice to the intensity of the light or the clarity of the horizontal movement.  pretty cool! at no time did i have any sense of time/space distortion.  i estimate the orbs were about 1 mile away from our location moving roughly along hillsboro road near green hills mall (or beyond it to the east).","distance":"501 Feet - 1

immediately yelled for me and when i made it out to the porch, i saw and object just coming into view from the side of the house.  it was heading due east from the west.  it looked to be the size of a commercial aircraft as seen during a descent for landing.  this is weird (well...That goes without saying) but it looked like an airplane that was totally engulfed in flames.  it looked to be tapered at the front and have a high rudder-like tail like a commercial airplane.  my wife stated later that it was brilliant white when she first saw it and that it had lessened to the flamelike orange that i had seen.  i yelled for my son to grab his phone to take video of the object. it headed slowly due east and then it started canting to the north, hovering for a moment.  it then headed north by northeast and hovered for a longer amount of time before dimming for a moment.  it grew in brightness and headed in a more easterly direction before hovering once again.  when it began moving again, it looked as if it was heading back westward, directly toward our location. it then resumed an easterly course and started lowering in altitude before dimming so much that it was barely perceptible.  if i was to hazard a guess as to its location during descent,  i would place it somewhere around the needmore rd./n. dixie dr. area, but that is only a guess since i really couldn't fully determine its size.  another odd thing is that what i saw, which was an object that was bright orange, appears to be rapidly changing colors in all manner of patterns and colors.\r\nplease forgive the crappiness of the video.  it is with a cell phone. i enlarged the video, slowed it down by 50% and tried to keep it in frame as much as possible.  i did not use any filters or anything else. i have the original video if someone has better equipment/experience with this type of editing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
