binoculars looking for anything visually unusual around it, but when i got outside onto the porch on the north side, i realized the moon wasn't actually visible at that time. still, i stayed outside and looked almost straight up into the sky facing north without the binoculars. i noticed a very faint whitish-orange light moving north, it looked almost just like what a typical satellite would. but after about two seconds of looking at it, i noticed its brightness changing in a strange way. it appeared to almost fade in and out of being visible, and so i grabbed the binoculars around my neck and quickly aimed them at the strange light. now, seeing it closer, i could make out that it was instead made up of four individual lights. three white lights in an equilateral triangle shape, and one single orange-ish light in the center. the center light was pulsing bright and then dim, not like a sudden flash but more gradual of a change. along with that, the group of lights appeared to fade to dimmer and then brighten at times, which was strange because it was not flying behind any clouds and i could clearly see all the stars around it. at times, it dimmed so much i almost completely lost sight of it. i could not make out any physical structure or body, but the lights stayed fixed relative to one another, giving me the impression that they were part of a single craft. after about 10 seconds of following it with the binoculars, i wasn't able to hold them on the craft any more and continued watching it for a few more seconds with just my naked eyes. by the time it was about to disappear behind trees to the north, it was quite a bit brighter than an average satellite and then slid behind the treeline. the whole sighting lasted around 20 or so seconds and the craft made no noise as it flew over. i also never saw any other craft in the sky around this time, identifiable or otherwise. the craft looked much higher than a typical aircraft, i'd honestly say 80,000 feet or higher. this whole experience perplexed me after it happened, and for hours after it happened i sat and went over in my head exactly what i saw and i could come up with nothing to explain it myself. i have no idea what it was, but i have an idea of what it wasn't. it wasn't a commercial aircraft or typical satellite. it even appeared twice as bright as the iss appears from where i am. there is an old air force base in the area formerly known as perrin air force base. this base is not used as a commercial airport, just a small municipal one.","distance":"Over One

helicopter? i said something like yea,  they search for people laying on beach. probably not legal. spotlight was ( although we were 150 feet from ocean across sand) we were 300-400 from the craft at first. it had a beam like one of those big beams that shine in the sky for advertisement. but it just shined down at the beach. this was in about 1978 and it's hard to remember a lot of detail as far as speed and shapes. but i think the craft was moving up the beach toward us at about ten miles an hour. this lasted 1/2 to 3/4 minute then,,, a flash very similar to a fireworks display but short. the flames theat shoot out from the center and each one of the 30-40 flames shoot out from the center to make a giant circle. but, in this case, the flames went out a short distance. like now if i had to compare the size of the craft as 50 foot across the flames were now making it 100 foot. no,,, smaller, sorry. the craft is now nearly straight out and about 180-200 foot from us but the little explosion like flames were just barely bigger than the craft. like a ball ,,tennis ball5 feet in front of you and flames all of a suddden jump out from it in all directions about 2 incehes from all sides. just like a fire work except instead of 200 foot, it was 6-8 foot from craft in all directions.  at any rate, as soon nearly as the fire came out around the  craft, i think the beam stopped but the craft was out over the atlantic by 80 or 100 miles within 5 seconds with no noise that i can remember. i have thought about the noise factor many times but just cant remember. i know it wasnt loud.I remember asking my father about it because through he years i couldnt come up with anything and he seemed to be knowledgeable about everything. opinionated at least. lol his idea was that a helicopter with jet engines. and i didnt bother to tell him about the fact that there was no noise/. jet engines were very loud and this definitely was no helicopter with jet engines. but the object sat still out over the ocean what appeared to me to us to be about 30- 5- miles,, 60 ? so hard to tell. but way, way out in 3-4 seconds. hmm  see why i dont talk about this now.? huh  ! any way, the craft sat for 15 or 20 seconds . just sat, still. then, the little firework like explosion or charge of electric went off again and it went what appeared to be north and it was gone. the second time it took off was the same. the little firework thing and then gone ! fast !  i was with another woman before i met my wife so as i mention this story, i reference to 'a friend ' that was with me. sue hutchinson was next to me just talking as we both witnessed this. i asked what to do . thinking no one would believe us anyway and susy said\" no one would believe us anyway\" i distinctly remember this because of the coincidence of what i was thinking and what she was saying. she described the same  thing that i saw and we were sure we saw the same thing and weren't hallucinating from the beer we drank a day or two before that. \r\n   i had contacted another group 20 years latter about 1998 or so and they were concerned with the witness. very understandable but the relationship had ended by 1980. last i heard she had moved to a place called texas city texas. i'm not 100% sure the town even exists but i think i had looked it up before. maybe along the gulf side. i has tried many times to contact her by face book to no avail. she was from waterford, michigan and moved there about 1980 or 1981. susan hutchinson had a brother named john. a father , a pharmacist in waterford, mi. at a  drug store near walton and dixie hwy on dixie 1/4 mi north of walton blvd on left. they lived on williams lake. in waterford. she worked at b's bar on dixie and walton where i met her.  if i had it to do over, i would have followed up  much sooner. always wondered if someone else saw this but i dont see anyone explain it this way. it waould be hard for someone to not see this. maybe it was reported. maybe they felt as wee did that no one would believe it anyway. sorry i dont have pictures but i can draw a description if anyone even thinks it would help. i have no police record other than driving infractions and no convictions or anything and no reason to make anything up.  i always feel someone should know. i seem to spin my wheels. i have watched many videos on netflix and youtube and only one had the (firework like ) flash when a video was made of a ufo.  so.. cant think of any thing else but at a distance fof 200 foot or less,,,, i was close. the craft came up the shore with the spot light on the beach for a minute or two and then flashed away. 50 miles over the atlantic in 2 secs. then another flash and gone !   . very short happening. very little amount of things happening but as real as it gets.  can think of any more details right now anyway. thanks for listening,,, joh   : j","distance":"101-500

i couldve sworn i remember seeing a control room area i dunno. but then the dreams turned horrifying these lasted for months and they were always slightly different but i was running through these black halls almost like a dark parking garage trying to escape monsters with a bunch of other people as well. and also just living in the space ship i think it was almost like a spacey hotel. the dreams are all mixed together but if you put them in sequence its like i lived there for a bit fine then things turned bad but they could just be dreams.\r\nwhat panics me though is these scoop mark indentations. i have been researching other abduction marks and these look like them.You can very obviously feel the perfectly round indentations and there was absolutely no blood or damage when they appeared. something is wrong and i really need your help.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s), Other","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":80076,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.675464014198376,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10282016-0002","longitude":-118.00835267023349,"occurred":1476586800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1477625803000,"summary":"Walking down a dirt road and came upon 2 entities that made me blackout","tags":["lights","abduction"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1477640676521,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":23,"maxtempi":74,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":70,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":18,"mintempi":65,"minvism":10,"minvisi":6,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":23,"maxtempi":74,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":70,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":18,"mintempi":65,"minvism":10,"minvisi":6,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"92648","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":12,"locationName":"Huntington Beach, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:51867"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Carthage","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On 16 october 2016 i saw a white light in the sky just above the treeline about due west. this occurred at just before 7:30 pm. i had put out halloween decorations the day before including some lights and i had gone outside to check the lights because one string had a short. this light caught my attention immediately as i turned the corner because it was very bright and considerably larger compared to the observable stars and seemed to my naked eye to be “blinking” just a bit. i watched it for a few minutes then i went back into the house to get my iphone to attempt to photograph it and tell some members of my family to come see it. i went out the back of the house the second time and when i got to a place where i could see the light again, it suddenly went completely black and then almost immediately came back on. i went back into the house to again tell family members they needed to come see this. i went out the east side of the house (where i had come out the first time when i first saw it) and could still see it clearly. my mother came out behind me and i pointed it out to her. my sister also came out and saw it. they went back into the house and i continued to watch. i then realized the blinking effect was a slight change from red to green then back with the light still being a white light overall. the light never moved as far as i could tell. i did capture a few moments of video on my iphone. on video the light was very dim, but seemed to move, while the streetlight (the only other thing visible in the video) was still. i was shocked by this since the thing was in the same place the whole time i observed it. i eventually went back in and was informed by my mother that she went to look again and it was gone. i thought maybe i was seeing mars or some other planet so went back the next night at the same time to see if it was there and nothing was there.
