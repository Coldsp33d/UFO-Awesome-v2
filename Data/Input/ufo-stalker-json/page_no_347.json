object over brisbane australia, during full moon rising of october 16, 2016.  recorded on unmanned time-lapse video and later discovered upon viewing of the digital images \r\n(12 sequential frames from 559 600 shots).\r\n \r\ninitially i assumed this to be an aircraft.  several lights appear during the time-lapse (total play time of 11 seconds) – i have not yet closely examined the others.  \r\n\r\nnote: as has been the case previously when i recorded such footage - the camera (panasonic lumix fz1000 bridge camera with leica zoom lens) which was set to manual focus, mysteriously lost focus near the end of the recording, (and in one frame of this sequence) then regained focus once the object had left the area being recorded.\r\n \r\nthis object was descending on a steady flight path angle from left to right, as would an aircraft.  my question over this being merely a commercial aircraft, is that it doesn't appear to be a case of motion blur; rather an evenly halved red and white body.\r\n \r\nalso; if it was an aircraft heading from my left to my right towards brisbane international airport, from my vantage point on the west side of brisbane (about 20km from the cbd); why then do i see it as a well lit, thick cylinder instead of just what i would normally see from a conventional aircraft of wing-tip lights as it passed side-ways to my viewing perspective - not bright  lights as it would be if facing my direction?\r\n \r\ni further speculate that even if it was the cabin lights from windows; it would appear on film as only a relatively thin band of white lights - not the full height of the vehicles fuselage.  also; there would be no red colour on the full side of same to leave this image as an equally distributed red and white object, and certainly would not start and end as a rounded curved shape as it does.\r\n \r\ni have a good degree of photographic knowledge, as i was a professional photographer for over 30 years.\r\n \r\nthis is not the

(just a guess but i'm an aviation buff so that's probably accurate to about 2000 ft. either way.) the craft continued in a se direction before disappearing over my house. at no time did the craft change direction or altitude, it just continued in a straight line toward the ocean. i've always been skeptical of the \"triangle craft\" reports and wondered if they were of hysterical origin or maybe the result of the power of suggestion, but i am a sober, educated individual with some background in aviation and i know what i saw. as for how i feel, honestly i'm a little freaked out. i saw lights in the sky many years ago, but they were so far up,  i was more fascinated than anything else, and nothing has happened in the interim. i'd like to believe it's terrestrial technology of some sort. mcas new river is not too far from us, we see v-22 ospreys flying over from time to time and coast guard helicopters and the odd c-130 from elizabeth city, but who knows what the black ops guys have developed?

was black with no n numbers.I thought at first it might be attached to the antenna.However the antenna was not bending.I continued down blue ridge blvd.Towards my house.It was facing in westward direction.When i got to the corner of blue ridge blvd. and cedar ave. there was a second one hovering just above treetop on cedar ave. which was a few feet north of my car which was headed east.I pulled to the side to observe the object.It triangular just like the first one. it was just hovering in a stationary position.Both were black in color and appeared to be made of stealth composite type material.It was complete triangular not like f-22 which has some other shapes on edge.I sat there in my car for about 20 min. watching it.The bottom was smooth.After looking at bottom for about 10 minutes i noticed a couple of very faint circular areas which i assume were where landing gear was.The object did not move up or down at all the whole time i was watching.I was trying to figure out how it was able to hover.Finnally i rolled down my window and listened to see if i could here something.I was barely able to hear anything but what sounded like an engine reviving at extremely high rpm.The thing would not move while i was sitting there so i decided to circle the block to get a different view.By the time i circled the block it was moving in a westerly slightly north direction at about approximately 25 or 30 miles per hour at same height as it was hovering.Approx.30 feet off ground.I could not see a cockpit of any kind from my angles of view.It was not a helicopter.I hope this

a high altitude) i could clearly see the light and there was no strobe what-so-ever. i pulled out my phone and began recording the object. \r\n\r\ni observed that he object was moving slower than a normal aircraft. during the entire time i kept looking for the strobe or even the silhouette of the aircraft. no once did i see any strobe nor could i see a silhouette of the object.\r\n\r\nthe object

eventually had to go inside because the mosquitos were eating me alive!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na few things you should know about me...\r\nas a uscg vet i'm a trained observer.\r\nas a former private investigator, i'm a trained observer.\r\ni'm very well versed in all forms of aircraft from civialian to military, and even drone tech.\r\ni've been flying radio controlled aircraft for 20 years.\r\ni'm a certified contest director with the american modelers academy - i know drones!!!\r\ni'm a drone pilot instructor!\r\n\r\nwhile i cannot identify what i saw, i do know it wasn't a registered aircraft. it had no silhouette, it produced no noise, it had no strobes. it couldn't be a civil drone as it's flight time was too long and it's flight path and height was much too distant . i seriously doubt this was a military drone because the border patrol doesn't illuminate their night drones (i've seen the border patrol drones at night (juxtaposed against the moon).\r\n\r\nanother note... i went on youtube on several occasions and discovered that i'm not the only person to object and record this type of object. it seems this type of object and event is a fairly common occurrence in hidalgo county.\r\ni have several videos of this object (all sequential)  and i'm uploading the primary one for now. i can upload the rest at your request.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

them and heard a noise in the sky somewhere in the sky above which sounded mixed between metal screeching or tearing and mixed with something breaking the sound barrier.  it happened twice, the second time i didn't continue to ignore it and went out front to see a bright orb in the sky just to the south west over the nevada desert.  while i didn't have my glasses on i could see sparkles emanating from the object which at that time i couldn't tell rather it was coming towards me or away from me.\r\ni watched it for about five minutes before i decided to go into the house and get my cell phone to record it.\r\nby the time i got back out doors it had stopped making nosies and sparkling.  could be it had just traveled further than my hearing could hear.\r\ni began a two minute recording above the buildings to my west.\r\nthe slightly orange square in the lower part of the screed is one of my neighbors bathroom windows.\r\nas you can see it remained in the sky for some time.\r\ni recorded only two minutes of it and since it wasn't behaving erratic, meaning making noises or sparkles i decided not to record anymore.\r\nthe internet didn't show any other sightings for about an hour, but the odd thing is that their sighting didn't seem to fit the direction mine did.\r\nif it was a rocket coming into the atmosphere, that would explain the metallic noise but only if it was close enough to be heard if it was breaking up and it didn't appear to be that close.\r\nstill have no idea what it was but as you can see, the colorado river is directly before me and the orb was directly south west and heading west.\r\nin the internet articles they reported it crossing the sky across las vegas, so this either turned northwards about a hundred miles or they were two objects in the sky.\r\nthe other reports came in from phoenix and that one would have been in alignment to the one i saw if it was heading west but again the videos of the one in phoenix appear to show an object not
