(a cessna averages 72 mph at landing, and a piper at about 60 mph).  \r\n\r\nall three craft either appear to be headed to entering a lake, or have departed from a lake.  the first craft appears to be descending straight toward the unnamed lake behind the lakewood oaks golf clubhouse.  the second craft appears to be departing from 334° azimuth, or the westernmost portion of blue springs lake.  the third craft appears to be ascending to the right from the unnamed lake behind the golf clubhouse.  \r\n\r\norigins & destinations:\r\n•\tthe origin of the black sphere in the 1st video is unknown.  its destination appears to be the small unnamed lake west of highway 291, at 310° azimuth from point of observation.\r\n•\tthe origin of the ascending grey sphere from the 2nd video appears to come from the westernmost area of blue springs lake at 334° azimuth from point of observation.\r\n•\tthe origin of the grey sphere from the 3rd video, since it has an angle of climb not unlike that of the angle of descent of the black sphere from the 1st video—could be from the same small unnamed lake.  the angle of descent of the first craft was 3.5° while the angle of ascent of the third craft averages to about 4°, close enough for a margin of error.\r\n\r\nsummary:\r\n1.\tthree craft were seen in a span of 3 minutes.\r\n2.\ttwo of the craft may have been coming from and going to the same location.\r\n3.\tthe speed of descent of the black sphere entering the unnamed lake was much slower at 151 mph, but the craft that seemed to be departing from the same area was very fast at 1868 mph.  this would be logical to conclude about such movements.\r\n4.\tas of this report, five bodies of water within a 5 square mile triangle have been reported to be the origins and destinations of many craft.  \r\n\r\nthese lakes include:\r\n•\t blue springs lake. \r\n•\tlakewood lakes. \r\n•\tthe unnamed lake in this report (just west of  highway 291 and behind the lakewood oaks golf clubhouse)\r\n•\tthe unnamed lake .3 miles west of blue springs lake’s middle and western shore.\r\n•\tthe unnamed lake at the bass pro shops mall west of the intersection of highway 291 and 40 highway.\r\n\r\nconclusion:\r\n\r\nthe fact that the speeds of other two of the craft were 493 mph and 1868 mph are proof that none of them are normal human-made craft.  the shapes of these three craft being spherical are also not shapes of human aircraft.  the origins and destinations of the craft appear to be lakes, and not airfields.  therefore it is reasonable to conclude that none of the three craft in these videos are of human origin.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

 we ruled out the later because i had observed the space station earlier last month and its path and size was entirely different. there was a large blinking red light at the front of the craft and one at the rear.  the lights blinked in unison.  to the left of the craft there was a red light which was also blinking, and after about 5 blinks it would turn green and then it would go back to blinking red. this light did not appear to be attached.  could it have been a much smaller craft,guarding the larger one? there was another light exactly like this to the right of the craft.   \r\nthere was absolute silence. we lost sight as it went behind a tree,so we moved to the side yard facing east. then it moved behind another tree,so we moved to the front yard, just as the craft moved to far away to be seen any longer.  from start to finish, the entire observation lasted about 6 or 7 minutes. the craft moved off in the direction of lillington,nc.  we tried to take pictures with a smart phone,but we couldn't see the lights or anything.  the screen just appeared black.  so now all we have is this eyewitness account. we would love for someone to say they saw it too and could tell us what this was.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":80018,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.4814347,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10252016-0003","longitude":-79.18125719999999,"occurred":1477344060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,  Missile","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1477362567000,"summary":"Hopping center moving toward downtown sanford.  it appeared to be cylinder shaped or missile shaped.","tags":["ufo","lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1477377553134,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":" 27330","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Sanford, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:52395"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Magna","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was inside my house when i heard a helicopter outside. we don't often get helicopters in this area, so i dicided to take a look. it was dark out but, due to the cloud coverage, i was able to see two dark cigar shaped objects without lights, being followed by the helicopter that i had heard.We live fairly close to dugway proving grounds aka the new roswell, but i have never seen anything like this before. the objects travelled in a southwest direction. i followed them until they passed out of veiw over the houses to the south.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":80017,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7155221,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10252016-0002","longitude":-112.0978588,"occurred":1477350720000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1477359358000,"summary":"Miltary helicopter with lights folling 2 cigar shaped objects without lights.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1477374253109,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/80017_submitter_file1__20161024231017.mp4"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"84044","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Magna, Utah","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:52396"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Neenah","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I walked out on deck with wife and looked to the north to see a tight v dimly lit with dim round lights on the bottom. the craft rotated to the north east and then i lost sight of the object. what ever it was moved silently and traveled over a mile in seconds.\r\nboth of us were in awe of what we saw and then made a note of the time. truly amazing ! exciting !

witnessing, and if he is still there when i get out of work, i plan on trying to get it on video. there is a lot of light pollution in this area so hopefully i can get something on film. in any event i figured it was definitely strange enough that i felt the need to make a report. i don't follow ufos and conspiracy theories closely, but i am thinking whatever i witnessed made me believe.

take my lunch break outside, as i often do. my partner was on his way so i was just finishing up when i looked above the two buildings i was sitting behind, the business next door and the building i work at. reveling in the delicious meal i had just devoured i threw my head back and noticed it. i thought that airplane looks strange. i stared a bit longer to notice it had no wings. i immediately stood up and took notice. from my vantage point it was traveling along the building top and was about to disappear. i could also see another plane way further in the distance that like normal had vapor trail behind it and the thing i was looking at didnt. the more i looked at it the more i could tell it just didnt fit. it also seemed hazy or even blurry and though there wasnt any kind of wing there was the sun glinting along the entire body of the craft. on this particular day i did not have my smart phone and as i held up my burner phone to work out a way to get a photograph, the object without a sound blasted into the sky. it was so quick, it was as if it were never there at all. just a blink and it was gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
