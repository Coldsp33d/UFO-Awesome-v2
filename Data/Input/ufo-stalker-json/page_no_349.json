mountains. i went to go look back at my pictures when i noticed one of them was not like the others. at first i thought a wood hip was on my lense but i looked closer and i realized i had spotted a ufo! now, i don't really believe in stereotypical ufos but this creeped me out so much that i'm reporting it just in case it really is one! the u identified object i saw was a disk, football shape and it was yellow/orange. when i zoom up on my camera, there seems to be a dome on the top as well. as soon as i saw the picture and realized it wasn't a football or woodchip i got a very eerie feeling. i showed my brother and dad the photo right when i saw but they didn't seem to be worried much about it. i attached the photos in this report as well. the first one should be a plain picture of the mountains and the second one has the weird object in it. it seems to be hovering over the mountain in the middle right side of the photo.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

they described to me as shooting stars. i looked up to see, and i saw a third one. it was an abrupt streak of white light. i stood up and walked further into my yard to get a better view of the night sky, and while facing east, i saw more unusual lights. there was a cluster of lights, around 10 or so, all the same size  (star size) and color (white), moving in formation over and over, but remaining in the same spot in the sky. i was amazed at what i was seeing, so i called w2 over. they saw they same thing i was seeing. we called witness #3 out from inside the house to look at the lights. we all discussed what they could be. drones, maybe. the way they were moving reminded me of swarming bugs under a streetlight, but much slower. w3 went back inside, so w2 and myself moved to the backyard to get a better look at the lights. at first i could not make out a definite pattern of the lights, but at first it almost looked like they were forming geometric shapes, with an odd veil of mist, and it was slightly blurry. after a while, w2 and i headed back inside. i grew curious and went back out, and sat near the same spot i had first seen the lights. i watched quite intently and finally noticed a pattern. now the lights were brighter and clearer. first they would cluster, then form a square tipped on its side, with a light forming each corner of the square, and it had a tail made up of about 3 lights. when it was this shape it reminded me of a kite. i actually at one point questioned if it was a kite, there was no wind to fly one. but then it would reform, the other lights fading out, until it was just 3 lights diagonally, then it would reform once more. this time all the other lights would fade out and it just looked like one star in the sky. then just as quickly, it would be a cluster of lights again, then kite, then three, then one. of course, the pattern was not perfect, the lights constantly were shifting, swirling and moving, but it was a pattern of lights nonetheless. at one point, as a group, the lights did also appear to hover and then move slightly to the left, while still moving amongst themselves. but they moved as a unit. that happened once, then they kept shifting and forming their weird pattern again. maybe it was supposed to be a message? maybe they were trying to imitate the little or big dipper? maybe they were just trying to dance. i continually watched these lights for the next hour or so. i described the pattern to the other two witnesses, but i can't be for sure if they noticed it as much as i did. i eventually went inside because i was starting to grow anxious. it could still be going on in the sky but i am too afraid to go check by myself. although i have had a prominent interest in ufos and alien abduction for years now, this was my first sighting, so i am still feeling fearful, and even a little skeptical. maybe there is some explanation for these mysterious lights? overall it was truly an eye-opening and exhilarating experience and i am excited to hear back from the good folks at mufon.","distance":"Over One

it would appear on film as only a relatively thin band of white lights - not the full height of the vehicles fuselage.  also; there would be no red colour on the full side of same to leave this image as an equally distributed red and white object, and certainly would not start and end as a rounded curved shape as it does.\r\n \r\ni have a good degree of photographic knowledge, as i was a professional photographer for over 30 years.\r\n \r\nthis is not the first unusual sighting from the same vantage point of my house - mufon has another authenticated video of mine online which i named;

because i thought it was some sort of new lighting on top of a tower. i saw a small aircraft in the area that passed heading east.  there was something about the aircraft and its relation to the object that made me realize it was too high to be that apparent size and also sitting on top of a tower.  its initial shape made me think it was the moon, but it had no features associated with the satellite. as i continued to look it seemed almost blood cell shaped, with a depression in the center.  furthermore, as i came closer i saw that it was completely covered in small white lights. from where i was they were as bright as stadium lights. i took out my camera phone and began to try recording and taking photos.\r\n\r\nas i drove it remained in the same position while i followed the curve of the road.  when it was in the passenger side windshield i noticed two additional lights--a small blue/green one on the top left, and a small red one on the right.  at this point the object revealed more of its shape.  it was like a teardrop on its side, with the smaller part of the \"drop\" pointing to my right.  the blue/green light was on the bulbous end, the red light at the top. i associate these with aircraft, but nothing else about the object was like any aircraft i am aware of.\r\n\r\ni was trying to be safe on the road, keep an eye on the object, and take images--impossible to do all at once.  pulling over in a dark, desolate area with speeding traffic was out of the question.  i felt very strange, like i was in one of those nightmares where i see the monster but everyone else thinks things are just fine.  i remember believing that the object was stationary and that i was moving, but i don't know now if that's true. it never really seemed to change size, but my experience of its shape changed (from blood cell to teardrop). the odd thing was that despite its size i could detect no noise.  \r\n\r\nas i continued to drive the relative position of the object continued along the passenger side of the car and i noticed a relatively dark rectangular shaped area towards the larger end of the object, about a third of the size of the object as i saw it. i thought i could see writing and it crossed my mind that maybe this was some sort of elaborate ad.  but i still felt fearful and on edge because it was so massive, bright, oddly shaped, noiseless, and motionless.  i lost sight of it near the back windows as i drove, then it became part of the darkness.  i continued on home and have questioned myself since.  i want to know what i saw and hope the explanation is conventional.  i don't want to think that i might have been exposed to anything that could cause later damage.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

that's were it was going.Why i think it was one of our ufo was that it had lights on it i believe like navigation lights on a boat same colour light green on the left light blue on the right red on bottom in the middle and white on the top it had 30by20 concave panels  on it.Burnt looking probably from reeanter the atmosphere it sounded like it had a bad air conditioner compressor going bad it was loud like the ones we have to run our house. that's the only noise it had. also i like to point out that this all happened at dusk just before the sun went down.I also have another story when i was delivering disc shape objects one a week to the port in ga.The invoice said it was going to taiwan general electric in toccoa ga was making them this went on for along time i think a year or more

fast then stopping motionless then the orbs would go into one orb, with out changing size then 6-8 orbs would come out and fly around independently then all go into one orb again at most there was 12 orbs in the sky. they could move very very fast and stop immediately or go in a reverse direction instantly. in the end there were 3 orbs that went straight up and disappeared i lasted between 20-30

was dusk time about 18:30  and i went on balcony of our apartment on the 5th floor to smoke a cigarette, i use to look at the sky when smoking on balcony to track some satellites passing by occasionally. at the first glance to the sky a bright and shiny object caught my eyes moving from west to my zenith, at first i thought it was iss, which surprised me as i saw the speed was higher than i expected. and the magnitude was slightly bigger , and also shinier, after it passed my zenith about 15 degrees i suddenly noticed that it started going in sinusoidal like movements, there was a few cloud patches in the sky and i noticed that there is no reflection of its light on the clouds though it was four to five times shinier than the shiniest star in the sky at the time. so i thought it must be flying  higher than an ordinary aeroplane's flight altitude. i could not believe my eyes! so i noticed more carefully and saw it change its direction 2 more times. then i followed it to the most eastern part of sky where it faded out.I checked the bright satellites and there was no in my sky at that

several minutes later, with the witness in hand, we observed that the object was now way off to the east and was tracking to the southwest.   it made quite a course correction in a short amount of time!   eventually the object got too far out of range for us to see.  neither the witness, nor myself have seen anything like it before.  it could not have been a satellite because of the course
