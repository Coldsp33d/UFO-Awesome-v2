to notice unexplainable movements amongst lights & stars moving in ways we had never seen before. it was so bizarre to us. then we heard jets. it looked like stars chasing stars, but sounded like jets. we decided to just go home, it was late. all the sudden walking to our truck, discussing what we had just witnessed, my husband grabbed me and threw me down in the sand. within that second i looked up and a fireball went literally right over top of our heads. since this event, i have developed strong psychic empath abilities. my husband and i share a telepathic communication. i personally have been visited through what seems to be dreams, but they leave me wondering if it was real. also, this is very embarrassing to write but on two occasions i have seen them on top of me, sexually. once was when i was just waking up, it was a dark grayish dwarf sized mist. other time was in a dream but i felt a pressure ( in my area) when i woke up. we were in this room that looked like it was made of sheet metal a little larger than the size if drywall, put together by these weird large screws. these screws made a pattern of sorts on the walls. very weird & hard to explain. ever since the night at the beach took place, it has changed my life. it has changed my marriage ( for the better \r\n) emotionally. we still find it fascinating some nights during certain moon phases to look towards the east where the ocean is and watch the lights. doesn't happen all the time, but we still wonder and look to the stars.","distance":"20 Feet or

17, 1995, 10:50pm. having just tucked my children in, my wife already asleep, i stepped out onto the east facing front porch for a smoke. there i ran into our neighbor, and we began chatting about the weather. it was \"windstorm 95\" and made the news with gusts around 70mph. the conversation then turned to some red and blue lights, my neighbor had seen in the clouds a few minutes earlier. after a couple moments i  saw them as well. they were horizontal bars of red and blue light that pulsed on then off in particularly mechanical way, a horizontal red bar of light would come on inside of a cloud followed by a blue bar of light directly underneath where the red light had been. not flashes of light, but measured pulses. this happened three more time not counting the 2 or 3 times she had seen it before. they appeared in random parts of the sky and always inside of a cloud, which were scattered across the sky. planes and stars were also visible between the fast moving clouds, with slower moving larger clouds above. transformers were also flashing occasionally, from the storm, but appeared as flashes, lighting up the underside of clouds, but the red/blue bands of light were clearly coming from inside the clouds as distinct pulses..\r\nsome kids were playing in the gusts across the street, when suddenly our entire field of vision was illuminated in brilliant neon-red light, eminating from a blue and red striped disc, which had appeared directly east of us. it was just below the treetops, the right edge obscured slightly by the roof of a house directly across the street.\r\nit spun metronomically, in high wind, without so much as a shudder. no sound. just spinning in place for about 3 minutes. once i came to my senses, after the initial shock, i called to the kids, so we'd have more witnesses. they hesitated at first, but cautiosly came over to see. just as i told them to turn and look, the object pulsed, as if it were going to go out, and did so just as they turned. the kids ran for their lives the second they saw it, and the object then collapsed into a single point of light, and vanished, like an old tube tv powering down. \r\nit had radiated such an intense light, that i could feel the heat, and felt a little sun burnt from it. i called the local news station, and airport that night, learning nothing from them, and called noaa the next day. they told me there was no lightning associated with the storm, and that there was no such thing as red lightning, in response to my inquiries.. i never saw the kids again, and have lost contact with my neighbor, but our reports, and a couple from the su dorms behind us are on file at the national ufo hotline.","distance":"101-500

camp crystal mine in the community of board camp, near mena, arkansas. the group and i were investigating anomalies that have been occurring regularly at the site for nearly one year. this is the same site investigated by mufon nearly one year ago and featured in the october 2017 issue of the mufon journal. one person in the group was training us on how to use specialty equipment in our investigation, such as a night vision scope and radiation detection device.  at approximately 8:30 pm, i received a cell phone call from a friend who said, “quick run outside. we are following a triangular ship from ink and it’s heading your way.” the community of ink is located north of where i was located in the community of board camp, so we expected to see the object coming toward us from the north. although i could not see the actual object itself, i could see the effect of the object as it approached and flew over. the night sky was clear and full of stars, so i could see that a portion of the sky and stars was blacked out as it flew over. it did not fly directly over my head but was more east of me. i did not see any lights on the object, only the black out and reappearance of the stars as it flew over.  from the first time i began seeing the stars black out and reappear, the flyover lasted approximately 4-6 seconds and the object was approximately 1000 feet in elevation.  the group i was with had heard dogs and coyotes barking earlier, but all sound stopped during the flyover. it was very quiet. i saw it pass over and the estimated size was probably 150-200 feet long.  i was facing east and it was moving south.  after it passed over, i caught the quick glimpse of stars blinking out and coming back to my right, which led me to believe the anomaly changed course from south to a southwest direction. after i received the phone call from my friend who first saw the anomaly in ink, the people in my group and i were excited and immediately started scanning the skies. i also quickly texted another friend of mine who lives between ink and board camp and told him to go outside to watch. before the flyover, i had a radiation detection device in my pocket. it was set to the highest setting and was picking up normal background radiation indicated by an occasional beep sound emitted from the device. i noticed the flyover approximately 5 minutes after my friend called to notify me to look for it.  during the flyover, the radiation detector in my pocket went off making a constant beeping noise, and the other 3 people in my group heard it, and were amazed and said, ”it must right overhead!\"  after about 6 seconds, the detector went back to normal. after the object flew over, it disappeared past the horizon. immediately after the flyover at approximately 8:40 pm, i called my wife who was inside the house on the same property, and told her to call a friend of ours who lives southwest of us around the cove and hatfield communities located south of the city of mena, to see if she could see it, after we determined it was possibly heading in her direction. later, when my wife and i talked to our 2 friends who we had notified to watch, both confirmed they saw something in the night sky, either the blacking out and reappearing of stars, or they saw 3 yellow lights.  my background is i am a us army veteran, formerly worked as an investigator for the department of homeland security, am a volunteer trained firefighter and certified instructor for dept. of labor.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

jumped... it did this for another six times before it went back to it's original location (star formation orion) it flashed bright, and the next couple times it flashed it was like the lights dimmed
