the lake is divided by both indiana and michigan line.  \r\n\r\ni was on a pontoon boat sitting at the dock waiting for some friends who were using the bathroom in the cottage. it was approximately 10:30 p.M.  the skies were clear and full of stars.  being on lake with little or no lights around the area, made it very easy, and enjoyable looking at the stars.  it was an exceptional night for star gazing, which i love to do.\r\n\r\nseveral other people were on the pontoon boat at the same time.  i was laying down on one of the seats looking up at the stars in the sky. i happened to look to my right, which would be a northerly direction. as i looked off to my right, i noticed a glowing white ball in the sky, which seemed to get bigger as i gazed at it.  it was moving toward our position.  i figured it might be some kind of fireworks since it was just after the 4th of july (this incident was on saturday, july 7th).  but there weren't any other fireworks being set off at the time.  i was curious so i continued to watch this globe move toward me.  maybe it was a plane, but the globe or circle of light was too big to be a plane.  \r\n\r\ni sat up to get a better view of this display.  my friend was directly across from me laying on the other reclined seat. he was looking in a westerly direction.  his sister-in-law was in one of the captain's seat in the front of the boat looking east.\r\n\r\nthe light got as big as a penny and then it burst into a perfect rectangular shape light.  no globe shaped figure anymore, just a solid glowing white light in a rectangular shaped - like the globe exploded but no fragments - just a perfectly shaped very long rectangle. this was only a few seconds before there was nothing.  it was gone.  \r\n\r\ni blurted out - \"what the heck was that!\"  my friend didn't move and just asked \"what?\"  his sister-in-law asked the same.  i said right there as i pointed in the direction of the white globe turned rectangular burst.\r\n\r\nas my friend exclaimed what did you see, and his sister-in-law was repositioning herself to look in the direction i was gazing, two smaller spheres or globes appeared; one coming from a westerly direction and the other coming from the east. one was a \"red\" color or \"scarlet\" colored globe - smaller than the white globe before it burst into the rectangular shape.  the other globe was \"purple\" or violet colored globe.  they came to rest on top of one another, it seemed. just for a second before one accelerated very fast straight up and the other straight down.  this all happened quickly - not in slow motion - but in a few seconds. so before my friend's sister-in-law was able to position herself to look in the direction i was locked onto, the globes were gone.\r\n\r\ni was really excited and said \"oh my god\" look at that.  my friends sister-in-law was turned around at the time and said - \"what\" ... i pointed in the direction of where these two globes had just disappeared.  all of sudden they both appeared again coming from the same direction they did before, from the west and the other from the east.  they again stopped above each other - like resting on top of one another - for just a second or two and then just took off directly away from our position - very quickly until you couldn't see them. \r\n\r\nmy friend's sister-in-law said, \"what the heck was that?\"  i said, \"did you see that - good - i don't want to be the only one who saw that.\"\r\n\r\nseptember 2016 (saturday):\r\n\r\nmy wife and i were visiting with some friends who owned a cottage on snow lake - again in the angola, indiana area.  this lake is not far from little long lake.  \r\n\r\nwe were out on the pontoon during the evening to see the lake at night. it was a very clear night and again good for star gazing.  my friend was asking about the sighting i had witnessed in 2012.  i was explaining the entire situation when i was gazing in the sky and said, \"look at that ball moving across the sky.\"  it's too big to be a plane, it's really moving too fast to be a plane (jet), it could be a satellite, it's not a comet because there is no trail.  we all gazed at it and made comments about being something other than a a plane or jet - maybe a satellite.  all of a sudden the ball stopped and then took off straight away from us until it was gone.  we all gazed at each other and said - \"what the heck was that.\"\r\n\r\nthese are two very peculiar sightings i have witnessed in the same area.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

trash to the curb. i have a large yard with a long driveway so it takes a few minutes to walk out there and back. \r\n\r\nas i rolled the can to the street an airliner coming from charlotte douglas international airport flew over and i heard the sound of it fade by the time i parked my trash can at the pickup spot. we get a lot of air traffic overhead and it is pretty normal to hear the jets fly over at all hours of the day and night. there were no more airplanes that passed overhead after that one was gone.\r\n\r\nas i turned toward my house, i remembered that i had heard that there was going to be a meteor shower soon, so i looked up at the sky to see if i could see any. my house is located between two urban areas, so to the east and to the west, there is a constant urban glow in the night sky.\r\n\r\nwhen i looked up, i saw a dark triangle silhouetted against that urban glow.\r\n\r\ni thought, \"am i really seeing this?\" but i did not take my eyes off of it until it disappeared. when i saw it, the object was almost straight overhead, moving south to north. the northern part of the sky is much darker here, so when it reached that part of the sky, it disappeared from view. the whole incident took maybe five seconds, if that long. it moved very fast across half of the sky, from around 90 degrees overhead to where it disappeared about 20 degrees above the horizon -- much, much faster than the low-flying airliners that i am used to seeing. there was absolutely no sound at all to accompany the sighting.\r\n\r\none other thing i noticed about it was that the trailing edge of the triangle seemed to have a very faint glow to it. i don't know if that was reflection of the lights on the ground or if it was emanating from the object. there were no other lights on the object. it was a solid, dark silhouette. the faint glow on the back was the last thing i saw before it disappeared against the blackness of the northern sky.\r\n\r\nlast comment: i am dumbfounded as to, if it was one of ours, why it would fly without lights across a busy air lane.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

light about a third the way from what looked like a huge shuttle cockpit tip. there were two large aircraft that had strobes flying on either side in a v formation. my girlfriend also saw it right after i did in a place twenty miles away from here. i'll ask her to file her own report. it flew pretty low, not like right above the tree line but like enough i could make it the engines on the planes following. i do live near ft bragg and am less than fifteen miles from the camp mccoll training ground, we see paratroopers jump from time to time. but in the past two weeks i saw a couple of those unmarked black helicopters flying very low near my house. oh that reminds me, this huge thing nor the planes showed up in photos i took, and i don't think they showed up in what my gf took miles away moments later. it's weird bc i had a sighting a few months back. my first, and it was the same day i was going thru deleting pictures and came to one from that night that showed a red light, upon playing w the filters the red light appeared to be a huge rectangular structure but headed towards it was the craft id seen. showing three white lights in a triangle w a red one in the center. i didn't report it bc i watched the video i took and saw nothing, deleted it. hating that now bc thru sum filters who knows what it may have shown. i didn't even realize if snapped a picture in the process of going to video that night. and the day i come across picture, which shows in sum filters to actually be a disc shape and triangle lighting pattern, but that's the night i c a flying aircraft carrier, idk what was. b if i can attach a picture i'll send one of what i first saw and make a report on it when i can better figure out the date, but the other night, even though i could c em fairly well, nothing shows up on my camera. i see strange lights zipping around in the sky here over half the nights i look for any length of time, but those two were extraordinary, add the black helicopters and ima bit worried about what's happening around here. oh and i also saw them return the same way they cane less than forty min later","distance":"101-500
