a.M. and i was waiting for a bus to return home. decided to go across the street to the park, which is at the corner of ocean ave. and santa monica blvd.\r\n\r\ni was standing at the guardrail at the bluffs that overlook pacific coast highway, it was a clear night and i could see the ocean and the stars. suddenly, out of the northwest corner i noticed an object that was all white and flying out toward the ocean. what caught my attention were two things:  \r\n\r\n1. it was completely quiet. 2. it flew in a strange, jerky, zig zag, side to side kind of movement that i had never seen before. it continued away from me for about another 200 feet then stopped in mid air. it hovered for a few minutes and it's white light seemed to go from bright white to dull and back again. at one point, it turned so bright that it left a thick trail of light on the water.\r\n\r\nwhen it began moving again over the water it took a southwestern route an was getting a little closer to me. at that point i could clearly see the shape was that of a cigar. the exterior looked gray and it had outside flashing lights that were blue, green and red.\r\n\r\nas it was leaving my view i looked back over the western part of the water and saw two more white craft, but both coming from opposite directions over the water. one looked to be about 200 ft. from me, while the other seemed to be about 300 feet. they both slowed to a very slow pace, but did not hover like the first craft did. they eventually crossed paths and one headed in the same southwestern path as the first one did. as it turned closer to me, it too was cigar-shaped, gray colored and had the same blue, green and red lights flashing on it.\r\n\r\nlong story short, over the next hour i spotted a total of 7 of these craft that would either hover over the water or move very slowly over it. all six left in the same direction, which was the southwestern direction.\r\n\r\ni watched the final one fly and hover for awhile. finally, and to my surprise, as it began to leave it started to fly in my direction. i became slightly frightened as i didn't know if it had observed me watching it. i stood under a large oak tree hoping to be shielded. i watched it silently fly over. it looked silver and gray on the bottom with a few red lights. it was flying quite fast at this point. it continued in a southeastern direction and i watched it fade from my view.\r\n\r\ni have always believed in ufos, but this was my first official sighting of one. i felt bewildered and somewhat out of sorts as to what i had just witnessed. \r\n\r\nlastly, my cell phone had died about an hour before so there was no way i was able to take any photos. furthermore, because it was still nighttime, i'm not sure how good the quality would have been anyway.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First off, it's hard for me to summarize this stuff. my family and i don't have just an event to explain. strange things have happened for years, so long it isn't uncommon to see something not star like in the night sky. i'd imagine the things unexplained probably correlate to one source, and possibly by explaining myself to people with the right knowledge base i can figure out more information on this issue for my whole family so here's my attempt.\r\n\r\nwhen i was around 7 the first strange thing took place. i was about to lay down for bed. when i laid back, i closed my eyes, but immediately after was bombarded with any memory i've ever had in a third person perspective. the strangest part on this was the speed of the memories flying by my mind's eye and the memories that would be randomly stopped on, as if everything that had ever happened to me was viewed in a flipbook. when i opened my eyes out of the fear of knowing what was going through my mind wasn't what i was truly thinking, i saw the most beautifully white light. words can't do justice to the brilliance. a silhouette arose from the vastness of white towards me. i tried to rationalize it as a family member being 7 & clueless, but it emerged what looked to be a woman, tall & slender, in a floor-length white gown, and the most compassionate eyes. eyes kinder than any i've ever seen a human have, true compassion was in them. i immediately feared that was the white light from what church had told me i'd see before death, and being 7, i was not ready so i closed my eyes tight and opened them back up. everything shot into a tiny ball of light when i reopened them and shot away. i could explain strange things about radio frequency being audible after that, but for lack of wanting to type, we'll slide past that.\r\n\r\nfor years, until i was 15, i can't recall anything strange. i lived in the woods, but we moved when i was 15 to live with my aunt for a couple months. that's when we started seeing what we refer to as 'nonstar' now.\r\none night i was lying in bed and felt that sensation of someone looking at you in the same room, but from the up above. you habitually look towards the energy when someone directs it at you so i looked up and saw what was looking i guess, a red, green, yellow, and blue light hovering outside my window. weird, but i didn't want to admit that i saw it so i kept it to myself for the first couple weeks. until i had a pretty good idea to when i could get my mother and aunt to see what i was talking about. it would appear around 10 every night and so i felt confident sharing. we watched it with binoculars and decided to call it a weather balloon after a week or so, so it wasn't abnormal to have outside and go on with life.\r\n\r\nfrom then to around a year ago i would have times when i'd see it, but when it's not daily, it doesn't seem as significant to me, but it's getting stranger now. \r\naround a year ago, i saw a beautiful blue asteroid fall behind my great-grandmother's house across the road from my driveway while coming home one night. i kept looking up when i turned mostly because i wanted to keep my eyes ready to see another of whatever i just saw. when i turned though, i made eye contact with the same thing that was outside my window every night for months, that i was aware of, when i was 15. i woke up my mother to show her, but she said it's been there every night for about a week now. if it was going to hurt us, it would already, go to bed.\r\ni did, but the next night i got her and my sister involved in watching it. we watched it for around 30 minutes out of our kitchen window. it hovered, figure-eighted, floated down and up gracefully while changing its lights. i got my sister's telescope and saw the bottom which looks like a strip of lights going really fast. as we were watching, a pack of coyotes came to our back yard and started howling. at that moment, a bright blue shot out of the bottom for around a two second time, strange. i'm trying to figure out what it is, and in the process read a few things. it sounds like the people in 1976 in tehran saw a similar object. it pulsates lights quickly, in different patterns. it can have four smaller ones in a diamond shape that appear to do different light patterns around it. what troubles my sister and me most from it is the heaviness that you feel on the top of your head when it's out and the strangest vibration sound that is heard through the house when it's there. \r\ni'm from a small town, you don't declare you are seeing things in the sky in a place like i grew up so we're really in the dark about what this is and it's still affecting us so any information about what that is would be amazing! i know how it sounds, but i really am doing this as a last resort for answers. we've also started seeing a low to the ground yellow orb that looks more like the white light i saw as a little girl when it's higher in the sky. that started last week. within the week i've seen it with others twice. it moves about, the one we see routinely hovers until mornings. then it either slowly flies away or dims until its gone. \r\n\r\nnow i also saw i could click that black helicopters have been sighted and they honestly have given me the worst experience out of my family's unexplained files as i like to call them. we see them fly over routinely, and that doesn't bother me until they start doing things that i can't believe is by policy.\r\nmy sister and i were sitting in our living room watching something on netflix. then boom! it sounded like a bomb, one second, the rumble started. it came closer and closer until it hit the glass of the front house windows. there was a strong, violating vibration that shook every organ of my body, saw it shake the ground, my sister, and hit the back of the house windows. we jump up and hold one another. we both, from what we just felt, thought we must've just been attacked by an enemy of our country. then here comes the black helicopters. there were at least 8 of the regular black helicopters and then a black double winged helicopter in the middle. immediately after seeing that coming towards the house, i ran towards the back door so they could watch me watch them doing whatever they were doing because it upset me. my sister came too with her phone out and got a great picture of the big one in the middle's back hatch open. i don't have the file to send now, but can if you'd like to see. we went in to look up what had shaken through us on her computer, with three fire walls. we find what it was, spot on with our picture. her computer goes black. she immediately started getting expressive because of what had happened. she explained that her computer was hacked and wiped. when it reloaded it loaded to the sites she used the day prior. if violating us with a vibrational frequency or whatever it was wasn't enough, violating computer usage too. that's awful. we got back to the site though and found out what it was. a new model of the line of unmarked helicopters from ft.Campbell that is to be used in military services in battle scenarios. we read the hatch would only be open during battle scenarios so why did we feel and see what we did? if you have any information, any idea as to what happened, especially about the helicopters antics, i'd be forever grateful. i don't like the idea of this happening to my family again without knowing what it is. thanks for reading a brief summary on the strange happenings i am tired of knowing nothing about! please let me know what you think is happening if you are educated on these topics!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

question:\r\n\r\n“in our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. i occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. and yet i ask, is not an alien force already among us?

ahhahaha.\r\nsometimes ignorance is bliss.\r\nother times you are just ignorant.\r\n\r\nthe deceived people of the world would unite to fight the “enemy”, and the globalist powers would manufacture

enemy such as “terrorists”)\r\nnuclear threat (truman dropped the bombs when the empire of japan verbalized intent to negotiate peace)\r\nalien threat (a universal menace that would force national

talking on the phone with one of my friends, around 8:45 pm i started to see flashing lights start from what appeared to be the ground but i had rooftops in the way. there was at least 35-40  lights shooting up pretty good size. from then they started to go across the sky and they formed a chevron type shape, at that moment i took two pictures. from then i started  to drive towards where i thought this was coming from. i still had my friend on the phone telling her everything i was seeing. as i'm driving the lights came back around and formed triangles, probably about 8 or so triangles all pretty close together.  by this time i was driving as fast as i could to get to the closest parking lot where the lights were coming from. after the triangles, there was a huge v-shape very large v-shape,  at that moment i was able to pull into another parking lot and get out of my car, got my phone went to take a picture and the lights went dark except for one light that remained for about 10 minutes. then it faded out. but i could see the outline of a huge mothership right before the v lights went dim. i have 3 pics total, unfortunately not of the triangles or aviva of the chevron and them shooting from the side or what looked like the ground. im a normal sane a person,  i know what i saw that night was not of this world. it still blows my mind what i saw. i've shown a few the

shaped object in the distance moving toward my general direction. there were a few low altitude  planes in the sky during the observation on their usual predictable flight path into heathrow. the object was high in the air, the planes and the small cloud to my left gave me an indication of size and altitude. it must have been quite large but not the size of a 747 at all, perhaps 7-12 meters wide.\r\n\r\nthe sky was crisp and clear and the object was reflecting sunlight off it's surface. the surface was metallic in nature, but not heavy looking. the central top area was illuminated by itself or reflecting the most light. when i first saw it in the distance the entire craft was reflecting sunlight, brightly. when it was to my left it was the central area that was illuminated.\r\n\r\ni watched for a minute and noticed it had no wings and no port/starboard lights and moved without making a noise as it was getting closer but still quite high. i took out my iphone 4 and took some pics as it moved over to my left. i even tried to zoom in but didn't get a decent shot, only about 5 shots on the standard setting making it appear quite small in the frame, yet for me identifiable.\r\n\r\nthe disc moved at an even pace quite slowly all through its trajectory. it appeared too slow for a fixed wing craft to sustain lift. it was not a helicopter, there was no noise at

grande ave noturna, mas se aproximando mais e saindo totalmente fora do raio de visão da copa de uma árvore, eu vi nitidamente um mecanismo voador no formato de bumerangue com 6 luzes redondas e vermelhas que pareciam como transparentes. quando ele chegou sobre a rua mudou seu rumo 90 graus a direita, baixou de altitude, diminuiu um pouco de tamanho e passou a 15 metros acima de mim,

at the sky. \r\n\r\nsummer here in brazil were approximately 7pm summer time. i noticed that there was something \"pulsing\" in the sky but could not see anything, just that light. i watched it for about 20 minutes so i decided to go up to my apartment and see with the camera which could be that.\r\n\r\n i used a camera sony h-100 zoom 42x, first took a picture and then started shooting. the object was too far away, the naked eye could only see the pulsating light but with the camera i noticed it was a metal object, at one end had a light beating. \r\n\r\nthe object was exactly 90 degrees about me, it was bad to shoot because the zoom is at the most and i was shooting over my head, so the footage was blurry. it was hard to focus on the object, as was still day and could not see right in the camera display, and often had to zoom out to find the object in the sky. i filmed for 5 minutes and i got tired of holding the camera above my head and frustrated to not be able to focus on the object. i went down on the playground again and watched the object for another 15/20 minutes standing in the same position in the sky and then i can't see it

and a couple videos (though the videos are pitch black and just are basically audio). i have yet to find an explanation for what the object was and i have not seen it since then. i typed up a detailed account right after spotting it, which is as follows. if anyone has seen something similar, please let me know. i know it's an old account but after talking about it to someone, i was encouraged to post here.\r\n\r\nmarch 2010 - as i was walking home from work at 8 last night, i saw this interesting object in the sky that got my attention. the object consisted of 3 solid lights and 1 blinking light on the right. it didn’t look like a plane at all. maybe it was a plane, but if it was, the plane was flying way too low. i’m about 15 miles west of bwi airport, so it is normal to see planes coming and going. the object i saw was descending in an awkward way, parallel to the horizon like a helicopter, but i've seen helicopters descend in the area at night and it didn't look like one. i probably would have ignored it were it not for a gut feeling that something was not right with that object. i followed the object as i walked home, but lost it as i got to my street. i was a bit disappointed, but immediately spotted another object that was even more interesting… \r\n\r\nthe object was a blood red color, and was moving through the sky at a fairly fast speed. it was about the brightness of mars in the night-sky, but a darker red. i am not too familiar angular diameter, but it took less than 5 seconds for it to move a distance equivalent to the width of the full moon. it was not very bright, just a bit brighter than the stars on orion’s belt, so i kept losing sight of it. when i first saw the object, it was heading southwest while blinking at variable speeds. i pointed it out to a neighbor who said it could be mars, but it was moving way too fast and didn't look like a plane or helicopter. i quickly ran inside and grabbed my camera. i still have it, it's a kodak z730 budget camera but thankfully it has a custom exposure slider.\r\n\r\nwhen i returned outside, i could not find the red object. i looked around for it, but could not find it. a few minutes later, it (or another, similar object) reappeared from my northwest. it followed a similar, but slightly different path, parallel to the first object. on a normal 1/8th second exposure, the camera did not capture the red object. i upped the setting to 2-6 second exposure and captured the flight of the red object. when it reached the spot near where it hovered before, it slowed down, but then rounded a 90 degree turn and i lost it a few seconds later. up until when it rounded the turn, i thought the object could be a plane or a meteor or something, despite having 2 passes. but the 90 degree turn was done at a speed that i have never seen in any other object. after the turn, i saw it turn blue, and then i lost it. ”\r\n\r\ni had another similar experience with a similar red object several weeks later. in the middle of the night i woke up and just felt the urge to peek outside. i saw a red object just moving slowly from my north to my south at a full moon's width every 6-7 seconds. i thought to myself \"that's odd but it's probably just a helicopter.\" a couple seconds later, it suddenly shot down towards the horizon and my stomach dropped at least a foot. that photograph is attached. (the last image) \r\n\r\n\r\nwhat. the. heck. is. this. thing!?\r\n\r\n**tl;dr** saw weird red object in 2010 that did not look like any plane or helicopter i've ever seen. caught some crappy pictures of it using a multi-second exposure. then it stopped and shot down to the horizon at a 90 degree angle from it's previous position, covering a distance of the width of 5 full moons in a second.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

78 degrees, normal temps are in the 40s at night. the sky was clear and the moon was behind out with plenty of star cover and clear view of mars as a marker. i was talking to my pug on the second floor deck looking at the stars as i often do. i noticed a rather bright looking star which caught my attention right away. there was several air planes flying to the left of this bright start by a large distance. i continued to watch the bright object and yell at the dog, the object caught my attention by moving upon the objects moving in a downward right 90 degree angle. the object was stationary prior to this movement. the object became brighter and tripled in size as the white sphere clearly was looking like a movie star ship starting to engage its engines. the object became a white i could only describe as amazing looking. then within second of this brilliant white light it blasted off in a upward arch towards the top of the atmosphere. this whole event from watching the object remaining stationary to moving was roughly 5 mins at most. once the object started its downward sharp right angle it was gone within seconds. the amazing part was the way it moved from stationary was flawless, a smooth almost unreal movement and as it flew into the atmosphere. no noise was noted, no colors other than a sparkling white to burning intense white during what this writing is noted \"takeoff\". the writer stayed outside with a cell phone set to video to record any other noted activities but nothing occurred at this time and date.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional

waked up at midnight wanting to drink some water. suddenly saw a big saucer. it was larger than 4 cruise ships combined. it had bright slightly orange lights and was hovering over a large hotel. it didn't move at all. at first i thought it was lights from the hotel but then when i paid a bit more attention, i noticed that the lights are brighter and larger than hotel lights.I tried to take a picture but didn't have a camera. i reported it on a forum too. i could not stay up so much so i went to bed and lost sight of the
