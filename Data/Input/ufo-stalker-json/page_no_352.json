son, i witnessed would be my 3rd ufo experience out here in northeast ohio at our home. we live kinda in the country so this as stated above isn't my first time experiencing such an event. to give you an idea, we leave close to the akron canton airport, so i see plenty of aircraft take off and land here. i was facing sw when i noticed a bright light in the sky, to bright to be a star that early and oddly placed to be an aircraft landing or taking off. before i started filming this ufo it was hovering for a good 20 minutes in the sky, no sounds nothing just hovering. i started filming and then noticed it slowly descending behind the tree line. i stopped filming after it sunk below the trees as the camera wouldn't pick it up but it stayed behind the tree line where i could see it through the trees for a good 15 minutes. it wasn't a plane or helicopter no flashing lights, no sound. i feel gifted to be able to see one let alone three out here within 4 years. call me crazy i don't care but i know what i seen. \r\ndefinitely wasn't the space station. i first seen at 7pm higher in the sky, began filming at 719pm lost sight behind the trees 3 min later, completely lost sight at about 730 ish. space station wasn't visible in the nw till 830 ish. i have video upon request. i can say it wasn't a plane, meteor, or the space station. only leaves two other explanations, ufo or a drone, ive never seen a drone give off such a bright light. this is my 3rd ufo experience out here in 4 years, each different.

was pointing the camera a little to far to the left and then the triangular object came into view.  it was flashing and traveling south.  it wasn't that high in the sky but it was moving away from me.  i noticed the flashing lights and different shades of blue and gray. may have been different metals.  i tried to make sure i followed it with my camera. as it moved away from my sight it turned left and began traveling east.  i took as much video as i could and have not reviewed it yet because i wanted to report this as fast as possible. i will attach the video.  anyway, i have seen a few ufo's (flying very low) since moving here.  i am frightened by this because i was not a believer until i observed a ufo that was very close.  this ufo was not the same one as before. each one i have seen has had blinking lights but the shape varies.  they fly very low which is why i see them so clearly.  previously they were silent. this one tonight was extremely loud.  i do live by an airport and know what i saw and heard. this was not an airplane or helicopter. nor was it a drone or weather balloon.   our airways are monitored and i believe they would have seen this thing.  i would like confirmation of this incident. i did watch it until it was out of sight due to houses and a hill.  \r\ni want to mention that i heard the same sounds later tonight while typing this but did not see

national forest in wi, we were camping at the p4 camp site.  this was our fourth night at the campground, and the first night since we had been there that the sky was clear.  it was about 7:00 pm, and we had just finished eating supper.  i had been looking at the sky, because i enjoy looking at the stars when there is little light pollution.  i had noticed a bright, white sphere in the eastern sky, and i had been trying to figure out what it was.  it was too big for a star, and i thought that it might be a planet.  i periodically glanced at the object trying to figure out what planet it could be.  \r\n\r\nmy friend and i were talking about the events of the week, and i was sitting at the picnic table looking at the object, when all of the sudden it started to move, slowly at first, then faster.  i told my friend what i was seeing (my friend is blind).  it was moving south-southeast, and had become obscured by some evergreen trees.  i ran from the picnic table, down the steps to the dock at the campground, because i thought that would give me a better view as the object moved sse.  when i got to the dock, the object was gone.  i walked back up the stairs to the picnic table where my friend was still standing.  i told her that the object was gone by the time i got down to the dock.  i was describing the sphere to my friend, when i looked to the east again, the sphere was back.  \r\n\r\ni told my friend that the sphere was back, and was describing it to her.  while i was describing the sphere, and scrambling to find a camera or our video recorder, the sphere split forming two spheres.  when it split, it appeared as though the new sphere dripped off the original sphere.  these spheres were originally aligned vertically, and then the lower sphere moved upward to be aligned horizontally.  once the spheres were aligned horizontally, one of the spheres split again.  there were now there spheres aligned horizontally.  each time there was a split, the spheres became smaller, and they were all bright white.  the two sphere on either side, just seemed to turn off, leaving the sphere in the middle.  that sphere began to change colors, cycling through white to red to red-orange.  this continued for about a minute, and then that sphere just turned off.  \r\n\r\nthe original sphere was slightly bigger than a bb held at arm’s length, and it was oriented approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.  since i’m not familiar with the area, i don’t have an estimate of how far away the object might have been from the campground.  the object(s) did not make any noise, and i didn’t see anything like an exhaust trail.  the overall sighting lasted around 40-50 minutes.  about 20 minutes after all of the objects had disappeared, a plane flew over our campground.  it was easy to hear the plane’s engine, you could see the outline of the plane in the sky, as well as see the aviation lights blinking on and off.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately, we did not get a photo of the object(s).  my camera had fallen out of my backpack on to the ground under the picnic table, and i didn’t see it there until the next morning.  we did get the video camera out, but were unable to record the object(s) due to a camera malfunction (?).\r\n\r\n   \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

first noticed just above my eye line a shere which was white passing through cloud cover in a horizontal line which i would say was size of a basketball ,compared to moon size of a tractor tyre which was clearly visible at time.I stood and watched it move from right to left or east to west in direction,for maybe a minute,when i saw a same size object parallel left of it,my first impression was they looked like two torches pointing towards me,but were obviously massive but miles away,has far as the eye can see,if a bright star is the size of a small raindrop,then these were the size of a orange if at the same distant,but obviously they want,the city of leeds is 12 miles away,i don't know but if they were above it,they was the size of a basketball. it is hard to judge the distance they were from me but a plane passing just above with flashing red light,was a pin prick compared to an orange at the distance and i would say that the plane was nearer,i see passenger planes all the time and that's how i get the size difference.So i kept an eye on these two objects all the time only losing sight when passing trees and houses.Has i got nearer home both objects seemed to be stationary,now it could be that cloud movement tricked me to thinking that they were moving east to west on my first sighting i can't say for definite.But when i got home i had a stationary  fix on them,they were fixed just above roofline of neighbours house,now i can judge my estimation on size,distance,movement,comparison, i don't know how far the i can see,to add i have good eyesight,but they were miles away,but they were big,the moon is absolutely miles away,yet my comparison is star a dot,objects a basketball,moon a tractor tyre.Thats the best i can do,and the planes flying in every direction dots.My first thought was to grab my samsung tablet,no show, then grabbed my mobile,no charge,so i grabbed my partner's mobile who is working night shift at adds supermarket,its a samsung galaxy note 2 ,old now,not that good,but ay,its the best i've  got and started to video \r\nthem,now i dodon't know her phone so i messed about for a while,trying zoom in,no go!,night vision,no better,so after 4/5 attempts to film which i've kept,i settled for auto vision at normal zoom,had no choice,and not happy,but it's all i could do,so i filmed them for 3  more takes of about 50 minutes to maybe 1 hour.They remained stationary in a fixed position between my back next door neighbour,my adjoining neighbours shed,my kitchen doorframe.They remained constant in size and distance,not pulsating but fade-in in and out,constant but not conformed or regular,so to me,sometimes they would slightly  fade ,then the one on the left would fade then vice versa,then they both looked like tigers eyes,then full globes,then bright then dim,and all the times this was happening the moon was disappearing from view for long spells of time due to clouds,which were visible all the time to my naked eye,yet they never distorted these objects ,i know that for sure,the moon was slightly higher and i would say 20 degrees east based on 360 degree basis of my fixed view.I filmed about 6/7 times stopping just to try zooming in and better vision to no avail,,not my phone ,but the longest of these was about 35 minutes,and although it's not a good picture,or ratio of size,you can see that it's strange,but to my naked eye,it was unbelievable.I truly believe for the first time i witnessed something,err? i don't know,but would love to collaborate with radar sighting.I would say frommy position,north by northeast..Am i wrong or am i right,ever wway i liked to know!  to add its now 2.56 am.Thats 5 hours all this as taken,i after get up for work in morning,so i am taking this seriously.Thank you for any kind of response,positive or negative.....I can send the mobile phone footage,but only if i get a reply to do so","distance":"Over One

 just as they do in the presence of a predator, they had been raucous until a few moments before i sighted the cylinder. the other interesting thing was that the anomaly seemed to respond directly to my thoughts (i know that this is a preposterous suggestion and that its subsequent change of direction was purely coincidence) - but twice it seemed to react to my thoughts. the first time i thought \"come this way you bugger, so that i can get a better look at you!\" and to my surprise, it changed its direction from heading west and then arced toward me in the north east, again traveling end over end (almost like a boomerang) and then when it was directly overhead, i thought \"stop...So that i can see you better.\" and to my surprise, it did. still it was very high and it appeared to be being mobbed by white birds, small white dots were swooping in toward and then away from it. i craned my neck to look up at it for a good minute or more and despite the wind, it remained stationary. i then considered the possibility that it was some type of drone and that it was paused to take surveillance images for some unknown entity (presumably a corporation) and as a result my mug and it's awestruck expression was being captured for someones database - for reason's unknown. as soon as i entertained this thought, the thing tumbled away leaf like toward the eastern horizon and was soon lost from sight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:16:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":79873,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-35.1043054,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-10182016-0004","longitude":150.634359,"occurred":1476188040000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New South Wales","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1476776675000,"summary":"Brightness caught attention, while i was working outdoors. initially dismissed the sighting as airborn rubbish (plastic).","tags":["floating","entity"],"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney","timeZoneName":"Australia/Sydney","tweeted":1476791403250,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/79873_submitter_file1__UAPTuesdayOct111.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"2540","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Sanctuary Point, New South Wales","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:54134"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Los Angeles","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First sighting of white ord was arround 12:47 pm. was waitting for step son to get out of school, reach for my camera but by then has dissappered. went home and arround 2:05 came out went to the car got my camera it was a beautiful day. found some shade and look up to the sky se. i observed a orb;
