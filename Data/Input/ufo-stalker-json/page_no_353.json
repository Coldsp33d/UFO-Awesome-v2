staring at it in sydney's hot and blue sky - underneath that object that was something man-made was one of those crafts that are triangular with 3 pulsating white lights and it's like it was malfunctioning with its cloaking device and was translucent but could still see the triangle shape and an orb bot coming from the west going east.\r\n\r\ni was in awe and shock and excitement. i am not on drugs or hallucinated that because my father saw the last one zoom by at incredible speed.\r\n\r\ni'm actually having anxiety and when i saw the craft and then the orb with it that was soooo bright i yelled out to my father to come and look - by this time the triangle and it was not all translucent - it was like a cloaking device bubbling and changing around it - like it failed to cloak it completely. and it was escorted with an orb at a speed just a little faster than a plane.\r\n\r\nbut the other 2 orbs zoomed past from the same direction from west to east and only like a kilometre away in the sky. right in front of me.\r\n\r\ndad finally came out and missed the 3rd one and saw the last and most brightest flying a straight path to where the other to went i assume.\r\n\r\ni never seen anything like this before and only on youtube. had i have video taped it - it would have been the best footage ever in a sunny blue sky and i lost sight of them all as there is a double story

it was flickering/twinkling like you would expect a star, but then i questioned if it was moving to my roommate. he said it was moving earlier, and that it was vanishing then reappearing, and so did his girlfriend. after observing it shortly and deducing it was slowly moving, i observed it began to dim slightly, then vanished from the sky. as of this writing, about 45 min from writing this, i have not seen it again since. i believe i witnessed the object for about 1 min 20 seconds, but it was in the sky before i witnessed it and other people where already looking at it, i.E. my roommate, his girlfriend, and anonymous other people with her at our university's new building. this sighting is particularity important to me because i observed a similar albeit red/orange orb in sarasota florida that vanished almost 2 years ago while i was on vacation;

familiar in the otherwise clear sky. i immediately pointed it out to my neighbor as we were heading towards the car. it looked like a smoke ring-perhaps 30 feet in diameter, but seemed to consist of cloud. there are no chimney's or smoke stacks on either building that i am aware of. this was see through in the center. it was stationary between two buildings-a one story and a two story over a parking lot area. it had no solid structure to it whatsoever in that there was no evidence of a solid object being there such as metal, glass, wings or actual lights. around the perimeter of this oval shaped ring were much smaller and a more dense/thick  cloud matter that was perfectly round in shape and spaced equidistant around the ring.These seemed to have a little bit more of a brightness to them without giving off any actual light.My neighbor and i stood and marveled at it for about 1 minute at that time of the sighting. i shared that i had seen this same thing in the same general area several times in the past about 3 years prior. it was in basically the same area. i saw it from approximately a half a block further away from an easterly direction facing again facing west from my balcony. i suggested that it appeared as if there was something solid there that was possibly cloaked, for lack of a better term, that would have been a disc-shaped object that had lights around the perimeter but everything of the thing that might have been made of solid material, ie. a structured craft, was somehow being cloaked. it was too perfect in shape to be just clouds and too detailed in appearance to be some sort of mist or fog. my neighbor agreed that the way i thought of it as being a cloaked object that was in actuality solid but not able to be detected as a solid object resonated as what it appeared it could be.We moved the car into the garage and  decided to walk back to study it again. it hadn't changed or moved from what we could tell in the 1-2 minutes it was out of our field of vision. we stared at it again from about 1 minute and returned to our building.","distance":"101-500
