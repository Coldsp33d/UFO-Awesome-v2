where were you and what were you doing at the time? i was taking a walk in the later evening about dusk to get some steps in for the day. the sighting was around 730p est, in newnan, ga, about 15 miles south of hartsfield jackson airport.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object? there 2 very bright lights in the sky, not airplane lights. living so close to the airport i see airplane lights all the time and know the landing patterns of the planes. they were out of the landing path from the west and east of the directions of the planes in the area. the orb lights stood out like a sore thumb. the orbs were also closer together than any planes would be on approach to the airport. \r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? airplanes\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. 2 very round, circular, glowing orbs. like perfect glowing circles. almost star like in color. after taking the pictures with an iphone 6s +, i zoomed in to see if i can get a better look. in the middle of the orbs there seems to be something in the middle of each of them, but not sure if it is just distortion or not. \r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. i always look for ufo's, so i was excited that this could be my first potential sighting. i had no other feelings other than excitement. i texted my buddy the picture and he check flightradar24 and nothing on the app showing aircraft in the area matching the two orbs in that area. i am always skeptical of ever seeing anything like this, but this was different than anything i have ever seen before.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object? total sighting was about 10 minutes for me. i wasn't 100% sure, so i started walking down the hill to my house. i as started walking each orb went in separate directions in slow controlled line. it was odd to me that they were going the opposite direction of the landing patterns of the planes. they went below the tree line (in the pictures) and didn't see them again.","distance":"Over One

pros to film the sunset, one go pro 2 the other a gopro3. we placed the 2 on time-lapse and the 3 on video 25 feet apart from each other. the time-lapse was accidentally set on 1 minute intervals, the other 30fps 1080p hd video. while we were eating dinner we observed a object that looked unfamiliar and even in the video two of us are discussing what it could be although neither one of us had remembered the conversation. in the video we start to eat and stop watching the object toward the end which is the section of the video the object dematerializes. we continued to summit the next day and return to portland. for 3 years the video sat on a hard drive. i was cleaning up my hard drive when i first discovered the object in the video clip. i was very confused as to the conversation we had in the video as someone asks me if the object is a airplane and i reply, \"if not its a ufo\". i had no recollection of ever saying that. examining the video, and running it thru basic filters on imovie, it became quite obvious to me that what i had recorded was a disk in a slow spin which appears to be skipping but i believe the skipping illusion was caused by whatever powered this craft because the object skips along in the video, and its is a solid disk in the 3 photos captured by the gopro2. i believe the illusion of skipping is caused by a distortion by whatever powers the object. all 3 photos taken show a solid disk with a light upper and a dark lower. i have 3 photos and one 5 minute video with a 2 minute 50 second sighting. on december 31st 2014 at new years, roughly a few days after i had discovered the video, my wife, my climbing partner and i were on my porch celebrating new years eve. at exactly the change of new year, a disk illuminated 500 yards above the broadway bridge, the disk was stationary and had a bubbled center with a tracer type light circling the disk before it went dark. i saw a clear bubble shape in the lower center and the disk was completely stationary. after 5 seconds the disk slowly started moving west toward the coast and as it got directly over portland a \"orb\" came around the side of my building, 8th floor, and stopped directly in front of all 3 of us for about 3 to 5 seconds. the appearance of the \"ball\" looked like a rock, there was no smooth surface, and the movement was irregular like if a nickel was put into a blown up balloon and tossed. it then shot up into the air and went directly toward the disk. i lost sight of both as the went over the hill behind portland toward beaverton or. i will upload a photo taken, but the video file i will only give to someone who takes interest. i have tried other resources getting help with this and have had no luck, no one has the photos or video file. the video i put together was recently shown at the roswell ufo festival 2016.

other roomate was standing in the driveway facing west just staring at something in the sky. we said \"hey whats up?\"..He just pointed at this classic black triangle tr-3b style craft without losing his focus on it. so at that moment i pulled my phone out to capture it on film or at least get a picture, but the craft wouldnt show up on my screen in the shot. almost like it was cloaked, but we could still see it with the naked eye. it was moving less than 100mph easily, it seemed as if it would just fall from the sky it was moving so slow. the altitude it was at is unknown because i dont know how large it was, but it seemed to be only a few hundred feet in the air and very big. it was so close i felt like i could reach out and touch it. it was loud like a airliner as it was coming at us, but was silent when it was above us, and had a quiet hum that almost made you want to vomit as it flew away to the east. none of us had any fear, we all swemed pretty calm, if not \"amazed\". it had small squared windows on the side, three red lights on the corners of the undercarriage, a big white light in the center of the undercarriage, and a vertically vented rear \"thruster\" area. there is always ufo activity out there, some at space altitudes, and some closer. but this was the only one weve ever been able to clearly make out what it was. surely other farmers and local saw the craft.

naturally i was staring at the sky and we live on a flight route from boise. so i'm used to seeing a lot of planes and king is going over and i also come from an air force military background. so i was i was laying there looking up i noticed that it looked like there was this bright star even know it was on the 830  and there really wasn't much for stars out yet at least not in that area, so as i watch this i noticed that it never moved even though there how did the trade rooms up there and it was kind of a blustery day so i yelled out my neighbor to take a look and see if he had any opinions on what it might be because i thought maybe it was the star and he said  no it's in the wrong area, thought maybe possibly a satellite since it's orbiting around it would travel with this and not moving. but isaac got my attention more i started the video and take pictures and then i happen to have a telescope sitting on the porch so i tried focusing my iphone 6s plus which has a pretty  good camera through the lens of the telescope although it was shaky i could see a little more detail. so after toiling over talking about it and hearing other people mention it i'm not understanding what it can bs just kind of put it in the back of my head and had these pictures.  and after talking to my father which is part of saturday and was fine he said that i should probably send this to him just to have it looked at so here i am. i would so much love in answer to this. thank you for any opinions and help you can give, , i think it's the not knowing and the questioning it is bugging the crap out of me. fyi i'm not some your final night or conspiracy but i do believe in a higher arrive from dennis and i've seen a lot of things in my life to show me  may show me i may be right. but this made my hair stand on and i'm creeped me out same with my neighbor and friends i've talked to that side as well hope to hear from you. i had expecting as a place to put my videos and pictures the

something caught my eye. i was facing almost due east, looking at a full moon. with buildings obscuring the distant horizon, in came to view a single, radiant orange glow, such as reminded me of a hot air balloon heater, but without the balloon. intensity pulsated   irregularly, the way flames do, not rythmically. nothing was blinking. it was silent. it was moving at a steady pace. i'd use the word gliding. my impression was that it was 500-1000 ft off the ground, but the way the moon lit the background, it was hard to discern. if it was at a height in that proximity, it must have been cruising at a speed of 100 mph. at that point i was siting in my car, radio low, windows down with the temp about 66°f. then a saw an identical light come into view along the same path. it occurred to me the first could be teathered to the second. their relative distance seemed that consistent at that point.\r\n\r\nwhen the second one showed up, i grabbed my iphone and stepped out of the car. i couldn't come up with anything that explained what i was seeing, and figured i'd try and capture it. the phone cam could barely capture the lights, and of course, they were tiny on screen. at the point the first one was overhead, i saw a third come into view. at this point it was clear these were not on an identical track, but it was as if they were generally moving along the same path. then, two more for a total of five \"things\", i was looking between. these flamy-glowy things were of the same shape and intensity whether they were approaching me, over me, or going away from me. at no point could i find evidence of sound. their paths bent toward the north slightly. way off in the distance, the first gave me the impression it had slowed down, as if it were letting the second take over the lead. my vision isn't the sharpest, but the state doesn't require me to wear glasses, if that's any indication of my visual acuity. it was damp enough it was hazy, but i remember no clouds. i never saw any intense acceleration. i never saw anything jerky. intensity of the glow never varied.  they each, in turn, exceeded my ability to see them until they had all gone. i looked around to see if there was anyone else that might have been looking at me, or perhaps had seen what i had seen. no one. \r\n\r\ni have lived near lambert international airport, and later, near scott afb my entire life. i watched with enjoyment, all manner of aircraft, large and small, over my years. it didn't feel like jets. it didn't feel like helecopters. i think of myself as a fairly analytical, discerning, creative and bright fellow, and i cannot explain what i saw. felt the need to share.

wanted to take more so i aimed my camera again.  this time the light that i thought was a star moved and kept abruptly moving in various directions. suddenly it would disappear.  a second or so later reappear.  it did this several times then shot straight up behind the moon.  it came over the top of the moon as a larger red oval with a whitish green glowing center. i snapped a picture. then it disappeared.  i called into the house for my boyfriend to come outside to see what i was seeing on my camera.  it reappeared again under the moon as a star looking object only to repeat moving abruptly under the moon.  i snapped a picture.  again it shot straight up behind the moon.  it again came over the top of the moon as a larger red oval with a whitish green glowing center. i snapped a picture. it disappeared for a brief second and reappeared under the moon.  it still appeared as a larger oval with glowing center.  it stayed under the moon for several seconds.  i snapped a picture and in this one picture the moon is elongated and distorted as well as the oval object now has an glowing elongated center.  it then slowly disappeared.  none of this was visible to the naked eye.  since my phone battery was going out, i went into the house and grabbed my boyfriend's cell phone.  i ran back outside (a total of 15 seconds that i was in the house) stood on m patio in the same
