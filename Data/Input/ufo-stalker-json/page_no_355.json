july. he lived in a rural area west of the city of owen sound ontario canada, near sauble beach ontario.We hadn't seen each other since school ended for the summer.We were hanging out, talking, just doing what friends do etc.We were walking on the side road where he lived it was around 10pm at night. we both seen this strange looking light , down the road probably a mile or so, above the tree top level, we could see the out line of the tree tops form the remaining day light. this object hovered above the distant tree line, but swaying left to right. it had 5 lights the centre light was redish to orange in colour but pulsating, and it had 4 other lights that were in a square around the centre light that were green blue.We watched it for 20-30 seconds, while it swade from left to right.Then the object,moved right towards,us in a blink of a eye. i only really recall the centre light becoming extremely bright, like some one pointing a flash light in your eyes at night.Then in the next moment, i was watching the object swaying left to right above the tree top level down the road, and then it just streeked acrsos the sky, in a north direction and disappeared.My friend and i both looked at one another, and with out a word,both ran back to his house.We went inside his house, in his lower level( the house was a 2 story we were in the lower ground level)we sat on a the couch and after a few moments asked each other \" did we see what we just seen\". we both described the same lights and rapid movement of the object , not just like a \"flash light being shone in your face at night\", but how the object just streeked across the sky.One thing, that is the strangest part, is that my friends digital wrist watch , was almost an hour behind the clocks in his house, and he looked at all the clocks in the house even the one on the kitchen stove.They all read 11:20 pm, i thought he was just kidding be he showed me all of them. and from his wrist watch to the clock in his house , i still recall his wrist watch being 10:12 pm, and the clocks in his house reading 11:19pm.We did not discuss what happened,and  went off to bed. the next day after awhile, i asked him about what happened, he said to me we both know what took place, and \"as far as i am concerned, nothing happened\".Over the years we have drifted apart.Before we went our separate ways in life , so to speak, i would periodically had asked him, do you want to talk about took place that night and he would have nothing to do with it.For me i some times have \"flashes \" of things i can't explain. things like bright lights, with human like silouhets behind the lights.I had no unexplained scars or bruesing after the event.But am still left wondering, what had really happened.Now some 20 years later i live only but 2 miles south of where the events of 1995, took place ,and have seen some unexplianed things in the nights, or near night sky.As recently as august of this year 2016 i obsereved a clearly passenger jet, passing to the east of my house( we are under neath a flight path from torornto, ontario cananda's pearson airport for north westerly flights. departures and arrivals.) it was about 7:30pm in the evening and the jet outline was plain to see with the naked eye,but was being followed by a bright white light of a bit bigger size , but at the same level and approximately \"1 foot\", behind the jet(my view point,ground to sky) i have over the years of living here, have see lots of jets pass over head , but have never see one being followed by just a bright light.I can't explian this. or other instances of objects in the sky.I do beleive we are not alone in the universe and that earth has, and will continue to be visited by unearthly craft and or persons.","distance":"Over One

discussion to go home because i had work the next day. i only lived half a mile down the street so i drank my glass of wine and walked home. the time was around 2 o'clock when i made it home and i figured i have a cigarette before heading in. growing up i always looked up into the night sky and tonight it was cold, very quiet and clear. as i looked up i noticed a odd orb of light and thought to myself maybe its mars or something but realized it changed many colors and was far though close. then i noticed another one across the way and then the 3rd one each at a equal distance from one another. i thought to myself maybe its a ufo and laughed at the thought and considered maybe its little home made hot air balloons. then i noticed the complete object was at a tilt and its center was dark negative space with nothing shining through it. stars all around except in this dark triangle shape object which made no sound.  this thing is extremely big and it was heading north west which happens to be the direction of the nuclear power plant.  i looked at it for a few minutes external nervous and scared to even go inside my house to sleep. i was 24 at the time and really did some rational thinking as it happened.  i'm 100% sure i saw something i shouldn't have seen and wish i never did.

it was a solid black shape. it continued past my house and off into the distance with the airplane following close behind. i watched until they both flew out of my sight, and then just stood there trying to contemplate what i just saw. it definitely was not normal. you could just tell that it wasn't anything that you would see normally flying through the sky. i felt a little uneasy, but also exited about what i just witnessed. it would really be great to know that someone else witnessed this, just for validation, although i know what i saw, at it was not normal at all. thank you for listening and i hope to hear back from someone.","distance":"501 Feet -

ohio. i had been working there through a temp service for almost 3 months. i was on the highway and was approching a bridge ahead of the bridge i saw a big black triangle craft with white lights in each corner and one red in the center. it was big enough and close enough that it blocked the sky out as i approached it. it was just siting there hovering probably only about 100 feet above the trees and took up both sides of the highway. when i looked up as i drove under it the red light was right above me i have never seen anything like it. then i remember looking in my rearview mirror and it moved off to the right very slowly and when i tried to look back again it was gone. the weirdest part that bothers me to this day is that i could not remember where i was. i knew i was trying to get to work but all the sudden had no clue where i was and i had drove this route by memory for almost 90 days. i ended up getting off a wrong exit and got back on the highway trying to figure out how to get back home. i finally saw a sign that said youngstown which was kinda by where i lived in warren so i got off there and found my way back home and never went back to work there. i was staying with my father at the time and knew i couldnt tell him that so i told him that i was let go from the job through the temp service. to this day i have no idea how i could have forgot how to get to work it was like i felt funny and couldnt make a clear thought. ive came to this website before but could never bring myself to fill this out but i think i just want people to know and maybe somone knows what it was. thank you, matthew peigowski.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
