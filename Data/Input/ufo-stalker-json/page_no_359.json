avais pas bu d alcool,j etais tout ce qui a de plus sobre,je tenais a le preciser.J etais sorti fumer une cigarette.Cest en regardant dans le ciel que je remarque deux lumieres vive,presque comme des halogenes,mais ce qui m etonna c est que je n ai entendu aucun bruit,et pourtant ce truc semblai trã¨s proche,et c est surtout qu il ã©tait stationnaire,fixe,immobile,ancrã© et sans sonoritã© decelable a l oreille.Ces deux lumiã©res battã©es le rythme entre elles,sans temps defini,c est a dire que le temps d eclairage ã©tait alã©atoire,pas comme une signalisation d engin aã©roportã©s,le battement ã©tait irreguliã© mais trã¨s lumineux,sachez que je suis sur une zone aã©rienne plutã´t peuplã©,dense,mais la c ã©tait bas par rapport au gros porteur et autres planeur,car je suppose que les distances,appareils_terre sont defini,j ai pour habitude de regarder les ã©toiles sans pour autant imaginer des bizarreries comme celle-ci,en plus c ã©tait trã¨s proches,fixe.Le ciel ã©tait plutã´t degagã©,pas de nuages de plus c ã©tait trã¨s bas,pour donner une idee,ma camera ã©tait a un angle de 50-55â°,a l å“il nu,d ou je me positionnã©,la lumiere faisait pratiquement 1 centimetre au centre de flash incessant entre elles,qui n avait pas de temps equitable entre elles,elle sont restã©es stationnaire,durant moins de 5 minutes,et ce qui m a davantage surpris c est lorsque celle-ci est partie,trã¨s lentement,comme ci elle ã©tait sur un fil,dans l eau,trã¨s fluide,doux comme demarrage,pas comme un helicoptere,ces deux sources lumineuses se suivaient equidistantes entre elles,ce qui m a fais penser que c ã©tait un seul appareil mais long,lorsque celui ou ceux ont demarrã©,ils ont passã© au dessus des toits des maisons alentours,le temps que j aille voir de l autre cotã©,je n ai plus rien vu,volatilisã©.Ensuite je suis rentrã© chez moi sans trop y penser,c est deux jours aprã¨s avoir pris ces deux clichã©s,que je me suis dis,il y a quelque chose de bizarre dans ces deux

appeared to be somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 feet in altitude.  it was really too small for me to see clearly, but it looked like a boomerang on its side with one wing broken half off.  like an upside down \"l\". \r\n\r\nit was perfectly motionless from my vantage point for ~2 seconds prior to seeing it very rapidly shoot what appeared to be straight up.  right after it started ascending, it emitted or reflected a brilliant bright blue-white light, similar to a welding arc.  the light was very visible even though it was late in the afternoon.  the \"object\" was not close to me, i estimate it was at least 10 miles away, likely further when it shot up.  \r\n\r\nfrom the time i first saw it until it was out of sight was no more than 6 seconds.  i heard no sound whatsoever from this.\r\n\r\nabout 20-30 minutes later, i heard (not saw) loud jet aircraft (sounded like fighters) flying around for 10-15 minutes. i am an aviation buff and can identify all us aircraft made since wwii, some by engine sound alone. what i saw was definitely not an aircraft, it certainly wasn't a bird, wasn't an object bouncing off the atmosphere, or reflection.  i don't think a human being could

which was flickering red, blue and white from my window. this light can be seen in img_3065. at first i thought it was a helicopter as it was just hovering in the air for about 10 seconds until it started moving left and crossing the chimney. i can't remember whether it was after it had crossed the chimney or after it reversed course to the way it had came that it switched to a more brighter, rounder and stable looking blueish color like can be seen in img_3068 which did not seem to flicker noticeably, at least not to the human eye.\r\n\r\nthe course change happened quite quickly, maybe after 5 seconds or less after it had crossed the chimney.\r\n\r\ni couldn't hear any noise coming from this object but it could be due to it being far away.\r\n\r\nin the photo img_3070 you can see a gray colored object inside a white/yellow colored aura which itself is inside a neon blue colored outline. i couldn't see this object with my eyes.\r\n\r\nin the last photo that i took of this orb (img_3072) the orb appeared to change it's light structure to a more cylinder/cigar shape.\r\n\r\nit continued it's journey all the way to the trees that are on the right side of my window (can't be seen from pictures) after which i couldn't see it anymore due to the trees blocking my view. i did catch a brief glimpse of it through the trees continuing at the same path with the same exact height.\r\n\r\nafter i had seen this i didn't have that much time to react to it as i pretty much immediately after this saw another similar looking orb coming from the left side of my window. this one seemed to be just as bright or maybe even a little bit brighter than the last orb. this one also acted much more like an airplane than what the first one had as it came further from the left than the first one had in the same manner that i can occasionally see airplanes flying. this one was also less blueish than the first one had been and in fact i don't remember seeing any blue colors in it at all. i remember it looking just like a light-yellow looking ball of light going across the sky but in the pictures i took of it it looked more light-orange colored like can be seen in pictures img_3073-3075 which i don't recall seeing but then again it could be due to super fast flickering.\r\n\r\nin the picture img_3074 you can clearly see a sphere/hexagonal shaped object inside a orange colored light which itself is surrounded by a yellow aura of light. i didn't see this object with my eyes.\r\n\r\nin the picture img_3075 you can still see the object but in this photo it does appear to be more sphere looking that hexagonal. also the orange inside light seems to be gone.\r\n\r\nafter seeing these objects i felt pretty amazed at what i had seen as i realized they most likely weren't airplanes or helicopters.\r\n\r\nimg_3065-3068, 3070 and 3072 are taken with my camera without a window in between but all the rest are taken with the window in between and that is why those images are more blurry and smudgy looking as my window is pretty dirty.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

when i was younger.. around the age of 18 it started turning into physical abductions at night and randomly seeing crafts periodically. this carried on all throughout my life until the age of 32, at the age of 32 it turned into something completely different. a week before i turned 32 my body started transforming. i have holographic orbs & serpents swirling around me now. it's an energy that i do not completely understand, it's part of me & incomparable to anything i've ever seen. it changes color & can move through solid objects; it reacts intelligently. this energy is inside and outside of me at the same time & it never leaves me or stops existing. the energy regenerates my body & mind, it heals me & can heal others. at one point during the transformation, there was an etheric injection in my arm and i felt a spark jump into my body 'it shocked me\", now my eyes glow different & i feel like i have more energy & soul than did before. there's also a lot of energy work going on with my charkas while laying in bed at night. this transformation has been going on for almost 10 months now, it will be a year around the end of december. the race of aliens that i'm in contact with are \"the reptilians\". the reptilians send me holographs to communicate, they showed me our history through holographs \"we evolved from velociraptors\" and then there was some kind of war that's still being fought. from what i've gathered, i'm a reptilian/human hybrid, there's hybridization program right here on earth with rh negatives blood types & other hybrids do exist. unfortunately most have been killed, or haven't evolved enough mentally, physically, & spiritually or want nothing to do with the reptilians \"out of fear or being brainwashed by organized religion\". as of right now, there's only a handful of awakened/empowered hybrids. so there it is.. i'm in direct contact with reptilians \"they exist\" & we've formed a bond; they're really good to me. they guide, protect, & upgrade me. i wouldn't be alive without them, they've even saved my life multiple times; i trust them more than i do most humans. when the reptilians manifest on earth \"sometimes the women will come down to play\", they look like the celtic/nordic race. i can always tell when it's one of them because the women are always perfect, with a glow to them & stars in their eyes. it will only be for a period of time \"a few days or months\" and then after that they just disappear, never to be seen again. so basically from what i've gathered we have a race of reptilian/nordic terrestrial genetic & technological alien masterminds right here with us on earth. i stand by this firmly, i've spent almost 33 years of my life spinning in their web.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":79655,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4218671,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10072016-0004","longitude":-82.89986300000001,"occurred":1475809200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1475819859000,"summary":"I'm

daughter and 20 month old daughter in the car with me. as i turned onto the road towards the fields i noticed this very large aircraft moving at a fast pace across the sky. it got my attention because the appearance of the aircraft and how large it was but also way further off into the sky than a regular airplane and there were two airplanes in the sky as well so it was definitely out of place. it also caught my attention because of the many lights on the craft( about 5-6 lights on each side of the wing or craft) and they would fade in and out as if it was passing through a cloud but it was a completely clear sky with the moon and stars present. it really got my attention to the point where i pulled over and tried to video but it was so far off and fading in and out i couldn't get it on video and also strangely enough when i finally parked my vehicle at the parking lot i went to see if i could zoom in on the video and there was no video. that seemed strange to me as well because i was positive i got it on video and could prove it may have been something other than a ufo. as soon as i saw this craft it really excited me but also scared me to the point where i was shaking and had to really take a minuet to calm my self before parking and entering the park. my 5 year old saw this as well and coincidently said \"it's a funny looking plane\" and then asked where did it disappear when it wasn't in the sky anymore. \r\nthis isn't the first time i've witnessed something strange like this here in hattiesburg, along with my husband and 8 year old son witnessing a very strange

this at risk i know of being (further) branded a ‘loon’ but regardless i am not an absolutely convinced believer in the existence of visitations of beings from other planets here so far but the fact that this ¾ of an hour long event was at the time reported on radio at least by reportedly as many as ten thousand sydney-siders.\r\nhowever, curiously, reports of this, what one would have imagined as being regarded by ufologists, even under the circumstances of the number of reportees and level of importance of authorities give reports, it strongly appears as if skeptical authorities have perhaps intervened removing this event from ufo sightings reported sightings lists from among lists of reports of just single momentary sightings by just one or two people and one would have to ask why? why this particular event. perhaps was it for concern about the military implications for reasons which will become evident.\r\nas best as could calculate i know it was on a thursday night, i believe it may have been about one week before the upcoming christmas long weekend, the 22nd december 1983, we were preparing to gather everything together to go away on one of our last holidays to mid-north coast new south wales at south west rocks up at trail bay about 450 kilometers north of sydney.  we’d returned home to south bondi a bit after nine thirty from the last thursday night shopping night before the christmas long weekend planning to leave next morning on our annual holidays.\r\nwe planned to take the christmas break at horseshoe bay camping grounds where we’d stayed at least once before at trial bay and between rentals were once again staying with my mother-in-law’s three story house in fletcher street bondi after the unfortunate incident with our neighbor next door stealing our electricity.\r\nwe’d returned home around 9:30 pm after late night shopping shop’s closing on the last thursday night’s shopping before the christmas break in 1983.\r\nmy then wife and i, had gerry-rigged a unit out of the rear room and toilet complex some years earlier i’d started to fix up some years before to be eventually used for my young brother-in-law when he got older. we’d been staying there already a few weeks by december in the months prior to our planned migration in around march the next year to move to perth.\r\nat two stories above our south bondi street level and then elevation of another tall story above that down to the lane behind and below that the smallish window from the bath/toilet there held a commanding view across tamarama and down the coast. this can be seen since it is a photo from there i happened to save which i used to create the recreation of the sightings the three of us witnessed that evening.\r\ni put the shopping down ready to sort it after i had a cigarette while i hung out the window and enjoyed the view so as also not to allow my cigarette smoke back into the tiny flat.\r\nsuddenly two things rushed into the scene before me at what could only be termed, initially, as incredible speed, into the proximity of tamarama bay but then just pulled up on a dime as the saying goes to hover there momentarily around a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet above the park which nestles up into the small steep valley behind the road which circles tamarama bay in turn after bondi then mckenzie’s then bronte, coogee etc.\r\ni was gobsmacked and struggled to make sense of what i was looking at and seeing when just as suddenly while the other two ‘craft’, round orange metallic spheres about 20 to 30 feet across pulsing slowly, glowing brighter and then dimmer orange, seemed to just sort of hang there hovering when i was shocked by a third ‘craft’ which rushed equally fast into the scene.\r\ni was mesmerized trying to make sense of what i was looking at surrealistically transposed there into a scene which i was regularly accustomed to looking across whenever i had a smoke out that window. \r\nnow as i peered and tried to focus more closely at it appeared that there was a break in the surface circumference which became clearer with the dimming of the orange glow when its brightness faded. it was then that it was as if there were two 2/3rds size human like figures visible behind a window there moving about inside.\r\nconsidering that the objects were somewhere between 75 to 150 meters off, and almost, but not quite, up to the same height where i was standing on the top third story that i could estimate that they were between 20 and 30 feet across that the figures i was looking at would have been about two thirds my six foot height.\r\nimpulsively and frantically i called to my wife and daughter in the makeshift unit out of instinct “quick come and look the choppers are going to crash into one another!” because we’d lived there on and off for many months over the years and i’d watched how in bad weather especially the police helicopter frequently would hover over the cliffs with its enormous search light nicknamed ‘the midnight sun’ was used to search for fishermen swept from the rocks in high seas. but this was a warm balmy mid-summer night with barely a cloud in th sky and two nights out from a full moon two nights before which shone in the sky out the front of mother-in-law’s behind and away from the scene before me.\r\nbut the third ship, craft, thing did not crash into the other two but once it arrived came to the same incredibly apparently impossible abrupt halt considering its initial speed but then the other two did slowly begin to move off around the headlands south towards bronte beach and, i imagined beyond almost lackadaisically as if they were out of an casual evening stroll and reconnoiter doing no more than about thrifty miles an hour.\r\ni rushed inside as fast as i could and being a professional photographer formerly as quick as i could tried to affix my 250mm (?) telephoto lens  my pentax camera i admit nervous as hell and fumbling.\r\n“oh-h-h!” i thought disappointed on my return “the bloody things have gone when i returned to the bathroom window but no sooner did i arrive than they just popped up over the far southern bronte headland and continuing at the same steady pace started on a journey i estimate at around between fifty and one hundred and fifty feet above the road way along mcpherson street bronte, then waverley then from radio reports all the way down to the five ways mascot over the next three quarters of an hour or more before doing the typically reported thing of ufos’ splitting up and flying off in all different directions and blinding speed in zips of light.\r\nthe rest of that night was a busy one from memory packing the last of our camping supplies, bicycles, tent, annex and stuff into our new sigma wagon for the next morning’s early departure to beat the traffic. may this have been the aspect of the sydney sighting event which shook and most disturbed authorities and the military the most? that somehow some mass influence had been exerted over all the human witnesses to collectively forget it? imagine, for example, that if that was the case and these intellects involved were  so scientifically advanced as to be able to do so then other sightings may have occurred, may be occurring everywhere around the globe all the time with no one able to recall there occurrence? \r\nwe left the upstairs flat in my mother-in-laws where we were staying to go downstairs when we found my nephew and his mate, come into the house as white as sheets and shaken as they flopped down onto the lounge sofa.\r\npoor kids had been east of the mother-in-law’s house, down sitting on the cliffs overlooking south bondi and the ocean as all three ufo’s came in from the north at incredible speeds only meters over their heads. i realized quickly that their story corresponded with what i’d seen and that in deed from the height that the craft came into my view, especially the third and last one which i’d seen enter the bay so low over the headland it must have almost buzzed their heads sitting there on the park bench in the reserve apparently just talking! unimaginable experience for the poor kids!\r\nmy nephew reported that he had said to his mate who spoke first,  “what was that!? we were sitting in the cliff-top car park down the end of the street when they came in so fucken low and fast we thought they’d take our heads off!”.  \r\ni managed to take, i think from memory, two recognizable photos but only one of the skyline of the bronte roof tops and the three ‘metal balls’ being clearly defined, the other, with the objects by that stage so far off that although i’d tried to zoom in, too shaky and blurred to be discernible. i have since sadly lost these pictures over the decades.\r\nafter the event by the next morning we had clearly consciously completely forget the whole incident to some part of my mind as if it had become ‘curtained off’ as totally insignificant?\r\nbut the flowing january  when i opened the pictures of our holiday snaps retrieved from my staff club i noticed the two picture and excitedly then exclaiming to a confused mum who was in the car “what’s this on the last shot! the metal balls! the metal balls!”.\r\nmy mother was in the car at the time and then said that she recalled hearing the reports on the radio and i then recalled hearing those the following morning about “as many as ten thousand reports jammed switchboards for nearly one hour last night flooding into police about flying objects seeing flying at street level twenty kilometers from bondi along mcpherson street waverley,  over roseberry many kilometers away and  before disappearing at incredible speed over mascot (where our international terminal is)”.\r\nhowever no reports were heard of since and other than that the following day causing us all to not recall it and consciously not remember the event as if the ufo’s or their inhabitants were blaze about being so up close because they knew they could erase the sighting and experience form our memories despite ten thousand people the night of the sighting reporting it at the time?\r\n(picture 1 uploaded: my photo-shopped version of the scene and the craft of the three spherical ufos (see pointers picture 2:) jumped up over the bronte headland two headlands away and started to fly at about 15 to 20 meters about the ground heading west inland along mcpherson street. i was 9:30 pm mid-summer and a little darker than the photo recreation above. this was the photo i’d taken, and which i described to mum as ‘the metal balls’ and in my house moving about sadly lost.)(picture 2 uploaded:  my ‘photo-shopped’ version approximating the picture i took which became lost with the arrows point to where the objects were travelling west along mcpherson street bronte/waverley with the roof of the flats opposite in the dellvue lane, tamarama/waverley/bronte) (picture 3: for context: my daughter at her 9th birthday celebrating in tamarama park below where the objects would have hovered in 1983). call for any further info if you like, hundreds of others must have eventually remembered this sighting surely!

bedroom window.  i have logged two ufo sightings on previous occasions within the last couple of years from this same bedroom window but did not keep any records, myself. i have reported one to mufon and another to national ufo reporting center.  i have seen about four other sightings over the years directly over the city of ottawa and gatineau.  i sometimes look out the bedroom window to check for ufo's especially at sundown and during the night.  there is usually one red air-ambulance helicopter go close by once or twice a day with pulsating red and white lights with characteristic sound.  one of the previous ufo sightings was of a very large white light and with a definite round-shaped red light of same size in its center which looked something like a spot light from a short distance away vantage point. this was about 2-3 miles away.  the reason i am saying this is that these ufo's could be trying to imitate helicopter lights!  anyway, i looked out my bedroom window and the western sky was misty.  there was one large star to be seen, probably mars or venus at about 30 degrees.  i looked out of the corner of my eye, as i sometimes do, to see if there were any fainter stars near-by.  i thought i saw a couple and one of them was red.  they were very small and faint, and much smaller than the first star seen.  as i kept looking, the red one seemed to get bigger.  then, i detected it to be moving west to north.  it came to be within about 5-10 miles, i think, no sound, window open.  the red light kept flashing at about once a second as it moved across the sky.  it was fluttering up and down and would lunge forward at tremendous speed every 3-4 seconds.  it came as close as to within 3-5 miles, i think, before going out of view because of the window frame.  it was going way too fast to be a helicopter at that distance.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path

at nite.  looked up and saw purple blue round object soaring across sky from east to west behind neighbors house to north of mine.  looked to be at a distance away.  i  thought it was a meteor, but then saw hovering in sky, so went in house to get cell phone.  recorded part of experience.  the whiter colors in recording are house landscape lights of neighborhood, but the blue purple light you will see hovering then disappear.  next i saw it from behind my house at approximately same distance away, but could not get good video as was partially covered by trees.  then disappeared and moved to different location back to where i saw originally from front of house.  i did not see it move, just disappear, then reappear.  noise you hear on recording is traffic from hwg 92.  twice in one spot and once in the other spot.  looked like it could have been located somewhere between hwy 92 and hwy 6 in c.B.  i read a similar sighting in atlantic ia same nite and moving in my direction.   might be same?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

was a nice cool night. i looked up to the sky & noticed the moon. it was a nice sliver of a moon and was very bright. i thought it had a little orange tint to it. i mentioned the moon to my wife when i came in. later on, i went out on my additions upper roof deck to look at the moon & stars. i immediately looked up in the ssw direction above my head at maybe a 70 or 80 degree angle & saw a bright light which at first, i thought was a star. it then flashed, almost like a camera flash, and then went back to a bright starlike light. it then slowly faded away from sight. the whole sighting took maybe 6 to 8 seconds. i then took out my cell phone & started my sky map star map app. there was no major star in that same area. the moon was to the right in the wsw direction. mars was near the moon, to its left. saturn was to the right of the moon but blocked from my view by trees. it was the third sighting i have had on the roof, since i built the addition & roof deck, 17 years ago. i reported to mufon my last sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
