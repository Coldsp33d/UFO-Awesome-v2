to the western portion of the sky as i always do, and i see what i completely thought was a small portion of the moon, peeking through some clouds, as the light was kind of foggy looking. \r\n\r\nbut when i looked all over the sky, you could clearly see that, number 1, there was no moon out yet, and 2, there were no clouds in the sky, and even though it was night with no moon, you absolutely can tell there were no clouds in the area of the \"event,\" i made sure of this.\r\n\r\nat first, it was stationary like a star, but then when i focused on it as best as i could with my eyes, i could tell it was not the moon, because a light started to project from the top and bottom (or somewhere) of it, but not dramatically, or intensely. the lights plus the star-like object together, kind of made an hour glass type shape, and the lights would change directions, almost like a search light of sorts, but the hour glass-like shape remained, as the lights rotated around it (or something like that anyways, it's hard to explain).\r\n\r\nanyways, once i saw that, i figured it must be a hoverin helicopter, or possibly even a blimp, moving slowly towards my direction (there are military and border patrol choppers that fly over the town at times too). then it started moving more east, in the direction of deming n.M., and the light would still rotate around the star-like, light-ball, or whatever shape it was, and it wasnt that easy to see the light doing it either, i has to really focus on it just to see it happen.\r\n\r\nby the time it had crossed a good portion of the sky, or at least i think it was a good portion, i had went inside to get my 19 yr old sister to come check it out too, and a lil less than a minute later, we were both outside looking at it, and by this time, i knew it wasn't a chopper, blimp, or a plane, as there were about 4 or 6 commercial jets flying in the sky at that time (we see and hear them all the time, way up in the sky), confirming it was not a jet.\r\n\r\nand then it was close enough that we should have hear something from it, if it was of this world. from where we were standing, we were looking south by this time, more or less around a 35 degree angle, give or take, and the object slowed a bit, but the lights were still rotation here and there, and it still looked like some sort of mist was surrounding it, because of the way the light was viewable.\r\n\r\nnow this is where things got really weird. it started to speed up a little (i think), and when it did so, it must have kicked in its propulsion system, because it stared leaving a smoke-like trail, and it was at this point that i thought it could maybe be a rocket, but again, we would have heard something, and there was no noise at all, not even from the many jets above, that i remember. anyways the smoke trail grew quite long, really quick, then it started to expand outward, a lot. i mean that thing grew and nearly made, what i could only describe as being a weird round-ish, bell-like shape, and it just kept expanding.\r\n\r\ni personally thought it was opening some form of portal, but it wasn't, and the smoke-like substance just kept expanding and expanding until it was at least about 3 inches or so wide, if i would have measured it with my thumb an index finger, it was really big, and a bit worrisome, until it began to vaporize (or just fade) into the air, until there was none of it remaining. and all the while the trail was expanding, you could still see the weird misty-lit object, but its light had faded significantly, and it shape seemed to of changed too, but i can't describe the way it looked when it started off, and headed to a more south-eastern direction.\r\n\r\ni think it ended up getting longer, and i remember seeing more lights, like it was a cluster of objects this time, and it was even harder to see after awhile. i had to focus between the expanding smoke trail, and the object itself in order to even see it this time, looking directly at it didn't do it anymore. but it's light was still  very misty/foggy looking, as opposed to the rest of the stars and jets in the sky. \r\n\r\nalso, this could be coincidental, but when the smoke trail was expanding, the dogs were barking in that general direction, but they could literally have been barking at anything, since we have a lot of open desert between my dads and town (maybe a couple of miles or so, you can see the town easily from his place), so they could have been barking at any animals, just at the same time as we witnessed this thing. but when that trail was expanding, i was thinking that it must be a poison cloud of some sort, cuz it seemed to just keep expanding, but it was mostly just a dumb thought i had, i wasn't actually in fear of our lives. plus, if it was, there wouldn't have been anything i could do about it anyways ^_^. \r\n\r\nwhen the trail faded entirely, me and my sister were left wondering what the heck it was, and our two other younger siblings came home from their moms, and i shared what happened with them. the next day, according to my 12 yr old baby sister, a lot of people saw the event, but brushed it off as a meteor, which i highly doubt it was. \r\n\r\nand that's how this \"story,\" goes, but living here, i've seen my share of weird stuff in the sky, as i'm sure many others here have too, some dating back a long time.\r\n\r\ni apologize, but i don't have any images, video, audio or anything ready to send, but i could definately draw out the smoke trail me and my sister saw, if needed. and i could care less about being anonymous, so no worries there ^_^.

the doors when we came to my parked car. i was the first to witness it and immediately asked my friend from class, \"do you see that too? what is that??\" she replied \"i don't know but i don't want to stay around. just get in your car.\"\r\ni stayed standing there mesmirized at the object and kept yelling at a distance to my friend who was now walking away to her car; \"but what is that (insert her name)???\"\r\nshe replied one last time; \"stop freaking me out. aliens are my worst fear\"\r\n(so before i even mentioned the possibility of e.T.S my friend unprovoked assumed the same, as we both had never seen anything to the likes of what we were watching.)\r\n\r\nshe walked out of my sight into the darkened dirt parking lot and i stayed staring at the object.\r\nit was a glowing peridot-lightforest mixture of green colored orb and it was slowly but steadily making its way south at a medium pace.\r\ni don't have very good far sighted vision so i couldn't see details.\r\nwhat i did see what an airplane going to or from the el paso airport in nearby texas,and the airplane flew close by the glowing green orb like they didn't see it.\r\n\r\ni would say that it was approx. half a mile away from me in the sky.\r\n\r\nit was leaving behind a glowing green luminescence that would dissipate after ten-twenty seconds. \r\nit was definitely round in shape and almost looked like it was made of green fire.\r\ni have never seen anything like it.\r\ni also got the immense feeling or knowing that i was seeing something man made that wasn't from us.\r\ni also got a knowing that it was doing some sort of task or job.\r\ni should have gotten my phone out to take a photo but it was far enough away that it'd just have shown up too small, nor did i imagine that i would be writing a report days later, after doing some research and not finding any aircrafts that fit the description or comets/asteroids that give off a green fire.\r\ni also thought that nobody would believe me, hence why only my friend who saw it knows and i haven't told anyone else until now.\r\n\r\nthe orb didnt make me feel uneasy, but it came off very playful, well, ignited a playful feeling inside of me.\r\n\r\ni only watched it for approx. six minutes before i decided that i should get home. when i got in my car and made a turn to get out of the parking lot and looked back through my windshield i saw that the glowing green orb was knowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nodd experience but i hope to have more as it was so interesting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the city and was going down the freeway over a large bridge over water. all of a sudden i saw a ball of light traveling slowly on the opposite side of the road. there was a policemen on a motorcycle following the orb slowly holding back traffic getting on to the freeway from the on ramp.I was watching the orb when all of a sudden it crossed over to my side of the road and passed through the car and my self then went straight through the pillar on the bridge and suddenly dropped straight down like it wrnt in the water below. when the orb passed through me and the car it felt like time just stood still and everything just felt wavy. after that i found my self parked on the side of the freeway 5kms from where it happened with no memory of what had happened and how i had gotten of the bridge and then drove through a 2km tunnel and ended up parked on the side of the road with the car off. i turned the car back on and continued to go to the clients home. i had left early and should have arrived before my appointment. upon reaching the clients home i knocked on the door then the gentleman started yelling at me because i was 15 minutes late. the time on the cloxk in the car was actually 15 minute behind the actual time.I only remember this whole thing had happened only about three weeks to a month later. the funny thing was that there was nothing on the news about the orb on the freeway even though a policemen was holding back traffic. the date and time i am not 100 percent sure but i can find out if i look into my work history and pay slips.\r\n\r\ni really hope someone contacts me so i can better explain this in greater detail. this has not been my only experience i have had 7 different experiences in total. i would really love to speak to someone so i can get a

sky. it was bright red, then changed to white, then after a few seconds changed to red again. this happened a few times as it was stationary in the sky. direction was south-east, could see orion constellation clearly. object was about 15 to 20 degrees lower than orion's belt, and left of orion from my point of view, maybe shoulders width distance with arms outstretched from orion's belt. time was 8:40 pm pacific time. no clouds and the sky was clear.\r\n\r\nobject descended, hovered, and changed to a rapid flashing light of green and white. object hovered for about 20-30 seconds then started to descend quickly and i lost sight of it between the far side apartment buildings. i had recorded some video but the glare from the lamp posts only caught fuzzy details of the light descending. i was not able to record the red and white colors as i was unsure what i was looking at. i started recording when the lights changed color.\r\n\r\nmy friend and i both observed this object. i have lived near an air force base most of my life and have seen many types of aircraft. this object did not behave like a normal aircraft. it was stationary then descended, then stationary again, and changed colors and frequency of flashing lights, not typical of any aircraft. this object did not seem to be moving away or toward me, but rather downward in a straight line. the speed it descended the first time was slower than the second time.\r\n\r\napproximately 10-15 minutes earlier, while walking the dog, we had seen a military aircraft circling the base, probably a c-17 from the size and speed. it had it's landing lights on as well as strobes.\r\n\r\nafter the object had descended out of view, i noticed a similar military aircraft, headed away from the base in a westerly direction, at a much higher altitude than previously seen. i'm guessing this was the same aircraft that we had seen earlier circling the base.\r\n\r\nthe video i have is grainy and on my cell phone, only a flashing point of light can be seen. don't think it's worth uploading, but can provide it if needed.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

didn't just fall. it shoot down from the sky. planes or anything else couldn't have fallen as fast as what i saw. i came back out for another smoke around 3:45 am and i started to see a small flashing light, yet again just thinking it was a planes light flashing. it was flying away from my house in the beginning and then once i told myself it was just a plane, it started hovering towards my house. i got scared once i saw that and i stood up, about to go into my house. i took one last look at it and it was above my neighbors house, still coming close and closer until i went inside. i felt so uneasy for the whole night that i couldn't get to sleep until around 6 am. i've never been a firm believer of aliens and ufos because i was just messing around with conspiracy theories about aliens in middle school because they were all the hype. but after last night, i can now say that whatever that was, wasn't normal.","distance":"21-100
