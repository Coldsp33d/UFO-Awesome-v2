the window rolled completely down by the time i pulled over. i noticed it was then moving really slow. then it began to cork screw in the sky as it moved forward. at no time did it change direction or go backwards. i saw it was a perfect triangle when it cork screwed.  it was black or dark grey. when it got close to the hillside going east i noticed it picked up speed and disappeared behind the hill. it made absolutely no sound. i sat in my car for about 5 more minutes and fumbled with my phone to call my husband but there was no reception to call him. i noticed i was shaking. it scared me

yesterday i spotted two different things, it was right after sunset it wasn't dark at all sun was down and yellow/orange light was still present, first a bright light with mother of pearl sheen to it swooped down from one end of the sky and disappeared after 2 or 3 seconds, it was nothing like i've ever seen.. after a while where it disappeared in the sky i saw wispy cloud in a shape of hawk.. while i was observing the cloud another yellow orb appears from my left and disappeared quickly.. people in pakistan are pretty ignorant to these kind of things due to their religious beliefs, so we can say its a safe haven for ufos...I've been contacted by a lot of \"aliens'' in past few years and was taken by \" grey aliens\" all i can recall is me in a hospital like place , i was later taught by \"greys\" the term \"annunaki\" as i mentioned people in my country have no clue about these things i was one of them , i shared the incident with my online american friends and they told me about annunakis ,later i received visitations from \"reptilians\" i was taken thrice by them, they showed me few things i cannot share here.. everything stopped happening after an incident with illuminati... cannot provide the details here, if anyone's interested from the website i will be glad to share all the information i have received in past four or five years ... now i have started receiving visitations , visions and dreams of coming events ,you can say i am a medium but its on completely different level..

pursued a drink driver from aldeburgh golf course through rendlesham forest and onto the officers mess carpark at usaf bentwaters. there i arrested the driver and took him to woodbridge police station for breath analysis. later that night i returned to usaf bentwaters and thatnked the air police at their office for their assistance as they backed me up with the earlier arrest. it was now about 2.55 a.M. when i left bentwaters to return to my beat  around aldeburgh.\r\nas i approached rendlesham forrest i turned my roof emergency light beacon on checking it because during the earlier chase it had failed several times. the blue light was a new design with a very strong halogen bulb rotating on a belt driven chassis inside the blue plastic lens. i left the light continue on for about 4 minutes checking its continued operation. as i came to a clearing in the forest at an intersection i noticed some kind of craft hovering above me through the opening in the trees, i could only half make out the shape of what these flashing lights were attached to. at first i thought it was a pair of a10s as they fly in pairs slower than f111s of which i had seen several and even attended a crashed f111 in ringsfield suffolk. but these lights and the craft they were attached to were almost stationary, i continued driving through the forest and every time there was a break in the trees i would look up through my windshield and there above and slightly infront of me travelling about my speed was these lights.  at the next intersection in the forest just south of dunwich i stopped and got out of my patrol car and observed these pair of craft with the same flashing lights about 4-500ft above me and slowly rotating around the vicinity of this intersection, my car 2 way radio was producing continuous squelch static and i couldn't get hq to acknowledge a radio check. i stood next to my open car door for about 3 minutes trying to make out what was circling above. there was no sound at all and i know it wasn't a helicopter. i got back into my car and drove off as quickly as i could go and by the time i was south east of saxmundham, the entity had gone. i never saw it again and never reported it because you would be labelled a fruit cake, it wasn't until about ten years ago i heard about the rendlesham forest ufo and realised that was probably something to do with what i has seen that night.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

rounded the curve in the road the last 1/2 mile of our journey was uphill and totally dark, so dark we could not see our hands in front of our face. no lights, no other homes just total wilderness, on our right side was a mountain ridge with tall trees. on our left side was a ravine covered with undergrowth and heavy laurels and large trees beside the road.\r\nthe trees on both sides of the road formed a overhead blanket, so that even on the brightest of moons, this was still a dark and very spooky place to be. a little further down the left hand side is white oak creek, that can be heard from he road in the still of the night.\r\nmy brother chris and i were walking and talking when suddenly we both heard foot steps in the thick vegetation between the road and creek. on this side of the road the ground is like 20 feet below the road, a steep drop off and is covered with thick growth.\r\nwe both stopped and whatever was following us took one extra step and stopped, chris said in a low voice take two steps and stop. again our unknown follower took the two steps plus one extra step and stopped. i must say we were both frightened and did not know what to do. so we repeated the process of taking two steps and stopping and again the being mimic and stopped.\r\nwe could not understand how something could see us (if this was how we were being tracked) or how anything as large as what this appeared to sound could walk in this tangle of undergrowth, trees and uneven earth. whatever was following us made heavy but calculated steps, the dried leaves and sticks broke under the steps of this creature.\r\nour next action was to stand still and bend down and pick-up what gravel we could, we could not see we just scooped up what we could and hurled into the area where this creature was. no sound so again we reached down scooped up some gravel and hurled, again no movement and no sound from below the road. i said to my brother, lets run do not stop until we get home on three, we ran the last 1/2 mile uphill and in total darkness the creature was running in the woods as fast as we could on the gravel road. at the end of our driveway was a street light and as we reached the lighted area the beast stopped its chase. there is  clump of laurels as the woods meet the driveway and this beast shook these large laurels so violently and so loudly we knew this was not the prank of any human.\r\nin our home, just a few minutes later it was a strange night our mother, father, 2 younger brothers and 2 younger sisters were not home, but our mothers station wagon was in the driveway, dads truck was not at home. my brother and i thought it would be relaxing to go to our parents back bedroom set-up the game board and play scrabble. when suddenly all the lights in the house went out, as we were looking for candles we felt the creature on the covered deck that wrapped around the bedroom. heavy foot steps, loud foot steps, in this bedroom is a big picture window and a glass sliding door, both were covered with drapes. \r\nchris said to me in a low voice pull back the drape and see what it is and of course i said no. we felt trapped and we felt really hopeless, our mothers station wagon would start without inserting a key and the car was on the other end of the house, so we ran through the house, i jumped in the back of the car and chis jumped in the drives seat, started the car and off we went. this is our last memory making it to the top of the driveway and no other memory. we do not know where we went, what time we came home or anything else the remainder of this night. we ( my brother and i) would like to know what happened and put a closure to the wound we both still carry with us to this day.\r\n ","distance":"21-100

here near oeiras, lisbon, portugal today october 5 2016 at aprox. 9:30pm, i'm not easily convinced and can explain away lots of things but this was different, it is night already i was in my garden just now and happened to look at the sky, this is a place where aircraft heading for lisbon airport fly overhead making a lot of noise and blinking a lot of lights, nonetheless i use flightradar24 sometimes to track them for curiosity and nothing was flying above at the time. as i just said this was something completely different, big and totally quiet heading in a straight line direction north-south heading south, 3 very dim yellowish lights no blinking in a triangle formation plus another light near the forward tip of the triangle slightly offset to the side all moving in perfect unison creating the appearance of a very big silent dark triangle moving through the starry sky completely silent at a speed of about 400kph if it was some sort of plane heading for the airport 16 km away, but this seemed like a big dark triangle, moving in straight line in complete eerily silence, maybe it was something flying very high like a satellite constelation moving in unison, sometimes you also see satellites flying above here, very rare and normally just one bright white light or reflecting sunlight flying through the sky, here i could not tell the altitude and couldn't see any features just three dim yellow lights forming what looked like a huge triangle in the sky of size at least aprox. double or triple the size of a conventional commercial aircraft of type airbus a320 or boeing 737 that you see when on the outskirts 10 miles away from the airport, no blinking lights, no white or red lights, just three dim yellow lights navigating eerily silent through the sky forming a perfect triangle, whatever it was it was probably painted dark because you could see nothing reflecting of it just black and three dim lights. just wanted to write this here before i forget the details, thanks and sorry for writing all this as i'm still kinda excited and very much puzzled. for the first time i tend to believe they are here among us but why the lights even if dim? and flying over the outskirts of a city at this hour? possibly someone else has noticed it too altough it was subtle due to the dim lights and no sound. well, maybe there's some kind of secret and misterious new big silent craft that just glides through the sky in total silence. minutes after that several aircraft passed and you could clearly ear the loud noise and all the blinking lights you can even see the lights inside the plane, completely different on what is a starry night with just very high altitude clouds and temp aprox 20centigrade especially in the dead of night. curiously i didnt have my phone with me even if i had it wouldnt capture anything in the black of the night it would be like photographing dim stars, even if i had the camera the thing zoomed by in just 3 or 4 seconds and then disappeared over the trees of neighbours gardens, i tried to go to better vantage point but nothing, the lights were too dim, so no time even to think in taking a picture as you're just looking kind of in awe and perplexed.&#65279; amazing especially the silence of a big flying object. very eerie sudden and different experience but also fantastic.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

the only thing in the sky apart from the stars. he watched this though his binoculars for maybe a few seconds, then suddenly these dull gray colour brick like shapes appeared, he continued to watch as more appeared. now he was seeing what appeared to be brick shapes moving in a triangular formation with dark equal spaces in between them. he followed this or these objects though his binoculars for maybe  5-10 seconds from a north to south direction where the object(s) kinda spread out distorted and just disappeared in a blink of an eye. he believes he was or maybe looking at the underbody of
