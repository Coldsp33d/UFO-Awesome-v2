States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i were taking a late night stroll through a wooded area near our home. we know the area well and had frequented the grove many times. as we approached the wooded area we could see lights from the houses beyond the grove shining through the trees. as we approached we noticed there appeared to be shadows darting through the trees. we immediately thought there were children playing around down there. we decided to go and check it out and possibly to scare the kids for fun. \r\n\r\nwe got close to the trees and realized there were no children in the grove of trees, no one could be seen at all. we took a side entrance into the grove and walked into the trees, wondering if the shadows we saw simply came from the light from the houses in the distance, like maybe our eyes were playing tricks on us. \r\n\r\nthe grove was well light as there was a lot of moonlight and virtually no leaves left on the trees. it was fairly cold; it happened before the first snow fall and dead leaves littered the ground. \r\n\r\nas we walked holding hands into the grove we abruptly heard a footfall in the leaves; at that time the unknown entity crossed our path. it moved in glimpses as if under a strobe light, only no light was given off. as it crossed our path it was visible one moment then gone the next. this alternated as it strode in front of us. \r\n\r\nit smiled at us and appeared to be waving. i wasn't prepared for this and seeing it froze me in fear. the entity was a bi-ped that stood taller than me at 5\"10. it was completely naked. though no genitalia could be seen. where human genitals should have been there appeared to be nothing there, as you would imagine a doll would look. its skin was a dark greyish color. it had very small black eyes which reflected the moonlight. it's ears were tight against its head, the ears came to a point. \r\nthe jaw was bigger than any humans. the jaw line went all the way up the sides of its head as if it's smile stared behind its ears almost. rows of sharp white teeth were visible as it smiled at us. it had slits for a nose that were slightly flared at the top. i can't remember how many fingers it had but it definitely had digits that it held up as it waved. the encounter lasted all but a few minutes. the instant i was able i twisted my wife's arm and i grabbed hold of her wrist. i'm twice my wife's size with a very athletic build. i ran at top speed literally dragging her in the dirt through the leaves out of the grove up the grass hill through the soccer feild and into the street. \r\nas we reached the street i noticed my wife was yelling and screaming at me to stop, and go back, go back she said. as she badly wanted to make contact with the entity. \r\n\r\nbut my fear over powered me and i dragged us both into the house. from our door step we could see the grove of trees. i immediately said don't say anything! as i didn't want our testimonials to become tainted with any kind of suggestion from one another. i separated us into different rooms and had us write down our testimonials of what we saw. \r\n\r\nto no surprise we both described the same entity with the same features. \r\n\r\n this event has effected my life very negatively, as my family thinks my wife and i made it up or are just plain lying to get attention or something. \r\nnot knowing what this entity was keeps me up many nights. i must have thought about every possibility. i though could it have been a spirit, a human in hollywood style movie make up, maybe a scooby-doo type hologram projector, or even an alien. to this day not knowing eats at the back of my mind. \r\ni fully know aliens exist. with the vastness of space and the countless stars in the universe it becomes clear that we can not possibly be the only life. \r\n\r\neven know i can feel my heart racing as i recall the event. did i miss out on a one in a billion chance to possibly communicate with another intelligent life form? i only have one regret in my life, and that regret is not going back to find out for sure what it was. \r\n\r\nif were ever going to communicate with beings like this (if indeed it was one) we need to have love at the center of our awareness, so we don't flee in fear for no reason. \r\n\r\nfor along time i never told anyone but my closest friends and my immediate family for fear that people would think we were crazy. but its come to a point that this itch in the back of my brain has gotten so bad i feel it necessary to tell others of what we saw. i've become so obsessed with searching the web for possible information on the existence of alien life that i often spend hours of my time sifting through garbage on the internet just trying to find someone somewhere who has seen an entity like the one we saw. \r\n\r\ni'm currently attending a trade school for an hvacr program, and in less than one year i'm going to have my epa 3 certification so i can handle refrigerants. i am not crazy.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),

film producer very focused on environmental and social projects, united nations member harmony with nature and executive director ofngo in mexico. since childhood i have had sightings of unidentified flying objects, the first time was in the company of my mother and were 3 red lights forming a triangle were in a park in mexico city. the second sighting was in the company of my baby at age 18 opposite a park in the city of veracruz mexico pozarica this time was a white sphere and quickly moved to the right and disappeared when the point. i've seen ships of light many times, however there are two situations for which i write are the ones i call the attention and would like to know a little more, the day 7 july 2014 i was behind the hotel piedra escondida in tulum, quintana roo had made a very deep meditation and ending watched the sky with a friend, no clouds the milky way was seen, first saw that half the sky white put a white light that blinded us stopped 3 seconds sea &#8203;&#8203;side only clearly defined was repeated about 4 times, at that time i told my friend that we gave thanks for everything and our feet began to move by themselves so much happiness, and began to give tachycardia, at that moment we heard some noises were approaching and we were not able to see anything, first we thought they were raccoons, came more and more and at the same time we began to see in the sky but not as high a triangular, transparent but dark ship, the noises came closer when the noises were already with our hearing within 10 cm or 5, the ship under close as a maximum 6 meters from our head i told my friend we left. later in mexico city we saw again, he was stop one block from where we were in heaven as the look went fast. a few days later i was in my bedroom with a friend she was asleep all the lights in the house were out i was lying on the mattress about to sleep when i saw that slowly a very strong white light and a black lump the size of the iris is lit an eye. i feel watched by a technologie that i dont know what it is if is of this planet or of another. i think the ship was founding higher frequencys. thank you for your

just before 1:30 am (i checked my watch after and it said 1:30 am).  i saw an orange light to the southeast and it appeared to be heading towards the airport which is roughly west of my workplace.  i assumed it was an aircraft heading towards the airport as i see these occasionally at night all the time, especially the police helicopter.  the size of the light was roughly normal for the front light of an aircraft, maybe slightly larger, if it were flying low on approach to the airport.  i thought it was unusual due to the color as usually the front light of the helicopter and other aircraft is white.  the light flew directly 'towards me', passing directly overhead in a straight line roughly se-nw.  at no point did i see any other light than the orange light which i felt was odd as normal aircraft have red and green lights.  the light remained consistently shaped and bright throughout the encounter which i also felt was odd afterward as if it was 'in front' of an aircraft it should have gotten dimmer or changed shape after passing overhead.\r\nas the light got close to being overhead i went outside into the parking lot to try to continue observing it.  i saw it pass directly over the building.  when it was overhead i could see what almost looked like a 'shock wave' directly in front of the light.  the light moved past the roof line of the building so i moved further out into the parking lot to try to regain sight of it.  i did not see it again.  all together i'd estimate i saw the light for one or two minutes.\r\nthe light moved in a straight line from when i first observed it to when i lost sight of it with no variation.  the speed was pretty similar to a conventional aircraft coming in to the airport.  the sky was pretty clear with only a few clouds at the time.  there was a slight breeze but i don't know the direction.\r\nalthough i'm assuming this is some kind of conventional aircraft that i'm unfamiliar with (due to our proximity to the airport) i felt that what i saw was odd enough to write down my observations at the time to make a submission later. the things i found odd were the color of the light (light orange, similar to an incandescent light bulb), no other lights (other aircraft i've seen have always had red and green lights), no sound during the encounter (at the altitude i assumed it was at i would have heard an airplane or helicopter engine, even with the factory noise), and i did not see a conventional 'aircraft' shape at any point (even at night when a helicopter or airplane flies overhead you can see the shape of it).  i felt the light was moving too slow to be a meteor or other such phenomenon.  the light moved in too deliberate and direct a path to be a balloon, bird, or firework.\r\ni've worked at night at this location for many years and have never seen anything like this before.  i live in the area and am out frequently at night--i'm fairly familiar with the appearance of aircraft at night time coming in to the airport, though i am not an expert by any means.  i assume this has a normal explanation but what i saw felt strange enough to me that i felt i should write down the details so i could transcribe it as accurately as i could immediately after the event.

looked designed, big time.\r\n  interesting is after filling out forms and seeing a \"power lines near\" check box on mufon form, it was in fact hovering maybe 2,000-3,000 feet above some interstate transmission lines and right near a highway and a massive chunk of cattle grazing land. if any cows are butchered out there, i sure want a steak from it!\r\n  the strange thing is....It blended back

mistaken for demons devils and gods, or maybe its our future offspring time traveling.\r\n  all i know is, clouds don't make straight edge symmetrical on two sides triangles that stay for that long as

pulse the blue light three times and it was some what random.  the light pulsed there was a two second pause.It pulsed again, another two second pause it did it a third time another two second pause

it. i remembered my camera and ran into the house to get it. when i came back outside it had moved behind a large tree and it took it about 5 seconds to re-appear from behind the tree. my camera was

of sky.  i thought i was looking at the pleiades, as it was dark and the venue is up next to our wasatch mountains.  it had the appearance of liquid in the sky that was bright and moving, i then realized i didn't know what i was looking at.   it grew larger as it moved closer and slowly grew in height, flashing star like lights moving slowly in a long trail formation similar to birds, moving horizontally, no sound.  a few reports were of 'orbs', 'fixed lights on very large object along with the flashing lights'.  i saw only the flashing lights.  they appeared to be as close as a flock of birds and looked similar to the flight formation birds would be in.  the flash of the lights was large, making me believe it was close.  also there seemed to be countless lights, i think hundreds.  when the lights were over the entire venue, an unmarked helicopter appeared at the back of the venue with long bright headlights, it hovered for a few seconds before maneuvering around and disappearing.  the lights had everyone's attention in my section of this outdoor concert, abt 3000 people attended.  everyone in my area of west lawn were filming the sky, no longer watching the concert.  the lights took at least 12 minutes, were over us for at least one entire song but i didn't time it.  it seemed like forever that it moved above us.  i thought the entire thing was beautiful and it seemed to coincide with the positive song that was playing, it was like looking at magic in the sky.  it was amazing to see such a huge unknown band of lights cross through the night sky and everyone started to talk to the stranger next to them saying, maybe it was the stage lights reflecting off of something overhead, some people thought it could be part of the concert.  i lost sight of the lights as it moved over the mountain to the north of the venue, heading northeast.  i had a friend on the opposite side of the venue who didn't see the lights, only saw the helicopter and wondered what the heck it was doing so close to us.  she said she had gone many times to the venue and had never seen a helicopter take that route, also she said it's lights were ext bright and unusual and that she was unable to tell what kind of helicopter it was.  i saw the side of it and it had no markings except for red and white colors.  my feeling afterwards was that i had had quite a remarkable experience seeing this unusual thing and i no longer really cared about the concert, it was all about seeing a ufo with so many other people.  no one was upset or worried about the lights, quite the opposite.  an article in one of the local papers said concert goers startled by lights in sky.  i didn't see anyone startled.  also no mention of the helicopter in the paper which came out a few days later, saying that it could have been glow sticks, lanterns or hot air balloons.  to it's credit, the article did say that none of these possible explanations matched the description of what people had reported as seeing orbs.  i think most people at show saw the lights but its hard to say exactly how many.  i only counted the people around me that i can honestly say saw it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:12:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

stepped outside my home with a cup of coffee to have a cigarette. while standing on the deck outside the rear door of my home i noticed in my peripheral vision a very bright white light at about 85 degrees se of my location. i then looked directly at the light and could not distinguish an object from which the light was emanating, but it appeared to be moving toward the south east. no other lights were visible at this time and no sound was emanating from the object. the object did not appear to be projecting the light to the ground such as a search light would have been. the bright light faded out after a few seconds and only a single dim white light was luminating from where the bright light was previously. although i could not see the shape of the object and judging from conventional aircraft i have observed in the sky the object appeared to be at an elevation of about 30,000+ft. the object then appeared to be moving slowly while constantly changing direction. not abrupt right angle changes, but very sharp right and left semicircular directional changes as it moved slowly further away to the south east. as the object moved slowly away the dim white light grew fainter and eventually out of sight. i have observed other aircraft, (helicopters) operating in the night sky using search lights and this object at its estimated elevation did not resemble the same characteristics of those craft. changes in direction also appeared to have been too abrupt for the object to have been a winged aircraft. because of the short duration of the sighting i had little time to collect any visual documentation.

ufo was still seen and what witnesses before their statements were taken off of the internet said is it looks like the helicopters were chasing it. when i first heard about this i didn't jump straight to the conclusion that it was a ufo but there is nowhere close to here where helicopters would be able to take off and get here that fast so either it could be some kind of military crafts that they don't want people to know about and that's why they took everybody's comments off of the internet no pictures i were taken or at least none have been released. but i am now leaning towards it being a
