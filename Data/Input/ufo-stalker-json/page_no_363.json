12 midnight, the year was between 1985 to 1990 i was about 13-14, i was looking out the window when i noticed coloured lights level with train at about 100-200 meters away, it was hard to tell exactly cause it was so dark. at first i thought it was a truck(semi) with trailer lights on,but then i thought about it and the hi way was on the other side of the train, then i thought it was a farmer having a party with lights hung up around his house, then i realised that if it was a house or stationery object that it would be far behind the train, then i thought it might be a refection of something in the train, so i cupped my hands up close to the window to stop any light coming from inside the train, that's when i noticed that when the lights came to a cleared paddock it would descend and when it came to trees it would then go up,that's when the hairs on the back of my neck stood up i sat there and thought of everything it could be but everything i thought of it wasn't, i sat there for about 5-10 minutes, watching these lights then i asked mum to come and have a look, buy the time she stood up and looked out my window as she was on the other side of the train, when we looked out the lights where gone.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

unidentified flying object.  i can only say that this occurred in the beginning months of 2016.  i was walking my dogs home from a short walk a few minutes from my home.  the sky was so unbelievably blue and completely cloudless.  just looking up one couldn't possibly miss seeing the contrail forming in the nw sky.  nearly as soon as i saw it i knew it could not be something from earth.  having seen rockets from the cape, it could not have been that.  one reason is it's pattern was sharp and each zig and zag was identical in length and size.  the second reason was the tightly formed contrail that was forming the pattern did not dissipate or feather out into the atmosphere as it went in a complete loop down then up and over the beginning of the contrail pattern as it was when i first saw it.  it is hard for me to say as to whether it then went straight away from me or whether it went straight up.  as it came out of the loop and seemed to straighten itself out of the zig-zag, i still could not see what was at the head of the contrail (at no time could i see anything which was making the contrail) but along side of the head of the contrail there suddenly appeared two black objects which appeared as black dots one under the other on the right side however only one black dot appeared on the top left with none underneath.  believe it or not, i just took my eye off of it and i don't remember looking back.  unless it wasn't too high up in the atmosphere i  don't see why it wouldn't have been picked up on radar.  if i'm not mistaken it would have been around south of orlando but not too far because it wasn't completely due west.  my reaction to seeing such a sight was sort of \"see we've been telling people all along there are extraterrestrial vehicle's and not weather balloons or anything else an earthling might try to put in flight\". seeing one makes me feel as if we are all vindicated. i have nothing but my word and this account of what i saw.

usual when staying there i took my two dogs for a last walk of the day, ready to bed them down for the evening.\r\ni took them as usual down onto the beach - (brean sands).\r\ni always take a torch to see where i'm walking with, as the beach here is behind sand dunes and so away from the main street and the street lighting.\r\nthe weather that evening was fairly mild, a clear cloudless night with a slight south westerly breeze.\r\neverything was very normal and uneventful, i walked for about 5 or 600 yards along the beach until we reached the first row of groynes, at which we turned around to return. after walking back for 100 yards or so i saw a white blinking light far off out over the sea, i paid it no real attention assuming it to be an plane - (easyjet from alicante) on its way to bristol airport. which is a few miles away and brean is on its direct flight path.\r\nover the next 5 minutes or so it continued to travel across the sky at a right angle to my position - just as i'd expect an aircraft heading toward bristol airport to do. then it finally caught my attention as odd - because it seemed to be descending as it came in over the coastal headland to the north of me. i thought to myself  - that can't be an aircraft, it must be a helicopter, it's too low.\r\nall the time it continued to blink, much as you'd expect an aircraft to do. except it was only the one single white/slightly yellowish tinged light.\r\nit descended downwards over the following few minutes at an angle of about 20° until it was down below the height of the headland - i'm estimating its height at this point to be about 200 feet, and it's distance from me to be a mile or so away.\r\nit then appeared to become stationary in the air - although there was no sound - i still thought i was seeing a helicopter - until i realised it wasn't stationary at all and in fact had turned at a right angle and was actually traveling directly towards me.\r\ni moved about 10 yards up the beach away from the sea to get a clearer angle to see if the light was indeed traveling towards my position. i could now clearly see the light was moving parallel to the coast along the sea edge of the beach. it continued silently and slowly to descend as it travelled along.\r\nas it was drawing nearer the light appeared more and more brighter and the blinking seemed to be more of a pulsing than a blink.\r\nthe light then drew level with my position. it was by now less than 40 yards from me and approximately 30 feet above me. it was really quite bright - (not blindingly) but enough to be dazzling and the pulsing quality was less defined because of the glare. although it was definitely still pulsing.\r\nthe light was now totally stationary, by now i was feeling increasingly disturbed by what was happening and began backing up the beach away from it - i was distinctly uneasy and kept watching it as i moved away.\r\nalthough it may well of just been fear induced - i had the horrible feeling of being watched. \r\nthe light then started to move away - back out over the sea and gradually began to ascend as it moved away.\r\nit continued to retreat and ascend moving back towards the north west of me towards the general area i first saw it come from.\r\ni found, in my unsettled state i'd missed the track back to the main road and had to double back on myself for about 50 yards, until i found it again. all the time i kept watching the blinking light retreating upwards and seawards as it went, for another 5 or so minutes - until it gradually disappeared in the haze of the horizon.\r\ni had the distinct impression that whatever it was - it came in from the sea and deliberately was drawn towards me by the fact that i was alone and drawing attention to myself with the torch i was carrying.\r\ni'm a grown man, but i'd be the first to admit - the experience has quite spooked me.\r\n","distance":"21-100

seconds long. at the time my friend and i were sitting on the back deck of another friends house star gazing and we spotted something. i quickly turned my iphone video on, but as you can hear in the audio we thought it was gone. at first glance you may be able to make out a small white light in the center of the video, but it is very quick. i have played it on various movie players and some of them do not show anything. i assure you there is a light, as my windows 10 shows it pretty clear. i tried to enhance it on a copy of the video and it seemed very strange to me. the light actually swirls a bit, pulsates, and then does a little loop and shoots up to the right and top of the frame.\r\ni was hoping that you had resources to analyze the video and let me know what you think. i used a magnifying glass to zoom in while watching it and it was pretty interesting.\r\nit was a star filled clear night and the iphone was pointed almost straight up, looking almost directly south, but a little west.\r\ni am not saying that this is definitively anything. i know i wasn't holding the iphone just in my hand. i wanted a steady picture so i just turned it on and had it resting on a table holding it tilted upward. the motion of the light does not appear to be movement of the iphone to me.\r\nanyways, thought i'd share it to see if someone couldn't enhance it, slow it down, and zoom in.

home watching tv in my living room. my mother was visiting and we both saw mysterious lights approaching from the west at a low altitude which we thought might be low flying aircraft. planes do fly over the area, but never that low. we went outside to get a better look. the object was travelling silently at a slow, constant velocity as if surveying the area. because of the complete absence of any sound, we both thought it could be air balloons. as the ship came in closer we were both surprised and shocked to realise that it was a huge, dark grey/ black, metallic craft of some sort. it had a strange shape like an elongated seven sided polygon. there were white or light green lights at each angled point and a couple in between. beneath the craft in the centre was a light that seemed to be moving, rotating or spinning haphazardly, possibly a smaller craft beneath the main one. the main craft itself did not hover or spin, but kept on moving in an easterly direction at an altitude of about 200 to 400 feet. my mother said she also observed lights in the fuselage area, but the shape of the craft above its base could not be determined. we lost sight of it when it was eventually obscured by cloud cover. i have never read or heard anything in the media or internet about this strange sighting and i have never reported it until now. a number of other people in neighbourhood also seemed to be observing the object from their balconies. we were not able to identify the huge craft, what it was remains a mystery.\r\n\r\nperhaps there is a connection, perhaps not, but two days earlier my partner at the time witnessed a ball lightning incident in the same living room from where i first saw the lights of the ufo approaching. a very bright white orb shaped light appeared in the top right hand corner of the room for about 10 seconds before suddenly vanishing. there were thunderstorms in the area at the time, but not in rheinfelden.","distance":"101-500 Feet,

swing as we usually do when the weather is nice. the temp was around 72 degrees and it was an absolutely clear night sky. out here we can see the stars very well. i can see the satellites as they cross with the naked eye and i watch the meteor showers annually while laying on a blanket in the yard. milky way is bright and clear here in mineral wells, tx, about 60 miles west of fort worth, tx. i was alone while my husband was changing clothes inside. as i was sitting on the swing i leaned my head back and looked up into the sky. it was then that i saw this half moon object cross into my view over the tree in my yard. it was glowing softly as if it was reflecting the ambient light of the town. i believe them to be disc shaped but i was only seeing the reflective angle. at first i could not imagine what it was i was seeing. it was moving slowly, at that point i stood up to try to get a better look when a second one came up behind the first very quickly. as soon as the the second object came into view, both of them moved very fast across the skyline. as they crossed my somewhat broad view of the horizontal skyline (above the treetops). took them less than 10 seconds to cross.  it seemed that the first ufo was waiting for the second one to catch up, then they just took off. one behind the other at the same speed and slightly angled from each other. looked like a formation maneuver that we use in flight of our fighter jets. i stood there on the porch for a second or two just stunned, i couldn't move or process what i had just seen for a moment. asking myself if it was real. i was shocked.  then i started screaming for my husband. i trying to explain what i had just seen. i couldn't quite put it into words at first because i as so excited and amazed. i kept thinking no one will ever believe me because i live in a very small town of about 15,000. what are the odds that anyone of them would have been looking into the sky at that exact moment. even my husband, who is a true believer, had a look of skepticism. very excited and frustrated because i was the only witness. i watch airplanes regularly cross this skyline view. this moved much faster and the ufo's were much bigger than any airplane or helicopter that has ever passed my view of the skyline, as i sit on my porch at least 4-5 days of the week when its nice weather. i know that what i saw was not man-made and much, much too fast and it was too big to be ours. even with our modern technology, we are not capable of this type of air travel.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
