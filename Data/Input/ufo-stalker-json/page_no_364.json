States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Last friday night (9/23/16) around 8:00 p.M. i had been watching an object exhibiting some uncanny moves that defy anything that any conventional airborne device could do that i and probably all of you would agree on.  more on that later.\r\n\r\nso i called witness b to come to my home to verify sighting and i shall now refer to myself as witness a. upon witness b arriving at the home of myself witness a, we walked around the back of the house to a dark area on the side of the garage where we sat down on lawn chairs. the general area of the residence for witness a would be the 100 block of gilbert terrace in machesney park, il.  there was a lot of humidity and by 9 p.M. the grass was already wet from dew.  in order for witness b to know where to look, witness a had a green laser, the kind that i think have been banned under faa regulations.  because of the low to the ground water vapor, the laser beam was easy to follow for an estimated several hundred feet into the sky as witness a aimed the laser at the object in question.   witness a is in the habit of always looking up at the sky so this particular night wasn't an exception.  the object would dart around the western sky that it had been in before zooming around.  on one of the laser pointings at the object instead of a constant beam i did 3 laser flashes a couple of times. the object seemed to angle towards the ground at which point witness a noticed several white lights (around 10) or illuminations on one edge...As if to acknowledge or that the object was observing.  at no time was a laser shot back towards witness a.   witness a also observed a red non-strobing light on or near the object. the height of the object wasn't able to be calculated because of certain unknown factors.  for you astronomers, witness b used the compass feature on his phone to determine that there are 4 stars that resemble a pointed hat that around 9 p.M. were at a bearing of approximately 255 degrees with an angle of 60-70 degrees.   the object was below the 3rd star in a row approximately 3 inches down at arms length.  the light intensity wasn't any different from the surrounding stars, which by then were hard to see because of atmospheric haze.  sorry, but that's the best location for the object that witness b can provide.  did witness b check weather conditions on his phone for 9 p.M. that evening?  a-no. although this wasn't the first sighting rodeo for witness b, everything that should have been done at the time just wasn't registering.  witness b was able to find local weather conditions for last friday and the average high for the day was 69 (high of 79) degrees, the dew point average was for the day was 65.7 (bordering sticky), and the average humidity for the day was 90%.  the humidity factor was ideal for a laser beam to be seen.  witness a tried to use the video feature on his iphone, but video and slo-mo couldn't be found.  it had always been there in the past.  besides witness a, my sister, brother-in-law, and a neighbor witnessed the jerking movement event. my sister and brother-in-law weren't that interested to go outside and see what witness a was seeing, but they did for a few minutes anyway.  from what witness a could gather, they're not that interested in the subject of ufos. \r\n\r\nwitness b tried to find the object with binoculars to no avail.  witness b did not observe any erratic movement, but a couple of times the object would seem to slowly drift to the left, then move to the right beyond were it had just been and then do a downward arc type movement, move a little more to the left and of course return to it's original location.  the movement was like that of the shape of a locking pin.  search for: nemco 45279 lock pin\r\n\r\nwitness a went to summon a neighbor. he confirmed that he saw the object. witness a called 911 and the dispatcher said that no one would be sent without more details. then a call was attempted to the rockford airport, to which recordings only were heard. that was followed by a call to scott afb in southern illinois as well as a call to grissom afb in indiana.  witness a wanted to alert everyone of his sighting as he wanted as many credible witnesses as possible. while the calls were being made, witness b took the pictures.  the no-no's are:  as aforementioned not checking weather at the time, witness b didn't include the roof line of the garage in the photo for a reference point, witness b took the picture holding the cell phone as steady as possible instead of leaning up against the garage for stability, and more than likely other no-no's that witness b knew better to implement when taking the picture.  witness b was so intrigued by what was transpiring before him that he did the best that he could at the time. witness b left around 45 minutes after getting to witness a's house.  when witness b got home and looked for the \"hat\", it couldn't be located because of cloud cover.\r\n\r\nwitness b was informed on saturday night that another call had been placed to the sheriff’s non-emergency number friday evening and within minutes after witness b left, a deputy arrived  at the house of witness a.  upon arriving, he was dispatched to another call and was gone for a short period of time. of course when he went back to witness a's house, the sky was cloudy.  it was cloudy at witness b's house when witness b returned home a little after 10 p.M.\r\n\r\non saturday evening witness b drove just north of rockford to escape the light pollution but could only faintly see the \"hat\" through the atmospheric haze.  witness b checked the sky around 9 p.M. at his house and again shortly after midnight with negative results.  sunday night was overcast. witness b is pondering over whether or not there is a star under the 3rd in a row \"hat\" star.  ideally there won't be one.  if so, then perhaps \"something\" was blocking out that star while the object was zipping around at both high and low speeds.   that just adds to the mystery.  regardless, both witness a and b are in agreement that something very peculiar was seen on the night of september 23, 2016 between the 3 hour span of 8-11 p.M.  by 11:00 p.M. on 9/23/16 the sky was 100% clouded over, so witness a called it a night.\r\n\r\na front moved through this area early monday (9/26/16) morning and the air is now crystal clear, along with a clear sky.  witness a called witness b monday evening around 8:00 p.M. and drove out to witness a's house to see what he was looking at at that time.  witness b found the \"hat\" monday as it was in the same area as on friday evening.  was the \"moving\" object/star there in the same location as on friday?  no!  but we saw another object at a bearing of approximately 275-280 degrees with an angle of approximately 10-15 degrees.  this object was periodically \"dancing\" around in small circles for an unknown short number of minutes.  it was obviously lower and farther away when compared to friday's object, but still visible to the naked eye. there are photos and video of it that show this.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

the yard.  after getting the drone to fly he started to video while flying.  he did not hear any noise nor did he notice anything odd.  he came into the house and played the video on our computer.  he called me as i was up at his mother's house so i came home to see what he videoed.  we both were confused and played it multiple times trying to pause it to see what it was in the sky above and behind our house.  it is unclear at this point.  it is not a plane, helicopter or a bird.  there are no blimps in our area.  we do not think a hot air balloon would have been in the air as we were under a storm watch/warning.  very cloudy with a possible storm coming.  since he was not aware of the object in the sky he did not know to fly higher to get better video of the object.  it appears several times at the top of the viewing area so it pops in and out of the video.  it does appear to move but not sure as the drone was moving.  we contacted wdbj 7 (local news) but they had not received any

but it is clearly something.  we both believe it to be an ufo of some kind.  other family has viewed it and think we are crazy and said it was a weather balloon but they are not black.  we are in the country and mostly wooded.  we have small planes that fly by but it is clearly round and black.  it seems to hover as the video is a little more than a minute long and it is in the same area during almost all of the video. it is a little creepy to think a ufo is that close to our home.  we are unaware of where it came from (direction) or where it went as we were unaware of the object until viewing the video inside about 5-10 minutes after filming.  we did not actually see the object in the sky while outside, only after watching the video when connected to the

elevated and dimly light resulting in low light pollution. i like to gaze at the stars whenever i'm out late at night and on this particular occasion a triangle shaped aircraft captured my attention. it was moving rather slow no more than 50 yards above. it was hard to completely make out it's shape but it looked as if it had two wings with 3 lights on each side with the 3rd light of each wing joining at the peak of the triangle. the aircraft was completely silent. i stopped to observe and was blown away by the stillness and lack of any external noise what so ever. there is a private airport about a half mile away so i'm quite used to the sound of commercial and private aircrafts landing nearby along with the noise they bring. this aircraft was headed directly south while the private airport is located south east of my apartment complex. at first i was simply perplexed but upon further research it appeared that these crafts have been sighted in the past. i have had experiences with other-worldly entities in the past and have done a fair amount of research on the topic. i am familiar with remote viewing and have had multiple encounters but none of these encounters were like this one. the craft was not interacting with me and didn't seem to have any other agenda other than a direction path south. i maintained eye-sight on the craft for approximately 2 minutes until it faded from view due to the light pollution on the edges of the apartment complex.  i would like to add that i was not under the influence of any substances and have been sober for almost a year running now. i am 21 years old and open to any further questioning or follow up investigations. the craft looked exactly like the image i have attached. i was unable to get any

east azerbaijan, iran in the town of ilkhchy. we were sitting in the park at night around 8pm. we were waiting for our host friend who went to get a drink which took almost 45 minutes. because drinking in iran is prohibited so he had to be cautious and had set a place and time with the dealer to meet and get the drink, that's why it took a little while. while he was away the rest of us were sitting on the park bench playing with our phones. i got a little impatient and felt bored so i stood up and stretched looking above at the sky i saw this star-sized object in the air and called out to my friends guys come chech this out. an object that had the same size of the nearby stars was coming from south heading north-east at a rapid speed incomparable to any flying thing i'd ever seen. clearly it wasn't an airplane because my friend told me about the flight line of iran and turkey besides that night we saw some airplanes too which conviced us what we saw was of unknown origin. airplanes fly at lower altitudes and they have red and yellow flashing lights\r\nbut this one we saw was as white as and the same size as other stars in the sky moving fast. the moment i saw it i knew it's the thing but my friends were in disbelief trying to find out some sort of explanation as to what it is. one said it's a satellite the other said it's america's stealth plane.\r\nevetually it continuded north-east and diappeared. we were still heads up waiting for it to come back from the same direction but quite astonishingly it came back again from south this time heading directly north disappearing into horizon again we were waiting for something to happen. the object came back once again from south this time heading north-west. the thing i did not understand was that we were observing the same object or they were many in traffic. then the object came back from north-west heading south. in the middle of the way right above us it shone so bright all of a sudden that all four of us were convinced that it's a real ufo because stealth aircraft don't make their presence known like that and passenger planes don't give off such strong light suddenly in the sky the light took 2 seconds to dim back to normal continuing its way fading off towards south. it didn't stop trafficing. it came again from south-west going north-west we followed it in amazement. the last time it made its appearance it came back from the same direction lowering altitude which caused a shinier appearance and rising altitude going back to normal shine. we were expecting it to return but it didin't. the time between each appearance to disappearance was approximately 2 minutes. the thing i learned from this event which gave me the goosebumps is that this event occured on 22nd september. the gregorian date is quite insignificant to the event but its equivalent date in the persian solar-based calender which is the best and most precise calender system in history is it happended on the 1st of mehr month. mehr or mithra \r\nis the supreme goddess of mithraism the oldest religion in the world that once spanned the whole globe. 1st of mehr is the achaemenid's new year beside nowrooz which is the persian new year. and there is a celebration associated to the day which is called mithrakana. another thing i have to add is that when our host friend came back from his meeting with the drink dealer we told him what happened and he wasn't taken aback like we were he told that their region is a ufo hotspot and he had seen ufos flying there and even landing when he was a child. i suppose this has also to do with the region itself because this region of iran was the gate fro the enterance of arians to iran from europe and it was one of the centers of mithraic worship in which this cosmic and mysterious religion thrived.\r\nthere is something to this event and these connections which i too am eager \r\nto discover.

it. its only when it flew at great speed right overhead that i saw what it was or wasn't because what i saw definitely wasn't a plane. it was triangular in shape and look almost transparent either it was black or was in somekind of cloaking mode. there was red and greenish lights around the edges of the craft witch helped me to notice it first and establish its shape because otherwise i woudln't have seen it at all. even the lights was quite faint but i could see it clearly because my attention zeroed in that thing and my brain was going a thousand mile trying to make sense of it and to sink in as much as i could of the event witch lasted 3 second, maybe four at the most. it might sound like not enough time to see something but believe you me it is more then enough to know this was not normal. and to me the creepiest part of it all is the absence of sounds. it moved in total silence. i was shocked by it and made me uncomfortable like they are stalking us. it disappear in the horizon real quick. it was as fast as a jet fighter. it had no blinking lights like a plane would have. i replayed and replayed my memory of it to try to discredit what i saw but honestly could not. it was a traumatic experience to say the least. when i tried to talk to my brothers and my sisters about it they were all laughing and making jokes about it. i knew then i could not share this experience with nobody and had to keep it to myself, one of the most defining experience in ones life, finding out that there is something or someone out there from another world visiting us and i cant share it. i is
