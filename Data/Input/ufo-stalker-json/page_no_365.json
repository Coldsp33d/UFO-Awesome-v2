when i saw two blue lights that flashed yellow and then blue again, consistently and i also saw a solid red light that did not flash or go off, and noticed that i was seeing a black triangular aircraft across the river. the next thing i knew, it was directly above me so logic tells me it flew across the river, however i do not remember witnessing an actual flight path because it happened so quickly. the craft was about 2.5 cars large, solid black with lighter grey geometrical lines on the underneath, along with a circle in the center of the under-part. it was shortly after concealed by the treeline so i continued my drive to the atm at the bank about a mile and a half straight ahead. once i left the bank, i saw the craft again directly in front of me, but down the road a little way. i was already going in that direction to go home and the craft went in the same direction so i essentially followed it. i passed my subdivision to continue to see where this craft was going. i proceeded to follow it for about 3 minutes when all of a sudden there was a flash of white light inside my car to my right eye, as if someone in my passenger seat was taking a picture of me with a flash (however, i was alone in my car), and then the craft was completely gone. it was absolutely nowhere to be seen and it was a clear night, stars everywhere. no other planes or objects in the sky. there were people out and about walking, running, enjoying the evening and no one seemed to even look up at it or notice it. however, a friend of mine who is a first responder also saw the craft separately from me seeing it. there have been no reports in the media of a drone or military maneuvers in my area, however i do live just miles from a navy base and there are a total of 4 military bases in our greater area.

first thought it was a plane, heading away from me. then as i watched, it moved up and down, then from right to left.\r\ni went and got my binoculars and was able to tell that one half was red and the other blue. it was still moving, but, now was making a square with its movements.\r\ni thought the movement might be caused by my breathing, so i rested the binoculars on the porch railing. it continued to move.\r\nmy wife called out and asked what i was doing, that the presidential debate was coming on soon. i asked her to come out, then i asked if she saw anything. she pointed to the object, and said \"it`s flahing blue and red\" then she said \"it`s moving\"\r\nour view of the object was through a neighbors tree, and i thought that possibly the branches were moving and giving it the illusion of movement.\r\nso, i walked out to the driveway ,looking at it from the right of where i was, with no obstructions. it would hover then start making the square movement.\r\ni had my phone an attempted photos and a video, which, i`m sorry to say are not very good. also at this time i observed to planes traveling towards the object, but, apparently at a higher altitude. the difference in lighting was very obvious.\r\nit was then that i noticed the object getting lower to the horizon, and realized it was moving away, to the south.  then i lost sight of it.\r\ni thought

one.\r\ni had a long career in law enforcement and was trained to remain calm and observe. this i did and tried to rule out anything i could be confusing this with. \r\ni`m certainly not saying this

live on a property and are surrounded by scrub and grazing paddocks and we can see a long way. approximately 8.25am i was walking past a large glass window and noticed something very bright in one of the paddocks approximately a half a mile away.  i knew it was on our property and called my husband to come quickly as i thought some one in a white utility was on the place.  husband came and saw it too so we both had a look through a pair of binoculars.  at first we thought it may have been kangaroo shooters or a pig hunter as it appeared to be about the size of a larger four wheel drive utility. the object was extremely bright, almost glowing, and it was difficult to make out what it was exactly as it was very very bright. we decided to get closer to have a better view and i grabbed my camera.  the door outside is right next to the window and my camera was right next to the door so it took about 8 seconds to get the camera, open the door and start to walk to the gate.  it was only out of our sight for that amount of time and when it should have been in our line of sight again it was gone.  it being a paddock there was nowhere for it to go without us seeing it drive away but it had just vanished. i immediately looked up and scanned the sky, there were no clouds and the sky was clear but there was nothing to be seen. we spent the next two to three minutes scouring the paddocks with the binoculars but it had gone. this all happened over a period of about 3 to 4 minutes. \r\nwe jumped in our car and drove down the road to where, if it had been a vehicle, there would have been tyre tracks as it had not long rained and tracks would have been very visible but there was nothing.  thinking it may have been the neighbour going on to his property across the road we checked his access gate but again there were no tracks.  we drove back home and i took my camera and jumped on our quad bike to go and have a good look at where i thought it would have been.  i spent about half an hour checking the ground over an area of about 100 square yards, stopping often to stand on the back of the bike to see if i could see any depressions or marks of any kind but there was nothing.  i looked for pools of water thinking it may have been a reflection but there was no standing water anywhere near where we saw the object.  there are a lot of dead trees and large fallen tree

can't answer some of the above questions as we simply don't know what it was.\r\nthe object just vanished, there is no other word for it and there was no noise. it was so bright that i couldn't make

lights glowing on and off.  not like airplane lights that flash off and on, but more like someone walking infront of the light and then to the next light and then the third, and then back to the front and start over again. we live by an airport and see planes at night on a nightly basis, this was not a plane, and was four or five times larger that a normal plane coming in for a landing at the airport.The vehicle appeared to be huge moving very slowly to the east. the object was just above the roof tops and appeared to be a mile or so to the north of me.\r\ni ran into the house and told my wife, grandauter and her boyfriend to come out and look at what was in the shy.  we then all watched the object travel at a very slow speed to the east.  we could all see the outline of what appeared to be a disc shaped object about a quarter of a mile long or more, and about 300 feet high. the object continued to travel east.  it went behind a tree in a neighbors yard, so we moved to a new spot but still in the back yard.  it appeared to decend to a slightly lower altitude and seemed to slow down.  then it appeared to either stop and hover, or it started to move away from us which made it appear to stop.  \r\n\r\nwe all decided to get in our vehicle and follow the objet.  we drove to the airport ,as there is no trees or building around.  however by then we had lost sight of it, as if it had continued north east and out of sight.  \r\n\r\nthis made a believer out of all of us.  do not know if it was alien, or military, but it was the largest object that any of us had seen in the sky.\r\nall of us were very excited at what we had just witnessed.  my daughters boy friend stated that it was like an \"independance day \" space ship.  we wer all so excited and in awe of what had just taken place.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

i was so excited! i grabbed a big blanket and a pillow, as well as my high powered mag light flash light and went back outside and lay on the porch. i was still facing south, but i was now looking up towards the zenith of the sky, but with my head elevated from the pillow so i had a clear view of the south facing sky. \r\n\r\nas i was watching, i kept saying \"if you can hear me, fly over agin! i know i'm not crazy!\" and as i was laying there, i noticed the sky directly above me and slightly to the left black out. it was a very large, much larger than the triangle, gray/translucent craft that was flying over my house at approximately 1,000 ft. at first there was absolutely no sound and had no lights, but as the full craft emerged overhead from over the house, i heard what i can only describe as the sound of a small fire crackling, or a quiet round of applause. \r\n\r\nmy heart jumped and i got that tight  adrenaline rush feeling in my chest and remembered i had my flashlight. i shined my flashlight up directly at the craft, but when the light was on it, there was nothing to be seen! i turned my light off and could see the shape and outline clearly, then i shine the light back on it and there was nothing! \r\n\r\ni then distinctly  remember the birds around the house starting to chirp really loudly and excitedly and my dog, who was sleeping on her blanket on the other side of the porch, lifted her head and started growling. \r\n\r\nat this point i was completely dumbfounded. i've been an avid sky watcher for almost 10 years and have never ever seen anything like this, let alone multiple ones\r\nin the same night. my heart was pounding, my body was shaking, but again, i didn't feel fear, only exhilaration. \r\n\r\nat this point, i knew i needed to get to bed soon, and as a sort of joke, i said out loud, to the sky \"if all of these crafts are related and you can hear me, fly over again, but go from west to east.\" i felt silly, but i've read stories about people claiming to have communicated with et and conjuring  crafts because they request that they show themselves.\r\n\r\nso anyway, about fifteen or twenty minutes later, i started thinking about bed again, so i said out loud \"i'm going to go inside in about 10 minutes because i'm getting cold. if you can fly over one more time from west to east for me, i would appreciate because i feel crazy and i want you to prove that i'm not.\"\r\n\r\nnot more than a minute later, a gray arrowhead shaped craft with no lights flew quickly overhead from west to east, and once again, when i shined my light up at it, i couldn't see anything, but when i turned my light off i could distinctly see the outline and the shadow it was essentially creating by blocking out the ambient light and stars. \r\n\r\ni know that this all sounds crazy, i can't believe it myself! in the ten years i've been doing this, i've always debunked my sightings in one way or another. i try to stay logical and pragmatic. in all the years and with all the sightings, there has only been one other incident that i've felt was report worthy because i couldn't find a good explanation. last night was the first time i have ever witnessed anything like what i saw and couldn't wait to write my story out. \r\n\r\ni'm not saying it was aliens. it very well could have been military crafts, or drones, or something else explainable, i just know that i have  never ever seen anything like what i saw last night. and the fact that it seemed like they could hear me and did what i asked by flying west to east completely amazed me.

degree angle from our position. there were no clouds in the sky so it was quite clear. what caught our attention is that a small plane was coming up to it from the tamiami airport which then descended. two minutes later another small aircraft came out of the airport and flew in front of the stationary light without there being any reaction from it. by that time i decided to film the third aircraft which also approached the stationary light. from a distance it looked bigger than a star. at that time i observed that there was another automobile parked on the other side of the sidewalk also watching in that direction.  the third aircraft also then descended. we then continued on our way. i took two pictures and a brief film. upon our return at around 9:00pm the star-like light was still suspended in the same spot. there was no sound from the craft/light and no unusual phenomena surrounding the event although i remember that on saturday night we had observed the same size

before. it had a reddish glow to it and hovered higher than the others. it would drop down and then rise back up and move side to side and quickly dart from one spot to another.\r\n\r\nthe other two objects were moving around above the field right above the treeline and then would shoot up and blink erratically. the higher one would blink slowly and then the others would drop back down to a different spot.\r\n\r\nthis happened for about five minutes before i noticed another object off to the left. i needed a better view so i moved to another window and observed a large triangular-shaped object gliding by. it banked left very quickly and i was able to notice that it had three white lights below each point. the object shot forward rapidly. not far behind it there were two, what could surely only be silent helicopters, as the way they moved and having nav lights, were in hot pursuit. \r\n\r\ni looked back at the other objects and saw that they seemed to be responding to the helicopters. the objects were blinking back and forth and blinked out for a few moments. they appeared again in at different locations in the same vicinity. shortly after, there were, what appeared to be, three jets, again, nav lights on what looked to be wings, flying toward the other objects. the highest one glowed bright white and and the others followed suit. the jets quickly banked toward the nw and flew off. from then on, they were not disturbed and went about their business for quite some time. \r\n\r\nwe had seen the highest object a few other times in recent months. one time, it had a glowing sphere roaming around a different field that seemed to \"report\" to it. this is suspected because it hovered way above the other object and the one in or right above the field would blink and glow and then the \"main one\" would blink quickly in response. my in-laws were here in town on one occasion and were not believers until they saw the objects for themselves. we've had up to four witnesses.\r\n\r\ni don't know if it's connected or not, but there have been strange cattle deaths in close timing to seeing these things previously. the deaths have been blamed on some type of
