this is not unusual, we see any number of passenger and military jets passing overhead. and yes we can hear them as well, even the passenger jets at altitude.  i always look at the night sky when i am outside. what was strange is there were no blinking marker lights... only the bright white light. as it traversed the crossed my field of view the intensity of the light never changed, even when it was obviously traveling away from me. never seen the headlight of a plane from behind before. again no marker or nav lights, no sound whatsoever. traveling too slow to be a satellite and i have seen plenty of those over the years. i am 53 yrs. old and was raised in a military family so i know jets and can estimate speeds.  i am not urge what i saw, but it was interesting and somewhat exciting. the object appeared to be the same size as jupiter as view from my back yard. now i know some say well then you must have seen jupiter...Mbut jupiter doesn't travel at the speed this thing crossed the sky. unfortunately i didn't have a camera ,do no photos. i would love to see it again and get one photos.As isaid earlier it traveled from southwest to northeast, this is not the usual direction for jets in our area. bottom line... i'm sure i didn't see the usual jet or even a satellite , not ure what i saw, but i would love to see it again... just a light with no obvious outline and completely silent.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

elsewhere and at a different time and not at the direction i was veiwing.  i decided it was a satelite until i felt strange, so i said \"hello\" quietly to myself.  i felt a strange sensation and was almost like hypnotized. as i was watching, 2 bright flashes appeared behind it, their duration was literally 1 second each.  it felt like the ufo was friendly whatever it was.  i have no idea what the flashes were as they were not attached to the ufo nor were they emitted from the ufo. i was frozen watching until my dog ran into my legs and knocked me off my feet. i ran inside to see online what was in the area.  all the other objectx in the sky were either at a different part of the sky or at a different time.  as i am writing this, i am watching for the space station which is sw,ssw tonight in about a few minutes.  it is obvious that what i saw was not the space station, what i saw was traveling n. it felt like somthing was trying to communicate.  im completely confused at what i saw.  i

one we saw as of now was really unnerving cause it was right up over the trees just floating like a balloon it was sort of oblong shaped but short and thick. the color of this one was brown and it

basket ball approximately a mile away. it came to a dead stop, like it was hesitating then came around in a tight circle zipped off to the west at an impossible speed. \r\n\r\n\r\n

april 2000, 23 miles northeast of morón afb (seville), spain. around 7:15 p.M. still broad daylight, i was driving home from my workplace, alone as usual. there were no cars then on that stretch of back road from marchena to écija (province of seville, spain). i had just entered a mile and a half long straight section of road when from my left side, from behind a hill, as if taking off from the ground in a movement along an arc of circle, a streak of light caught my eye, which almost instantly i recognized as a red sphere of light that was coming right towards my car. i jumped in my seat but somehow my scare turned into cold-blooded curiosity when the sphere immediately came to a sudden halt, perhaps not more than 60 yards away from me, as if it had been aware of me, and then changed direction, and continued moving ahead of me in a straight line parallel to the road and then it started blinking within fractions of a second. it was then, very much to my surprise, that another orb of light, same size, this one yellowish, was wiggling behind the first orb, hurrying along from the same direction the first one had appeared, till it started tailing the first sphere in a straight line, both following the contour of the fields, blinking at the same time and flying very low, all the while parallel to the road. they slightly increased their speed and disappeared behind a low hill. from the start i had time to check my speed, first i was driving at 87 mph, then i lowered my window because i wanted to be sure that what i was watching was real and it sure was. i reduced speed trying to listen to some noise coming from the orbs, and i couldn't hear anything apart from the wind rushing in. both lights were perfect spheres, they had the size of a ping pong ball at arm’s length, maybe a little smaller. before they disappeared, i flashed my high beams for some seconds at the same time they were blinking. somehow i wanted them to know by doing so  that i was there. the whole episode may have lasted for about 30 seconds, at the most. as soon as i could pull over, i phoned my wife to tell her what i had seen. i was excited and she was nine months pregnant, and got a little scared. she asked me to get home as soon as possible, which i did. from then on i am absolutely sure that something really really strange is out there.\r\ni had seen strange lights moving in the night sky before. on one occasion in córdoba (spain) in august, 1987 around 1:00 a.M, it was really weird. i was with a friend, we were sitting on his doorstep, chatting while looking at the stars. suddenly, a white star like light, which was there like any other star, started moving slowly, i nudged him pointing to the star and said: can you see what i see? he said suuure. the light stopped and then suddenly flashed out of sight. seconds later, it flashed back into sight again a little bit to our left and started jumping up and down in a zigzag motion crossing a large stretch of sky, and then suddenly flashed out of sight again at an incredible speed this time leaving a long streak of light behind. we were amazed and unable to identify what we had just seen. it definitely was not anything we could think of.  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

my balcony for a smoke and sat down in my chair facing east overlooking most of ne eugene and n springfield. looking in the sky above and well beyond the neighbors house at the sight line of the power lines i saw 3 orange lights equidistant apart and in a triangle. it occurred to me that there shouldn't be bright stars in the sky in that area that time of night and time of year so i  looked closer. \r\n\r\nas i  looked closer i saw the bottom most of the lights moving and then i thought to myself: that makes sense it is commercial aviation. so i looked back at the other 2 lights and saw they were moving together too and that it was one triangle shaped craft rotating on its center axis. all the while i  noticed the bright orange lights were shining through what looked like heat shimmer coming off the desert floor.\r\n\r\nvery much like a scene from the movie \"predator\" the \"cloaking\" around it wavered for just a brief second and when it did i saw a large triangle shaped craft with smooth sides and a smooth metallic bottom with a smaller circular abutment in the center with a light bluish glow. the craft stopped rotating and it looked like a harrier jet pulling up its nose on a vertical takeoff and then it disappeared. it did leave but as it was leaving the \"cloaking\" kicked back in and it disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nlike something out of the x files 2 helicopters showed up within 30 seconds of the object disappearing. eugene is a small city and helicopters are fairly rare here with just a couple of overflights a day but these stayed on station for the better part of an hour circling over the eugene/springfield area. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then
