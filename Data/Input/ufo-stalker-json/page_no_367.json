navarre florida (near gulf breeze)to watch the sunset and take pictures for an art project. several days later, when looking at the pictures i had taken, i noticed a dark stationary object in several of the photos. the object was in a single position from 7:02- 7:03 pm in a southerly direction- at a height that it cast a shadow on the cloud directly behind it. there was nothing in the photos at the spot 2 minutes prior to the even and no object one minute after the event. i know it was stationary because my iphone se takes short videos when the photo is taken. there are small clouds in the photo which remain in the sky throughout the event. this is the only object which appeared for 2 minutes and then was gone. it could have been an unusual momentary cloud, but there is no indication of formation and dissipation as a cloud would require. moreover, the final picture does appear to show a dark disk-shaped object with what appears to be a pointed antenna-type object on its top portion and an apparent diamond-shaped field around the craft. it had some solidity as the object appeared to cast a shadow on the cloud behind it. i have 8 photos of the object, showing various shapes/forms, with the final photo being most distinctive. i also have photos of the area minutes before the event and minutes after with the object no longer there- which seems to me to indicate it was not a cloud. i am attaching the last (best) photo first. the last photo attached shows the sky one minute after the event, with no indication of the object. i have not included enhanced photos, for proper photo analysis by experts.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":79418,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.4109342,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09262016-0018","longitude":-86.91232169999999,"occurred":1473447720000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1474901617000,"summary":"Gulf

girlfriend and i had just returned home from dinner out after work. it was roughly 10:15pm (local time) when we got out of the car in our driveway. we live in a new development in the south end of the city, and with the turn towards cooler evenings, the night sky has been rather clear as of late. i've been pointing out planets and constellations to my girlfriend recently and so i've been making a habit of looking to the sky. interestingly enough, i looked straight up and my gaze was instantly drawn to an \"unusual star\", brighter than any others with a slight blue cast to it. it was almost directly above me. it held a stationary position for several seconds, perhaps 3-5, and then took off due south at an incredible speed, passing beyond the horizon in less than 2 seconds. as it moved, it was partially obscured by the sporadic cloud cover, and i have a distinct recollection of it moving from obscured to visible to obscured to visible, etc., as it moved through/above the clouds on it's path southward. it happened so quickly that, while i'm confident in what i saw, it didn't register any alarm with me. i did not mention it to my girlfriend as she's uncomfortable with such topics, and given how fleeting the \"sighting\" was i didn't see the need to bring it to her attention.\r\n\r\nnow, with the above said, what prompted me to make a report, was an additional day-time observance the following day. i was at a local park (whitemud park) on saturday the 24th,at around 11:00 am. i was walking through the trails there taking photographs of trees/squirrels/etc when i felt compelled to look up and instantly spotted an object moving through the sky. it was certainly not aircraft, and i initially wondered if it was just a bird, but after several seconds of observation i discarded that thought. the object moved at a fixed speed (directly south again) and appeared to be small and reflective. i'd say it was dull grey but would pick up flashes of reflected light as it moved. i'd say it was maybe 400 ft up and i can't really give a good size estimate - depending how accurate my distance estimate is, i'd say it was anywhere from a basketball to a motorcycle in size. part of the observation was obscured by trees and i was unable to get my lens cap off and the camera turned on in time to take a picture. there was a group of young women near by that saw me looking up at it and they gave me a look that was either like \"what are you looking at?\" or \"did you see that too?\" i didn't speak with them and it was a windy day, so it could have just been debris.\r\n\r\nneither of these \"sightings\" are particularly good, i know, but given the uncanny fact that they came in back to back days, were both moving due south, and both featured me instinctively looking up right at the time to see them made me think there might be something to it. mostly just curious if anyone else in edmonton has seen anything this past weekend.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On thursday, september 15, 2016, around 7:15 pm, i was at home with my 9 year old daughter, and my husband.  my husband was in the shower and did not witness any of this event.  i was in the kitchen getting dinner ready, and my daughter was in the living room watching t.V.  the living room has a sliding glass door that opens to our second floor balcony.  \r\n\r\ni heard a noise outside.  it sounded like there were a couple of motorcycles, maybe across the road in the sports complex's parking lot, that were revving their engines or something.  it was kind of loud, and a little disruptive, but i didn't pay too much attention to it, since there is a fair amount of traffic where we live.  after a couple of minutes, my daughter said to me, \"hey, mom, it's a helicopter.\"  i said, \"oh yeah?\"  i really wasn't interested in stopping what i was doing to look at a helicopter, but i did to make her happy.  you can imagine my surprise when i went into the living room to look out the sliding glass door to see a helicopter in the sky, but instead saw an object hovering literally right next to the left corner post of our balcony.  the object could not have been any more than 10 feet away from us, maximum.  i became quite alarmed and gruffly told my daughter get inside and away from the glass.  i looked back over at the object, which continued to hover momentarily.  it was solid black in the front.  it could not have had any propellers on it because the object was so close that the propellers would have been striking the building.  also, i did not feel any wind or breeze coming from the direction of the object.  the glass door was open to my balcony, so i would have felt something coming through the screen.  my hair did not even move.  \r\n\r\nafter telling my daughter to move away, and then turning to look back at the object, it went from a hovering position, to a straight up vertical ascent, extremely fast.  in this position the object had a egg shaped front, with a long thin part extending toward the back, connected at the back, top part, maybe 8 feet long?  not sure.  the extension part looked like it had some red color on it.  the object ascended straight up, and then started to turn like it was going to go upside down.  i became concerned that it was going to crash on the ground.  then a light army green colored helicopter (a real one) was traveling over our building coming from the south and headed north.  as the green helicopter went over-head, the black and red object vanished.  literally.  my daughter also saw the object ascend, since she had only moved away from the window, and did not go where i had wanted her to.\r\n\r\nlater, my daughter shared with me that she had seen the object arrive, starting at the east end of our balcony and stopping at the west end of it.\r\n\r\ninitially, i was pretty confused by what i had seen, and thought the object was a helicopter, as my daughter had thought.  it all happened so unexpectedly and quickly.  also, i felt like my brain wasn't really processing my observations like it normally would.  almost felt like i was a little bit \"trance-like\", which i think is why it took me a few days to sort out what i actually saw, backed up by my daughter's observations, and come to terms with what happened.  however, looking at all of the facts, there is no way the object could have been a helicopter.\r\n\r\nthe next morning after the sighting of the object, my daughter woke in her bed with a bleeding nose.  also, she was very distressed, angry, agitated, and physically aggressive.  she was 1 1/2 hours late for school because i could not get her to calm down.  \r\n\r\nmy reactions and feeling were:\r\ninitially fear and concern.  why was someone in a helicopter hovering next to our balcony?  were we in danger?\r\nthen somewhat a feeling of awe watching it ascend so quickly, and also from what it looked like.\r\nthen concern again that it was making unsafe maneuvers and might crash.\r\n\r\nthen extreme confusion.  initially, it seemed like the object had turned in to the green helicopter heading north.  but, really it just vanished, as the helicopter was going over. \r\n\r\ni have to say, this has been an unsettling experience.  the event happened after a series of sightings of strange lights, farther away, one of which had been on the ground across the road from us a few weeks prior.  i am concerned that we could be confronted again.  i just don't know what to expect at this point.  trying to not dwell on it and focus on the blessings of each day.  but, experiencing a lot of anxiety and stress, to be quite honest.  also, maybe a little curious, too.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

could now see the unusual, bright flashing (mostly white but also violet/purple) object, and it seemed to constantly change shape. idk because it was hard to tell. so i stood in a darker spot on the sidewalk away from lights in parking lot & took pics. i forgot & left flash on at first, so those didn't turn out, but the object still shows up in those 2 pics. then i took a pic with no flash. i tried to zoom in best i could. then i tried to take a video, but every time i tried that, i couldn't find the object in my camera view for some reason. so i then took 2 more still shots. after examing my photos (including zooming in) inside, i noticed the more violet/blue color more, and i also see that the light/object/orb did indeed change shapes. it continued to stay in one spot in the sky (stationary). i felt afraid when i went back outside after i first spotted it. it really scared me that my flash went off b/c i worried \"they\" might see it from up there. and i surely didn't want to draw attention to myself. i was praying. i never lost site of the light/object/orb. i was too scared to stay outside. it never changed its position the last i saw. i'm afraid to look even now. can't sleep.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

3 in the morning. we all noticed a strange light formation underneath a strange shaped cloud. we stopped and were really taken with awe when the 2 strong lights began to what seemed like emit smaller orbs of light from themselves and then merge into one. \r\n\r\nthe moon was quite bright that night and highlighted the cloud which was over the top of these lights but not obscuring them in anyway. in fact it created enough light to see there was a dark oval shaped object hanging at a 45 degree angle which was the source of the lights.\r\n\r\nit continued to hang there whilst 2 other onlookers came over to us, one of which was quite shaken up and really wasn't enjoying the free light show.\r\n\r\nwe stood there for 10 minutes watching as it stayed completely still but continued to emit various light patterns around the oval and orbs of the same bright yellow color which seemed to merge with each other. \r\n\r\nthe lights suddenly dimmed and we saw a point of light moving incredibly fast and out of sight, literally straight out of the atmosphere. strangely the weird rectangular cloud formation was no longer visible. \r\n\r\n it was very strange and as skeptics have had to except that this might be some sort of technology which is either secret or off world. i have poured over the internet looking for an explanation which could be natural or maybe technological. i cant find anything which looks/describes or could rationalize what we saw.\r\n\r\nwe feel strange about what we saw. we have told our group of friends on whatsap but they referred to the meteorites which have been seen in our area over the last few days. my self, my wife and our 17 year old daughter saw an amazing meteorite on friday night, it broke up pretty close to us. it was electric blue and fast. was over in less than a second.\r\n\r\nwhat we saw the following night was no meteorite. it would be great if you could contact me, we feel we would like some closure to this or even if anyone else who saw it from a different angle could tell us something we may have missed which could throw some closure on the strangest event of our lives.\r\n\r\nwe have a short mobile phone video recording of the event but my friend stopped filming because it wasn't showing up passed the street light pollution. i think you can see a tiny light on it but does not show what we saw at all.","distance":"501 Feet -

i had saw the crossing of war jets and other planes that was very nearest but these objects was very far and had very powerfull lights and clear round shape in triangle order and cross the sky from horizon to horizon in 4 or 5 seconds! soon after that the light came back ans all these happens in maybe 10 seconds!\r\ni was shocked at that time and after that feel fear. i went to the yard from the roof of our home and after that inside the house so quickly that my parents also feared and asked me that what happened?! i said that i saw a ufo. my mother who was washing the dishes and my father who was speaking to her laughed at me and my mother said: \"be careful that the aliens dont rub you!\". i became very shameful because my parents always appreciated my talent and i felt that they think that i am very crazy. i did not say anything and after some minutes i went again to the roof despite the fear that i have but not see any abnormal thing any more. after that i saw again a lot of planes and comets but non of them were like the objects of that night.\r\ni became a physician and i also was a police trusted physician for many year but i did not say anything about that night to anyone else. but read a lot of books and see a lot of movie about ufo and aliens and etc. i saw the episodes of mufon project on the tv and i told my story to my wife after years. she is a veterinarian and she believed in me and she knows that i had read a lot of book about ufo and aliens but she also laughed at me and i did not insist on it but i decided to wrote it here.\r\none think that is fantastic to me and also my wife has knows it is that every time i saw a document movie about ufo or aliens i bacame very sleepy so that i can not finish the movie!

(see house ufo.Jpeg which shows my neighbor's house, but in daylight.) my first thought was \"omg a ufo!\"it was way too big for a plane. a second later as the lights strobed and reflected off the body i realized the lights were a wrong color(too much blue) for a plane, and it was far too big and too slow to be a plane, slower than even a slow helicopter. my vision is about 20/35 without my glasses, so i ran inside to get my glasses. it was hovering at about 30 degrees in elevation and 10 degrees north.The sky was mostly clear with only a few clouds (cloud base 3100-6500 feet according to the weather report), wind ne at 8 mph, temperature was 78 degrees and humidity was 78%. it was disc-shaped but had sharp points on the top and bottom. there was a larger oval, very bright white light on the top point that blinked, not strobed. that light was so bright it hurt my eyes. surrounding the object along its side were strobing multi-colored lights that strobed from white/blue/green/red/ yellow very quickly. they reflected off the body that seemed to be dull gray, but sometimes looked dull amber depending on the color of the lights strobing at the moment. its speed was quite slow, slower than a slow helicopter. twice, all of its lights went out at once for about two seconds and then the lights came back on as it hovered in the same place. initially it hovered for about two minutes over the house, (i counted 110 seconds after i retrieved my glasses) then it headed east for about 10 seconds, stopped for 2-3 seconds, headed back west for about 10 seconds, stopped for 2-3 seconds, and then headed southeast.It had significant sideways movement as described, but its altitude did not change much other than slight wobbling.Once it went inside a cloud, the cloud lit up with the multi-colored lights and then it came out of the cloud, so its elevation was at least 3100 feet, meaning it had to be pretty big to appear penny-size at arms length and 3100 feet up. it moved slowly southeast of me and i lost sight of it when it was behind some woods. from its height and distance it should have been over the atlantic ocean at that point. from the direction it moved, it may have been over downtown st. augustine and/or st. augustine beach at some point, so i wonder if mufon will get more reports. i watched it for a total of approximately 6 minutes. there were no animal or psychological effects and no missing time.

bright star at the horizon which we had not noticed in the passed hour. we asked ourselves \"had that been there the whole time?\" we then started to realize it wasn't a star because it was rising from the horizon line fairly quickly for a star. we thought maybe it's a plane but as it slowly came overhead we noticed the brightest light had 4 dimmer lights around it. like a square and a bright light in the middle. it seemed the lights were too close for a craft to be so silent, a plane is often audible from a much further distance. but the body of the craft was almost impossible to see, may have been a vague outline. it kept on moving overhead until it it met the opposite horizon. my friend hoped it was a plane but we both felt that didn't make sense. it scared her. i felt certain it was not a plane but couldn't identify what else it may be. we first spotted it at about 11:30 and it had reach the opposite horizon at about 12:10. we were both confused and curious at this sighting. i kept saying \"that is no plane i have ever seen before. it's too quiet for how low it is. if a plane was low enough to see its lights so evidently you'd hear it,  easily.\" \r\n\r\ni pointed out a plane maybe 20 after loosing sight of the lights. that plane was flying much higher and the plane lights were vastly different, plus i could hear the plane. the comparison made it clear to me that we had not seen a plane earlier. it must have been something else. i just don't know what. \r\nwe tried to capture a photo or video but our phones couldn't manage to clearly get the lights.  \r\ni drew a digital sketch to demonstrate the shape of the lights and size.
