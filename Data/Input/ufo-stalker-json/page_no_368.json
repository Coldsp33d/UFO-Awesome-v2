and other things are very much correct as on date also i can visualize this as it made great impact on me.\r\nwhen i was 9/10 year old there were many news on sky lab falling issue, news paper were giving news about it and prediction of loss or damages . we were living in small town and there were farms behind our house colony. we use to play in near by premises of half build houses and on road after school time. there were 2 half build houses opposite to each other on the road. there was a huge tree( tree of heaven) around 25 meter tall behind half build house on the border of orange farm.\r\nit was a time of sunset around 5:20 pm and sky was clear , all of sudden i noticed dark spot in the north west very clearly so i stopped playing and ask my friends to see the object which was not airplane. and to our surprise that object was descending and was getting closed and we have a very good look at it and we were stunned to saw it and every one excited to see that object came very straight inclined path without doing any noise, any light and any smoke. it was so beautiful sighting that we were impressed . it was seen that it was very well control on its speed . very smoothly that object which were looking like disc , having diameter of around 15 to 20 feet stopped in air above 15 meter ground level near to tree . and we saw it is stopped there which was hardly 150 feet away from us , we all friends ran towards it making a noise . when we cross the road and enter in the premises of that half build house and we were away from that object almost 50 meter , the saucer take off  in the same line path and in same angle but rotating in spiral way and with great speed went in same direction and that time there was no sound , no light and no smoke. \r\nsurprisingly while it came down it was not rotating so calm and steadily it came down and stopped in air  and while going back it moved and rotated so fast that it disappear in 10 to 20 seconds while landing it took almost 1 to 2 minute and it was remain landed in air for almost 30 seconds to one minute.\r\nwe were stunned and after that we realized that we have seen something special and we talked among ourselves about the incident . but we didn't think that it is rare and very much important. as we were use to listen about saucer sighting and some old stories in family that in our grand- grand parents were having power of landing star to earth ( which might be a communication with ufo) . \r\nat that age also we talked about power and movement without noise and any smoke or wings or fan. evening we came to home and told our family that we seen saucer but no body took it seriously , next day we told this to our friends but they only thrilled but no one believed it and we also not seriously promoted it as we thought it was common incident. but after so many years i never forget it and still i want to solve this mistry that why that ufo come to that place. why ufo chose that place whether there is any relation with our grand grand parents story of having power to land star on earth? is that place has any special relation for ufo? has ufo visited many time there? is there any relation with big tree of heaven with ufo?\r\nbut one this is very clear ufo is in existence. and their technology is beyond our imagination.    \r\n \r\n","distance":"21-100

having just taken out the trash, when i heard the sound of large helicopters arriving  - then i saw two helicopters flying in loose formation (about 2000 ft. apart at the same altitude (approx. 2500 ft.) and one trailing the other) they both had either bright landing lights, or search lights pointed in the direction of flight.  i assumed they were military because we often see formation flights of two of either ch-47 or uh-60 flying along the river (delaware river). \r\n\r\nhowever as the flight came to nearly over head, i observed the lead helicopter was actually following another unknown aircraft, which was approximately 1000 ft. in front of the lead helicopter.  this unknown aircraft did not have flashing anti-collision lights (\"strobes\") nor the primary red flashing light, however, it appeared to have one or more very dim whitish lights, not flashing.  as this unknown made a gentle turn to the south, the flight of two helicopters pursued this unknown.\r\n\r\nsince it

drone, except the airspeed of the flight was doing at least 90 knots or faster, so i don't think it really was a drone.  there was no sound of a different engine type other then the two helicopters.  the flight of the two helicopters perusing the unknown disappeared to the sw of my position at a level flight altitude of about 2000 to 2500 feet.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it was still there and it had starting moving. me and my granddaughter then went out to see if we could stay in visual contact. we lost it then found it again while walking down the street, it was huge silent , i at first thought maybe it was a blimp. after we had gotten to the skate park it came into sight as a totally different thing, it was long and seemed to have two different sections but they were connected together. it was just over a tree line, i was not sure if it had changed shape or was it a second ufo. we walked closer, but as we went to cross the road it fell behind the tree,s, we ran around and it was gone.On the way home we meet a man who had seen it from his car and had drove to his mothers home where she say it as well.","distance":"101-500

about 3 in the morning. my wife,daughter and son were all asleep. \r\ni have trouble sleeping so i tend to stay up late. i was in the living room watching u.F.O stuff on youtube like i always do. i found a particular video that i never saw before so started watching it. it was about orion and the belt. the guy went on to say something about a man that worked at area 51 and that the 2 out of the three stars in the belt were 2 types of good being resided and the star adjacent to the two was were the bad beings were.\r\n    i then went to sleep not thinking anything about it. \r\n  \r\n    all of sudden i started dreaming a very vivid dream. \r\n\r\n    i was in my house in saint augastine  and i was trying to escape my house but couldn't get out.I tried to get out the front door but when i opened the door the was a red brick wall.\r\n all of a sudden i heard a voice in my head tell me,\"if you don't be quite you will wake someone up. listen to my voice and i will guide you.\" \r\n\r\n    the voice was very soft and calm. so that's what i did.\r\n\r\n    next part of the dream i was in what seemed to be the biggest airplane hanger i've ever seen. the hanger was completely empty. at this point i had the ability to jump very high in the air. i did that for a minute and then i heard him again.\r\n\" come to the corner of the hanger and i'll show you from there.\"\r\n   \r\n    next thing i know i was having the re occurring dream i used to have when i was a boy.\r\n\r\n     in the dream i was walking up the stairs in my parents house in pittsburgh. there was a beautiful white glow on everything. but this time the dream was different. \r\n    you see when i was a kid and would have the dream i could never get to the top and see what was up there do to fear, so in the dream i would just float off by someone who i thought was my dad.\r\n     now in the dream on the 3rd of sept. was different. this time i was able to get to the top.\r\n    so as i'm walking to the top of the stairs i now hear his voice more clear.\r\n    \" do not be afraid, we are not here to hurt you nor do we want to.\r\ndo not be afraid. listen to my voice. do not be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n    now i'm at the top of the stairs, and the white light was unlike any white i've ever seen. very very peaceful. then the voice comes to me and says,\" we will now show you who we are.\" next thing i know 4 people come into view. they look human but there was something different about them. there was one standing to the right of the one that was doing the communicating and two to the left. their build was fit. almost like a cross trainers fit. they all had the same garments on and it looked like one in the middle was holding a child. he handed me the child and then he spoke, not using words and said,\" again due not be afraid. we are from a different civilization very much like your here on earth. we have family s and children just like you do here also. we are a hierarchy that is govern'd by peace. that is the only difference. there is really not much difference between us and the way we live except that. so due you wish to see are true form?\" \r\n    i said to him yes and he then said again not to be afraid. \r\n\r\n    all of a sudden the humans began to almost dematerialize right before my eyes. what i saw was not as clear but i saw very light blueish silver light beings standing in front of me. i was very calm and i then asked him \" am i dreaming this?\" he said yes. he then said\r\n\" would you wish to see us with your own eyes?\" i said yes.\r\n\r\n    next thing i knew i was back in my living room in saint augustine. i them heard him again, \" do you still wish to see us..\"\r\n\r\n    i responded to him, \" this ins't a dream is it. this is really happening isn't.\"\r\n\r\n    he said,\" yes. do you still wish to see us?\" \r\n    i said, \"yes.\"\r\n\r\n    he then said, \" come to the sliding glass door and open the blinds, again do not be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n     i began to walk towards the door and noticed this very blue dawn dish soap light coming threw the curtain. i slid the curtain to the side and there they were standing in front of me. the main one in the front. one to the right and two to the left. \r\n\r\n     at that point he said, \" we come from the belt of orion. we are a peaceful civilization, but there others out there that wish to harm to your kind as well as ours. you have been chosen for great battle. when that happens we will provide you with the tools you need. we will also fight along side you kind to defeat this harm. these are what the other kind look like.\"\r\n\r\n    all of sudden a hologram of this completely different type of being was in the corner of my back yard. they were kind of hunched over and their color was that of earth clay. reddish brown.  \r\n    the main being asked to battle it. i proceeded too by cloths lining it. as soon as i did that it disappeared. \r\n    \r\n    the whole time i was communicating with them there was a very blue, silverish, white light coming from above my house. \r\n\r\n    the ship wasn't the main focus. the main focus was the bond and how important what was going on about not being afraid. \r\n    \r\n    it was most real thing thats ever happened to me. \r\n\r\n\r\nthere is more but i will discuss that later if this goes anywhere.\r\n\r\n thank you for your time.    \r\n    \r\n  ","distance":"21-100

upstairs porch to smoke a cigarette. it was warm out (fairly typical for that time of year) and there was a slight breeze. it was very quiet out, which was also very typical for that time in the morning.\r\n\r\nas i was pulling out my pack of cigarettes i noticed two white lights, like the ones you would see on a light airplane, moving towards me, but with no sound. the two lights were moving just like you would see on a light airplane being gently rocked by wind as it was landing, but i lived right next to a mountain, and there were only homes in this area, no airstrip.\r\n\r\ni started to panic, thinking it was a light airplane that had lost it's engine and was going to crash land into homes or the mountain. as soon as i went to go inside to grab my phone, the two lights disappeared. once again, there was no sound. i tried to focus my eyes to see if i saw the airplane, or hear anything. \r\n\r\nthen all of a sudden two lights popped back on (no sound), but now they were further back than the should have. i was instantly very confused by this. as i was trying to figure this out, the two lights came back on. then went out again in less than two second. then three lights came on, but now the lights were much closer. then the three lights moved together to my immediate right. i don't mean as though they glided to the right like a small airplane would, but literally immediately right, which is impossible for any known aircraft. \r\n\r\nthen lights came back on where the original ones were, then they went out and lights came on to the right again. as soon as i thought to myself \"wtf is this?\" two lights moved directly towards me then went out and nearly instantly came back on about 200 yards behind where they just were.\r\n\r\ni was frozen mentally and physically. the lights came towards me then back a couple times, then started to move back and forth, then stopped for about five seconds. as soon as i thought it was all over, another set of lights popped on to my left. then the sets of lights came on from left, to middle, to right in order, then switched randomly. right, left, middle, left, right, left, middle, etc. \r\n\r\nafter maybe about 20 seconds or so (it felt quite a bit longer), all 3 sets of lights came on at once, \"flew\" back about 300 yards, merged together then very quickly flew nearly directly up, about 80 degrees (if straight up is 90 degrees). i watched the light go up about as high as an airliner coming in for a landing, then it stopped, changed direction, then flew up towards space in about a second. all of it with no sound.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then
