movie date in carbondale, il heading home to nashville, il when nearing the town of de soto, il we both noticed what looked like car head lights hovering above the center of town, curious we stopped short of entering the town to observe what we were seeing, after a short time the object started to move heading south in our direction. \r\nbeing young and curious i opted to stay put and watch what we were seeing with my head out the window of the car as it passed within a stones throw distance overhead. \r\nmy at the time girl friend was scared hitting me and telling me to take off and get out of there, me being suborn i stayed put instead to try and figure out what it was, puzzled i was not sure what i was seeing as it passed overhead, with the help of town lights i was able to see the bottom and part of the side of the object, it was a dull black triangular shaped craft about 30ft from each point width and length and had no propellers, landing gear, windows or any other feature of known air craft, the object was traveling south at less than 10 mph while over the town. \r\nas the object continued to travel south passing us parallel to route 51 just off the south bound lane, i continued watching and noticed the craft had what looked like a red tail light about a 1/4 the width across the back, it kept traveling south picking up speed as it reached the out skirts of town until it accelerated to unknown speed where i then lost site of it. \r\n\r\nboth myself and at the time girlfriend were completely confused of what we seen, it was not a plane, helicopter, or any known craft of that era, we joked that we just seen a ufo and told friends what we seen later that night, which of course they didn't believe. but one friend noticed a day or so later that a similar object was reported in the local papers stating that it had been seen in illinois and mississippi on that same night.\r\n\r\ni am older now and held onto the story of what we had seen for 34 years, i do not want any public attention from this report, i feel getting it out there might help tie my encounter to another from that location and time frame.\r\n","distance":"101-500

\r\n\r\ni don't know if this is related, but ever so oddly, about 10 mins later, i saw 3 very young children (hardly older than 5-7 years old) racing down the sidewalk (in the dark), on razor scooters, in the same direction that i had seen these lights earlier. - maybe they saw them too, from a bit farther away, and were anxiously racing to discover more about these lights.\r\n\r\ni drove around the neighborhood, and didn't see any other trace of the lights anywhere else.\r\n\r\ni phoned 1 guy in my town, who's mother told me she saw ufos in this area some years ago, and that guy told me that he actually saw the same thing i did, last night (the night before i did), but he claims that the lights that he saw were multicolor.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":79337,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.3087011,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09232016-0005","longitude":-85.218614,"occurred":1474579200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1474595845000,"summary":"Aprox. 7-8 bright yellow lights, in a formation 'similar' to the big dipper (laid sideways) seemingly less than a football field off the ground. 5-6 lights on the lower/2 on top","tags":["ufo","lights","disc"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1474610676964,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Batesville, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:61159"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Christchurch","country":"New Zealand","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my room on my phone when my parents called me down to the lounge and they said to hurry that's when they told me to look out the window. i saw a bright burnt orange light moving in a straight line across the sky. it was moving too fast too fast to be a plane and a helicopter and it only had one light when a plane  as a red or green flashing light. it lasted less than a minute until it went above the clouds.When looking at this i was really happy, my dad and i are really into this sort of stuff. this wasn't the first time my dad has spotted something like this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":79336,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-43.5234544,"location":null,"logNumber":"NZ-09232016-0004","longitude":172.6384554,"occurred":1474489800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Canterbury","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1474593944000,"summary":"Constant glowing light traveling west to east direction then climbed through clouds and disapppered","tags":["flash","light"],"timeZone":"Pacific/Auckland","timeZoneName":"Pacific/Auckland","tweeted":1474608876973,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Christchurch, Canterbury","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:61160"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Alachua","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"July 4th,2016 , while watching firewarks at alachua community center i noticed airplanes circling the immedate area as fire works were expolding in the air. i thought how would do that !

was maybe 5 to 7 years ago in oshawa, ont. i had been meditating and deeply absorbed in the ufo topic at that point in my life and one the popular theories i had read was that many of these beings were telepathic and kind. so naturally i thought i could try and make contact if i broadcasted my intent loud enough. for some reason at the time it was something i really felt that i needed,  was that confirmation of these accounts of ufos and telepathic exchange.\r\n\r\ni went outside and began to meditate under a roof with a sunlight in my family's backyard. it was a clear spring / summer day with not a cloud in the sky. i was meditating to ask for contact or proof. i slipped into a deep state and awoke from it staring up through the skylight. i thought i saw seaguls flying over but then something came over me and i thought one of those shapes didn't have any wings. i got up and rushed out from under the roof and looked straight up and this silvery-white object quickly in a straight path and as if to prove it wasn't a bird it did a quick maneuver where it darted left really fast, and then again to the right and kept moving far away until within a couple seconds it was so far and out of site. it looked like it was way up there in the sky but low enough to see. \r\n\r\ni couldn't believe it, not about what happened but that they would take the time to humor me. i believe since then i have had a few more sightings. because i can't validate the details of the other interesting experience i will quickly state the facts. i was with my girlfriend at the time in the park at night. we were looking at the stars and realized one that looked big and bright like a planet disappeared then again re-appeared somewhere else in the sky or there multiple lights. they were stationary. \r\n\r\nas well, given the circumstances of my first experience i had more meditations with the intent of contact. i would awake to immediately see a \"shooting star\" above me. once i was i was feeling quite emotional laying on the ground in toronto and remarked how the skies had so much light pollution we could never see any ufos if there were any. within a few seconds of that statement a shooting star passed right over. \"ha ha very funny, that's not the point space-guys\"\r\n\r\nanyways i have come to believe there are interesting correlations between shooting stars and the intent to make contact.\r\n\r\nufos and telepathy all in one. i have had a couple other experiences mostly internal that i will keep to myself.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
