brohters where sleeping in the same room. suddenly i woke up and went to open the window, something i was not allowed to do. nor have i ever done it living on second floor.\r\n2. when i opened the window i immedelately looked to my right and saw this huge object.\r\n3. since it was so large i thought that jupiter has fallen. that was the largest planet i knew of.\r\n4. the ufo was hoovering. very slowly moving straigt forward. the shapes is best described as a robot vacuum, or a cheesburger. round. there where windows that where big and bright. there was a blue light and a red light. one was on the top of the ufo and the other one was under. unfortunatley i cannot remeber which was on top.\r\n5.I realised it was not jupiter due to the windows. remember thinking that i should not lean out so much so that they could see me and pull me up.\r\ni also reflected over the windows. our buildings are big with smaller windows, it was the opposite here so i wundered if their constructions where different.\r\ni also tried desperately to wake up my brothers. my brother used to wake up easy, not this time. none of them woke up and i tried real hard. i looked up again and realised that the object would fly over our building. since we have a balcony on the other side of the apartment i wanted to there to wake up my parents and go to the balcony with them. i closed the window and where on my way to grab the nob on the door that was closed, when i heard two words in my head. warning, danger.\r\nso i pulled back my hand and decided to go to bed. i was never afraid or worried. the only thing i still think about is why i woke up and i am not sure if my clock was affected or i being young could not estimated time but it seemed as if over 1 hour had passed.\r\n6.After hearing this message in my head telepaticly i went to bed and fell asleep. my parents did not belive me. this affected me. if my parents dont belive me why should others? turns out a few days later there was an article in gp-newspaper that there where two other witnesses. so i will go and search for microfilms. hopefully i will find the article and send in a copy. need to point out that i am extremly unsure

and 150 feet long.\r\n2. what made you first notice the object? \r\ni just noticed a bright yellow colored light that i had never seen before in the sky.\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\ni thought the object was a large triangular aircraft, or maybe 3 planes flying in formation, but then i noticed that all 3 lights stayed together when the object moved, and that's when i started to think if was a ufo. \r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\nall i could see was 3 yellow bright lights formed as the points of a triangle. i did not see a craft, but it was the 3 lights that appeared to be on the points of a black object.  the object moved extremely fast, best way to describe it is when you're following an airplane, and it disappears behind a cloud, you expect to see the airplane again at an expected location when it reappears from behind a cloud, but this object did not act that way.  the object seemed to move more side to side instead of a straight line.  i saw it appear 3 times.  it appeared, then disappeared, and unlike the airplane, it reappeared where i did not expect to see it. it was like it was moving in 2 directions at once.  it was flying more of a southwesterly direction from my location. \r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\na felt a state of awe. i was driving and tried to follow it.  the object seemed to be heading in a southerly direction toward a small community called board camp or nunley where there have been other recent sightings.  i called a friend, orville murphy, who lives there to see if he could see the object.  he told me later that he did and would report it.\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\nthe object just disappeared while i was trying to keep up with it during driving. i drove 5 to 7 miles trying to follow it before i lost sight of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

road onto a side road heading towards my house, i noticed some extremely bright lights in the distance. i stopped my truck as i could see out across the valley to a ski slope on the far mountain. the lights at first looked like a large plane, but they were too bright to be a plane. it was traveling towards the east, and i was heading towards the west so i continued down the road, and as i went around a turn in the road to the left, the craft seemed to turn and head straight towards me. as i came up to the stop sign at the end of the road about a half of a mile from where i first saw the lights, the craft had came right up in front of my truck.\r\n i was at a t intersection were i had to turn left to my house, and the craft was maybe about 100 feet away just above the tree tops. i grabbed my cell phone to try to get a picture of it, but was having problems getting it to work. i tried several times but it just wouldn't work at all. once it went off seconds after trying to take the picture getting the dash board, then again when i held the phone pointing down at the cup holder trying to see what was the matter. i didn't think the camera was going to work, and the adrenaline was making me not able to think right. i looked back up at the craft and it was moving off to the northeast over top the right side of my truck and disappeared overtop of some houses on the road.\r\n i drove the rest of the way to my house, adrenaline flowing, not being able to believe what i had just seen. as i went into my house i grabbed my cell phone to see why i couldn't get it to work right,

wanted to know if it was a police helicopter.  the helicopter didn't register on the radar at all! this thing catches planes miles and miles away. it was right above us flying low.  sometimes the

and just looked up at the sky. it seemed to still look like night with the moon shining very bright, giving off a green reflective light. at first, i thought it was a star because it was very bright. then it looked as if it was headed my direction so then i assumed it was a plane. my eyes were locked into the sky not really knowing what to comprehend. i lit up another cigarette, and just kept looking at the general direction the object was. the ufo was very far away in the sky, not entirely sure how far but up there in the sky. i found it unusual the object or ufo, whatever you call it, moved into the opposite direction it was headed initially, which was towards me. i knew instantly then was i was looking at but still was confused but i believe in extraterrestrials and would never believe that i had a chance to see this event happen in my life. i called my friend up and told him, we facetimed, and i was like \"bruh, i think i see a ufo, im pretty damn sure\" i changed the viewing from my face towards the object in the sky. i used the moon as another object as my point of reference. from his point of view, he saw the moon and another light as well. i'm pretty sure he couldn't be able to see as clear as i did. i told him i'll call him back and then around 6:23 am i started to take pictures, burst pictures, and videos of my iphone. towards the end i recorded a 15 minute video. i took a lot of photos and videos which clearly shows the object moving in different directions, left to right, right to left, towards me, away from me, going in circles, up and down. also when i was taking some pictures and videos, it somewhat distorted some parts of videos and pictures. also i zoomed in when recording and taking pictures but initially, recording was fine but than almost became static but then reverted back to normal. also the object seemed to disappear and then reappear. i could tell it was trying to hide or tried to camouflage, but i could still tell that the object was there because of its outline, even though it seemed not to appear there, it still had its outline. sometimes the became some sort of ball shape, changed its colors, disappeared and then reappeared. i never took my eyes of it and never stopped recording and taking pictures. towards the end, i thought it disappeared but appeared again and then finally disappeared. for the majority of the time, it was a bright light. also excuse my language in my video, i live in oakland, raised in the bay so my lango is different. also i showed me tenant when he came out to go to work, around that time it was getting light with which it was hard to see with the naked eye but through the camera i was still able to spot it. he also saw the object through my phone when i was recording. hopefully you can just mute some parts of me speaking.

it is hiding in that cloud! quick take a picture! so i did, the first one my flash was on so it flashed back at me, i turned off my flash and took the 2nd and 3rd pictures with no flash. we then continued on our way saying to each other \"well that was odd\". after getting home i forgot about the pictures until the next day, when i looked at them i was dumbfounded! i must say that when i was taking the pictures i was in the passenger seat of my car pointing my camera on my phone out and angled up to the sky through my windshield, (there were no lights on inside my car) the first picture has a small illuminated area, but if you zoom in on the 2nd picture you can see the craft with 6 orange lights, then look below it and a little to the right and you will see 2 areas of illumination.

couple of pictures because it was an odd shape. when i enlarge the pictures it became apparent that there were several shapes in this light/star. additionally, it seemed to move back and forth on some

blue sky.I was approaching the stop light at the intersection of country club and stratford road and slowed down to stop, as the light had turned red.As i looked to my right, i saw a huge green object that was sitting on the ground in a grassy meadow, about a hundred feet from me. the green colour was so unusual, more like a bright neon green, that it was easy to notice it. because it was so bright, i pulled over to the side of the road and just sat there, watching. it was huge and the most beautiful green, a shade of green that i have never seen before.\r\n\r\nafter minutes of watching, at least five minutes of just being astonished, i observed the cars on the road continuing their ride to or from work. at least thirty cars passed within 20 feet of the object without interruption. eventually, there were two or three other cars that did stop at various locations, pulling off to the side. at least one car's occupants got out and looked in the direction of the sitting ufo. i decided to get out of the car, resting my arms on the top of the car and continued to watch. cars were still zipping past,unaffected by the site of the huge, green object. the couple who did stop and were standing watching remained for the duration of time that i was there. they were fifty feet from me and were between myself and the object. they were about thirty feet from the ufo. i was in wonder that more cars did not stop...Did they not see it as i and some others did?\r\n\r\nafter a few more minutes of questioning myself about what i was looking at,a feeling or \"voice\" told me to \"move along\", that everything was alright and nothing to be concerned about...No one was in danger and there is no threat to anyone. i got back to the inside of my car and looked for a brief second or two at the object. i then pulled back into the driving lane, obeying the \"voice\", and proceeded heading home. i was numb, but arrived home safely.\r\n\r\nthis is the first time that i have told the story in a public way, only confiding it to my wife and a close friend. i tell the story now because i hope that someone, in those other cars that stopped, would also come forward. i believe that it was a special event and significant.","distance":"21-100
