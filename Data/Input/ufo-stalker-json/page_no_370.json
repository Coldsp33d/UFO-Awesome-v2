society. i am the current president and john was our former president. we are amateur astronomers and astrophotographer's. he saw an object (gold) blinking in and out at 2:00 am, this morning. disappearing and reappearing in different locations between denab and polaris. at first he thought it was a aircraft but further observations convinced him it was not an terrestrial aircraft. it was zipping about and leaving a light trail. he observed it for approx. 10 minutes. he was using his binoculars. after our meeting tonight weds. 21st 2016, he called me all excited and he could see it again. i ran out with my binoculars but sadly rain clouds were in the way. also trees were obscuring the view. i live at best guess 10 miles away from him. he was giving a blow by blow description of what he was seeing. he got all excited and said there were two of them. then it became three and soon he saw three in a triangle shape (in formation) flying. i got a break in the clouds and did witness two objects streak. we witnessed aircraft enter the area. airline, cessna and lifeflight helicopter. infact he would see a airliner and tell me where the objects were in relation to the aircraft. then he said he could see twenty or thirty of them. i called fran our club secretary who lives in merritt island and asked her to take a look. after i helped her as to where to look from her house, she said she could see bouncing lights. then she said she could see a bunch of them. i asked her if they were flying like a normal aircraft and she said no. anyway the clouds came in and we all went into our houses. i've known john for many years. i've never heard him so excited. i want to go out again tomorrow night to see this but a bunch of us will be at fit for a lecture on the james web telescope. afterwards we might or make it a point to get together friday or saturday night to see if it happens again. during the event, we kept trying to figure out if it could be drones or aircraft, but it appears what was seen will not fit the questions we asked each other.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":79317,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.555267,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09222016-0001","longitude":-81.28775879999999,"occurred":1474495200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1474502898000,"summary":"First

father-in-law, wife, and myself were standing outside of my in-laws house in a small town of about 400.  there was no moon, no cloudy overcast, and the winds were calm.  as i turned to walk towards my car, i noticed a bright light at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  this would not be unusual where we were at because we live close to an international airport and are accustomed to seeing landing lights from aircraft entering and departing various traffic patterns. however, this light appeared to be stationary with no external navigational lights.  it also appeared to be whiter than most of the aircraft normally look. my family also noticed the light.  \r\n     \r\n     approx. 1-2 minutes later the light dimmed from very bright to about the same quality as a star.  it than began a near vertical ascent directly over our heads in what i would estimate was less than 10 seconds, where it was joined by two other objects of the same size and light quality.  the three objects were performing various maneuvers including tight circles, abrupt direction changes, and straight line flight.  the three objects became dimmer and dimmer as they tracked from directly overhead to the southwest where we lost sight of them.\r\n\r\n     i had one similar incident approx. 1-2 weeks before that i dismissed to some unknown anomaly. the first incident occurred exactly the same way but there was only one object total that was observed.  it was also in the direction of the airport along a flight path used for aircraft approach.  however, it was again a very bright light similar to landing lights that went vertically to directly overhead.  \r\n\r\n     i have also previously noticed an object with star like size and light quality that tracks from south to north crossing 3/4 of the sky in approx 20 seconds or less. i have attempted to research any satellites overhead on various satellite tracking website but have had no success find an object that passes overhead at that specific date and time. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

 my mother was not disturbed.  also, i immediately researched rectangular ufos and there was a sighting on november 5 about 35 miles away.  i have not found any evidence online of a similar large transparent portal in anyone's house. i have read about spirit portals but this is a little different in its shape, movement, and deliberate actions.\r\n\r\n   ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":79303,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.12151673483092,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09212016-0010","longitude":-76.32022286362066,"occurred":1446595200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1474453953000,"summary":"The paranormal sighting occurred in my bedroom 2x within 2.5 days.  this is a description of the first event in the middle of the night when i awoke with a rectangle full of light suspended, moving in the air 7 ft high across from my bed.","tags":["sound","landing","ufo","lights","abduction"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1474468817189,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":23,"maxtempi":73,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":13,"meantempi":56,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":10,"minvisi":6,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":23,"maxtempi":73,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":13,"meantempi":56,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":10,"minvisi":6,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"17543","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":322,"locationName":"Lititz, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:61453"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Smiths Creek","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was star gazing as usual early morning before sunrise. i looked up and saw an oval shaped object flying from south to north at what seemed to be a pretty good rate of speed. i watched it for about 45 seconds before it disappeared into the clouds. this is actually the 4th time i have seen these type of objects. this one seemed to be either bigger or closer than the others. just after seeing this unknown object a plane passed overhead. i could plainly see the blinking lights and hear its engines. the object i saw before had no blinking anything and i made sure to note that there was no sound. i suppose it could have been a plane that was so high i could not hear it. but in the night sky, from my experience, you can usually see flashing lights. also, this object was all white and the light was bigger than the lights from an airplane. just a white glowing oval object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":79302,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.93930487337926,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09212016-0009","longitude":-82.58096271406552,"occurred":1474438200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1474445983000,"summary":"Bright oval shaped object, moving south to north, no blinking lights, no sound. plane in area right after, could hear it and could see blinking lights.

blue light appear in the ne over some trees, about 1/4 of a mile or less away. we watched and were wondering what it was, as it held a stationary position. all of a sudden it started moving, slowly bobbing back and forth then it changed color to a pinkish/purple then it would hover then move, then bob a bit then hover then it changed colors to orangish/reddish and it slowly descended into the tree line where we lost sight of it. a minute or two goes by then all of a sudden, further down (or east) the tree line a orange light ascends and hovers a a bit then has a flickering light that is red and then a silverish white. it looks as if it was maybe a plane to the everyday person but it was a glowing orange and it was such a strange hovering bobbing path it was going west on....And i've seen many many airplanes and they don't stop or bob or hover or glow orange. it was absolutely silent as well and a plane that close would of have some sort of noise. it continued slowly west until we were not able to see it from our place anymore. i took a few pictures when it first appeared and then my phone died. i attached what i have. i had just submitted a report last week of a pulsating orange light and this seems to be in the same vein. i have no idea. it was way to big to be a drone and went to far where a controller wouldn't be able to fly it....And i still don't believe either things were an airplane because i have been watching the airplanes for years. i feel excited and feel like my family is being watched in some way. we are all rh-negatives on both sides and have always had strange things happen. and i can't stop thinking the clouds are not what they seem and i watch them constantly as well. sometimes they just don't seem like a real cloud but something trying hard to appear that way.

north east of everett (e.G. arlington, mt.Baker), over north western everett, hat island, whidbey island, continuing onto the pacific.\r\nas i say, i'm a former airforce pilot, so i am exceptional at identifying aircraft - these two were not aircraft per se.  the two were flying in close formation at approximately 6,000-8,000ft, at a constant altitude, at approximately 700-1,000mph.  i was looking from the side up at approximately 20 degrees.  they were either cylindrical or disc shaped, but due the shallow angle (and speed) i could not tell precisely, but were not cylindrical or triangular.  they had no lights, and were a silver/grey metal in the clear afternoon sky.\r\nobjects flying at such speed without any audible sound on a calm afternoon 'caught my eye' the most.","distance":"501
