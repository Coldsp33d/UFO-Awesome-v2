to this.  i went into the house to get my camera.  when i came back it was no longer there. \r\ntoday, 9/16/16, we witnessed the same thing.  we were relaxing outside on our patio and i looked up.  there was a white dot in the sky.  it was pretty much stationary.  i asked my wife to get my camera.  it had not moved and i went back in to get my telephoto lens.  a 55 to 300mm zoom.\r\ni took several pictures of the object.  not having anything for size reference i could not determine the altitude that it was at.  the sky was perfectly clear and what struck me interesting was that there was not air traffic the whole time we were outside.  we were outside for approximately 45 minutes.  we went into the house to prepare dinner.  i checked on it several times and it was still visible.  so the entire time it was directly overhead was probably an hour.  i stopped looking at that time.  \r\n\r\nit was silent and appeared to be stationary.  it did move from the west to the east over the hour we watched it.  if i were to estimate the distance it traveled in that timeframe...I would put it at 1 to 2 miles at the most.\r\n\r\nour dogs were outside with us and showed no behavior change or even sensed what we were seeing.  i used a nikon 12 mp camera with the telephoto to take the pictures.  i probably shot over 100.  it was just so slow moving that i took several in hopes of getting some clear images.\r\n\r\ni thought it might have been a weather balloon.  it moved so slowly that i felt it probably wasn't a balloon.  i am attaching several pictures for your review.  maybe its a balloon...Maybe not.

am et in gardner, ma. we're new to the neighborhood, so we are diligent about opening and closing the door silently as not to disturb the neighbors who often have their windows open during the warm summer months. being a sound engineer, i immediately noticed a deafening quiet that was unmistakable to me. no crickets, no wind, no cars, nothing. \r\n\r\ni whispered \"wow, it's really quiet out here. a little too quiet\". my wife said nothing. it was dark enough so that you could not see the sky behind the trees. i realized we had a huge moon the night before, so the 'no moon' darkness had struck me as weird. elapsed time we were outside was about 2-3 minutes. we were both facing west toward our neighbors house when we both saw a single spherical light appear, with no dynamics in luminosity. nothing at first, then right to full-on brightness. the singular amber / orange glow was the same exact color as the street lamp but much brighter, and the shape was spherical instead of oval, about the size of a baseball or softball. \r\n\r\nthe street lamp seemed to be about 10+ feet directly behind the object we saw. the object kept an altitude approximately 5 feet below the street lamp from our perspective. the glowing sphere never stopped moving at any point since it appeared. it moved at about the speed of a house fly, in a perfect counter-clockwise circle, with a slightly accelerated figure 8 pattern every few revolutions. the object moved in a circle pattern that was about 2 feet in diameter. it left a trail of light behind itself in the same color that faded linearly, but was overrun by the sphere again before the light trail fully dissipated. \r\n\r\ni whispered, \"do you see that?\". standing slightly in front of me, my wife leaned toward my viewpoint on the patio and said \"yea, what is that?\". it seemed that once this object felt us notice it's presence, it disappeared with no fade, instant off and gone. the object was gone even before i could open my camera app. i noticed some trees between the object we saw and our patio. so i waited until daylight this morning to see if it could have been street lamp light refracting off of a bunch of shiny leaves, but there are barely any leaves to obstruct the view apparently. we never saw anything block the perspective of the object while it appeared and danced for approximately 15-20 seconds in total. \r\n\r\nafter it disappeared, i came to my senses and opened my camera app. i was surprised to see a camera flash to our far right from across the street. i was sure the neighbors saw the object too and were taking a photo, while forgetting to disable the camera flash. when i looked over, i saw another 5000k temp flash in the gloss of the neighbors car, but no light hit the street or tree next to where the source would be. neighbors were asleep with all lights off an nobody was outside at all. no activity so far yet tonight.","distance":"21-100

reddish side, but with a white at the intense portion of the flash.\r\n\r\nhad i not been looking in that direction i would have never seen it as it was quite brief.  there were other cars around me on the highway that evening and i am positive someone else had to have seen it as well.\r\n\r\nmy personal view is that i saw an astronomical event of some kind such as a meteor, but i could not see the object as it was behind a cloud.  i am reporting this just so it is on record.  the only strange thing about this, is that i have seen meteors before and they tend to follow a path.  this event looked more like a flash of lighting, but red.  so, it is a bit unusual.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":79265,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.705652399999998,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09192016-0009","longitude":-98.1168531,"occurred":1474068240000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

i could'nt be a lightning cause it was summer and in my city we dont have much cloudy and stormy days. weather was clear and there was no cloud in the sky. 2 or 3 seconds later it came again but it moved (like u couldnt say where it is at a moment) rapidly in sky. it was some sort of round thing that showed light randomly from some spots on it. but it really look like lightning but it was round. i have no idea if it was one object that moved or several objects. there is and airport near us and i see planes almost every time but they fly near ground for landing and u can see them even in nights. but this object was not a plane im pretty sure. after several seconds it just disappeared like nothing has happened. i went to house and didnt talk about it with anybody even my family and i dont know the reson. i knew about ufo's back then, but some thing affected me not to talk about it and im sure it was not me cause i tell every one every thing. after a year or two a friend of mine came to me and i told him my ufo story with no reason! he was the first person who knew my story. then he said yeah i saw a ufo just couple of days ago!He said he saw a pyramid shape ufo in his way to his grand parents home. i have no idea what made me to tell a person who had witnessed a ufo recently. maybe it was an accident. but im sure that ufo had effected me

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello, my name is michael reardon. i'm currently a student at slippery rock university double majoring in physics/mechanical engineering, and this is my ufo story. let me start off by saying: i usually try to rationalize things before i come to conclusions, but i can tell you that this wasn't ball lighting, dust particles, or bugs. i was doing my statics homework at 10:20-10:27pm saturday september 18th when suddenly i notoced a bright dot out of the corner of my eye followed by my neighbors dog barking like crazy. upon noticing these things, i then turned towards the window and saw a very bright, basketball sized, white/silver, beautifully uniquely shaped ufo (orb). this orb was like nothing ive ever seen or experienced before. the best way i can describe it is somewhat angelic. it's shape was mainly spherical, but looked like it was a spherical shape hard to comprehend(like a 2 dimensional creature seeing a 3 dimensional sphere). it's almost like it came from a higher dimensional plane, managed to somehow project to our plane, gave off a feeling of power and love, and was accompanied by a light humming sound. i hypothesize that  mathematically, this type of \"dimensional projection\" can be explained by mapping from a 4 dimensional vector plane(their reality) onto a 3 dimensional vector plane(our reality) (linear algebra transformations). this would allow an orb of possibly a higher dimension to travel to lower dimensions and be visible to us 3 dimensional creatures. the orb's travel path was linear, traveling from the woods (behind the back parking lot of my building) to a lamp post (in the back parking lot). while traveling, it was pulsating. again, i was absolutely astonished by this object. the duration of time it took the orb to travel from the woods to the lamp post was approximately 1 minute. when the orb neared the light post, it caused the lights to dim initially. when the lights brightened, the orb started to almost \"dance\" around them in some sort of way. the object appeared to be metallic and have some sort of electric and magnetic field around it. with that being said, it's almost like the orb was trying to \"charge\" itself by interacting it's magnetic field against the electric field emitted by the light (this is explained by the solinoid-coil experiment to create a charge). as the orb did this it started to brighten. after staring at this orb baffled, confused, and coming to the realization that i wasn't seeing things, i took out my phone and started recording it. after a couple seconds of recording i waved my hands to try to get it's attention. upon seeing me, the orb started to zigzag from one point in space to another instantly (null geodesic) and then suddenly vanished instantly. also, the object appears to disappear traveling to the left. i submitted the original unedited video i took below so if you want to see how the object actually takes off, slow down the time frames in the video at the time gap from 32s- 36s. thank you very much for taking the time to read this and watch the video. and as a junior physics and engineering student i ensure the accuracy of the theory and invite you to look into the physics/mathematical topics after watching the video to try to make sense of these ufos and their nature. hope to hear back from you soon.
