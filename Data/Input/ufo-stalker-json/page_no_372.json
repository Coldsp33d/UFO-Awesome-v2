physics/mechanical engineering, and this is my ufo story. let me start off by saying: i usually try to rationalize things before i come to conclusions, but i can tell you that this wasn't ball lighting, dust particles, or bugs. i was doing my statics homework at 10:20-10:27pm saturday september 18th when suddenly i notoced a bright dot out of the corner of my eye followed by my neighbors dog barking like crazy. upon noticing these things, i then turned towards the window and saw a very bright, basketball sized, white/silver, beautifully uniquely shaped ufo (orb). this orb was like nothing ive ever seen or experienced before. the best way i can describe it is somewhat angelic. it's shape was mainly spherical, but looked like it was a spherical shape hard to comprehend(like a two dimensional creature seeing a 3 dimensional sphere). it's almost like it came from a higher dimensional plane, managed to somehow project to our plane, gave off a feeling of power and love, and was accompanied by a light humming sound. i hypothesize that  mathematically, this type of \"dimensional projection\" can be explained by mapping from a 4 dimensional vector plane(their reality) onto a 3 dimensional vector plane(our reality) (linear algebra transformations). this would allow an orb of possibly a higher dimension to travel to lower dimensions and be visible to us 3 dimensional creatures. the orb's travel path was linear, traveling from the woods (behind the back parking lot of my building) to a lamp post (in the back parking lot). while traveling, it was pulsating. again, i was absolutely astonished by this object. the duration of time it took the orb to travel from the woods to the lamp post was approximately 1 minute. when the orb neared the light post, it caused the lights to dim initially. when the lights brightened, the orb started to almost \"dance\" around them in some sort of way. the object appeared to be metallic and have some sort of electric and magnetic field around it. with that being said, it's almost like the orb was trying to \"charge\" itself by interacting it's magnetic field against the electric field emitted by the light (this is explained by the solinoid-coil experiment to create a charge). as the orb did this it started to brighten. after staring at this orb baffled, confused, and coming to the realization that i wasn't seeing things, i took out my phone and started recording it. after a couple seconds of recording i waved my hands to try to get it's attention. upon seeing me, the orb started to zigzag from one point in space to another instantly (null geodesic) and then suddenly vanished instantly. also, the object appears to disappear traveling to the left. i submitted the original unedited video i took below so if you want to see how the object actually takes off, slow down the time frames in the video at the time gap from 32s- 36s. thank you very much for taking the time to read this and watch the video. and as a junior physics and engineering student i ensure the accuracy of the theory and invite you to look into the physics/mathematical topics after watching the video to try to make sense of these ufos and their nature. hope to hear back from you soon. it's time to prove these things exist once and for all.","distance":"21-100

when she come upon moving objects. she pointed them out to myself and my husband. when i fist looked in the direction i immediately noticed the flashing airplanes but next seeing what she was pointing at. the strangest sky occurrence we've seen. a large mass of many solid lights in the sky all moving together at the same speed in what appeared to be a diagonal line then a shorter diagonal like a v, there were to many lights to count. we immediately starting to illuminate options of what it could be.  there was no flame, no tail, no stream. they were not colored, they did not flash. we saw several planes in the sky that appeared (from ground)  to be flying through the moving objects but at a different altitude. \r\nhow could so many stars fall at same time? could it be warfare? could it be meteor showers? \r\n\r\nafter running in the house to get the other three kids to see the event, they immediately reacted and were scared and upset while the other three of us were still in awe at the unique event we were witnessing. be tried to get video and pictures but it was to far away for an iphone camera. eventually the lite mass traveled to far for us see or went into the clouds as they slowly faded away. \r\n\r\nfollowing i got my laptop and started searching different events photos to see which image looked simalar which eliminated all of our previous thoughts and questions and landed on potential ufo sights. i got goosebumps looking at photos exactly like we saw except we saw many more lights.\r\n\r\nlights were moving from sw to se. \r\n\r\ndid anyone else see this?

aviation convention, i noticed an unwavering, solid orange light moving quickly across the sky from my right to my left, west to east, traveling right overhead. i am a student pilot and aviation enthusiast, and am quite familiar with the appearance of aircraft flying at night; as such, it struck me as very strange that there were no red and green navigation lights, and no blinking strobe. furthermore, the airventure convention shuts down flight operations after dark (except for certain scheduled aircraft arrivals).\r\n\r\nmy immediate thought was that it was an r/c aircraft or quadcopter, but it was silent, and seemed to be flying too high and too fast. i would estimate the light altitude at approximately 1,800 feet. the light travelled in a straight line at a constant velocity. i watched it for about one minute, then i pulled out my cell phone and filmed it for 16 seconds. it was becoming hard to track with the screen of my phone, so i continued to watch with just my eyes until finally losing track of the light. i tried to find it again, but i believe i lost it due to distance. the sighting lasted approximately two minutes, and during this time the light never flickered or changed intensity/color.\r\n\r\ni was quite mystified after watching the light, certain in my belief that it was not a legal/registered flight but uncertain as to what was flying. this is the only flying object that i have seen in my life that i have not been able to identify.","distance":"101-500

colored ufo, saucer shape about 30 ft above him. he told me that he was terrified and dropped the ball and ran in the house. he told his mother about this, and they both went outside. it was gone. he continued to tell me that both his father and his grandfather have seen ufo's and have also been abducted. he let me know that his grandfather had kept a journal on his abductions, and that he was working on getting these from his father, as his grandfather has passed. it kinda sounds like maybe a family type situation? i asked him if he wanted to tell someone about it? he said yes, and that he didn't know really how to find the right person. i attempted to make a report of this before, but i think i did it in the wrong area. would be great if i could help him get to talk to someone maybe with mufon, and get his whole story out. i think this might be a pretty interesting case. anyway, please feel free to contact me, at my cel phone would be best, and i will get the investigator in contact with my friend. thanks so much for your time, and i hope to hear back! \r\nrick m.

had difficulty to fall asleep for some time. after a while though i almost was about to fall asleep when i suddenly felt the strong urge to open my eyes: and there they were: 4 orange-yellow-golden glowing orbs hovering above the lake of zurich!\r\n\r\ni jumped up and rushed to my bedroom window. what i saw was very unusual. the lights were about one kilometer away from me. but they were so big, that they were very clearly visible. no trees or other buildings were obstructing the view on to those orbs since our house is on top of the hill and has a full view over the entire lake of zurich.\r\n\r\ni immediately compared the lights with the lights of houses or streetlights on the other side of the lake. the lights of the 4 orbs were much more bigger than any normally visible light from the other side of the lake. and a lot brighter.\r\n\r\nnext i thought about whether or not these could be helicopters or drones. the 4 orbs were moving from west to east about in the middle of the lake and at a hight of about 200 to 400 meters above the surface of the lake. the orbs seemed to fly in a loose formation. meaning: same direction but not directly in parallel. all 4 orbs were on the different flight level - and seemed to move a bit back and forth (maybe could be described as slightly zic-zac-ing back and forth - but yet all 4 orbs were moving from west to east. the speed of the movement could have been the speed of a helicopter - but the typical lightings of helicopters were missing. i am talking of the position-lightings of planes or helicopters. instead the entire object was glowing in an orange-yellow-golden-fire-like color. also there were no sounds. 4 helicopters fyling in formation in the middle of the night over an open area of a lake would have been making at least some noise - even from the distance i was observing.\r\n\r\nafter about 2-3 minutes one orb after the other just faded out... just disappeared... but not like switching the light off and gone it was - it was more like a slow \"fading out of the light\" over a few seonds for each of the orbs... \r\n\r\nonly then i even thought about the fact that i could have rushed to get my iphone and make pictures - but somehow i did not even think of that during the event. i was too fascinated. then i looked at the watch and it was 00:24 in the middle of the night. so i would guess the time span during which i was making these observation was about 00:20 to 00:24. \r\n\r\nafter this i was wide awake and puming adrenalin because i realized that i had really seen something very very unusual... :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

heard what sounded like a airplane, living by an airport i know that no flights came in so late. so i stood in my driveway to see what kind of airplane it was. suddenly i see a white orb of light going over the roof tops and over the trees. not far behind were 3 black helicopters in a triangle shaped flight pattern following the craft at very high speeds. the craft then made a left hand turn twords the mountains, that's when i see on of the helicopters intercept the craft, getting in front of it, that's when i loose sight of the craft over the roofs of near by houses. but i still stood to listen to the helicopters to see if they are still in the area. i know that this wasn't an airplane or helicopter due to the fact that it had no blinking lights or defined shape, and made no sound at all. when i took my cell phone out to record video the sky was too dark. before hand my cell phone was around 20% about a minute or two before i saw the craft. but when i took it out to try and record the video i noticed my battery life was on 2%. i'm a very open minded person, i've seen 3 ufos in my life time 2 over this summer, so when i first saw the craft i looked to see a defined shape or lights which i seen nether.  i know it was something starange when t saw the 3 black helicopters following. i could easily see the shape of the helicopters because of how clear of a night it was was. i felt curious and wanted to follow the craft but i know no one would believe me, that is why i reported it to mufon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

home from work. i got out of my car and went around to the passenger side to get my bags out. right before i grabbed the handle, i heard what sounded like a big gust of wind approaching. i turned around to look at the tops of the trees on the hill across from the parking lot. nothing was moving. i stared and waited. then a warbling sound (like sheet metal being moved) mixed in with the wind sound. i still stared. then, i realized that the sound was now above the trees, but yet i couldn't see a thing. where this craft was, i could see the stars in the sky twinkling. then, extremely quickly, it was hovering right above me, very close, about 6 to 8 feet above me. the warbling sound stopped by now. i could hear what sounded like air moving extremely fast around it. it was moving from top to bottom, too to bottom, not from side to the other side. still, i could see nothing. it moved up, then back down to exactly where it was, then up, back, then up and....Gone. just gone. i will never forget that. it all happened pretty quickly. i was never scared. i'm not sure why. i think it might be because my mind was going a million miles a minute trying to make sense of what was going on....Why i couldn't see this thing. anyhow, i went inside and immediately checked the clock. 11:20. no time lost. so i don't believe i was taken anywhere. by the way, the spot in the trees

west. they sat there for 5 minutes and then assented back over the city horizon line. during this time i noticed the water below the pier had gotten lighter but i kept looking back at the orbs while taking several shots of this phenomenon. when i got the shots back to the hotel i looked at image 2967 and noticed that something indeed had lit up the water below the pier. it was some strange creature or object that shot water out the back end of it. the water shoots out in spurts and looks to almost defy gravity. with 3 orbs in the sky and something large shooting water out the back it was a strange photograph indeed. i did not hear it shooting the water out because i was at or near the point on the pier that the waves break under the pier. looking at the photo it's clear this was no blow hole from a whale. so there were 2 unexplainable objects in this image.According to my exif data shortly after this thing swan by me going from my left to right the orbs started their assent
