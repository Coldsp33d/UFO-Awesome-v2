gujarat and the country is india. there are no helipads in the city so there are no chance of it to be a helicopter that was trying to land. and trust me i do not know how to use the photoshop. its

(approximately 20+ lights) on the exterior round/oval object and fanished into the night sky in a matter of seconds. just gone in an flash. we stood there in shock for another 60 minutes never seeing the lights/object again... never hearing any sound from the lights/object. \r\n- my father a civil service airplane mechanic for 30 plus years, my mother and myself were and still are completely dumbfounded by what we've witnessed tonight. unexplainable and very eager to find out if others in our rural community witnessed these events tonight. we notified the local police as well as san antonio's fbi office but pretty much got blown off my both persons taking note of what we were reporting. \r\n- as mentioned, we sat outside in a dark field behind our house for another hour never seeing the lights/object again after the final string of lights illuminated the object and disappeared into the night. there was zero cloud coverage in the area and no other planes flying anywhere near the area/path where we witnessed the lights coming in and out of view as well as hovering in a stationary position. what bothered my father was the color of the lights and the speed of the object... believe me, this man knows commercial and military aircraft like the back of his own hand. he's never seen anything like it. all three of us feel frustrated and confused... what the hell did we see. we are located only 25-30 miles south west of san antonio, tx. was this government/military related or something else? we don't know what to make of tonight but we know all three of us saw the exact same thing.

outside to get some supplies from our outside storage and had seen some strange red lights in the sky but i had no phone. by the time i ran back upstairs to get a phone or camera it was gone.\r\n  this time, i decided to take my phone and be ready. i could not see anything really clearly as it flickered and zipped back and forth.I really did not know what i was looking at.I have a series of photos of trails. one shot, however, came out really well. \r\n  at the time i was unsure what i had as i could not clearly see with my naked eye, it was not until i went back inside and looked at the photos in the dark that something odd showed up.\r\n  as far as my feelings, well, i have always wanted to see a ufo and i actually am thrilled that the photo turned out...But at the time i just went back to bed. that how i felt, i.E. not all that thrilled till i looked at it with a photo app and pumped up the lighting.\r\n\r\nnow, this is the really odd part. yesterday i was doing my everyday

several objects casting a trail of glittering sparkling lights like used during 4th of july. the objects speed was incredibly faster than our f-4 phantom jets. it seemed to fly directly over the

was a weekend but i am not 100% sure.\r\ni planned to drive to dixon where my dad and my girlfriend used to live.\r\n(i used to live there too for a few months)\r\n\r\nit was a sunny day (its always sunny there all summer long) and i was driving on the i-80 east towards dixon. a while after i had passed the hills between fairfield and the sacramento valley i noticed something to the right of me. i was like usual driving on the right lane, the slow lane to save fuel and keep my old motorcycle from breaking (it was an old suzuki gs1100e i think).\r\nabout 15-25 feet away i could clearly see two perfectly round shadows next to each other on the ground(in the dry grass). the edges were somewhat blurry and towards the center, the shadow was as dark as the shadow of a solid object.\r\nat first, i was very confused and was wondering if these where birds shadows but after looking up in the sky i couldn't see any birds or any other object.\r\nthe shadow of my motorcycle was to the left of me since the sun was up high to the right. \r\n\r\ni then slowed down and the shadows also slowed down without any delay and when i accelerated again the shadows also accelerated without any delay. they kept the exact same speed as me.\r\nthose were clearly shadows of 2 objects and not some kind of illusion and i could watch them for over 15 minutes while i was driving. shortly before dixon they disappeared....I am not exactly sure when since i also had to watch the traffic and road while i was driving.\r\nthe 2 shadows were a little bit bigger than a basket ball.\r\n\r\nthat time i also was not afraid at all and was watching the shadows somewhat faszinated and as if it was the most normal thing in the world that some type of invisible objects are flying next to you.\r\n\r\nmy motorcycle back then was a red superbike without any chrome on it. so what i have seen was not the strange reflection of some parts of my motorcycle at all.\r\n\r\ni have the feeling that this technology (or creatures) are possibly even older than the universe we know about. i can't even imagine how something\r\ncan turn invisible or vanish infront of you without a trace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
