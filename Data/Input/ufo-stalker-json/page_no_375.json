have filled out this form before and reported my first ufo encounter a while ago. the first time i was extremely afraid.\r\nmy second time was very different and didn't scare me at all. it did leave me questioning my sanity back then however.So i didn't tell anybody about it until i was about 35.\r\n\r\n\r\ni was often going to castle nideggen at night with a friend.We usually just walked around the castle, went on one of the towers to the west and watched the view while talking about mostly meaningless personal things.\r\nwe didn't have contact for a while and didn't go to the castle for about 1-2 years and then he visited me and we had nothing better to do and decided to go to the castle again.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived there it was about 21:40 and already dark outside.\r\n(my friends name is thomas küntzler and he lives in drove too)\r\ni don't recall exactly where we went first in the castle. its possible that we first walked up to the top of the south-west tower (which is the only one intact) and then we walked to the remains of the south-east tower.\r\n(there is a metal gate now and its locked now for whatever reason.)\r\n\r\non the tower (its not very high) we started talking like usual. i was facing my friend and looking to the west. i could see the ruhr river valley from my position and had a good view in the direction of the town of brück and schmidt.\r\n\r\nwhile my friend was talking to me suddenly the clouds lit up in one spot and something came out of it very fast like a shooting star. it looked just like a shooting star but it was closer and brighter. in the first moment i thought it would come down somewhere south of schmidt but then it flew into the ruhr valley which was only 1-2 kilometers away approx..\r\ni was somewhat excited to see that and expected the shooting star to hit the ground where i can see it down in the ruhr valley.\r\nbut when it hit the ground(or the tree tops...Not sure) it seemed to bounce off without loosing speed and it came flying exactly in my direction and vanished about 15-20 meters away from me into nothing.\r\nit was a large ball of light about 10 meters (probably larger) in size.\r\n\r\nthat all happened so quickly that i wasn't really able to react to it at all until the object was already gone. my friend thomas had his back turned towards the ruhr valley (he was facing me) and didn't even notice it. he just noticed that i was looking at him confused and wasnt paying attetion to what he was saying suddenly.\r\nback then i did not tell him(or anybody else) what i witnessed because usually nobody believes you and people later think your some kind of crazy person who wants to get attention. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

campfire.  when we decided to go to bed, quenton threw a bucket of water over the fire, and while we were both waiting for the smoke to clear, we started admiring the view of the stars from where we were.  no light pollution meant we could see more stars than where we lived, and both being lovers of the night sky, just stood there staring for a while.  i saw what i thought at first was a chinese flying lantern, and pointed it out to quenton.  he immediately said to me \"that's not a lantern, its moving too fast\"  so we both stood there and watched it for a few minutes.  it went up and then to the right, very quickly.  then stopped and went left in an almost straight line before shooting down almost to the horizon, and then zig zagging its way back up to almost right above us.  this went on for about 15 minutes.  i tried to get a video of it with my phone, but it was too dark and too far away.  my heart began to beat faster and my breathing got heavier, as i wasn't sure what to say or do about the experience.  we noticed as it was flying around that all the animals went silent, and we couldnt even hear the river flowing that was less than ten feet from our campsite.  as i said before, we watched it for about 15 minutes before it shot off into the distance out of sight.  neither of us could sleep that night, we just stayed awake until dawn talking about it.

house. 10 minutes later i'm watching the stars when a plane heading west catches my attention and as i watch it fly by just past the plane something catches my eye. at first i thought it was just another satellite going by and did think much of it until i notice two more lights following the first. as i watch the three lights heading east i start to make out a dark shape or edge that looks curiously like a triangle. i went to take my phone out to record it but my camera isn't good at night and i didn't wanna take me eyes off it so i stop. still watching it suddenly it changes direction at 90 degree angle and is now heading north till it goes out of view behind a hill/tree. at this point i become overwhelmed with emotion, remembering my cat i quickly rush her inside to get back out to try and understand what iv just seen. now from the time i see the plane to the time i watch the lights go out of view all happens in maybe 10-15 seconds. after coming back outside a few seconds later i kept my eyes on the same area of dark cloudless sky. i'm watching the sky when a small flock of birds flys south, if it wasn't for the full moon i wouldn't have seen them. at this point that reassures me that the first thing i saw was not birds but just raises more questions about what it was. i keep my eyes up, maybe 3-8 minutes later somethings else catches my eye. as i try to focus on it i realize it has three lights as well, triangular shape, and very similar to the first one i saw. it could even be the same one but i can't say for sure. this object with lights is heading west towards the mountains, i'm able to follow it with my eyes for a few seconds till it goes out of view into the darkness of the sky, almost like it vanished. at this point i'm overwhelmed with emotions and excitement most of which is hard to explain but i don't take my eyes off the sky for another 10 minutes. slowly i'm coming to terms with what i think i saw, iv been watching the sky for years with no luck, but tonight i feel like i won the lottery.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

around 12:30pm in the vicinity of the flatiron building. \r\n\r\nthe light was moving westerly to southwest and appeared to be translucent and dully reflective at the same time. it is because of how the light appeared that i took note and began to watch it move slowly across the sky. a few minutes passed and i decided to record the light with cell phone video,for a total of 57 seconds. towards the end i lost sight and attempted to move back into view, but i had lost it. i did not see where or how it disappeared. \r\n\r\nlater that evening, i reviewed the recording and saw multiple orbs which flew in various paths in various directions at various speeds around or near this initial object. \r\n\r\naround 10 seconds into the video a fast moving orb enters the screen from the left (east), travels towards the initial light (west) and then abruptly changes direction back towards the east. \r\n\r\nabout 15 seconds into the video another orb is seen traveling from the bottom of the screen in a straight path towards the top of the screen. it is slower than the previous one. \r\n\r\nafter many personal viewings, i have identified many more recorded light movements and flashes of light throughout. i'm unsure which of these could be digital noise and i lack the software to do anything more than pause. \r\n\r\ni am extremely interested in an analyst's findings and summary of the

grafton illinois on 9/13/16 at around 5:45ish 6. i was hunting in a bluff elevated area when i noticed some of the wildlife in the area acting odd such as bird flocks moving very quickly in the sky like a eagle or other predator was chasing them and they were moving in a rapid flock change,and even a few deer moving quickly in a panicked run along with a strange absence of squirrels and other small wildlife i usually see when i am out hunting i also noticed that my cell phone had a total loss of service although i usually do not get good reception in the area but i do get some service as i have hunted this area in the past with some service i did notice however that my compass on my paracord bracelet was going odd directions instead of true north although this is not a professional compass i have never had it act this way before. after i moved from the spot i noticed this from i came near a bluff over look when i noticed something in the sky that i first thought to be a helicopter in the sky but upon further look i found it to be a large triangle object in the sky that was motionless. there was no noise coming from this object like a helicopter would have and no motion from this and it was a silvery gray and black object with no visible windows i did zoom in with my scope on my rifle but it is not a very powerful scope but i did see some small bright lights on its underside that did blink a few times during this i didnt feel unsafe just really freaked out and confused. after about 10 minutes it began moving silently away from the area towards alton but i lost track of it as it was moving fairly quickly and i could not follow it because of tree line. after i left the area and went back to my car my phone had service again and my compass was acting normal but i did have someone mention seeing something in the sky when i went to get gas in grafton. after i saw this i told a coworker who told me to contact this place.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
