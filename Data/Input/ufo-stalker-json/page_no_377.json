to a military base and we've been seeing the ufos here for years. what makes this time different is they didnt just dart around the night sky like usual, but actually seemed to be looking for something, or someone.\r\n\r\ni remember going outside and looking up at the sky. i saw the orbs, at least a dozen, which is far more than ive ever seen before. they always flash random colors, and sometimes if you shine a bright light at them, their color pattern will change. usually it's red, green, white, blue. this time though, they were darting like crazy around the sky and my boyfriend freaked out. he told me we needed to go, but the car wasn't working right. so i just stood there and stared up at the sky.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i know, there's a blue beam of light and i'm paralyzed. after that, i remember being on a table with these creatures looking at my leg.\r\n\r\ni had been in a terrible car accident a few months prior, and i was told i would probably never walk right again.

needed to come see it. i heard a voice in my head say \"no, we ant let you do that\" and then i blacked out again.\r\n\r\nits been a few weeks now,and while there were never weird marks left on me,i do suddenly have two moles where the aliens cut into my leg. which is doing much better. i dont need to walk with a cane anymore. if i keep improving, i might even be able to walk normally within a year.\r\n\r\ni only believed in ufos after seeing them with my own eyes. now i'm convinced theyre not just a light in the sky. they're here, with us. and theyre not all bad either.","distance":"20

Unknown","city":"Roseville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  i was walking west into my back yard at approximately 8:45 pm not long after sunset, when, for some reason, i happened to look up into the night sky to my right and almost directly above me. i immediately spotted some movement there which i assumed at first was just two airliners which were flying directly past each other, a common sight in my area which is in the flight path of a major airport. there was no discernable sound above the background noise of this small suburban city, just the movement of the aircraft accompanied by the flashing and constant-on lights typical of commercial airliners, or so i thought at first.\r\n  within seconds i quickly realised that i was witnessing a very unusual event, an event that never occurs in commercial aviation except in very rare cases of extreme emergency or during aviation air traffic control mistakes,  mistakes that almost always lead to tragic aviation accidents. a commercial airliner was being intercepted in a near head-on collision by what appears to be a ufo, their crossing distance is well under under the faa mandated 7 mile minimum, and both aircraft appear to be traveling at the normal cruising speed for commercial airliners. the ufo then passed directly below the airliner at an estimated distance of around one mile.\r\nthe commercial airliner was traveling west northwest at an estimated cruising altitude of 18000 feet when it was intercepted and passed by the ufo which was flying at an estimated altitude of around 15000 feet in a dead west to east direction. the ufo then abruptly changed its flight path two or three seconds after it passed directly under the higher flying commercial airliner, turning 30 degrees south to a new heading of east south east. \r\nthe commercial airliner was displaying the industry standard nighttime running anti-collision lights; white strobes, red constant-on lights, one on each wing and one on the front port side, and a green constant-on light on the starboard front side of the aircraft. \r\nthe ufo on the other hand was displaying decidedly non-standard aircraft lighting of a type that i have never seen before. there were no flashing white strobe lights like aircraft normally have. the only lighting the ufo prominently displayed was two red lights, one to a side, which slowly pulsed off once every three seconds. the red lights were large but pale in appearance compared to normal aircraft anti-collision lights. there was also a small pale blue light located at the front and/or rear of the ufo aircraft.\r\ni watched the ufo fly off into the distance until it disappeared, that is when i barely noticed the pale blue lights on the craft.\r\n\r\nthe weather was very clear, cool at 78 degrees, and dry, especially for a late summer night, due to a cold front that moved into my area a few days before this event. visibility was unlimited at 35 miles or more, there were no clouds in the night sky to obstruct visibility, just an extremely thin and light city haze, and the quarter moon was not due to rise until a few hours later. the wind was completely calm and still. excellent viewing conditions overall.\r\n\r\ni also witnessed four additional ufo's on this same day a half hour earlier. i have been seeing these same types of ufo's many, many times in my area since at least 2006 or earlier. these other sightings have also been reported to mufon.\r\none of the four ufo's was a very large golden glowing orb which was easily visible in the near distance, another was also golden in color but it was \r\nlocated at a further distance immediately behind and to the right of the nearer and larger golden glowing orb, and this one was pinpoint bright and fluctuating in an arc-like appearance and brightness. the other two ufo's were smaller in size and dimmer in appearance. they had large golden constant-on flood lights at the front, and a constantly flashing bright white strobe light located in the rear. one was hovering stationary near the closer large golden orb like ufo, and the other one was traveling from the east over lake st clair westward towards the larger stationary hovering golden orb like ufo.\r\n\r\ni have witnessed many other near head-on collisions of aircraft before. this occurred when all of the air traffic control system computers went down for the entire east coast of the usa, and control was not reestablished until hours later when all air traffic control was re-routed to the control systems which were located in the central or southern usa? this event resulted in many near head-on collisions occurring in a brief period of time between commercial airliners, which i personally witnessed, over a period that lasted at least two and one half hours, until control was reestablished by the faa.","distance":"Over One

flame and oddly didn't give off any smoke. as i got closer it was descending to the south and headed into a tree (pine). i was approx 15-20 away when it settled about 3/4 up the tree. i inspected it and seen no appendages as i was suspecting maybe it was a chinese lantern. it was simply just a ball of fire. i grabbed my phone to take a photo/video but i was at an angle now that the roof and a-pillar of the car was obstructing my view and frankly didn't want to get out so i didn't look like an idiot if someone was watching and it turned out to be something explainable. i then took a moment to look around in case it was a goof.  no one was outside.  i also listened to hear if people were talking or if a stereo was on. dead silence. i then proceeded home continuing to try to keep and eye on the flame which eventually went out of view. pulling into the driveway, i wasn't as concerned with what i just saw but worried about the tree catching fire and felt i had a responsibility to monitor for a fire since i seen no one else around. i decided to drive back to the tree and when i got there the flame was gone and figured it went out. also, there was no sign of burnt markings on

relatively metropolitan area in houston texas.\r\n\r\nmy fiancee noticed something hovering in the sky and alerted me. at first i was unable to understand what she was exactly talking about. henceforth she pointed up at the sky and i had noticed exactly what she was talking about. \r\n\r\nwhat we both witnessed was a hovering object that did not look logical. we could not exactly see the shape of the vehicle but we did see what appeared to be lights that may have been on the corners of the vessel.\r\n\r\nlike a plane, jet or helicopter type aircraft, we both saw lights that were logically positioned on the vessel.\r\n\r\nnevertheless the shape or style of the vessel it appeared as if they may have been at the tips just like on the aircrafts i had mentioned previously.\r\n\r\ncollectively we do not know how long it had been hovering there before we noticed it. once we noticed it we saw something that seems very out of place.\r\n\r\nneither my fiance or i are experts when it comes to aerodynamics, aircrafts,or ufo's.\r\n\r\nwhat we did see was something very unconventional e out of the ordinary. i have never seen any sort of aircraft hover in the same position like that with no sound and with the type of lights that were emanating from the vessel itself.\r\n\r\nas i instructed my fiance to retrieve her mobile device to take video i was in the position to take a still shot captions with my mobile device. as she retrieved her device the unidentifiable flying object decided to descend in a fashion that i have never seen something move through the air before. during this altercation i had taken three or four still shots with my phone zooming in trying to get the best photo possible.\r\n\r\nafter she retrieved her device in our home the object decided to descend in a manner that i have never seen something move through the air like before. she was very upset that she was not able to capture the moment on video and at that point in time relied on the fact that i had taken still shots with my own mobile device.\r\n\r\nas i attempted to retrieve the images that i know that i've taken with my mobile device, i noticed that they were not able to be retrievable.\r\n\r\ni found that very odd considering that i can use my mobile device like the back of my hand.\r\n\r\nwe would never go this far to report something like this if we didn't feel in our heart of hearts that we had witnessed something extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\ni hope that our testimonial is useful so this referendum.\r\n\r\nwhat we've witnessed tonight was something unexplainable and completely real.\r\n\r\nwe are open to any sort of comments or questions that many of you would like to ask. as all of you, we would like answers for ourselves.","distance":"Over 1
