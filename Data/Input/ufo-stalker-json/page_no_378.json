surrounded by all directions with the existing appearance of what are very clear to be ufos. what first caught my attention, was my security cameras started acting up. they would exchange motion detection from the front of my home & then sense the back yard motion off almost directly after , if not at the same time. it took me a good two days before realizing it was due to what seemed to be spit lights at the time, scanning the city/neighborhood. that's when i also noticed the the objects in the sky. at first i thought drones. the second night, the kore later it got, more appeared in the area. all a sudden, it was like spot lights coming from about 5 of them. each light was at a different level of brightness. a friend & i noticed that they would scan the nreighbourhood, rehab stop directly in my windows as if they seen us. we watched until they basically disappeared from thin air. the following night, my security camera caught many orb figures  that detected my motion cameras off to record. this happened repeatedly all night long. so basically i've been extremely freighted. i've been completely invaded. over the duration of about 4-5 days now, they have made their reflection very noticeable on just about any object that can catch their reflection inside my home. i have my video recordings of these object both inside & outside my home. my friend went home two days ago. the day she left & i returned home alone.. i opened my door to literally thousands of microscopic pieces of the ufos. it looked as if dust particals were falling from all around my kitchen window. the only way i was  able to notice them is due to the color change if blue, red, green & clear.  i then began my way upstairs to my bedroom whereby then discovered them throughout my entire room. i have taken footacge of them each day, as each day they have made themselves much more viable to my eye sight. last night was the second night inward home alone & when i had received the most definable body figure. i have been really scared as the more i research, i've seen the attacks they have had on family's including children. i will send a video from one of my first sightings & a photo from a screen shot i had taken during a live stream video i took.  last nights live stream took place on september 9th, 2916 @ about 11:00pm. \r\n\r\nplease be sure to contact me as soon as possible. i'm very worried about abductuction considering they have already completely invaded my home. they are  everywhere & so many of them. you also are going to watch to view all the recordings

town of high prairie alberta .In the early evening around 7pm with two cases of labatt's blue beer to drink .We sat down by a power pole at the edge of the riverbank 30 ft from by the bridge's eastern edge in the grass.We drank and joked around for awhile  i was getting concerned that they were getting too loud so i took a beer and went and sat on the bridge to keep six if any cops should show up.At this time i opened my 3rd beer and sipped on it.I\r\nwas looking towards the road bridge just north ahead of me about 300 ft or more .I was looking into the night sky.I was admiring the stars when all of a sudden in the top left front of my vision i seen a triangular shaped dark object that had a orange dome in the center of its underbelly flew past me and swooped down and around the river bend giving off a flash of white light heading in a southwesterly direction and was gone. this only took 2 or 3 secunds .If i wasn't looking in that direction when i was i would've missed it and saw nothing.I didn't hear a thing and it was fast and like in slow motion at the same time. i ran to my friends and asked them if they  saw anything just now and they said no probably because they were too busy horsing around and i didn't bother telling them what i saw or anybody else that night.Thinking back on it, i think  the ufo was following the river and mapping it for whatever reason i don't know. i mean what else it would be doing in a small town like h.P.? right.Well that's about it.I know nothing special happened but what the hell was it doing there in the first place just passing by hoping not to be seen by anyone following low above the river? well i believe in ufo's now after this experience that's for sure and if anyone don't believe me then they can take a hike because i know what i saw no-matter how briefly it was and i wasn't drunk either.I would like to send a drawing and photos ot the area i saw this thing at but don't know how at this time. thank you for reading my

constantly watch traffic behind house and regular incoming flights to stl lambert international airport. suddenly noticed unusual green light between trees on horizon to the north, roughly the size of a bright star or venus. thought it was incoming aircraft landing lights but after watching for 3-5 seconds, realized it wasn't moving. so, i was curious as to what it was and continued watching. after another 2 seconds i witnessed the green light moved to the west slightly, opposite of normal path of incoming flights. i thought maybe it was a helicopter. still curious though, i kept watching and saw the light turn from green to red, then back to green, as if the object was rotating, while it was moving west from the original hovering position. as it returned to the green light, it dipped slightly on the horizon, then rose back to its original altitude, hovered for 1 second, then ascended a couple degrees. at this point i knew i was witnessing something very unusual and got chills. after ascending, the light moved west again about the length of your index finger held at arms length. without stopping, the light descended immediately from the westward direction and disappeared behind the tree line at the top of my subdivision. i waited 20 minutes for the object to reappear, but did not see anything again. based on helicopters and planes regularly seen in the area for last decade, i estimate distance of like-sized object with similar lights to be between 5-10 miles north of my location. if the object was larger, it was most certainly farther away and its movements much faster than normal craft. i am reporting this today to help corroborate any other witnesses since it happened on a friday evening near a major interstate interchange in sight of anyone traveling north on i-64 near i-70.

the sky when it's clear due to seeing strange things recently (my daughters and i went to their school playground last week and stayed until it got dark. my oldest saw some lights in the sky and said momma what's that? i looked up and saw 3 bright white lights starting to separate from each other and go in 3 different directions. one moved straight up in the sky, another moved south east and another northwest. not a single one was blinking and they were moving much faster than the airplanes in the area. i couldn't tell if they made a noise as there were airplanes in the area that i could here, all of which had blinking red/green lights of course.) i noticed the object tonight coming from the sw and kept an eye on it because of the unusual brightness and triangular v shape. it was like it was made of a bright red light completely. it didn't look like there were multiple lights. i also noticed the orange-red trail was not lagging behind like planes in the area normally do. it stayed at a consistent distance the entire time i could see it. the object moved ne at a fairly high speed, faster than the planes in the area for sure. i thought it was a commercial plane at first, but quickly ruled that when it was not blinking and when it came directly overhead and i could see the odd trianglular v shape. not sure exactly what time the sunset was, but the trail could've been orange-red  colored due to the sunset. i watched the object until i couldn't see it anymore with my eyes only. i didn't have binoculars handy. 5 of us total witnessed it and are clueless as to what it could be! i tried googling it like i do with just about everything else i see (the 2 green fireballs i saw last year a week apart from each other were pretty crazy looking, but they're somewhat common as far as i could find in my googling them.) totally would've recorded if i had my phone outside with me!! i'm hoping someone else noticed it as well!!
