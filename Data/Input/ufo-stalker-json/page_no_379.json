was, maybe a ufo. on a trip back from wva to florida, i was returning from seeing my mom in the hospital in wva., it was late at night probably around 11pm while driving back through alabama/tennessee going south on the interstate highway i-65. what occurred was that an extremely bright light that reminded me of a locomotive train light appeared just behind me about 100 yds quite suddenly and it followed me at the same pace i was driving around 60 mph, its movement was so strange because it didn’t fluxuate with the contour of the road and i took notice there was no sound as if a helicopter. i wanted to alert my wife, who was sleeping beside me in the car, but i felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control, so i kept my head straight ahead or forced to look straight ahead, whatever. i even tried to take my foot off of the accelerator, thought again and again to wake my wife but the only thing i could do was use my eyes to look in the forward direction and glance as well at the rear view mirror from time to time or maybe most of the time, to keep track of its movements or was this what i was supposed to do, who knows, last of all i also noticed my palms were sweaty on the steering wheel but i couldn’t take them off to wipe them. it seemed like for hours this occurrence was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever i don’t really know. i took notice as well, there were no cars in either direction the total time this was occurring, nothing seemed to be happening until this thing was gone and how did it go away well, poof the light was gone is the only explanation i can come up with. when i was able to make movements with my body the first thing i did was move my head then wipe my hands off then i stopped the car on the side of the road got out and looked all around including the night sky, this caused my wife to wake and you can only imagine what she thought and said when i told her of this occurrence, finally i noticed life and back to the now time zone, cars drove past in both directions, so tell me did my time stop or what, now doesn’t this event seem strange to you but anyway the years have passed and from time to time i try to take myself back to those memories and ask myself, why me. i have never felt comfortable talking about this subject. before this occurrance i was just a radio operator working in communications, but after this episode my life literally changed around me, it steered me into the defense electronics world of repair and new products and reverse engineering projects through out my career as well as traveling into far away lands. does this seem normal, not to me. i'm just a small hands on tech with an amazing career in communications missiles, aircraft, ships, subs, radar, lasers, flirs, gps, fiberoptics, test equipment, etc., and traveling. maybe they wanted me as a remote viewer because i have an unexplained solid bump on my forehead just above my left eye with no scar, who knows with 16 countries under my belt. finally i'm retired and sitting in my rocking chair waiting impatiently for the end to come, good luck.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

overhead, but at a very high altitude. at first she thought it was a satellite based on the intensity.  we regularly observe the iss and the lights were about the same magnitude as when the iss first becomes visible, or about that of a medium magnitude satellite.  however, we quickly ruled that out because there were 2 lights flashing in close proximity.  after watching for about 7-10 seconds the lights appeared to move vertically and faded out.  i would estimate the lights were seen approximately 90 degrees from the horizon.\r\n\r\non friday september 9th i walked out to my car, again right at 6am, and because of the lights from the day before i looked up.  i was shocked to see the lights again, but this time there were far more of them in a line.  they were again at approximately 85-90 degrees above the horizon.  unlike the lights from the day before which appeared to be independent, the lights this time appeared to be fixed on a structure.  i could not see the structure but it looked like a sliver of deeper black than the still dark sky.  (at this time of morning the sun is still well below the horizon and the sky is still very dark)\r\n\r\nas i watched the lights it did not look like there was a pattern to the flashes, they appeared to flash more randomly.  i can’t be certain but the object looked like it tilted along a vertical plain as the lights seemed to compress at an angle at which point they faded out.  total observation time was 15 seconds.\r\n  \r\ni have a lot of experience with aviation and i can say for certain this was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything of that nature.  i’ve seen military jets on maneuvers over a bomb range at night, and all kinds of aircraft both civil and military.  i also have spent many hours stargazing.  i have seen hundreds of satellites, meteors, space shuttle fuel dumps, and other manmade things in space.  this was unlike like anything i have ever witnessed, and was not the flash of spinning space junk.  i’m an open-minded skeptic.  to think we are alone in the universe is ignorant.  i have no idea what it was that i saw, but i know i’ve never seen anything like it before.\r\n   \r\ni would guess that the altitude of the object was suborbital, but well above 20,000 feet.  an airplane passed within approximately 20 degrees of the object along the path commercial aircraft fly over my house so i am guessing that plane was between 20,000 and 30,000.  the lights were very obviously not aircraft anti-collision lights.  they were one color, not red/green and were in a sting.  they also did not move, but remained stationary.  i don’t think i would call it a hover, more like an absence of movement, or a slow drift, until it tilted on the vertical plain.  \r\nat the time there was zero cloud cover, and the object was in proximity to the pleiades.  due to the clarity of the conditions i could easily see 7 stars in the constellation.  the conditions on both days were identical.

because there were orbs of light shape shifting. i knew what it was right away. i felt static electricity on my face. i felt something come out of my chest. black fibers that had static electricity and a very sticky red substance that morphed. it was hard to pull it off my chest. it had some sort of magnetic connection. it felt like i was pulling invisible glass energy out of my chest.\r\n\r\n the orb was small at first in the sky. it was alternating between different colors of light shape shifting.  i went back into the house and that's when the weird fibers came out of me. then i went back outside and it had changed directions. this time it was much much closer to me and i was thrilled. i felt more alive and energized then i have in ages. i wanted to say thank you to it. i felt a lot of gratitude. i felt time was frozen. i couldn't stop staring at this light. my fiance was with me and he saw the entire thing. he fell asleep while i could not after that. during the event he said he felt an aura of energy and he felt it in his chest. he knew nothing of the strange fibers or clear energy i had felt. i'm pretty sure he might think i'm nuts if i tried to explain to him. he said what is that when he saw the mark on my chest. i said not sure no biggie and he seemed a little off. \r\nthe object in the sky was like a bunch of orbs of light in the shape of an octagone shape shifting colors then morphing... i then saw a huge ball of light around these lights. beams of light shot down and it was scanning something. it was a very intense light. it appeared enormous in the sky. it looked like the size of six blimps made of shape shifting light orbs. the lights sparkled, strobed, changed shapes from orbs to a ball of light then into a triangle shape and back to orbs of light strobing again. its tough to explain. i'll have to have my fiance try to make a report as well. i lost sight of the object when i sat down to type up this report. i kept track of it for nearly two hours. it was strange how it went from small to enormous and lower to the ground... back to higher up. it hovered for a very long time and i promised it i wouldn't take pictures or video as long as it would stay. when i went to make a report i read that photos are mandatory and video so i went back outside and took numerous photos and videos. i felt guilty i went back on my promise to this energy. it pulled away once i brought the camera phone out. i have a very loving connection with whatever this is. it makes me feel alive and gives me purpose. it will appear as long as i promise no video or photo... i still feel guilty i went back on that promise. who knows tho maybe its just a satelite. i don't think so tho.. i know it communicates with me via electromagnetic frequencies. i know that because a bunch of static electric elastic type things came out of my cuticles and chest. i also felt a very sticky substance cover my face and hands. it almost feels like  i have really really soft skin but its more of a film on my skin then anything. very strange. i hope to see it again and i know you will see it as long as you stay positive and ask the universe to share this gift with you. i feel sad now that the sun is coming up and it is going further and further away. it just keeps getting smaller now. it disappeared around 6:15 am. i have to get some sleep now. thanks for reading about this. i have to email the video and the pictures seperate because my cell phone keeps freaking out and it wont let me upload to my computer. very strange. i'm' going to get some tech support here then will be sure to follow up with footage and photos.

of the lights remained the same and never varied.\r\n\r\n5. immediately upon spotting the lights i called my husband's attention to them. his vision is such that he was unable to witness anything. i was excited to see something in the sky and keep looking at them until i lost sight of them. i was initially seating and stood up to point out to my husband where they were. i called out/narrated what i was seeing. as they moved farther away i stepped back and then on tip-toe to see them until losing sight. the entire episode lasted probably 15-20 seconds. after losing sight of them we both sat down and recapped what had happened. i then went inside to check flightaware to see if they were on radar - they were not. i made notes of the event. and got metar from kpie which is 5.5 miles se of our house. \r\n  report as follows: metar kpie 090253z auto 10012g18kt 10sm clr 28/23 a3004 rmk a02 ltg dsnt sw slp173 60000 t02830233 51015\r\n\r\n6. the objects disappeared momentarily (1 second) and reappeared before finally disappearing in the ssw. i believe that there was very low clouds - scud - that was developing which is what caused the intermittent visibility before finally obscuring my view.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

(i estimate the highway is about 80 to 150 feet higher than the water.) the object may have been a helicopter, however, the weather was very marginal for any aircraft operations because of the intermittent rain. \r\n\r\nthe impression i got was, that it looked like a head on view of a huge c-5a transport aircraft at about 300-500 yards, where the fuselage was a glowing red ball, and a glowing single white ball was slung under each wing! i only saw this for about 4 to 6 seconds because of all the trees in the way. i should have gone back and looked, but i only pulled off about a mile later to try and get another glimpse but saw nothing. i was too tired to investigate further.\r\n\r\ni am 74 yrs old and i am a pilot and i have good eyesight. i had not been drinking but i was tired from a long 7 hr drive in stormy weather. however, i did see each of these things and all may have an explanation. but it was quite unusual to say the least.

  there it was hovering right in the middle of the highway!  it was a very shiny silver metallic disc hovering right above the road.  \r\n\r\nwhen we first noticed it, we were heading toward it as we were going east.  we were about 2000-3000 feet away and heading right at it.  it could not have been much more than 80-100 feet above the road in our eastbound lanes.  \r\n\r\nthere were a few other cars on this highway going in both directions but not too many.  i immediately glanced at other cars to see if they were seeing the same thing we were seeing, but no other cars were close enough to us to get anyone's attention.  we did not see any cars react to the ufo's presence which surprised me because i expected to see people pulling over by now.  this is about the point where things get a little strange.  \r\n\r\ni immediately focused back onto the craft and remember thinking how special this sighting was, so i wanted to look for any details i could see.  i purposely focused on the edges of the disc and they seemed to be fuzzy or oscillating because i could not get clear vision of the edges of the disc shaped craft.  the rest of the craft was a typical disc shape with a slight domed top just like i had seen in movies.  the fuzzy edges was what was amazing to me at the time.  this is also about the point where i remember not being able to speak to my wife.  i literally tried and wanted to yell out to her something like \"are you seeing this?\" but i could not talk.  it was like the thing had me in a hypnotic or trance like state at the time.  i knew she was looking at this thing too because i could tell in my peripheral vision she was staring at it the whole time too.  i later confirmed with her that she too was being affected by this thing and she could not talk or shout over to me either.  it was like it had a \"lock\" on us.   \r\n\r\nthe other very strange thing is here i was driving down the highway at the time about 65 mph and i had no fear of wrecking my vehicle or even having to pay attention to the road.  it was almost like time slowed down and things appeared like it was slow motion.   as we approached this disc, i had locked my eyes onto it for what seemed like at least 1 full minute (trying to be accurate here).  \r\n\r\ni remember we were getting closer to it as it got larger as we approached it.  as we were about 800-1000 feet away from it, it decides to finally move.  it first moved up slowly and gained a little more altitude.  it then slowly started to go south and hovered south until it was well off the highway.  about the time i passed it, it was due south of us.  but still only about 2000-4000 feet away from us and still pretty close to the ground.  maybe 100-150 feet off the ground. \r\n\r\nabout the time we passed it, is when it freed the \"lock\" it had on us from speaking to each other.  my wife starts yelling at me to turn around and go after the thing.  i am, at that point, still in a state of shock and still trying to catch the last few glimpses of this thing before it was gone.   \r\n\r\ni started leaning over in her lap to look out my wife's window at it since i knew we would lose sight of it very soon since i was still heading east.  it flew slowly over a rise in the terrain and i could no longer see it as it was southwest of us by then.  \r\n\r\nit wasn't like it flew off fast at all.  it just gradually moved over to that rise and it was still over there when we lost sight of it.  my wife and i had a nice long debate about whether we should find the nearest exit and try to hunt the thing down.  after the trance-like state it had us in, we both agreed it would be wise not to try to confront it any further and so we proceeded down the highway to our original destination.  we have some regrets we didn't exit the highway to try to go find it.      \r\n\r\nthat is what happened to us many years ago in 1994.  we both are still together and she and i always talk about our amazing sighting to each other.  we are sorry we did not report our incident more closer to the day it happened, but we remember it very well and we will never forget that day.  ever.
