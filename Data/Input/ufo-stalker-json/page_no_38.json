about 10pm-midnight, pehaps. my girlfriend and i were camping on the top of a small mountain range outside of victoria b.C. canada.\r\nwe were sitting on the tailgate of my truck, looking east at the big cheesy pre-autumn full moon rising over the mainland. when we observed two round glowing balls or orbs floating around above the mainland and with the moon in the background, which looked exactly like the moon at the time but much smaller. they were bright and orange too, they danced around a little and then one went north along the coast and one came west, towards us.\r\nas both balls left each other they turned white, a bright consistant glowing white. the one coming west flew very slow and on sort of a glide or floating straight path, about maybe 300 feet up. it flew over the saanich peninsula and seemed to be probing the urban pockets on it's way through, it then turned north and continued on past pat bay and towards the malahat hwy. then it crossed the inlet and headed west directly for the heavy forrested side of the moutain and the whole time maintaining the same speed pretty much, which was around 40-60 kms an hour maybe.\r\nthe object was anywhere from the size of a large vehicle, such as a big truck. to the size of a small to medium sized house maybe and it definitely had purpose and was aware of where it was going, i had no idea if it knew we were watching it or not.\r\nit proceeded to fly directly into the thick forrest of the side of the range we were on, about 300 yards away from us max. i could pin point where it went in within 50 yards either way, i said to my girlfriend; we should go check it out. she didn't want to or me to alone in the dark, which made sense. i felt no fear or aggression at all though and we camped there anyway, i jokingly said to her.. something about long fingers and green men and we slept fine that night with no known disturbances or inturuptions.\r\nthe next day we packed up and left because we had to work on the monday, not because we were freaked out or anything. \r\nin fact i don't know why i have not gone there with a friend to check out the area, i'm an adventurer at heart and physically fit enough to travese the terrain. it may be on crown land or even someones property, there is a house nearby. but it's like i just forgot about it and not totally forgot, but didn't care enough to go back with a buddy in the daylight and check it out..\r\nwhich is strange, for me. i saw a youtube video of mount adams in washington, with an opening in the side of the mountain.. yeah that one and it inspired me to finally write this, so if anyone wants to go there lol.. let me know and i'll be more than happy to show you, it's about a 20 min drive outside of victoria.\r\nthis is the first time i've repoted anything although i have seen many different ufos, including another orb that year in the fall over the western mountains near kamloops b.C.. again with my girlfriend at the time and on my way back from working in alberta, the firt time i saw one i thought.. someone else had to have seen that, my second thought was.. \r\ni can't tell anyone, because they'll think i'm crazy. probably typical and i don't care now, i know what i've seen. my eyes and mind don't lie to me, besides they are here and everyone is seeing them. i don't know why they are fooling around anymore and don't just come out with it already, it's silly and ridiculous and most of us are wise to the fact by now and most would be able to handle the news just fine, in todays day and age. \r\nit's like trying to hide the fact there's no santa clause to a kid whos 12 or something and knows better, who's the more intelligent of the two parties and who looks like an idiot.? really..","distance":"101-500

saw aircraft lights on my left, which were decending at around 1500ft, landing west-east at heathrow.\r\n\r\ni looked again and saw what i thought was another plane with flashing lights however this craft was closer to me, much lower and travelling east-west.\r\n\r\ni observed the craft which flew across the fields in my direction and then banked left to fly parallel with the road i was travelling along, directly left of me. the car was travelling at around 50mph and was moving alongside the craft for quite some time.\r\n\r\nat one point the craft was so close i could see that the shape was triangular, with bright white lights at each point. i could see that the craft seemed to have a dome underneath its centre, i noticed what looked like gold coloured foil around a domed part underneath that glowed slightly highlighting the gold coloured material. i also recall that the craft seemed not to be flying flat but leaning slightly to the left for some time. i couldn't make out much at he top of the craft\r\n\r\ni remember that there were red and blue flashing lights around the base of the circular centre exactly like the strobing lights on an airplane. i recall there seemed to be more blue lighting more than red. the craft seemed solid and slightly reflected the glow from roadlights. it seemed to be a matt grey.\r\n\r\ni tried to take some pictures through the side

passenger in a car from windsor towards maidenhead. i saw aircraft lights on my left, which were decending at around 1500ft, landing west-east at heathrow.\r\n\r\ni looked again and saw what i thought was another plane with flashing lights however this craft was closer to me, much lower and travelling east-west.\r\n\r\ni observed the craft which flew across the fields in my direction and then banked left to fly parallel with the road i was travelling along, directly left of me. the car was travelling at around 50mph and was moving alongside the craft for quite some time.\r\n\r\nat one point the craft was so close i could see its shape was triangular, with bright white lights at each point. i could see that the craft seemed to have a dome underneath its centre, i noticed what looked like gold coloured foil around a domed part underneath that glowed slightly. i also recall that the craft seemed not to be flying flat but leaning slightly to the left for some time. i couldn't make out much at he top of the craft\r\n\r\ni remember that there were red and blue flashing lights around the base of the circular centre exactly like the strobing lights on an airplane. i recall there seemed to be more blue lighting more than red. the craft seemed solid and slightly reflected the glow from roadlights. it seemed to be a matt grey.\r\n\r\ni tried to take some pictures through the

have a great amazing view of the milky way above my house - so looking at the sky is a very regular and normal thing for me.  i see satellites, iss, once i even the space shuttle trying to dock with the iss one summer long ago, meteors showers, comets, airplanes, and know the difference between them) \r\n\r\nso tonight after driving home from work to do farm chores next door at my parents house (my horse is on their property - share fence line)  i was leaving their house and noticed a light in sky - bright.   did not think much about it so went 500 feet more to my house and turned off engine and went to get out of my truck.  i saw a weird reflected shape/light as i was getting out through my truck window as i was turning to step out/down.  it was bright and i started to saw two small lines in sky... my first thought is it was a weird reflection in my window glass.  i was parked south and my body was facing south west as i moved to exit out of my truck down from my truck to the ground.  \r\n\r\nso i stopped getting out of my truck and while standing on my running board looked again at the light/lines and shape forming without being obstructed by the auto glass, i realized that i was really seeing two bright smoky/misty lines of light being formed right in front of my eyes.  i could hardly believe what i was seeing.  it was amazing.  i stepped out of my truck and walked a few steps away from my truck to again verify what i was seeing - the two lines of light were getting longer as the object? was moving south from a south west direction.  while the lines were getting longer - a conical shape was starting to form from what seemed to be a mist or smoke so it looked like a triangle v was forming behind /between the lines.  \r\n\r\nit was a that moment i realize that at the front of the v shape there was not a bright light leading the line lights  (there was space between the two lines of light at that center point of the v in the front - they did not meet at the point because something was there even though you could not see it.  i know because the darkness made the starlight disappear as the v lights grew.  the strange sight seemed like it was heading slightly downward at first, but i think that was an illusion as i realize it was heading away from me going from southwest to a more southern direction.\r\n\r\nthe light was only coming from the lines and the light from the lines were  illuminating the smoke/mist even brighter.  at that point, i was thinking, no one is going to believe me and i should grab my iphone and see if i could take a picture.  i took few steps back to my truck and reached into grab my phone.  when i final found it i tried to take a video and only snapped two pictures by accident - at this point the lights from the lines were fading and the smoke/mist started to form more wide bands of cloud like structures instead of distinct lines of light - eventually forming one large mass of smoke/mist.  \r\n\r\ni tried to switch to video mode - but there was not enough light to get the video to record.  by that time, the cloud/light faded completely and what ever was causing this was gone and all the light faded as well.  my two pictures show the very end when things and i can send the better of the two if you would like but it looks like a triangle smudge of specks of light.\r\n\r\ni went inside my house after it disappeared, let my dogs out to potty and then back in.  i then went back out by my parked truck and looked at the sky area again for any other weird stuff, cloud like leftovers or other lights and everything seemed back to normal for what i see in that part of the sky.  \r\n\r\ni scanned the rest of my sky view all around me looking for anything else out of the ordinary and started to get cold as the temp here is 24 degrees.  i went in and  immediately went on my computer googling to see if others from colorado might have seen what i saw when i came across this site and saw two other people described the same kind of thing v shaped line lights  in ca and az tonight.  \r\n\r\ni would not have typed all this in normally, but i feel like maybe we did see something different today.  i know that spacex was doing their thing today, but realize that all that was happening earlier in the day but have thought that it could be connected in some way to what we have seen or heard about yet.  all i know is i have never seen anything like it and honestly never thought i would be documenting a unidentified object like this in my life.\r\n\r\ni am excited, curious beyond belief, amazed and would love to know someday what it is i saw.  we do have quite a few military bases here in colorado so it could be something connected with them, it could have been something connected with spacex - the tesla crashing to earth ;)-  or just the weirdest meteor trail ever seen in my life - hard to believe since there was no bright center leading object visible.  but it is a large universe and there are still many things we have yet to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":90084,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.3472095,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02072018-0003","longitude":-104.4644112,"occurred":1517945340000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1517963353000,"summary":"Two misty bright light trails (v shape) appeared and left large conical lighted/smoky(misty) shape  -
