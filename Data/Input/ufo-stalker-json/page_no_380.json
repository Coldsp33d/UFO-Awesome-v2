to me by a source who wishes to remain anonymous:\r\n\r\nin the early 90s, my sister and i were staying at my aunt for a few days as my parents were away. on one of the summer evenings, at around 7pm, it was a sunny evening and the clouds were fluffy and low. we decided to go for a walk by the wharf. here in campbelllton. nowadays, it is a fairly busy spot, more touristy, but back then it was just an empty unused wharf, a beautiful, but quiet place to walk by the river.\r\n\r\nas we were walking i was trailing behind, but i somehow i just turned around and looked up right away. it is hard to explain but i felt there was something there, i almost felt watched. the object was hovering in the sky at a 45 degree angle to where i was standing. i could not hear a thing. my jaw dropped. i could literally not believe what i was witnessing. it was so vivid and close i could see it was metallic, i could see all the details. there was no way this would have been a balloon, a plane or a bird. it was clear as day and i was looking at a metallic hovering silent object in the sky above me. unlike the classic saucer shaped object that i was used to seeing on tv as a kid, this one looked more rounded; almost like 2 bowls one on top of another. i could clearly see the ridges of the sides and the protruding bottom and top. i was still as a statue looking at this thing and my aunt noticed i was behind, she came up to see what i was looking at. now, she is a very religious christian and as soon as she saw it i felt her complete discomfort. she started laughing nervously and asked outloud, \"well, what is this... it is so bizarre is it a plane? or perhaps a bird...? i could not believe she was even asking those questions, -as i mentioned earlier it was completely vivid and it would have shaken up the most skeptical person. suddenly, we were stunned to see it maneuver, in a very organic matter, behind the fluffy cloud. it stayed there for a few seconds, then came back around and stayed stationary for another bit, then it went behind the cloud again and we never saw it again.\r\n\r\nanother bizarre thing about this, was the fact that my sister never saw it but she was standing right there behind us. we found out a little bit later that she needed glasses; this might be why she could not see, but she remembers our reactions.\r\n\r\nacouple of years later, we had a group assignment to do in school and one of our subject was the paranormal, i chose to do it on ufos because of my experience. but another girl joined me saying she really wanted to do a project on ufos as well because she had a picture. it had been taken by a friend who worked in a lumber yard. that person wishes to remain anonymous. when i saw that pic and i was stunned because it was the same style of rounded saucer that i had seen and it was at around the same period. at the time there where no scanner like we have today so we made enlarged photocopies of the picture for our project. i had lost my copy of the project over the years, and a couple of years ago i reconnected with this girl and asked her if she still had the picture. unfortunately it belonged to her friend whom she did not have contact with. \r\n\r\nand a few days ago, she sent me this picture a copy of that project. she had found it in her mother's house.

when i looked at his face something caught my eye like a glare or something out the window. i raised my head up to see what it was and it was a being. it was a brownish tan color. it was short. i couldnt see the eyes or mouth. it had a head like oval shaped and you could see the impressions where the eyes and mouth were supposed to be but it wasn't there. it had its fist balled up and i didnt see fingers just the roundness of the fist. it was looking left to right like it was looking for something. when i seen it i panicked i jumped up and yelled \"bae bae bae\".

the quail, i observed a slow moving object in the sky to my right approaching from the east what i thought was a strange looking plane. it was moving unusually slow for it's size. it first appeared extremely shiny silvery metallic at the wings almost mirror-like but very dark almost pitch black in the center. it looked flat from wingtip to wingtip, no roundness in the center and i could not see the entire left wing side for some reason. i found it to be very strange that i could not focus on this object with my own eyes and i do not wear glasses. i looked down and rubbed my eyes for a moment. i looked up at it again and it was slowly turning to the south and west with a slight decent the further out it went. as it turned it began to glow very bright white. i have seen thousands of planes in the sky, i am a former ultralight pilot and have always had a fascination with all things that fly but i have never before seen any plane that glowed as brightly as this. normally metallic planes will gleam or glimmer in the sunlight at dusk but this was no gleam or reflection, the entire object was glowing constant. at this point i needed to get this on video. i quickly pulled out my new samsung s7 phone i've only had for a week or so, i set the video to record and did my best to stay calm and try to get best different zoomed views. by the time i started recording it was already heading out of view. then, it just so happens, a southwest airline flies over it from the south inbound for reno. this is a common route for planes to take going into reno depending on wind directions. it was a very windy day and as slow as this object was moving it couldn't be any civilian drone. most drones are rotor craft and can't fly in high winds. there was never a clear definition as to what exactly this thing was. closeups from the video shows a tail but no stabilizer, no propellers, no rotor blades, no signs of jet motors, no nose cone, nothing forward of the \"wings\" at all, which appear to be ball shaped. i lose sight of the object as it passed low over the top of my house. there was no sense in chasing it to the backyard because the house behind me is up much higher than mine so it was gone. my family and friends think it's just a plane but no one has yet truly identified it, even my other pilot friends. we all have no idea what this was or what it could be, i think there are a lot of theories of what it could be but until it can be positively identified i will call this a

shook his head. as the craft hovered, my car engine stopped, and we where missing about 25 minutes in time. we awoke in the car in time to see the craft swoop away. \r\nmy friend was absolutely terrified!! before he would go in the house that night, he made his wife go in the house and turn on all the lights and search the house!! \r\ni was just the opposite. i was absolutely exhilarated by the experience. i believe due to memories i can't explain that i had been visited 25 years before as a small child. approximately 25 years after this, i experienced another visitation while living in london,ontario. i heard sounds that sounded like \"buzzing\". i started to sit up and experienced a sharp pinch in my thigh. this time i woke up on the alien craft. i was laying on what seemed to be a chrome-like table, but it was very warm. there were all kinds of strange instruments around, and aliens examining me and the instruments. when they noticed i was awake, i received another \"pinch\"

continue to think about regularly. we were at end of dirt road that is one corner of a good size cow field around this area (u.P. mi). we were outside just watching for bucks with our binos which we did somewhat regularly. i remember seeing a light appear maybe 25 30 yards in trees opposite side road of field. by this point it was dark and my first thought was flashlight since this light appeared few feet of the ground. the size was about a soccer ball and was the best i can describe the color of what a flashlight would appear after dark. now this was my initial thought and initial thought only as i has yelled moderately hello 2 times before realizing a few things at once. theres was absolutely zero projected light from this solid round 360 degree ball of light. it was also fall and u cant take a step at night without leaves giving you away. it was silent, not to mention the moves this made was no man made light.\r\n i look at my brother as i realize what is happening. he has sheer terrer on his face and i recall this is the point i froze in shock. the light was coming directly at us slowly hovering in what seemed like forever to get to us. i mean this light appeared on us on purpose and made many moves to get to a clear view of us. so this light finally makes it way to an opening in trees which is i kid you not maybe 10 feet from our faces! it was hovering directly above a burm made where there the was maybe a 5 foot opening in tree line.\r\n \r\nafter getting to opening it stayed there for what seemed like 10 or 15 good seconds then suddenly dissapeared without a sound. i mean not a single sound not even a cricket when this light appeared. it was amazing, yet i wish i would have went back for proof. seeing is believing.","distance":"20 Feet or

brother-in-law, his friends and i were spending the night, sitting on one of the san martin park's bench. we were 8 in total, but one of his friends was drunk, sleeping inside one of the 3 cars parked in front of us.\r\nwe were waiting until morning for the copa toyota libertadores da america. final match between spanish real madrid and argentinian boca juniors. soccer is a huge thing in argentina and everybody was excited about that game. \r\nwe were chatting and having fun all night long. i was the only one quite as i didn't speak good spanish at the time. i was just looking up at the stars as the sky was clear. we have been there since midnight if i'm not mistaking. around 3:00 am a noticed a white sphere coming from north straight to our direction. there were middle and small size buildings in front of us and the park behind our backs. as soon as i saw that light, i immediately start pointing to it and repeating \"platillo volador! platillo volador!\" (flying saucer in spanish). i was sure from the beginning it was not an ordinary thing and i didn't think about anything else other than a ufo sighting. \r\n\r\nfor a second the guys just look at me and laugh, until they saw it themselves. now all of us were repeating \"platillo volador!\" and jumping like crazy. the light stopped just feel feet behind, over the building across the street. however, i am not sure about it's altitude.\r\n\r\nit was a \"pure\" white spherical light. i say \"pure\" white because i never have seen anything like that before. no blinking lights, no details in it's shape, no color changing. just a white light, not the same but similar to the fluorescent bulbs. it didn't have any emissions, any light effects or illusions we see when looking at any source of light.\r\n\r\nafter less than a minute it now started moving slowly in a straight line to the left (west). just for few seconds. it suddenly and abruptly change it's speed from something around 5 mph to 3000 mph (just guessing). it kept it's speed always moving west in a straight line. we still could see it moving far away, but it just turned the light off.\r\n\r\nwe were speechless and totally amazed with the experience. some of the guys said they never believed in ufos and now we continued talking about the subject for long time.\r\n\r\nin the morning we were all at the convenience store at the gas station having our breakfast watching the game which was happening in tokyo, japan. at that point, i'm pretty sure they were not thinking about the sighting anymore. i was and i have been thinking about it since them.\r\n\r\nhopefully one day i will have the meanings to travel back in jujuy with proper equipment and stay as long as it takes to get something on video.\r\n\r\nduring my stay, but days before the happening, ironically i met a guy who is widely famous in the ufo community for supposedly be contacted by extra terrestrial entities. probably many people reading this, knows whom i'm talking about but i can't tell any names in this post.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

when we noticed two red lights in the near distance moving in our direction.  we thought how wonderful it was that someone had released a couple of chinese lanterns. \r\n\r\nthese lights came across the tree tops moving very purposefully.  i started questioning if these were chinese lanterns since they were clearly moving horizontal across the sky and were not rising into the night sky as the chines lanterns should be.  i also noticed that there was a minor breeze with no visible movements from the tree tops.  i would anticipate that if they were chinese lanterns, with little wind, they would rise more vertically than moving horizontal at a descent speed.\r\n\r\nafter the first two disappeared across the tree tops, we noticed a third one approaching... this one however was brighter and moving faster!!!  as this third one flew past us, about 100-150 feet away from our location, about 75-100 off of the ground, i genuinely discerned a spherical shape to the object with a red/orange glow emanating from the bottom of the sphere.  the sphere was clearly translucent since i was able to see background objects through the sphere.  this sphere was \"catching\" up to the first two considering the speed it was traveling at... which we gauged at about 10-15mph based on our estimate once we got into the car and attempted to calculate the sphere's speed based on our speedometer.\r\n\r\nall three objects moved concertedly in a west by northwest direction and disappeared over the tree tops.  never to be seen rising into the sky such as chinese lanterns would be expected to.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
