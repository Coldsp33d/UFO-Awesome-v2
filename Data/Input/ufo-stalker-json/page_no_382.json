me and saw what i thought was one of those stealth type planes but i noticed the wings/\"fins\" on the side of it didn't normally match the ones that i had previously seen before. they looked like they had bat like points on the ends of them (think of the bat symbol almost on a triangle/tear drop shape). behind the black object was a weird, small shape that looked like it was glimmering/glittering, it was super sparkly but i wasn't able to identify it at all.\r\n\r\n2) the sky was a clear blue and the object was completely black/dark and the object it was either pulling or following it was shiny and reminded me of sparkly mesh netting. \r\n\r\n3) at first when i noticed it i thought it was one of the stealthy/army planes since i've seen those around here and there, but the wings on the side of it didn't match any of the kind i had seen before, plus the weird sparkly spider-web behind it made it seem really out of place.\r\n\r\n4) it was completely black and flying in a straight line while \"pulling\" (it didn't look attached to the actual flying object, it looked like it was being pulled though) this incredibly shiny, glittery mesh that reminded me of a spider web when it gets water droplets on it and sparkles. it wasn't driving in any weird path or anything like that, it was moving completely straight as was the object behind it.\r\n\r\n5) i was mostly confused since it wasn't like anything i had seen before, it looked weird and not normal too me once i saw the weird netting behind it. i didn't feel any weird or strange feelings coming over me when i saw it, just mostly confused once again when i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\n6) i don't like saying \"it just dissapeared\" because it sounds cliche, but that is exactly what it did. it was there one moment and then gone the next, the object being pulled behind it was gone as well. while at a red light i looked everywhere. everywhere. behind me, to the sides of me, in the air, near the road, and it was completely gone. when i reached my destination of my dad's house i looked everywhere then too but i was not able to see it again, which kind of freaked me out.","distance":"21-100

switched on as we were watching tv. it is impossible that this is any reflection from the inside.\r\n\r\nthen i turned around to talk to my wife and i saw a huge triangle with 3 lights under each corner. it was approx. 15-20 meters wide and maybe 1,5 meters high. the edges were rounded and there were no windows or anything to see. maybe there was something on the top but that was not visible from that angle.\r\n\r\nthe object was flying/hovering maybe 10 meters or lower from west to east, following the street. from my window i was able to see it around 10-20 seconds. unfortunately i didn't run to see it from the kitchen window because i was like stunned from that encounter. the speed was very low but i cannot tell how fast it was. it seemed to me like it was searching something like a police helicopter but it was sure no helicopter. i am a fpv drone pilot myself and i know how a helicopter flies and that it has to make (a lot of) sound when flying so low.\r\n\r\nsurface was black matte without any symbols or markings as far as i have seen it. the next week i have searched in google for a triangle ufo and it looks nearly exactly like the one described in the \"belgium ufo

7'33.09\"n\r\n 11°56'35.15\"e\r\n\r\n\r\ni always used to look out of the window observing the sky (i loved airplains)\r\n\r\ni have always been interested in aircraft of all kind.\r\n\r\nthen on the right side of the bus i noticed a huge commercial aircraft far away in the sky. curious, i watched it come closer.\r\n(it was tiny like an ant or beatle and must have flown very high)\r\n\r\nas the airplane came closer i noticed a hugh yellow sphere hovering high in the sky right above the bus\r\n(maybe a disc i was looking up at almost 90 degrees)\r\n\r\ni thought of the sun(they size was similar but that wasn't what i saw.\r\nit was early in the morning but the sphere was nearly 90 degrees in the sky\r\ni knew it wasn't the sun. it was bright but looking at it didn't hurt my eyes.\r\ni knew it was an ufo (what else could a huge glowing, floating sphere have been (it was no ball lightning!)).\r\ni don't know the altitude of the sphere.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was about here\r\n\r\n 49° 7'34.27\"n\r\n 11°56'35.17\"e\r\n\r\nthere were no details, no pulsating, no movement, no sound (it was loud in the bus).\r\nit was a bright yellow circle\r\n(as if you took a picture of a landscape and used photoshop to draw a perfect circle with no outline in bright yellow paint)\r\n\r\n\r\ncompletely eccyted and fascinated i informed all children around me, even shouted, but only a few looked out of the window(at least 5).\r\n\r\n\r\nby the time i looked out of the window again, the aircraft was very close already, flying exactly to the sphere without trying to avoid it.\r\n\r\nthen i noticed another commercial aircraft coming from a different angle also heading right for the sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nat first i was afraid, thought that the first plane had crashed with the sphere, but about two seconds after their sillhouettes touched the plane reappeared at the other side of the sphere (it must have flown right above it, with the sphere between the bus and the plane)\r\n\r\nby this time the second plane had reached the sphere and vanished behind it too, appearing at the other end in 1 or 2 seconds.\r\n\r\ni could not see the first plane anymore as the roof of the bus blocked my view it was heading soutwest.\r\n\r\nthe second plane didn't change its direction and flew away heading northeast (i think it started at munich airport(muc)).\r\n\r\nthe sphere was still visible without moving in any way.\r\n\r\nseeing two commercial aircraft coming from different angles intersecting on the same spot is unusuall on its own.\r\n\r\ni think the planes were investigating the ufo, taking a close look.\r\n\r\nas the planes were very close to each other, they knew their positions and must have communicated with ground control and with each other - at least to avoid a collision of the planes and the sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nthen the bus driver started the engine and drove on the street again so that the cabin roof blocked the sphere from my view.\r\n\r\ni wanted to look out of the opposite window but there were so many students in the vehicle that i couldn't (changing seats while driving was forbidden)\r\n\r\nafter another corner i was able to look for the sphere again, but it had vanished without a trace (couldn't make out both planes either)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni told my teachers about it - they didn't believe me.\r\ni told my parents about it - they didn't believe me either.\r\n\r\nfrustrated i stopped talking about it - no one cared (at least five children(me included) saw it for sure).\r\n\r\nthat is the reason i didn't report the sighting to anyone else but all details are engraved in my memory.\r\n\r\ni don't know the date of the sighting. as none cared i didn't investigate further (how could i as a boy 5 or 6 years old)\r\n\r\ni know it's not many details (hope i didn't waste your time (that's why i report it 16 years later in 2016))\r\n\r\ni thank you for reading this report.\r\n\r\nif you know something please let me know - i hope you blelieve me.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

the kids just after the sun had gone. i think the time was around 8.30-9pm. i was looking into the south/southwest sky, just above the neighbourhood rooftops and saw a red burning light, without a tail. initially, i thought it was a meteor or a comet that had come into our atmosphere, so i mentioned it to my brothers and we watched it fly from south to north in the western sky. there was no tail, the speed was quite fast(approx 200km/hr?), the red/orange light burned or sparkled brightly until it went past us and then the light started to burn out. it then seemed like the light had burned out and i was watching a dark grey, somewhat rectangular object flying in the north/northwest sky.\r\n\r\nmy brothers caught some of this on film, and then about 20 minutes later, the exact same thing happened again. same or similar spot in the sky, same size & brightness, it flew at a similar speed and this time my husband who had my phone caught it on video. we were all thinking it looked like it could be a chinese lantern, but then figure that a lantern could not travel so quickly & definitely not in such a straight and specific line or trajectory.\r\n\r\nthis happened once more (a 3rd time), which has us all dumbfounded with what this object could be. my husband thought that it may be an f18 fighter jet, with their afterburners on, but i believe we would've heard sound (which there was none) if a fighter jet was flying so low. it was hard to tell at which height this object was actually flying at, but we figure around 3-5,000 ft in the air? i discounted the jet theory because you'd most likely see the bright light from the back of the object and not from the front, which is how we saw the light. it at least seemed that way.\r\n\r\ncrazy experience....Would

the videos, please understand that the orb is small, also, considering the fact that my hands were shaking, so it's not easy to notice that it was moving irregularly, so please, you have to believe me (i feel crazy)...\r\n\r\n(1) i just finished my run, and decided to do a few pull-ups in a nearby playground at an elementary school. \r\n\r\n(2) i walked up to the monkey bars and looked up so i could see where i'm reaching and noticed a reflective/glowing orb.\r\n\r\n(3) when i first saw the object i assumed it was a planet.\r\n\r\n(4) i realized it wasn't a planet once i noticed it was moving, slowly but sporadically. in the center of the orb, it was white with a very, very slight yellow tint with an even less noticeable grey tint. the yellow of the orb was brighter at the outside. also, i should add that the edge of the orb faded away quickly, but at the end of the fade it looked as if there was some color fringing going on. the fringing faded (on the inside) from a bright yellow to a deep orange (on the outside) (the fringing was mostly orange). \r\n\r\n(5) during the sighting i was just frozen and i didn't know if i should be happy, scared or so on. right after the sighting i was slightly happy. then when i began to fill out this form i began to feel a minor panic attack on the rise (luckily the feeling went away, also i typically have panic attack when it feels as if i'm being watched).\r\n\r\n(6) i lost sight multiple times. the first time was when i was recording it with my phone. i was zoomed in all the way, but i zoomed out to show that i wasn't downgrading the video's image quality. when tried to zoom back in, i lost it. then i tried to zoom back out hoping that that would make it easier to find, but it stopped recording and became out of focus (my phone wasn't even out of space so i'm not sure why it stopped, the problem i had with the focus on the other hand could've just been a glitch for ios 9.3.5). \r\nthe second time was when i found it again and began to record it again, but the problem was i didn't even see my phone pick it up. then my phone actually ran out of space (also, i just looked at the second clip again, it turns out my phone did pick it up, i just wasn't looking in the right places, and it just wasn't as bright—also it pulsed once in the second clip). \r\nthen i just decided to walk back home since i didn't want to stand outside any longer,  looking at a possible ufo and risk having something happen to me.","distance":"Over One

to castroville from san antonio a few years ago a little farther from the light pollution of a major city, can't even see polaris in the city! i am very familiar with the major constellations in both hemispheres as well as how satellites and stars should behave in their orbits, and have seen iss fly overs more than a few times (as well as odd military aircraft, which may be odd, but still move and may sound like aircraft). since moving here, i have observed while star gazing, stars (or objects) in the night sky that simply just do not behave \"normally\". i star gaze at least four nights a week naked eye and these objects are not observed every night but i do see them at least once weekly.\r\n\r\nin the past few years, usually looking toward ursa major (i always start my scan there first after night fall), i will pick up a star like moving object or see an out of place star (i often see these in orion while scanning as well) or a star that is already moving. obviously the human eye is drawn to movement especially when it occurs in a place it should not, to those familiar with the night sky an out of place star warrants the same attention. sometimes they are satellites moving in their set orbit path as i observe them moving at the correct speed, or the iss, aircraft are a no brainer with their christmas light displays of red, white and green (even the f-117 has to display at least the minimum legal faa light requirements when operating in the united states). the disturbing things i have observed (and if i can get my wife off the couch to come see in time, she has seen one or two) is when the out of place star(s) begins to move or the moving star i picked up slows down, hovers, moves off at a high rate of speed, or splits into three objects that move three different directions at three different speeds.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure what these objects are, where they come from, or where they are going. i can say that i can not remember a time when i've seen so many odd

backyard pool. as ufo researchers ourselves, it is natural for us to occasionally look at the skies in hoping to catch a glimpse of any extraterrestrial vehicles other than aircraft, commercial drones, etc. one of us was in the middle of the pool and one of us was at the other end of the pool when, surely, both of us simultaneously spotted a very bright metallic white oval-shaped ufo object at 65-70 degrees or almost right above our heads appear out of nowhere (don't kid yourselves, extraterrestrials don't make an announcement of when they would come, they got lives of their own) and we immediately told each other to look at the skies in american sign language because we both are deaf. both of us looked at the object glide so beautifully and smoothly across the sky (like how you would see an air hockey puck start gliding the moment you turn on the equipment) and determinedly disappeared the moment it entered one of the cloud banks.\r\n\r\nwe were taught the importance of following our instincts and use common sense. we have scoured the skies with our eyes just about every time we go out or swim in the backyard - and we knew what we saw. not a man-made object, please no haters or wanna-be debunkers, we know better. it was not a firework object, not an airplane, not a drone, not a kite, not a satellite, not an astronomical object, not weather related, not a weather balloon, not a science project gone bad or a frisbee. read our lips: it was a ufo controlled by extraterrestrial intelligent being(s).\r\n\r\nin our perspective, we simply feel that the intelligent being(s) behind the object was just trying to say \"hello\" and that they are in existence, no matter how much our government tries to cover up or be angrily or sarcastically explained away by the narrow minded ninnies. we are not the ones that would let others think or decide for us, we have a mind and knew what we saw, to simply put it. don't let fools with degrees or authority tell you what
