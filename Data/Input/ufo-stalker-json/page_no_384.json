at the boston common. he was driving and i was in the passenger seat. we were a little before topsfeild ma around 10 pm when i noticed a parked car on the side of the highway with a man standing next to it with his attention to the sky, i didnt think anything of this and we just continued forward.I was looking to my right out the passenger window when i noticed this weird shaped craft moving very slow it was probably 100ft up or so. the weirdest thing was the shape i kept trying to put to an image what i was looking at it had all theese weird angles to it and first i thought it was a stealth fighter or something now im only 16 so a stealth is pretty cool to see. but then i realized it wasn't a stealth and it seemed to defy the laws of physics. i turned to my freind and he was still content driving, at this point we were going around a curve in the highway and i looked up again. this time it was right over us and i could see the bottom perfectly if i had had a phone then or a camera there would be 100% evidence of other life no doubt about it. the craft was black all angles were equal meaning any point could have been the front. it had one bright circular steady white light in each corner and a smaller steady red light in the middle. now it was moving so slow that i swear i watched it for atleast 10 min but then it gets weirder im looking at the bottom veiw of the craft as its flying south were still traveling north all of a sudden the front white light disappears now this thing is only 25 ft above us and i should still be able to see the front light then as it keeps moving the back 2 lights disappear as well. i feel so weird looking at this thing i still dont have words to describe it. it was silent as it glided toward the old danvers ma mental assylum which is along the highway sw of us amd out the back window i see this thing hovering above the roof i mean inches above it. we turned around to pursue it but didnt find anything. another very weird aspect of all this is we didnt get home till after midnight and we should have been home by 11 pm at the latest. ive never forgotten this as long as ive lived and this event has seriously changed my life.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

i was outside my apartment having a cigarette with my neighbor and her friend when the event took place. it was a very peaceful evening, quiet, good weather, scattered clouds. which made it an ideal day for looking at stars.\r\n2. after while of stargazing i caught a fast moving object out of the corner of my eye.\r\n3. originally i thought this object was a low satellite or some military aircraft, as nato is doing aircraft training exercises in the area.\r\n4. the object(s) in question composed of a v-shaped formation, several(9-1) orbs or star-like balls of light. it was moving at speeds i have never seen before. at an estimated mach 5-10, depending on altitude (which i estimate at 50,000 - 100,000 feet)  this formation had a solid v-shape, however, two other objects orbited around the solid formation in a very unnatural manner. the main formation moved in a straight line of flight, with the orbiting objects following it the entire way. i observed no sound from this object. \r\n5. my feelings during this event were sheer disbelieve and amazement. i pointed up and asked if my neighbor or her friend saw the object. unfortunately, by the time they looked up and i pointed them in the right direction, the object was gone. i felt a very odd sensation after seeing the object, almost like the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. however i have had no negative feelings about the object. it interested and fascinated me. \r\n6. i lost sight of the object when it went behind the clouds, it was only visible for about 5-8 seconds total. \r\n\r\n-i want to thank whoever has taken the time out of their day to read and review my report. this object i have observed is not the first i have seen since i have moved to denmark. i have observed six (not including this event) other instances of ufos in my area. i am certain this last event will not be the last. due to the speed and unpredictability of said objects, i have not been able to get much photo or video records. however i will make steps to further investigate on my own time and collect proper evidence. which i will send to mufon directly.  i would very much like to work together with mufon and solve this as a team. any and all feedback or contact from mufon would be greatly appreciated. thank you for your time and your work.

very dark and a lot of stars shining. out of habit i always look up at the sky to check the weather. i always look for satellites while i'm looking, have done this since i was a kid and saw the first sputnik. immediately i saw what looked like a satellite, almost directly overhead, maybe to the west a little, and it was heading in a westerly path. i kept watching it for a few seconds when it abruptly stopped and started moving to the left 90deg for a short time, then reversed and went the opposite direction and then turned west again. since it was early morning and i had not been awake for more than around 30 min., i thought my eyes might be playing tricks so i leaned up against my truck with my head steady and tried to lock on to the stars around where i was looking so i could make sure the movements were what they seemed to be, and they were. the stops were abrupt and change of direction was immediate. i am a former private pilot and try to keep up with the latest aviation technology, and i know we have nothing that can do this, either manned or unmanned. if i remember correctly, orbit speed is around 17,000mph and you cant stop abruptly and turn. i can honestly say this is the first time in my life that i have seen something like this that i can't explain. i can't say with 100% certainty, but this object seemed to be in orbit, not just a high flying object in the atmosphere. it did not glow, but seemed to reflect light just like a satellite, and it was not unusually bright. i am more or less a skeptical person, not dismissing any possibilities, but i have to see something to believe. experiencing this phenomena has changed the way i think about our place in the universe, not in a bad way but just different. i have no witnesses, no physical proof, nor am i convinced that this was extraterrestrial, but do consider the possibility. unfortunately, i had to go to work and never saw where this object went or what happened to

one in particular together with my wife. i wanted this one to be well documented and my wife didn't want to be questioned. hence, i asked her a ton of questions to clarify the event and sighting for others.\r\n\r\nmy wife was headed west on court street in clearwater, fl on august 24th, 2016. she called me to tell me she was taking a picture of the beautiful sunset. after the event, she told me it reminded her of a megaphone pointing to the sky. so while we're on the phone, no words have been exchanged yet as she takes the first photo. i heard her saying something but couldn't make it out, then i heard her exclaim. she told me that she yelled, \"nick!! i got a picture of an alien!!\" the interval between the first picture and second was 16 seconds apart. we were only on the phone for no more than 30 seconds as she took these two pictures. the timestamps in the filenames are 20160824_200518 and 20160824_200534. the second picture was taken 2 blocks down, where she had slowed down the car enough to capture the photo as it went out of view. \r\n\r\nshe came home and we reviewed the picture. originally i thought that the black ball emerged from the top shadowy arc. she said it was actually moving as a single object in a northwesterly direction. it was moving over or towards the scientology hq it seemed. the ufo hovered and began travel again. she was able to snap a picture as she looked back and forth from plain sight to the camera view. she described it as if the sky was blowing a bubble and this ufo appeared. she also stated it was blurry, even in plain sight and that’s why she was doing double takes between the cam and sky.\r\n\r\ni recently read that they're caught during sunrise and sunset due to the refraction of light and their cloaking technology. if that's so, this looks like it may have been only partially cloaked. articles i’ve read have also stated that they appear a lot near lightning strikes. it was across from a gigantic funnel shaped storm cloud that i started recording live on facebook after she called me about the sighting. all i was able to catch was a few fierce lightning strikes but in reviewing the video, nothing appeared to stand out. i’m sure it was long gone or hidden at this point.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

on it as i most possibly can find and its been quite the adventure doing so here we go.\r\nit all started in fairbanks al in the late 70s my dad worked on the alaskan pipeline and we lived near a air force base were i would be playing outside on playgrounds like every kid, the thing that i remember the most was trying to talk to my mom and other kids and they all seemed to be in a kinda sleep mode type stage i would talk to them but not much of a response back, and the other children i played with were a little different then me and were fine except they just sounded and looked a little different but i thought not much of it.\r\nwe soon moved to sacramento when i was around 6 and this is when it got serious for me, at the hottest times of summer (now in the 80s) the beings i now know as the tall whites would wake me up some how and i would play with there children outside, it never seemed that weird to me growing up with and looked forward to seeing them. the older i got tho the more i would see the adults and they would communicate with me. the one time that sticks out the most is when i was out with the family running arones, i was tagging along in the back going into one of many stores my mom was dragging us in and as soon as i walked in i saw the two tall whites walking out, they walked right by me and said \" michael be careful\" using telepathy like always( u hear them but not with your ears) is the best way to describe it. and then stared and smirked at me, i couldn't stop starring as they walked off then disappeared into the parking lot. but like usual everyone was in a dream like state and couldn't respond to me quickly at all its like there half asleep or something, it doesn't seem to work on me whatever is going on am always alert and fine. i have more details of my events but that sums it up so you have an idea. i also see a lot of ufos and have some pics.\r\ni have some other physical things that are different.\r\ni hope this info helps

we both got off of my car and started walking very slowly toward the star but then realized it was an orb and the orb was coming toward us doing a slight zig zag then travelled directly towards us. we both stopped in our tacks and she grabbed my hand and we both were just amazed how beautiful this orb was. it was the size of a beach ball and was glowing an absolute beautiful golden radiant color. it got as close as 30-40 yards from us and made a sharp 90° turn right ( south). it was tree top level when it turned south and out of view. i ran closer to try and get a closer look but it was gone.

stroller.  this was on the evening of wednesday  august 31st, 2016 at about 7:50pm.  my son likes to spot airplanes in the sky and so i saw a commercial airliner flying from west to east across the sky and told him to look.  i then noticed that flying next to it was a much smaller craft.  this smaller craft was between 1 and 2 commercial airplane widths (wing tip to wing tip) away from the craft and was matching the commercial airliner's speed exactly.  both craft were leaving a vapor trail, although the commercial airliner produced two tails while this smaller object only produced one.  the commercial airliner seemed to have a dark blue color while the smaller craft was a color between grey and black.  the smaller craft appeared to be about one third of the length of the commercial aircraft (length being from nose to tail).  because of the small size it was difficult to identify a shape to this craft, my best guess is that it was triangular shaped.\r\n\r\ni watched the two craft fly eastward side by side in a straight line until the trees blocked my view.  i don't think my son saw either airplane.\r\n\r\nmy initial thought was, \"what the heck is that?\".  i work in the aerospace industry as an engineer so i began trying to problem solve what i witnessed.  my first thought that this was another commercial airliner that was flying at a much higher altitude and it just looked like it was flying next to the commercial craft (which would explain the smaller size).  i then thought that this was unlikely because their speeds were matched exactly.  the next thing i thought it could be was a fighter jet escorting the commercial airliner.  i know this happens occasionally if there is a concern on the commercial airliner.  this would explain the greyish-dark color and how to could match the speed of the airliner but also stay so close to it.  this could also explain the vapor trail left behind.  i was thinking possibly an f-16 fighter jet could explain the small size and single vapor trail.\r\n\r\ni did not have a smart phone or any camera with me to photograph or film the two aircraft.  after i got home and got the kids in bed (about 8:25pm) i google news search for fighter jets escorting commercial airliners for that evening but didn't see anything reported.  i told my wife what i had witnessed and she thought that it was strange as well.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
