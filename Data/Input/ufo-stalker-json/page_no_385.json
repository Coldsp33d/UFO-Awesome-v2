open)  a little before 12 on friday night, when something in the sky catches my eye. as i'm trying to figure out what it is, thinking maybe it's a low flying plane, i notice that it was way too low to be an airplane, as it was 45 or 50 degrees overhead, and was a yellowish coppery color that didn't blink or have any other lights on it like planes usually do. it's low enough that i can see it move north to south across the sky. i had been watching it move across the sky for about a minute and a half from when i first noticed it. it wasn't fast, maybe moving only about 200-250 feet in that time. then it stopped moving and seemed to lower itself down and move forward a bit, making it seem like it was stopping to focus on something. this immediately made me uncomfortably nervous and  scared. i felt like it had noticed me or seen me watching it or something. i have no idea what this thing was and i felt like it had noticed me and was surveilling me. at that point, my fight or flight kicked in and i went inside.  i'm outside nearly every night, and so i see airplanes flying overhead all the time. this was no an airplane. i got it in my head that maybe it was a drone of some sort, thinking maybe the police in my town were using it for surveillance, but did research on it and found out that the county doesn't allow drone use. so either it was a random person using a drone, an unauthorized use of a drone by a police officer, or something else. \r\n\r\nall i know is that i felt like i was being watched and it scared me enough to feel the need to document it.

reasons\"\r\njoint staff pentagon \r\nwashington, d.C. xxxxx-xxxx\r\n\r\nsubject:  unidentified flying object (ufo) sighting illustrating unexplainable and amazing technology that had cut a hole in our sky to leave earth\r\n\r\ndear sir,\r\n\r\nyou do not know me, but i feel that writing my civilian authority or my congressman would be a waste of time.  i am writing you this letter to tell you about the subject ufo (flying saucer) encounter of the first kind i had (saw) in the sky over fredericksburg, virginia back in september of 2006 from my home’s driveway in spotsylvania county.  it was the most extraordinary thing i have ever witnessed in my life.  i have been waiting almost six years to tell it.  i cannot get the image i saw out of my mine.  i should have written down the date and time, but i have just been trying to forget about it and hope i never see anything like it again.  the comparison to my experience would be like a caveman seeing the space shuttle take off for the first time.  it frighten me that much and i was just mentally stunned when i observed it.\r\n\r\nthe subject event has made me question my own faith, real existence, and the rationale of trying to explain to myself what exactly i saw.  i did not have a camera that day i encountered it, but have made a simple drawing to illustrate the magnitude of the subject object.  what i could see of the ship is that it was huge, possibly the size of three large two-story houses and that was only half the size of the ship.  i do not remember the exact day, since i have been trying to forget the event, although i believe it was on a sunday afternoon about maybe thirty minutes before nightfall.  i remembered it being on a sunday because when i worked i would check the air pressure in my car’s tires every sunday afternoon so i would have no trouble driving to work on interstate 95 to fort belvoir, va.  i am now a retired gs-13 and retired from the headquarters, u.S. army materiel command before the command relocated to huntsville, alabama.  sir, you can also check out my integrity with amc and they will back me up as a truthful and honest hard working employee.  \r\n\r\nsir, in addition, i am a u.S. air force veteran and thought i have seen every known aircraft and spacecraft known to man.  as for ufos i have seen still photographs, movies of ufos, and drawings of such objects, but did not believe that they exist (i was a skeptic for sure), not any longer!  i now know from my experience that there exist extraterrestrial life beyond or outside our earth.  the following describes the event that i witnessed by pure chance.\r\n\r\nwhile putting air into my car’s driver’s side back tire’, i stood straight up to rest my legs and ankles after using an air pressure gage to check my tire.  and as i looked unintentionally at the sky at a seventy-degree angle, i noticed half of this large object just hanging in the sky, just like a “post-to note” hanging on a bulletin board, between two big clouds and not moving.  the ufo was stationary between two clouds and i could only see half of it while the other half seemed to have disappeared or be invisible in the sky, like if you would cut half of a silver dollar in half and paste it to a bulletin board.  the half of the ufo i did see was medium lead gray in color and smooth all over with a bulge in the middle.  there were no windows, lights, or protruding fins or engines of any kind.  it made no sound; it just seemed to be just hanging there.  i then noticed that the half that i could see had like a fluid or wave of some kind (which was invisible) trying to cover the other half of the ship that was visible to me.  the edges of the fluid or wave sparkled as if it was trying to cover the remaining half of the flying saucer.  to me, the edges of the fluid or wave looked more like a rip in our sky than a fluid trying to cover the craft.  it looked like our sky was cut open, like if someone would cut open a hole into some type of material fabric on a bulletin board (our sky).  \r\n\r\non television and in books i have seen pictures of hovering saucers moving about and flying meteors mistaken for ufos, but i have never seen anything like this before or anywhere.  this ufo must use some type of anti-gravity device or generate its own gravity to have held itself in the sky as it did. \r\ni was frighten and tried to tell my wife, but she did not believe me and still does not believe me today even after i showed her the picture i drew.  i wanted to contact someone in the u.S. government to let them know about this event so that my country and the other countries that live on our planet would be warned of this potential danger from this extraterrestrial life.\r\n\r\n\r\n*the detailed letter above was written on april 15, 2012, to the office of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, washington,dc.\r\n\r\n*******hot:  i originally thought that this happened to me in the year 2004. the aliens that had abducted me, did something to my mind (they tried to wipe my memory) and it took months and days for me to realize that the incident happened on 17 september, 2006.  it took me months and days to figure out in my mind what had happened to me and why i was having these disruptions in my mind about seeing the ufo while ascending to it and then seeing it like i was descending from it.  i could not get these thoughts out of my mind as they would just pop into my mind while i was in church, watching television, sleeping (before these thoughts woke me up), at work as i was just trying to live my life as normal as possible.  i believe i was transported from the ground to the ship and then returned to my original position on the ground.  i did have a watch on , but do not remember seeing if time was lost or i missed a length in time (i could not remember), but i do remember seeing the time before i started refilling the air in my car's tires (it was around 5:45 pm (more or less).  months later, my memory even recalled when i first saw the ufo from my driveway (it's bottom was circular and solid black) come over my house's roof.  this ufo also had a bulge in the center on top of the ufo and the ufo was disc-shape and smooth all over, no cracks, windows, engines, doors, or markings of anykind were visible outside of the craft.  it looked similar in design to the flying saucer that appeared in the first movie called the \"day the earth stood still\", but the ufo i saw seemed to be perfect (flawless) in design and looks.  when i witnessed the ufo depart through the rip in our sky, there was still no sound and as it departed through the fabric of our sky, a warm feeling came over me and i felt at peace like i have never felt before, but they had tried to erase my memory which had disrupted my mind with visions of ascending to the ufo and descending from it.  it was driving me nuts back then, and i finally told my wife what was happening to me, because of a ufo sighting from our driveway,  after i finally was able to convince her that ufos are real.\r\n \r\ni want to tell you about my other abductions before i die of old age or disease and they are lost forever (after, i got my memory back, i started to remember things) and this was not the first time that i was abducted.\r\nhowever, i want you to not use my name, instead you can refer to me as \r\nmr. john smith.  i was abducted as a child between eight and eleven years\r\nold, i think; all i remember for about two or three years when i would look at the stars at night from my bedroom window. i would fall asleep and would wake up after something in my head (an over powering command) told me to get dress and come walking and this occurred between 3:30 am and 4:30 am (1958 through 1961) in the morning.  my father caught me a few times as i tried to walk blocks (maybe miles) from my house at night in norfolk, virginia. i would return and sneek back into my parents' house after being exhausted from walking and then returning to sleep late the following day.  this never happened in the winter months, only during the summer months.  my mother would inquire why are you always so tired in the morning and during the day?  today, i am amazed that i am still alive, because i was not kidnapped or raped and killed somewhere.  \r\n\r\n*******hot: in septembet 1991 i was working for the u.S. army at fort leavenworth, kansas and was assigned to attend a training course at wright-patterson air force base, ohio, i am too tired to type out this nutty story, so bring a tape recorder to here the details.  anyway, i woke from \r\na sleep in my pickup truck in which i should have been driving and moving,\r\nbut i was safely put, truck and all, inside of this grassie area inside of\r\na cloverlief on an interstate highway somewhere between ohio or indiana, on my way back home after successful completion of the training course.  i do remember smoking a cigarette and drinking a large coffee while driving, that i purchased after leaving the wright-patterson air force base before entering the interstate to drive back to kansas.  i purchased the coffee\r\nto keep me awake and at the time, i smoked, even while driving. when i woke up behind the wheel of my pickup truck, my truck engine was running, but there was no coffee spilled or coffee cup found in my truck on the floor or any spills on my body.  in addition, there was no cigarette burns on my body or burns on the seat or floor of my truck.  it was like someone had picked me and my truck up as one unit and removed the coffee and cigarette from me and taken me off the highway and put me far into a safe grassie spot in the inner part of a cloverlief highway.  i did not see any\r\ntire tracks or paths cut into the grass in the cloverleaf by my pickup truck.\r\n\r\n*******hot: in virginia beach, virginia on shore drive in 1994, you will have to bring your tape recorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n*******hot: seoul, south korea, will have to tape story, i think i was being looked for!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n****also hot: on december 13, 2013 between the hours of 2:30 am and 3:45 am, i do not know the exact time, because i was too scared to think properly.  i was about to be abducted again (they tried, but i was able to call 911 and get two (2) deputy sheriffs for spotsylvania county to come to my house).\r\n\r\nit started on the night of december 13, 2013 as i was preparing to go to bed, i was in the downstairs bathroom, sitting on the toilet, and my house started to vibrate. as i stood up and opened the door i saw a empty white water pitcher in a washbowl move briefly half way across a hall table towards me.  i then washed up and made my way upstairs to my bedroom where my wife was sleeping in bed. i removed my clothes and put on my pajamas and went to bed and as i laid down and tried to go to sleep, i felt very uneasy and felt like someone was watching me through my ceiling and the hairs rose up on the back of my neck and i decided to get my firearm and call 911.  as i had my cell phone in one hand and my gun in the other, i proceeded downstairs to wait for the deputy sheriffs to arrive at the front door.  as i was about to leave my bedroom, i looked towards the two\r\n(2) front windows in my bedroom and heard a big loud whoosh sound coming from the top of my roof.\r\n\r\nthen,i proceeded to go downstairs and during this time, i had the 911 operator online the whole time as she told me that the two officers were on their way.  i told her that i was taking the ammo clip out of my pistol and putting the empty gun on my kitchen table for the officers to see that i had disarmed the gun.  one of the officers went behind my house and found nothing, but the next morning, i found footsteps leading up to my backdoor that i saw through my kitchen door.\r\n\r\nwhen the deputy sheriffs showed up, i did not tell them that i thought that i was about to be captured by a ufo and i did not inquire if they had seen anything hovering over my house.  i had no proof, not even a sighting to report, i was too scared to go outside and i knew that this was not a dream or nightmare, i had been awake the whole time and after the deputies left, i looked in my downstairs bathroom and saw in the mirror that my face was as red as blood from being scared to death.  \r\n\r\neven for the sighting above in 2006, i never reported it to the spotsylvania county sheriffs' department as a ufo sighting.       \r\n","distance":"Over 1

28, 2016.\r\n\r\ndid anyone else have a sighting in toronto, sunday night between 10-10:30pm? \r\n\r\napproximately 10pm est, sunday august 28, 2016 over newmarket, north of toronto, canada, two of us were sitting in the backyard facing east (see the photo below where the sun is rising the next morning with startracker lite app superimposed to show the sky from sunday night). \r\n\r\ntraveling from north to south (left to right in the picture above) across the eastern sky at a speed that was like a shooting star was a craft that was oval in appearance, seemingly wide like a plane, at a height approximating what a commercial jet would be flying overhead. \r\n\r\nfrom our sitting position on the backyard deck, it passed slightly above the trees as it sped south for a count of ò1 and 2 andéó then continued with its view obstructed by the trees in a slightly wider field of view than the photo above. initially we asked ourselves if this could be a meteorite but having already seen two a little earlier, it was clearly uncharacteristic of a meteorite. it was oval as if it might have wings but they were not perceptible wings. it was more like an energy pulse extending to each side like wings. it appeared as a quickly pulsating, oscillation with long, oval arch to each side. the rapid pulsing to each side of its center was extremely fast. \r\n\r\nimagine for a moment, as if the pattern of a tigerõs stripes was energetically oscillating at an extremely fast rate. that is how it appeared to me, though to alison sitting beside me, it was more like a subdued yet oval light swishing across the sky in a dark halo surrounding it. \r\n\r\nunlike the meteorite that arched down from the sky towards the horizon like the two meteorites that we witnessed earlier, this uap flew straight across the sky at a speed that is comparable to a meteorite. the energy was electric. the sky was the clearest we have seen all summer. \r\n\r\napproximately 30-minutes later, at 10:32pm, we saw exactly the same phenomenon in the same exact line of vision, but this time traveling from south to north. notably, it was moving approximately at half the speed of the original sighting for a count of ò1 and 2 and 3 and 4 andéó then the trees obstructed our view. at that speed, it was speeding much faster than a jet fighter would across the sky. there was no sound at all. again, there was an electric, energetic feel to the energy filling the air, possibly our own excitement from what we saw.\r\n\r\nthis is the sky photographed on my iphone 5s taken immediately after. though the phone was in my hand, the craft moved much too quickly to take a shot.  \r\n\r\ni believe these are the solar systems and stars that were visible, though i am not 100% certain of their exact placement, according to the startracker lite app on my phone. very grainy shot, but it offers perspective of where we were sitting and what we saw pass across our field of view. \r\n\r\nthe next morning at approximately 7:30am i went outside to photograph the sun rising in the exact same spot we witnessed the sighting sunday night to have a clear perspective of where we had witnessed the uaps for this report. upon downloading the images to my computer, one of the shots taken had a bright spot above the sun. \r\n\r\nwhen enlarged, two objects are revealed. what is particularly interesting is that the seeming light source is at the top, north side of the spheres and they exhibit a shadow to the bottom south side. \r\n\r\nwhile i have won awards for my photography and work in television, i am not an expert with photoshop nor do i have proper tools for analysis. my question to the readers out there: is this image typical of lens flair? \r\n\r\nis it something else that is naturally explainable?  \r\n\r\nor, is this a genuine capture of an unidentified aerial phenomenon or ufo? \r\n\r\ndaytime photos aside, the sunday night sighting was dramatically exciting. i've never really heard of craft described quite like what we saw. anyone else see this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

of 5 times approximately. the last one seemed to show a tube on the lower right looking at the tape. they also left a imprint on each one that would be there after the objects were gone on the tape. the objects came from the north and made a quick turn over the house towards my camcorder a south-west turn. on the second sighting also taped was a light show two nights later on the house next to this one, which has to much detail to put down, both were taped on hi-8 tape and transferred to disc. this one i was outside but looking the other direction and missed the whole event. i have many tapes all shot from my back yard except one. i do not know either of my neighbors and i would love for you to see them and tell me what you think. i believe this has been going on since i was young but hard to prove. i am having trouble or my daughter is by trying to send them to you i could send them if that would be easier. contact me anytime. thank you. charles","distance":"21-100

me.\r\nthen there was blackness. when i awoke in the morning, i had a screen memory that there had been a break-in the night before. it was a constant thought that kept occurring all morning. several days later, i found a 6 inch by 5 inch patch of mud on the inside shoulder area of the bathrobe i wore that night. immediately i wanted to save the bathrobe for possible evidence. yet i was receiving intense telepathic messages to wash the robe\r\nagainst my desire to not wash it. how did they know i found the mud patch?\r\n\r\ni have been abducted several times in the recent past, and this encounter\r\nhas all the earmarks of another abduction. i have now learned that they\r\nare able to \"turn off\" my dog. the screen memory of a break-in would\r\nnormally have caused me to call 911,

object to my left in the sky.I watch this very bright object that appeared to be bright red and white i watch this object move up and down and shimmer for about 10 mins before running in to get my wife so she could see it!It was still there when she came out and couldn't believe her eyes! we watched in wonder as this object moved spun changed direction and color very quickly! i then got my cell phone and pointed it toward the object to see if i could capture in on my phone!We watched this  for about 1 hour and 45 min. but it only felt like 20 to 30 mins my wife had already taken her sleeping pill before i went in to get her!In the morning we told our friend about what we saw but there was only audio of our event!I was dumbfounded that i didn't get it on video! then i went back to look at the videos and put the phone on full screen and sure enough it was on my phone doing exactly what we saw during this event! unbelievable!The next morning when i went to take a shower i noticed this half circle on my stomach the was white and very noticeable because i was tan from being there for 2 weeks! i told my wife about it later in the day and she photographed my stomach and you can clearly see it! i knew it was a u.F.O. right away because of its color and movement it moved up and down side to side shimmered changed direction and color very quickly!I felt delight that we were lucky enough to watch this event! but now i have questions about the amount of time we were out there when it only seemed like 20 to 30 mins! we finally went to bed around 1;15 am and the object was still there! i watched the sky for the duration of our vacation at the same time and area we saw this object but i never saw it

above south tree line traveling faster than a satellite, slowed its path and illuminated bright white light three times within the same path, brighter than any star in the sky.  the object stopped moving several times and disappeared above the nw tree line.  \r\na second object appeared almost directly overhead in the west, illuminated bright light and moved s by sw.  the second object stopped moving and blended like faint star.  at that same moment, in the same n by nw location where the first object disappeared, a bright white light illuminated and zipped towards the second star-like object.  \r\na third object appeared in between the first and second objects traveling n by nw.  the first object illuminated bright white and changed direction from moving extremely fast s by sw to n by nw without any delay or change in speed.\r\nthe second object stayed on one place and the other two objects disappeared above the nw tree line.\r\nat approximately 9:00 pm, two jets (possibly f-15's) flew cross patterns around the location of the unidentified objects and circled back around the sighting area instead of continuing the same flight path.  one jet came from the se and one from the sw.  approximately two minutes after the jets, a large plane (a bomber sized vessel), flying much lower, traveling n by nw did a big 180 around the location of the sighting and continued flying back to the se.  \r\nsimilar to the two jets, this large plane had identifying lights on the wings, but it also had a solid red light in the center, much brighter than the lights on the wings.  the slower moving plane flew slowly overhead and turned around in the same location as the first two jets.  i could hear the afterburners from the three marked vessels, but no sound came from the unidentified objects.  \r\nat approximately 9:10 pm, a fourth unidentified object from the east appeared, as faint as a star, and started traveling in the same direction as the large plane, towards the se.  this object did not illuminate bright light but traveled much faster than the plane and two jets.  however, no afterburner sound could be heard.  this fourth object faintly appeared and disappeared three in a 10-second time-frame before disappearing all together.
