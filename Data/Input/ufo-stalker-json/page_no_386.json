still illuminating the sky and cast some orange borders on wispy clouds. i'll admit that we had been drinking and were not actually sober. but we saw the same thing, mostly.\r\n\r\ni looked up at what i thought was a drone. it looked about the size of one of the professional drones that are 3 feet wide. it was hovering overhead, about 30 feet above the roof top of a house off of se gladstone st between se 27th and se 28th ave.\r\n\r\nas i looked closer for drone propellers i realized it was slowly turning upside down. it was thin like a deflated mylar balloon. to my wife it also looked thin but she saw a glowing red diamond shape, like a kite but glowing like a flame. i saw a black, amorphous object with four or so red lights shining out of it. the red lights appeared to flash randomly as though they were just reflecting off of a red metallic surface as the object rotated. this was past sunset though, so i don't know where such a bright, direct light would've been coming from.\r\n\r\ni then noticed that the object was fluttering like a flat weightless ash rising out of a fire. after it turned upside down it's right side rose, then it wobbled so it's left side rose like the random movements of a falling piece of paper. but it wasn't falling. my wife saw this movement too. \r\n\r\nwe both saw it pick up velocity in the southbound direction and leave the area quite swiftly. i believe it went in a straight line about 60-80 feet above the ground. the fluttering movements didn't speed up or change. they remained graceful and almost care free as we watched it travel at a constant altitude over the roof tops. since it wasn't very high we couldn't track it for long. houses and trees soon obstructed our view. it was surprising how much distance it gained so quickly. i was wondering if it was getting smaller or just further away because it covered a lot of ground in little time. the fluttering motion didn't make sense either because nothing i know could flutter so peacefully at such a rate of acceleration.  \r\n\r\nif i was to force known physics onto this thing i would say it was a mylar balloon suddenly caught in a super strong wind pattern that swept it away. but the air was still that night. the tree tops were still. it was a warm, sunny summer day with a calm beautiful dusk.\r\n ","distance":"21-100

came threw the window above the the t.V., the light felt like it scanned the whole house,when the beam left out the house it felt like it took everything with it like it snatched my soul and left my body, i was sitting on the recliner seat closes to the door my sister was sitting on the sofa by the back of the trailer, she said to me gabriel what was that, i got up and locked the dead bolt lock on the trailer, and sat down, my sister then said you a punk, got up and unlocked the door,when she looked out the door, she looked up and said gabriel look, i got out the chair , crawled on my knees and when i got to the door,i stayed on my knees the whole time on the left side of my sister, i looked up and what i saw was the most beautifulest theing i ever scene in my life, right above the tree top i saw a triangular object just hovering over our house,except it didnt have points instead it was rounded at the points, thier was a very bright whiteish orange light in the middle and around the edges of this craft bottom their were little lights going around the triangle but they were all different colors every color in the spectrum , the way they moved around each one changed color and had a hypnotizing effect, the moon was out that night,and the whole craft had a bluish hue,and looked like it was made out of star dust, and no matter how good technolgy gets or special effects i've never scene nothing similar to this but i could say it looks like something that came out of a sci-fi movei but this was better then the movies the cant duplicate this, and this was in the early 90's, the last thing we remebered is that the craft slowly started to move of, and then we lost time when we woke up we where both back in are seats and we both popped up in our seats and said what was that,we where alone that night , the next morning my mom came home we told her, people around the trailer park said they seen something similar but not a similar story of abduction, i feel we were taken because we lost time, but i would like to get hypnotized to find out the truth. a few years back i had a dream i was on a craft and i was in like a hospital bed , when igot up a looked around i scene more beds amd wierd creatures walking around ,so i ran and i got to an elevator, i got on and went down and when the doors open they were waiting for me and i woke up , i wonder if that was trying to open those memories, but this is real my sisters my witness.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the backyard letting the dogs out at 12:15 a.M. under tree cover. turned around to walk back inside and saw red orange orb appear from behind a tree at a distance, flying at the height of a cesna on a horizontal path similar to a plane. it was silent. appeared to be an intelligent craft with a vibrating bubble on top. as soon as i comprehended this was not a plane since there were no faa lights, the orb accelerated with the orb/bubble leaning backwards with gforce (elongating) then returned to concentric bubble shape at higher speed. i dashed inside to get my fiance' - took about 15 seconds. he dashed outside with me and we both saw the orb shrink suddenly to a small red light, which then changed directions and sped away from us at high speed toward the horizon, disappearing as it descended and was hidden by trees in the distance. \r\nmy cell phone was dead having been on all day at work. he didn't bring his phone because he doubted i was really seeing something but regretted it once in the backyard.\r\ni went back in the house, grabbed my camera and jumped in the car to head north to the far end of the lake. about 10 min later i turned around and came back, couldn't find anything. as i turned the car around he called to tell me the object had returned but was staying at a distance and looked like a red light. \r\nthe odd thing about the bubble/orb is that is vibrated and looked like it had an energy source inside that was vibrating like a tesla coil on the inside. the globe was translucent or frosted, concealing the light source inside. the light was darker reddish in the center and radiating out to be orange at the perimeter. the orb created a persistent ghost image as it moved. \r\nmy fiance' remarked \"now that was a real ufo.\" we are both familiar with aviation, astronomy and drones used for photography. this was not a drone. the lake is pitch dark at this time of night. 10 miles north is the beginning of the chickasaw indian territory

did they change color or flash. we jokingly laughed it off as u.F.O.'s. then within 5 minutes my girlfriend noticed something in the sky. she said look! it looks like a shooting star but it's moving in a zigzag. i've seen meteors before and this was definitely not a meteor. it never changed speed nor did it get brighter or dimmer in color. it stayed solid white and moved from south 40° off gulf coast northward in a straight line but occasionally zigzaged from left to right at about 45° turns til we lost sight at about 40° off of the northern horizon due to city lights. red orb sightings lasted about 1 minute on each orb and the last white star like object lasted about 7-10 minutes.

against clouds. for what seemed like four additional minutes, the object remained \"floating\".. and then unexpectantly, the object descended approximately 15 degrees exactly downward...It stopped for two seconds, and then appeared to go back up about 15% along the original line of descent. it stopped approximately two seconds again at the new apex, before starting another descent along the same original downward plane. the object descended extremely quickly, abnormally from any known aerial object. we lost track of the object as it disappeared from our line of site behind the house across the street. i tried to relocate the object using sight lines between the houses, but was unable to locate it. our neighborhood is generally a quite place, and we have no problem hearing audio of planes, helicopters, trains, but in this case, there were absolutely no sounds associated with the object. two civilian passenger airplanes  appeared through the clouds on opposite sides (east and west) about three minutes after the object descended. these planes were emitting normal looking exhaust, with a slight chem-trail lasting about five seconds behind the flight path. we are hoping other
