they were having a party. a hallway lead from the living room to the bedrooms and bath. mom and dads was the master bedroom at the end of the hall with it's own bath. mom wanted to put me in their bed so i would be farther away from the noise and be able to fall asleep. they were stringent about bed times. being five i had conquered the art of pretending to fall asleep.\"they were having a party!\" i wanted to see what the grown ups did for fun. i couldn't wait to sneak down the hall and scramble behind the couch. \r\n\r\nwhen mom placed me in their bed the first thing i noticed was the bed was enormous, it was a queen and i slept in a twin. it was the size of a pasture. mom kissed me and tucked me in then left right away. i didn't even have time to pretend to fall asleep for her to leave. now i had to guess how long i needed to wait for them to forget about me and sneak my way down the hall to get a glimpse of all the action. she came right back, 'crap.'\r\n\r\nthat wasn't her? it was somebody else and it was wearing a hoodie? i actually wouldn't know what a hoodie was for a couple more years but anyway. when the figure stepped through the threshold of the door they raised their left hand. it wasn't a hoodie, it was the grim reaper. a five foot tall insect wearing a black hood and cape with a large head and long thin fingers. i shuffled backwards away from him up the bed to the pillows. he took two steps and was right next to me. his arms reached out in an insect way, wavering back forth. i pulled the sheets as hard as i could over my head. the fear was the most intense i've ever felt in my life. he touched my forehead. i know what i saw and i would be 15 before i convinced myself it wasn't real. i forgot everything after that till the next day. 35 years later i discovered the truth. i was blacked out and abducted by a large insect.\r\n\r\ni had a photographic memory growing up.\r\n\r\n(1973) my dad was going to sell the ranch and begin a career of costume harvesting. he was meeting his new partner in this venture whom had a son one year older than me. we'd been friends for that whole day and where playing outside as it began to get dark.\r\n\r\nwe we're playing chase in brads backyard when brad chased me up a cherry tree. my only route of escape was to climb. brad was on my heels when i stopped because of what i saw. a red orb was flying in the sky. it was as big as a house and was playing like a firefly in the sky. shortly we began to believe it was playing with us, it seemed to go where we wanted. it seemed to be a living entity. then suddenly it shot away towards the eastern horizon then back again. it left towards the north accelerating at a 45 degree angle at over 10,000 miles an hour or more.\r\n\r\nthat's when a giant roman candle appeared in the sky to our right, or south. a white ball of light bleeding red, blue and green, then another in line being just above it, then another. then we could see the tiny parachute that held the first one. then another to the north and then we could see the silhouette of a military aircraft. a c-130. then we both realized the last flare had gone off directly over my parents ranch.\r\n\r\nwe turned and bolted towards the house only to meet our dads coming out the front door. they didn't have time to talk to us because my dads horses had jumped then fence and were in the highway.

strange, and we traveled a bit more southward towards helena, mt and the city lights were in view now.  then i again saw the circular light moving westward slowly and always at the same altitude.  the light moved past the city slowly and initially i thought it was some kind of special helicopter or plane.  but then it accelerated very, very quickly, and made a loud whip crack like noise like a sonic boom, and some sort of smoke ring or vapor ring was formed were it had been.  the noise was very loud cause i heard it in my car several miles away traveling southbound on 15.  so finally, when it shot westward extremely fast,  it traveled for several miles, and the light then disappeared.  this was all at the same altitude.  \r\n\r\ni waited to report this because i did not know who to

and face an open field next to our apartment complex. we're the only ones with this amount of an amazingly open field veiw at this complex. though it's an open field it is outlined with trees, some of which are close to our porch. from the porch of my 3rd story apt about 20-30ft out from me, just above a tree top, i looked up and out just in time to randomly see a dull orange/red orb come over and around a tree top right in front of me. i didn't sense it, it made no sound  at all, and even though it glowed orange and reddish orange it didn't cast enough light to shine on to anything. so with that being said if i hadn't just looked out at the view in front of me at that exact moment, i would have never seen it, i would have never known it was there at all. it moved fast and direct. staying just inches above the tree tops, moving decidedly around the tree tops. too fast, too silent and too weird of a light to be a drone, too close and too small to be mistaken for a plan or helicopter. a big storm was brewing in the next town over (broken arrow/tulsa) that we could easily see amazing lightening take place from, but the weather was very calm and pleasant where we were. almost no wind or noise, just a calm night. by the time i registered what i was seeing and started to say \"wow look at...\" to my husband, it was gone without a trace. the whole thing took place in under 10 seconds, my husband was lighting his cigarette while this was taken place and there for didn't see anything. it was the weirdest, yet curiously exciting moment ever. i've always believed with all my heart, no doubt about it, but had never seen with my own eyes. it's a 10 second moment i have played over and over and over again every single day since it happen. not a moment has gone by i don't think about it, not a night goes by i don't keep my eyes on the sky looking for... it or anything else like it. and the weirdset thing of all, it didn't fly away, shoot off or land. as soon as i made a sound to form the words wow, it was that exact moment, mid-flight past our porch it just fanished! gone. not up, not down, not hiding... light off in the blink of an eye, no traces left, gone. poof. and i've not been able to stop obsessing since. next day i had a strang, realistic dream during a midday nap. i felt the need to wake and check on my kids but when i tried to sit up and roll over i felt drugged, no strength, couldn't hardly move or open my eyes. i managed a weird flop and roll over, tried to say my daughters name but it sounded sluggish to my own ears. i managed to open my eyes just enough to be blinded by a very direct bright pin point of a light. i asked my husband later that day if he had come home from work on lunch and for some weird reason shined his phones flashlight in my face or something haha, but he said no definitely not. all i know is i must have immediately gone into a deep sleep and woke what felt like only 5 to 10 minutes later. everything was fine in the house. my daughter was asleep on the couch and my son was in his room on the xbox, everything seemed fine. then i noticed a wicked bad bruise on my left calf muscle with no explanation as to when or how i aquire it. a day or two later a solid white perfect circle appeared in the bruise, next day another perfect circle papered right next to the first, both in the middle of the bruise. that's also when i noticed there were sold pea diced hard lumps. one under each white circle in the bruise and the circles became outlined in perfect red lines that almost resemble spider veins but much softer, smaller and lighter. the bruises and red lines are gone now, but the hard mass is still very much there. also it stopped feeling like two individual pea sized knots, and started feeling more like the size and shape of a tylenol pill. as far as how all this makes me feel... mostly curious and ready. i feel ready, if that makes any sense? like something is about to happen that i want to happen and am relived? some fear of the unknown factors weasel in, but are far outweighed by excitement!","distance":"20 Feet or

sobre las 22:30 tiempo oficial aproximadamente en las coordenadas 39âº 55' n    0âº 37' w en el municipio de viver a unos 700m de altura. la noche era clara en un 4 sobre 5 de seing por lo que la magnitud que se podia alcanzar visualmente de las estrellas a ojo desnudo rondaba la 6âª.\r\naparecio una luz muy brillante hacia el sur-sureste completamente estatica de color amarillo anaranjado con un fuerte destello vibratorio de intensidad variable pero leve. se mantuvo estã¡tica a una altura de unos 20âº por encima de mi horizonte que yo estimo que seria de otros 15 o 20 por lo que no alcanzaria una altitud de 45âº con toda seguridad. ni el tipo de luz ni la posiciã³n me confirmaban que fuera un avion o helicoptero. estuvo estatica un minuto o dos y comenzo a desplazarse hacia el oeste al principio lentamente y luego con mas velocidad disminuyendo su brillo hasta desaparecer. estimo que recorreria un cuarto de hora de arco hasta desaparecer.\r\nni que decirle que jamas habia observado semejante cosa, por supuesto no era un dron, he visto varios y era imposible que la distancia que se encontraba, que luego pude mas o menos determinar, pudiera emitir esa luz.\r\nen pleno estado de estupefaccion y anotando los datos que le relato, habrian trascurrido unos 10 minutos del cese de la aparicion, volviã³ a aparecer de manera instantanea en el mismo lugar del horizonte y a la misma altura. no hubo ningãºn punto de luz que fuera incrementandose sino que fue un subito resplandor con la misma intensidad que la primera vez.\r\nen esta segunda ocasion se mantuvo estatico unos pocos segundos, tal vez 30 o 40 y comenzã³ de nuevo a moverse hacia el oeste pero esta vez se fue trasladando a mucha mas distancia. observe claramente que se desplazaba con velocidad claramente no uniforme, intercalaba movimientos largos rapidos con otros cortos mas lentos y ello daba la sensacion de que era segmentado. al mismo tiempo variaba la intensidad de la luz llegando en un momento a incrementar tanto la misma que pense que pudiera dirigirse hacia mi posicion.\r\neste segundo avistamiento duro unos tres o cuatro minutos y debido a los cambios de luminosidad constantes quede totalmente confundido en estimar la distancia a la que podria encontrarse ya que bien podia ser un objeto pequeã±o cercano o grande lejano.\r\nmis dudas se aclararon un poco cuando comenzo a descender ya sobrepasada la posicion sur- suroeste y comprobe que quedaba ocultado tras la sierra. el perfil de la sierra siempre fue claramente observable pues al encontrase tras ella la ciudad de valencia su alumbrado nocturno hace que sea perfectamente distinguible al recortarse ante ella.\r\nestimo por todo ello que debio ocultarse de mi vista a unos 10 o 12 km de mi posicion por las coordenadas 39âº 48' n.  0â° 38' w y que su aparicion fue en torno a 39â° 53'n  0â°35' w habiendo estado a una distancia de unos tres o cuatro km de mi posicion y a una altura estimada de unos 1000-1200 m sobre el nivel del mar y a unos 300-400 sobre el suelo.\r\npara terminar solamente insistir en que no he encontrado explicacion alguna a este avistamiento y por ello se lo comunico.","distance":"Over One

seemed to stay in the same place for a very long time approx two hours. at about 7am i went back to the window to check on the object the sun was rising and the object and greatly increased in altitude and was moving up and away to the sse. i estimate that the object was at an 70 degree angle while it was moving away. it was high and as the sun was coming up i vanished high in the sky. i was thinking it may have been a drone but when i last saw the object but it was really high in the sky. i tried to take some pictures but they did not turn out well. just a blurry white dot. i steadied the phone on the window to get a stable photo but the camera on the phone just wasn't sensitive enough to get a detailed photo. this was witnessed by me for about twenty minutes then i went to get my wife and we watched it together for awhile. we left the window to sit down and do some online searching for other possible explanations as to what we were seeing. we came back to the window

made a right-angle turn to my left and then faded out to nothing. i stayed outside for another 20 minutes, but i didn't see it again.  as soon as i came back into the house, i wrote down all the details i could remember. then i started filling out this form.\r\n\r\ni was very excited while watching it. about 2 minutes after i sighted it, a young man across the street came out of his apartment, so i hollered to him to look. he saw it for sure, but didn't seem very excited. he tried to explain it as a satellite with the sun (far below the horizon by 10:20 in august)shining on it. i've seen many satellites. they don't look anything like what i was seeing. they're star-sized and far away, like stars. and they look white. this orange sphere was about 2/3 the size a full moon is when it's all the way up in the sky.\r\n\r\ni knew i was looking at a ufo because i've read a lot about them and have personally witnessed 5, counting this one. my sister and parents have also witnessed ufos. the ones i saw were all different from one another--except the first one, in 1956, which was quite similar to the one i saw tonight. at around midnight, my boyfriend and i were driving down a woods road with a river to the right of it. we saw an orange sphere of light moving slowly towards the road from the left. it made no sound. it stopped and hovered over the wires right in front of us. we got out of the car to see it, but it zoomed off the way it came, fast. i wrote that incident up in mufon years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

there was lighting, i love storms. looked north west, and saw the towering clouds as the lighting lit them up. i saw a red light, and figured it was a plane, cause o'hare air port is close, but the red light had a different type of light. not a strobe, but faded in and out, but never going all the way out. and it seemed like it was a different type of light. almost more intense and direct. but after the one light, i saw another, then two more, then i saw a helicopter coming from the south heading north to the storm, all while these objects are appearing in the sky, just south of the storm that i had been watching. after the helicopter had gone by, i realized that there were more appearing and seemed like they were coming out of the storm way west of me,(moving south out of the storm), coming east and then moving north west again into the storm. i counted ten of these objects, not moving like the helicopter that flew by earlier. they were appearing in and out of the storm, not moving super fast right angles, but more abruptly than anything i've seen watching the skies close to o'hare air port. some times there were two together, but they were definitely following the same path. i do believe in life outside of our own planet, and thought i'd seen some weird stuff in the sky. but i truly believe that what i saw was not of this earth. i sent some family members a frantic, but excited number of texts, just because i had to tell someone. this is the most excited i have ever been about this subject, i feel like we are on the cusp of something great and possibly historic. i think something is getting ready to happen. good or bad...I am very happy to have witnessed what i have seen tonight, august 27th 2016. objects seen at on or around 9:30pm central time. no drinking or any other use of anything was going on during the event, but after what i saw, i cracked a beer, and after i finish this, i am going to drink a couple beers and stare at the north west sky, and hope for the best. i am not usually a very upbeat kind of person, but for some reason i feel like a million bucks since i saw what i have seen tonight. never really thought that i'd be doing something like this, but here it is...And it's the truth. thank you.
