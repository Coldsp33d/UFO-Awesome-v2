stepped out onto the street, i looked north (with my i-phone 6 in hand) and i was overwhelmed by the sight of a very strange cloud formation. it had three plumes jetting out of it and there was a ceiling of another cloud above it. it was so surreal and i said to my friend, “i’ve never seen anything like that before in my life!” at the same moment, i had a strange feeling that gave me a sense of it being “other worldly” and it gave me an odd but eerie feeling. (it should be noted that i was and still am, completely sober.) anyhow, i started taking photos of this strange cloud and realized that i had it set on “square” photo and then i switched it to “regular” photo after a few shots (just to explain the difference in layout). my friend was ready to go and stroll gay street, so i turned around on my heels and hopped in the street (as i often do) to take more photos of gay street looking south towards the tennessee theatre and the river. so i snap, snap, snap, etc. and then hop back on the sidewalk and take a couple more shots after that. during my short photo blitz, i was more focused on looking through my phone-camera than i was on looking at the sky, so i didn’t pick up the details that i had shot until i got home (about an hour and a half later). as i flipped through the evening’s shots, i could clearly see something in the sky of one of the shots and when zooming in, i discovered that i had photographed a fleet of bright green ufo’s! of course, i then took a much closer look at the photos before and after this particular shot and discovered that i had tracked this fleet coming out of the clouds (near a mountain which is lined with radio towers) and seconds later, they were on the opposite side of the sky over the tennessee river. in the next to the last shot, you can see two domed lights on top of the mountain (across the river).  note:  there are no lights on top of that mountain and my other photographs show it as completely dark. then in the last shot, you will notice the same two dome lights lifting off into the sky and there is also an orb-type ufo faintly seen in this shot as well. this last shot was taken out of series at 9:14 pm. (i think i just happened to catch them again while they were “taking off”). none of my photos before or after this series of gay street shots, show anything in the sky, nor specs on the lens, etc. i still have all these photos on my phone and i am happy to show anybody who would like to see the original shots so you can verify the time, date and that i have not retouched these in any way. i have only emailed them to myself and saved them to my desktop so i could put this slide show together. \r\ni should also mention that i have had close encounters (of several kinds) numerous times throughout my life. however, this is the first time that i have ever managed to take photographs of the visitors. not that it means much to those who don’t know me but i’m a very logical person, a respected professional in my industry (fine art painting) and a “normal” 49 year old mother. i hope these photos help open some minds on the topic. \r\n\r\nnote:  image # 4783 shows a much smaller green orb coming towards me, near the sidewalk.  also, when i zoomed way into each of these ufo's, there appears to be a violet/rose colored aura around each of them.  i also noticed that they seem to have 6 \"star-like\" points.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":78730,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.9626325,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272016-0015","longitude":-83.9167405,"occurred":1471639740000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1472311384000,"summary":"Photographed a \"fleet\" of ufo's traveling from out of the strange clouds near the radio signal towers to the mountain near the river in downtown knoxville..","tags":["photo","ufo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":81,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":25,"meantempi":77,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":72,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":81,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":25,"meantempi":77,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":72,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Knoxville, Tennessee","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:69746"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Bielefeld","country":"Germany","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was with my wife on our loggia (we live in an apartment complex close to the community center), and we had dinner. first, i noticed a flashing light in the sky, which i identified as a sports rotorcraft (there's a small airport not more than 3 miles away, suited for small airplanes). all of a sudden, i noticed another bright light in the sky, next to the airplane (distance and size unknown, since it was dusk), it hovered stationary for a few moments, then, flew some distance, until eventually, the light ceased. if it was a helicopter with a seach light, then it flew too high to observe it with our naked eyes. unfortunately, the event didn't last long enough to take any pictures or videos.

around 9pm-10pm. we started walking on the sidewalk, but it was late and not a busy street so we started to walk in the middle of the road. we walked for around thirty minutes down a couple blocks and started to circle back around to go home. the road we were on at the time was straight but then turned left and continued. we were looking in that directing, west, but were about five houses away from the turn. there is not a house on the turn, but a drainage ditch and a bridge immediately after the turn. on the side of the road there is an abundance of trees. we were looking over the tree tops because there had been a couple airplanes going to the local airport and we were glancing at the stars. then we heard a sort of low hum. i thought maybe someone had a refrigerator in their garage and it was kicking on. then my wife took me to look up and i saw what i thought was another airplane or maybe a helicopter. the ufo was about the same distance and location as the airplanes were when they were heading to the airport, but shortly after i noticed those two lights in the distance, the ufo very quickly descended below my light of sight over the trees. then almost instantly after i saw it disappear, it reappeared. it ascended from behind the trees and looked like it was sitting on top of the trees. i hovered there for about 5 seconds. it had the shape of a football, like an oval. it was dark and there was only one or two street lights around, so i did not notice any specific colors except it was dark, maybe black and grey. like graphite. then the ufo flashed an incredibly bright blue/white light at me and my wife. the light blinded us and stunned us. i remember after that i looked down and away and closed my eyes. my hands went to my eyes to shield myself and then the light was gone. so i rubbed my eyes because they hurt from the light. i opened my eyes but my vision was very blurry and i saw balls of light like you normally would after looking at a light for a while or at the sun. after probably fifteen seconds my vision came back and so did my wife's and we looked up and the ufo was gone. i felt dizzy and kind of sick, like i was nauseous. i was also disoriented and did not exactly know where i was at first. my wife said it was a ufo but i was skeptical. i thought it was a helicopter with a search light. but after i said that i realized it couldn't be that. a helicopter would not just ascend like that out of nowhere and disappear. and it was almost silent. so i then thought maybe it was a ufo. i had seen tv and events like this and that some had time missing. so i said to my wife maybe we have missing time. it was still dark so i did not think so but i checked anyways. i pulled my cell phone out of my pocket and i would not come on at first. but after pressing the button a couple of times it came on and it showed the time was around 12:30am. i first thought we were walking a long time, then i realized we hadn't been. we lost around one in a

light orbs circle. big orange balls of light work theyr way slowly across the sky and then disappear clearly into thin air as the stars around it do not move or go out of sight what so ever, the most crazy instance is when there is a very bright light that flashes over the tree tops almost like theres lightning striking up from the ground rather than the sky. all of these things happen either east over the atlantic or south east right on the water line. use this information to your best and hopefully someone will discover something amazing here. hopefully im not just loosing my marbles and am
