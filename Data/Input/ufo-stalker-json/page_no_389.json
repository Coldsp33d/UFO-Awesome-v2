position, she was flying n to s in a angle of 75 to 80 degrees very slow, pulsing all the time. i start to do light signals, and she stops, turns to east and come above my house positioning at south of me in an angle of almost 90 degrees, then starts to flying around me and maybe because of that plane the last time i see her was at south, this night the moon was also at south of me in quarter crescent.\r\n\r\none hour later i was like always with my head turned up, searching the skies and certainly a cloud of fireflies start to shower all over my house, i was recording this when i spot the blue orb, running at an imaginable speed, direction the sea nw, never see such speed in a object man made in my entire life, it was at the level of a meteorite. previously, in this year at 8 of july and last year same month, i have seen this clouds of fireflies, but because there light are very tiny i was not able to record them, only with binoculars, they came inside a oxidized copper green colour like, mist or cloud. first one i observed above the forest, the second one above the military nato deposit near me, this ones coming from west, from the sea, and finally all over me, and on this very not normal valley where i live. i believe this images are rare and i hope my work serves something directed to science and development of our universal human conscience, why here all this sightings? that is the investigation i am doing, 80% of this light goes ne, i hope in my time of life i found the answer.\r\nmy apologies for the bad cam and recording i am just one with 2 hands and if you could get the images better i appreciated.(not easy to upload from here 2and try)\r\nthank you  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

morning it was about 130 am and it was raining i was out side having a smoke and i was looking at this cloud like i had been for a long time and while i was looking at this cloud i notice these star like lights appear and there were many of these lights and these lights were flashing there lights at me i could not believe that they were watching me and they started to come out of the clouds and they were like putting on a show they were flying over the trees and it went on for about an hour.Then these lights went to one corner of the sky under the clouds and they were doing someting i don't know what but then out of that cloud that was lit up this big ball of light came out of this colud and it went over to the little star like lights and something happened and they went away and then this ball of light was going back into that cloud but then it truned around and came straight down to me i had my video camera. but i thought i was going to die i was so scared so scared i hit the ground this thing came in so fast i didn't have to to hit the deck it was over me i could not beleive what was happening i still have not gotten over it? anyway i got up slowly and i looked at this thing i was inside this thing it was like mist or ghost like and it was really big i mean big it was about 300ft long? and i looked at this thing and my spine was in pian so scared and i said hello to

parish priest was driving me back to boarding school in hamilton that night after having dinner at my parents house in camperdown,we were driving back and it was that sought of night where you did not need to put on your headlights,but we did as it was a full moon and not a cloud in the sky.\r\n2.It was actually father flanagan who noticed it first.He said can you see that? i said no. then i saw it also, and he asked me what i thought it was? to which i replied it was a ufo.Now father was an amateur astronomer who used to take students for science activities at night looking through his 2 telescopes at the heavens.\r\n3.We stopped the car and got out to observe the object,during our observations we went through everything we thought that the object could be.The object was less than 100 feet away from us.We said is it a blimp, no there were none in australia at that time.Only the goodyear blimp in the usa.Was it a reflection off something? no. was is an astronomical anomaly of some thing? no.Was it that we were both hallucinating and imagining the object in front of us?No. are we both sane and normal? yes.Father said to me not to tell anyone about this as it was totally removed from his catholic religion and he did not want anyone to find out about our sighting. the object we saw at close range was massive 100' to 120' in diameter and between 600'and 700' long, there was no sound at all, there were no flashing lights,you could not see any join marks or rivet marks ,but was seamless not a dint in the exterior metalwork ,the ends of the vessel were perfectly rounded,the were no extrusions ,exhausts,fins engine openings no visible hatches,doors anything.The object was about 50' off the ground and hovering just to the back of a house that was there.We did not speak to the occupants if there was any as we were concerned about being abducted or whatever.We climbed back into the car and drove the car from one end of the object to the other this is how we arrived at the approximate size of the object. we got out and continued to observe the object until father flanagan said i think it was time that he got me back to boarding school.\r\n4. the object was perfect in every detail there is no way that we could manufacture an object that big and cold fly,float not move and be completely silent.So there was no movement whatsoever,up down,sideways forward or backwards.They had obviously mastered antigravity and speed of light propulsion. \r\n5. i think both of us felt privileged to have witnessed this sighting it changed my beliefs in life in the universe.To this day i have not spoken to father flanagan who is still parish priest in hamilton;victoria and i would like to know what are his thoughts about our sighting today ,he is a lot older than me.I am not sure what you people think , but i now believe that there are an incredible number of civilisations out there and that we should be looking at classifying the different types of ufos seen where ,when and the time,the 50s were saucers, the 60s various 70s cylinders. 80s boomerangs, 90s wings.20s v shapes and various. that could be 7 or 8 different civilisation that have travelled enormous distances to check us out.\r\n6.We left the object exactly where we found it.I have always wondered if there was anyone living in the house at that time and weather they noticed anything. if you were asleep in the house it would not have woken you as it made no sound.","distance":"21-100

pool. my grandmother noticed the blinking light, pointing it out because it was too bright, white, and periodical to be a lightening bug. it was hovering about 20 feet off the ground. it blinked every second for a little less than a second. at this point it wasn't in the sky, as it was between us and the garage. the only other nearby lights came from inside the house, and they didn't reach where the light was coming from, so we couldn't see the source of light, and it didn't continue moving so that it reached the light. the three of us watched it and talked about it for about five minutes until i went inside the house to grab my phone and describe it to the others who were inside. my mom came out to see it, but it was gone by the time we got back to the deck. my grandmother said it had floated back around the corner, out of sight. i don't know if it's important but she also said she and my sister had shouted at it, something along the lines of 'don't mess with us' and 'we don't want to go with you,' i don't remember specifically. we described it to my mom, who prompted the idea that it may have been a drone. i considered it, but am personally skeptical due to the fact that it was relatively quiet that night and we didn't hear noise coming from the light that would likely have come from a drone. my mom and i went to the front of the house to see if the light had moved that far, but we did not see it. there was a moment where a light flashed in front of my eyes, but that was likely due to reflection from inside or off of my mom's earring onto the lens of my glasses. we went back to the back deck, and my mom went back inside, but i stayed in case it came back. a few minutes later we spotted it again, this time in the tops of the trees in front of the house, the same white blinking light. we watched it slowly move through and around the tree tops, circling the house, it went from the trees in the front yard to the back yard and back to the front. we knew it wasn't a plane because it was much too close to the ground, only had one light brighter than any lights that you could see on planes, and did a loop in the sky, not the straight route across the sky that planes typically take. we lost sight of it after it seemed to go back to the trees in the front yard. during and after the sighting my actions and the actions of the other witnesses were normal, it didn't do anything to us but freak us out a little, it's not every day you see a literal unidentified flying object.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

a summer night around dusk back in the early seventies my family and i were on our way to evening church service. as soon as we exited the back door we looked up and saw a saucer shaped craft hovering

40 ft in diameter.It had a glowing ring of light around the mid section. my parents, brother and i looked at it for several mins. my older sisters were terrified and ran in to the house. the craft slowly began to rise and we gathered all of our family to follow it. it moved slowly northward towards mt. doug. we followed it for 5-8 mins. it went behind the mountain and disappeared. that was the last we saw it. to this day neither of my sisters can recall the incident, yet my parents, brother and i can remember it vividly. the entire encounter was approx 15-20 mins. in my mind there was no doubt what it was.Over the years i have told the story to a few friends but have met mostly with disbelief and laughter. it has not affected my life in any way, good or bad. i recently saw on one of

see it since it looked so odd. i decided to go outside to take a picture of it but it was so bright i just held the phone up to the sky and pushed the button without being able to see the screen. i went back into the house to look at the picture since it was darker inside and i noticed the white/green orb in picture. i went back outside and took another shot to see if it would be in the picture again and it was. i could not see any orb or object in the cloud or the sky with my naked eye. i went back in to show the pictures to my partner, and he thought it could be the moon. i went back out to see and there was no moon in sight. i took a few more shots from slightly different angles trying to get the sun out of my eye to see if i could actually look or focus on what i was photographing so there are some differences in the angles of the pictures . \r\n\r\nafter reviewing the pictures, i noticed that in the ones where the orb is not visible, there is an object in the sky, with a silver/gray color. in two of the photos, the shape is less easy to distinguish. one of the photos, it clearly has a triangular shape. the object can be seen in the upper left corner of the pictures where there is no orb.\r\n \r\nthe orb looks perfectly round in some of the photos but in others there is some sort of shadows or change in shape or something is obscuring part of the shape. the orb is not in the same place in the photos. if you notice, there is the same tall tree in most of the pictures for perspective. there is also an airplane in the middle of the cloud formation in the second

see it since it looked so odd. i decided to go outside to take a picture of it but it was so bright i just held the phone up to the sky and pushed the button without being able to see the screen. i went back into the house to look at the picture since it was darker inside and i noticed the white/green orb in picture. i went back outside and took another shot to see if it would be in the picture again and it was. i could not see any orb or object in the cloud or the sky with my naked eye. i went back in to show the pictures to my partner, and he thought it could be the moon. i went back out to see and there was no moon in sight. i took a few more shots from slightly different angles trying to get the sun out of my eye to see if i could actually look or focus on what i was photographing so there are some differences in the angles of the pictures . \r\n\r\nafter reviewing the pictures, i noticed that in the ones where the orb is not visible, there is an object in the sky, with a silver/gray color. in two of the photos, the shape is less easy to distinguish. one of the photos, it clearly has a triangular shape. the object can be seen in the upper left corner of the pictures where there is no orb.\r\n \r\nthe orb looks perfectly round in some of the photos but in others there is some sort of shadows or change in shape or something is obscuring part of the shape. the orb
