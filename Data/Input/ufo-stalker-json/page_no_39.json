outside and continued to watch over them. then, in the west corner of my yard, i spotted an eerily bright light, peeking through the trees. i walked towards it in order to take a closer look, and it seemed to me an obviously bizarre, horizontal crescent shape. on closer inspection it looked to be a solid oval shaped object, with its bottom half glowing. even though by instinct i knew it was not a normal light, i began to reason that it was probably a street light in the distance. the object at this point (to my view), was below the tree line. i then proceeded to disregard it for a whole 10 minutes while i was in the yard. lol, probably not the best idea. i did keep partial watch over it, though. i observed that it was completely still and silent. didn't move a centimeter from my view, and made absolutely no noise. even though it gave off a very bright light, the brightness seemed contained, so it didn't light up anything around it. after about ten minutes of walking and dancing (hey, i was bored) around the yard, i let my dogs back inside the house. i took my eyes off of the object for about 30 seconds while in my house. i was still very curious about this bright object so, i walked back outside and made a beeline to the area i saw it before. right then, i saw something above me, from the corner of my eye. i looked up, and while i wasn't looking the object had moved across half my yard and was now in the sky high up above the tree line. it was also much closer to me now. scared the hell out of me. it was even then very still, and emitted no noise. i pulled out my phone and took two pictures of it. the first turned out clear, but there seems to be another light in the picture, no idea what that is. also, even though to my eye the illuminated part of the object appeared to be crescent shaped, my phone picked it up to be a different shape. when i tried to take a second photo, the object on my screen turned to a full glowing circle, and then my whole phone screen lit up white. that photo came out black. i assumed it didn't want me to take pictures, and since i was also thoroughly freaked out(and alone), i rushed back inside. i checked after two minutes to see if it was gone. it was. i had no idea how large the object was, and had no reference points to gauge its distance from me. i think that it was possibly watching me, since it only moved when i briefly went inside.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":90058,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.550487099999998,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02062018-0015","longitude":-98.2815335,"occurred":1514147400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1517931803000,"summary":"Oval

north shore of lake ontario. last night at about 7:35 pm i was looking south out my back yard patio door when i saw a large orange orb approaching slowing from the south southwest. this area is in the flight path from toronto's pearson airport which is about 35 kilometres west of ajax and i am very familiar with the air traffic in the area which typically moves west to east (takeoff) or vice versa (landing). there were no flashing navigation lights and the  the object was about the size of a penny held at arms length with its luminosity remaining bright but constant throughout the sighting. it approached slowing from the south from over lake ontario in the northerly direction under the cloud cover at an altitude of about 500 to 1000 feet.  i brought the object to my wifes attention and we watched the object as it changed direction slightly and proceeded at about the same altitude and speed following the lake shore moving west to east. i asked my wife for her cell phone so i could take pictures and by the time she had given me the phone the object had moved west about a kilometre or 2 along the shore line until it disappeared beyond my line of sight at 7:43. i managed to snap 5 or 6 pictures by which time the object was considerably smaller. when i first viewed the object it appeared to be a single object but upon viewing the pictures the object was seemingly 2 bright disc like objects side by side with pillars of light extending upwards similar to the shape of xmas trees. the series of photos shows the object changing shape slightly as the glowing interior of the light seemed to be on fire ( best description ) one of pictures also shows what appears to be an appendage on the bottom the very centre of the disc  it is worth noting the pickering nuclear plant is about 2-3 miles to the west of my residence. the entire sighting lasted only a minute or 2. \r\nregrettably my wifes cell phone does not currently have the facility to send photos via email but i am working
