2016).  my brother lives in georgetown, ontario, canada.  georgetown is about 20 minutes northwest of brampton, ontario.  being in the greater toronto area (and therefore close to pearson international airport), residents of georgetown see many large airplanes flying over day and night. on sunday morning (between 9am-10:30am, august 21, 2016) we were outside on the patio enjoying morning coffee.  the sky looked spectacular with real neat cloud formations - cirrus clouds too.  i thought some sky pics would look great for my facebook page and so over the course of 51 minutes i took a series of photos with my samsung galaxy s7 edge (camera was set to 12mp mode).  i did not use any zoom, merely aimed and shot pics. at the time neither i, my wife, my brother nor his wife saw anything unusual in the sky other than clouds, airplanes and bright blue sky. it was not until an hour later when viewing the pics that i notices a bright blue spherical shaped object in one of the pics.  i thought perhaps it was debris on the lens or something but quickly ruled that out as some pics had the blue sphere while others did not.  in total, the sphere appears on 5 of my approximately 12 shots.  when i zoomed in on the object i was surprised to see a solid object with weird protrusions on the surface.  when i examined the 5 photos more closely, i noticed the objects trajectory was perhaps from an 60 deg incline down to perhaps 30 degree incline.  but on the final shot, the object reversed course and ascended to perhaps a 40 degree incline in the span of 1 minute - i say this because the pics are time stamped.  so the first pic (highest elevation) perhaps 60 deg incline, second last pic 30 degree incline and last pic about 40 degree - all relative to my position of course.  the sequence of shots total 51 minutes, beginning at 9:18 am and ending at 10:09 am.  again, i am not an eye witness to this event - we did not see anything other than clouds and large airplanes. note:  these pics were not edited in any way. i have included one pic of a large aircraft for a sense of scale as well.  zoom in to see closer look of object and airplane.\r\n\r\n[name

called amazing space videos and from what i can see it doesnt seem like that channel talks about those weird events at all. this channel has other live videos like a live video of the sun but anyways i continued to watch this live video and went on my phone then looked up at my screen when i seen a star like light on the screen so i took a video of the live video and rewinded it and it looked like everytime it went under a cloud it would literally shine like a star and this orb like object was moving towards the sattelites direction so it could stay in the view of it. my reaction was confused because when i seen this object it looked fake or cgi because it looked like a cliche type of star but when it went under clouds is was like shining a light behind a tree because you can see it was under the clouds even when it was under because it was bright, it looked 100% real but i reccomend an expert look at the primary source of the vid after looking at this one the title should be in my video too because it was a live video on the iss. it dissapeared a min after following the view of the iss live video, i dont know how because it was under a group of clouds but didnt shine when it got under the last group of clouds but it did seem as if it shined everytime it went under a cloud. this event happened at 7:05 pm central time while i was watching this video at my house. the time might be different where the object was because this is a live video of the iss orbiting earth meaning it was most likely somewhere else and in the the video you can see this object over an ocean than once you see land which is toward the end of the video it dissapears and the video i sent in is me filming the part where it occured after it goes into the clouds i click the live video button which as you can see shows land so its now over land and the objects not in sight but was in sight while over the ocean. other people saw the light but i decided to report it because it was beyond

of an exceptionally brilliant, and vibrant red star to my right side, or directionally due nne. at about 50 degrees elevation, it grew to a size that seemed to me to be travelling directly toward me at an incredible speed. it appeared to come to a stop, where it neither 'grew', nor shifted in any noticeable manner.\r\ni had about 15 to 30 seconds, in which i stared at the object as it rhythmically pulsated an extremely vibrant, and intense red. almost as if it was burning, yet it had more of the quality of light, only exceptionally brighter. it also had a vibrating, arythmic throbbing shiftiness accompanying the consistent pulsating.\r\nat this time, it began its travel, in a straight line, to the western skyline over what seemed like the strathcona, downtown vancouver city center. i'd say it travelled 3-5 kilometres in half as many seconds. it then came too dead stop. pausing for a split second, then shot up about 50-100 feet. while doing this movement, the glow steadily diminished....\r\n\r\nat this time i ran inside, to my apartment, to grab my partner so she could witness is also. i knew that i shouldn't, i should've stayed, but my cameras were inside as well. i love need up grabbing my phone and ipad for cameras and ran outside...\r\n\r\nat about 1-2 minutes later, i'm fiddling with turning these contraptions on while i'm watching the object top burning almost completely, and 'morph' into a flat, convex black shape, retaining some of the red, but weakly. \r\nthe resulting 'object' shot off to the wsw for no more than 2 seconds and vanished, leaving no trace.\r\n\r\nit was then that i heard a jet overheard racing towards the area, where it made 6-7 circles over the area where it vanished, before heading back east, over my head.\r\n\r\ni

sky in my area was labeled 'clear'. i went out on my deck and saw the most clear sky i have seen in a while. since the view was so clear, i went back inside and grabbed a beer and went back out on the deck. i was staring at this spot of sky for at least 15 minutes and did not see anything out of the ordinary, except the stars. \r\n\r\n2. this object which i thought was just one of the stars in the night sky, began to move slowly from left to right, and that grabbed my attention immediately.  \r\n\r\n3. it had the motion of a man-made satellite, because i have seen satellites before in the night sky. but any satellite i saw in the past, was always in motion when i noticed it in the night sky. however the object i saw was stationary for a good 15 minutes before it moved.\r\n\r\n4. the object looked like a star, and was in the sky motionless for at least 15 minutes. during that time i thought nothing of it, and just enjoyed the view star-gazing. then the object began to move, left to right in a line that looked to go with the curvature of the earth. at this point my eyes were locked on the object and immediately i was thinking, is this a satellite? the movement, left to right, was slow but at a constant speed. it moved in a slightly curved line for about 10-12 seconds before the object changed direction. when the object changed direction, it was still in a curved line, but now opposite of the curvature of the earth, but still left to right. if i had to describe the path, i would say a really stretched 's'. when the object changed direction, the size of the dot slowly got smaller and smaller before disappearing. this took about 2-3 seconds. the speed of the object during this time was constant.\r\n\r\n5. my first feelings were super excited! i have always wanted to see a ufo, and i almost could not believe my eyes. when i saw this object i was fixed on it, would not leave the area to get anyone, just kept staring at the object. i was trying to rule out what it could be in my head while watching it in motion. once it vanished from the night sky, i kept looking at the sky waiting for another sighting. my adrenaline was pumping! i called my friends and some family members almost immediately. \r\n\r\n6. the object changed direction away from the earth and the white dot got smaller and smaller and smaller, until it vanished.

first high above like before, than an instant later was at the top of the fence posts on the passenger side of the car.  if we went up a hill, or around a bend, or whatever it went up the hill, or around the bent keeping level with the car's passenger's side window and the car top.  we got spooked after about 30 minutes of this.  i said we should stop and see who they were and what they wanted.  my mom said \"drive\".  this conversation happened repeatedly over the next 5 hours.  the craft/light started as a dull black presence which in the ??Center started a light (glowing pulsing and then erupted) that elongated both up and down, the length and height of the craft/light every few seconds, then the light would kind of collapse in on itself back into the center.  it would be dark for just a second or so at most, and then the process would start again.  this happened the entire time.  but it did not light up the fields under or around, or the fence itself.  you saw those, what little you could see at night, from the headlights of my car.  there was no other traffic on that highway at night. \r\nit seemed from the shape and size of the light to be 4-5 times as long as my datsun station wagon and so tall i in the driver's seat could not see the top even looking through the windshield.  it was darker and seemed denser than the surrounding area.  you felt like \"they\" were watching and listening because when getting to within 3 miles of home i said \"if they follow us home, do we have enough food to feed these people??\"  we went around the last bend in the road before home they just were gone.  there one minute and gone the next.

than the rest of them.\r\n although i could not see the outline of the ship, i could see different colored lights around the perimeter. i assume they were disc shape.  i was unable to get a good video of the incident because my battery kept being drained and my phone kept turning off. that is why my videos don't show a whole lot and that is also why the videos i've attached are only a couple seconds long because they kept disabling my phone. \r\nthey wouldn't emit the flashes of light while my phone was on but is soon as my phone had been disabled the flashes of light probably five times in a row after that. i lost sight of them because not only my phone had died but they weren't leaving and one of them had even started to come towards me so i close the window and stayed in my home.\r\ni have also seen them to the east of me at a limestone mine near my home. \r\nalthough this report was my last observation i have seen them around this area for the last three years. i have

Unknown","city":"Pflugerville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On 08/18 an individual from ohio reported three lights in a triangle shape while observing a meteor shower.  i first viewed this...Phenomenon, thing, whatever...In blue springs, mo during memorial day week 2016, and it was witnessed every night that week. what struck me was that this formation appeared to be in geo-synchronous orbit as it did not move in the sky over a period of hours, every night, though its position changed just slightly a couple nights.  the attached picture titled 1.Jpg is the best view of the full formation.  all of the pics taken in missouri were taken with my lg g5 cell phone.\r\n\r\nhere's where it starts getting weird (though the geo-sync part was pretty weird itself). the object that appears to be at the point of the triangle would, not pulsate, but the bottom of the object/craft would extend down in a white light and then retract back up into the object/craft.  i kept trying to get a picture of this odd occurrence, and the pic titled 2.Jpg shows the only thing i could capture.  i have absolutely no proof of this, but swear i could see it emitting hundreds/thousands of very small, unlit objects (possibly orbs) that ultimately returned to the object/craft.  it is at this point that i really started to question my sanity. i have at least a couple dozen pics taken with my cell phone while in missouri.\r\n\r\ni live in the austin area.  i watch this same formation above my house every night, clouds not withstanding.  the \"point\" object tends to be the one to exhibit the pulsating activity (for lack of a better way to describe it) most often, however can be observed on the other two objects as well. the objects are bright white and seem to have a small red light on the top.  they also appear to me to be outside of our atmosphere. the formation i view from my house does not stay in geo-sync orbit, but it seems to make a shift as it moves with the earth's rotation.  i have never actually witnessed any of the objects moving.\r\n\r\nthere are at least two other such objects/craft that i see in the sky that don't appear to be part of a triangle formation...One of which ultimately seems to transform to a dull green light and move to a different location.  this is truly surreal to me and the fact that its so obvious in the sky that it seems it has to be observed by thousands of people other than myself, and a few folks i've pointed it out to.\r\n\r\nthe objects are not visible in the daytime, become visible during late dusk and remain visible at dark.  it is very hard to get decent pictures of this. pics 1, 2, 3 and 4 were taken with said cell phone, all in missouri. pic 5 was taken in texas with a nikon d500 on a tripod with a 200mm lens. it is one of the \"solo\" objects and appears to show the projection/extension that i mentioned coming out of the craft, but you can't see the craft it is emanating from.\r\n\r\nhas my imagination run away with me, or have i finally lost it for sure?  these objects are so obvious in both missouri and texas...And apparently in ohio as well.  i'd love to know more about this.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
