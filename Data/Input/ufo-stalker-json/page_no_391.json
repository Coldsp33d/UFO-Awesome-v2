\r\n\r\nnotre observation a eu lieu le 1er aoã»t 2016 entre 23 h et minuit, aux coordonnã©es suivantes : 47â°01'31.9\"n 72â°28'38.2\"w. sous un ciel sans lune et totalement dã©gagã©, dans le ciel de la zec tawachiche au quã©bec, moi, ma femme et mon garã§on de 24 ans venions observions des persã©ides et mãªme de voir un bolide traversant le ciel dâ€™ouest vers lâ€™est. en scrutant le ciel ã  la recherche dâ€™autres ã©toiles filantes ou bolides, une lumiã¨re se dã©plaã§ant trã¨s haute dans le ciel a attirã© notre attention. il y avait une lumiã¨re qui venait de lâ€™est et se dirigeait vers lâ€™ouest et qui ressemblait ã  un passage normal de satellite. soudainement la lumiã¨re est devenue plus brillante comme cela arrive parfois avec le reflet du soleil sur les panneaux solaires des satellites ou de la station mir. soudainement la lumiã¨re sâ€™est mis ã  scintiller juste avant de faire des bons instantanã©s en ligne droite dâ€™assez longue distance en disparaissant pour rã©apparaã®tre plus loin pour ensuite changer de direction ã  angle droit vers le nord, la lumiã¨re a ensuite stoppã© net et a changã© ã  nouveau de direction, mais cette fois-ci vers le sud, totalement ã  lâ€™opposã© tout-en dâ€™ã©crivant un arc dans le ciel mais ã  moindre vitesse et distance. la lumiã¨re ã  fait un autre bon toujours en directions sud pour ensuite faire un dernier bon en ligne droite toujours dans la mãªme direction et de disparaã®tre pour ne plus le revoir cette nuit-lã .\r\n\r\nnous avons observã© ce mãªme phã©nomã¨ne ã  deux autres reprises soit le 2 et le 3 aoã»t suivant et toujours dans les mãªmes conditions mã©tã©orologiques. la provenance de la lumiã¨re ã©tait sensiblement la mãªme. donc la lumiã¨re se dã©plaã§ait dâ€™est en ouest et toujours en faisant des bons rectilignes, mais cette fois-ci, la lumiã¨re faisait aussi des bons de haut en bas ã  angle droit. par la suite elle a continuã© son chemin pour disparaã®tre en une autre fraction de seconde.\r\n\r\npour la premiã¨re fois de ma vie, je ne pouvais expliquer ã  mon ã©pouse et ã  mon garã§on ce que nous venions de voir (dâ€™observer) dans le ciel.\r\n\r\np. -s. jâ€™aimerais bien

technical problems of camera shooting but after going to a camera place they told me that those dots appeared because there where something there otherwise it would not show them. so i leave it to

pulled over i jumped out and as to my amasement it was hovering right above a house it seemed to be about 20 or so feet above but it could have been more. it was solid black triangl with a snub nose and it had 3 bright lightson each of its corners. the texture on the side of it was like if you take a fork and scower the side of it by pulling it down it was texered like that.I remember my step dad saying that it was some kind of military craft and i told him no way because it never made a sound.It just hovered there and it was so quiet.I staired at it for about 3 or4 minits and i was not afraid at all, kind of like it was calling to me as i wanted to stay and admire it more and even to approach it when my dad told me to get into the truck now! and i didn't want to.,but i did and we drove

a very bright orange light in the sky unlike anything i had ever seen before. the brightness of it was what got my attention, the way it was glowing and the color made it look like a street light, but i've never seen one that way and this thing looked way too big for that.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was that it may be the moon behind cloud cover, but the moon was almost directly above me at the time and there was no cloud cover that night. i still haven't thought of anything else it might be.\r\n\r\ni couldn't make out any features on the object, as it was very dark and the object was far enough away that i wouldn't be able to see any details on it. the lights on it seemed to cover up any details i might have noticed. i had my phone out and was recording video of it, and when i was zoomed in i noticed it looked like two separate lights with a small gap in between them. the whole time it was here, it never moved. after about a minute, the object began to shrink and gradually turned pure white. after about two minutes, the object faded away and i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\na couple hours before the sighting, while in the office i started feeling uneasy. it felt like something was watching me from just out of sight, and i felt like i was in danger, and that something bad had happened, or was about to happen. i have never felt like that at work before and ignored it and followed my usual routine. this feeling persisted from roughly 9pm to around midnight. when i saw the object, my first reaction was that feeling of fear, but it was quickly replaced by a feeling that i needed to record as much of this as i possibly could. after the object disappeared, i felt strangely calm and peaceful for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object when it slowly faded away roughly two minutes after i first saw it. i'm not sure if it was still there but out of sight, or how long it had been there before i saw it. shortly after it disappeared, i heard several loud popping noises in quick succession from its direction, but i am not sure if the sounds are related to the object or not.\r\n\r\ndo note that the video i have attached contains profanity, and i do not know anything about editing videos.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

frequently watch the stars, i knew it wasn't supposed to be there, and i got very excited.  this thing was big, about 4mm tall, and trapezoidal with the top about 2mm and the bottom about 3 mm.  i watched for about 15 seconds as red, green and blue lights blinked randomly.  i went inside and got my wife and 20 year old son.  as the 3 of us observed the object, it started to dart left and back to the right about half a dozen times.  after hovering motionless for a couple minutes, it shot down and back up again 3 times.  it then started to move in fast, tight circles for about 5 seconds before returning to its original position.  or at least as near as i could tell.  after several minutes of inactivity, my wife started googling while my son and i continued to watch.  over the next 1/2 hour, my son and i watched it through binoculars and tried to get it on film, but our cameras were inadequate for the low light levels.  also over that same time span, it slowly drifted to the north and farther away.  this i discern from its shrinking size.  about 40 minutes after first observing it, it grew too small to see.  \r\nwhen i first saw it, i was excited.  then when it started moving...Giddy might best describe my feelings.  disappointment when it was gone.  \r\nover the next 4 nights, the 18th through the 21st, we have observed as many as 9 of these lighted, blinking objects.  on the 19th we had an additional observer, a friend from town.  based on this, i have every reason to believe they will be back tonight.  additional report(s), to follow, hopefully we'll get some pictures/video.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

red earth creek. leaving at five 3 am to be at work for 630 was a common thing  i know it would've been thursday  in the early morning hours .  there was no clouds in a decent mood light the moon was behind us . we pulled out of town i was about to make the right-hand turn when i noticed something hovering in an open cut line almost level with me about 150 yards from the road . i remember my wife was digging through her purse to make sure she had her id and her wallet . i remarked what i was looking at you she looked up and we both exclaimed there's something i've never seen before she quoted what the hell is that ?  hovering about 30 feet above the trees was a disc shaped dark item surrounded by an outer ring of lights that looked about 5 feet apart.  i knew it was rotating because the multicoloured lights on the outer ring when i could see one disappear on the left side of the craft a new one would appear on the right side i open the door to my truck which upset my wife tremendously . i explained to her that i didn't want to see it through window i wanted to see it with my own eyes i leaned out the truck door with my feet on the pavement and watched it for approximately three minutes the craft stayed right where it was the whole time .  i could hear a very low frequency him when i was outside the truck i shut the lights off in the truck and the second i did that it travelled west away for me at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view in about two seconds .  i have never actually reported this incident although it has definitely changed my views on extraterrestrial life i always said you can't tell me what i saw with my own eyes .  many years later i was talking to my ex-wife and i wanted to see if her recollection of that night was the same as mine and they are exactly the same mine with a little more detail because i think it affected me a little bit deeper than her .\r\n\r\n i work in the area again now 20 years later and i look up at the sky all night during night shifts.\r\n\r\n i could still photograph the area and give detailed maps of its location and it's direction of travel if need be .","distance":"21-100

event, no longer than 10 seconds before we lost sight of it. we were driving and trees blocked our view very soon after we saw it, and when the trees cleared, i pulled my phone out to take a picture,
