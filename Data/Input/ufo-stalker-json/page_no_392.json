had not risen yet so the milky way was clearly visible as well as many other constellations that are normally difficult to see. we saw many satellites and a couple of shooting stars.  we even saw one satellite flash us as it's solar panels must have reflected light from the moon or sun briefly.  about 10:10 pm or so (i'm judging from the time we went outside to the time we saw the object. neither of us had a watch or phone with us), i saw what i just assumed was a satellite moving across the sky in a west/southwest direction.  what confused me is that it was flashing.  about once a second it would get approximately twice as bright as a typical satellite.  my wife noticed it shortly after i did, as i was still trying to figure out what it was.  she asked me what it was and suggested that it was an airplane.  there were a couple of large jets flying over at the time traveling in a similar direction.  i told her that it wasn't a plane of any kind.  there were no colored lights and the only light similar to one we were seeing would be landing lights.  they don't flash and they point forward.  i couldn't tell where this light was \"pointed\" but it did not seem to be any kind of landing light from a plane.  the light was typically a slight shade of blue and flashed brightly white.  again, the light was similar to a satellite.  i suggested that maybe it was a fast spinning satellite that was repeatedly flashing us.  in fact, told the wife that had to be what it was.  it was traveling faster than the jets in the area and quickly caught up to and passed one of the jets while continuing in a straight line from straight above us, where we first noticed it, to about 15 degrees above the western horizon.  i was content with the idea that it was a rotating satellite and was pleased to see something that i had not seen before.  then as i continued to watch it, it slowed down in it's path and slowly changed course.  this happened quite slowly and i questioned if i was really seeing it move out of it's original trajectory.  my wife asked if i saw it change direction, i confirmed and we began intently watching it now moving in a northerly direction from our perspective.  it could have been moving west or east as well which was difficult to determine from our perspective, but the light did not appear to be getting brighter or more dim. although at this point it was far enough away that we could only casually see it when it was bright.  the flashing consistency never noticeably changed from the roughly 1 second interval.  it continued to move what appeared to be north, very slowly, until it passed behind the tree line near our property.  the whole experience lasted maybe 8-10 mins.  we discussed what we had just seen for several minutes and could not come up with any reasonable explanation.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

driving home at about 10:15 pm when he saw the object flying in the air. it was a single glowing red-orange light floating about 150 feet in the air, irregularly pulsating. he immediately could tell it wasn’t a plane or helicopter, as he came closer to the neighborhood he said that the light grew in intensity and brightness before flashing and emanating what he described as “sparks and drops of liquid metal”. \r\n\r\ni was at home at the time, i was organizing some papers when i heard a loud explosion, i couldn’t tell if it was a gunshot or fireworks but didn’t think too much of it. when my brother arrived home he told me to come outside and check out the strange light. it definitely wasn’t a plane or helicopter, my first thought was a quadcopter drone. but those are often loud and usually have red and green lights. this was a single orange light that was floating silently from southwest to northeast.. i was only able to see it for about 5 minutes before it just suddenly vanished. frustratingly, it disappeared before i could get any pictures. \r\n\r\nit happened a second time tonight, i was staying up late doing some reading and i heard an extremely loud and percussive boom from outside, it sounded like a grenade went off across the street. i ran outside to see what was happening, dogs were barking all around the neighborhood because of the sound. i thought about the light from 2 nights ago and started looking up to see if it was there, sure enough, the same glowing orange light was silently floating above my neighborhood, this time it was much higher in altitude, maybe 500-1000 feet. again, it  was floating from southwest to northeast, irregularly pulsing in a red-orange hue. a bit redder than a campfire usually is. this time though, it kept moving until it suddenly stopped moving and was stationary in the sky. i was able to get an old telescope out to get a better look, i couldn’t see any definite features. even in the telescope it was just an orange light. to the naked eye it looked completely stationary, but in the telescope you see it slowing moving around, hovering in place.\r\n\r\nit slowly faded away until it disappeared. this time i was able to capture a few pictures of it on my cellphone, which doesn’t show much other than a dot in the sky, but it does show up. very weird experiences, pretty spooky! i’m going to keep an eye out and study it more if it happens again. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

our cottage, when at around 23:45 (local time), we saw a group of approx. 10 white lights (just like stars), blinking, moving and grouping in the sky. they started to form shapes, first a big circle then a vertical line and then a strange symbol like a question mark.\r\n\r\nthey moved in groups of 3 and were constantly blinking. during this entire exhibition we could see how the lights got closer and further to us at a fast speed, then something similar to a bright red shooting star crossed the area leaving a red trail. finally, the lights started to fade until they disappeared, all this lasted for 30 minutes or so, we called our friends and were shaking all the time.\r\n\r\n10 minutes after they disappeared, some aircrafts started to overfly the area, coming from different angles but all of them going to the same spot, one every couple of minutes, which is completely unusual. \r\n\r\nwe are all pretty sceptics with these things but when this happened, we were shaking, it was the most incredible thing we ever saw and we can’t find an explanation. i’ve searched a lot but couldn’t find anything, i found some tweets from people that may have seen the same at the same time, but just a couple and that’s all…\r\n\r\nwe’ve read about satellite lights and it’s definitely not that. \r\n\r\nour first thought was that it could be some drone exhibition or tests but everything that

perspective, silently accross the sky. there were three arranged in a triangle, followed by four arranged in a horizontal line. they traveled from north to south, for about 20 seconds, then turned west and dissapeared beyond tree tops and structures. there were not any flashing lights or features observed and the two groups did not seem to be physically connected since, when they turned, they seemed to turn as two separate groups. it was dark, so it's hard to determine distance or altitude. it was at about 45° elevation and i estimate they were about a mile away. my first thought was that it must have been some promotion or show for new year festivities, but i know enough about aviation to know about marker and navigation lights and none of these were

take a black and white photo of the church steeple on top of the hope evangelical lutheran church.  i did not see anything other than the steeple as i carefully focused my camera and took the picture.  when i got home later that evening, and looked at the photos i had taken, i noticed this unidentified object in the sky to the right of the church steeple.  the evening was mostly clear, and there was little or no wind.  i had not observed anything unusual in the sky prior to snapping the picture.  what is somewhat strange about all of this, is that the previous evening, august 18, i had been researching ufo sightings reported in the youngstown, ohio area. (that is where i was born and raised.)  i was particularly interested in an encounter which occurred in february of 1994.  this encounter was well-documented.  it fascinated me because of the location where the ufo was first seen, on sampson drive, which is quite near where i originally lived.  it just seems weird that i had an unidentified object show up in a photo i took, the night after i had been researching ufo's on my computer.

it cast no light on anything. as i moved south toward it, i realized it was moving toward me. i made very sure that it had no blinking \"faa\"-type lights. as soon as i was content that it did not, i stopped the car and killed the engine and lights right in the middle of the road (it's ok, we're extremely rural). i fumbled for my phone and tried to get it unlocked so i could take video, but i failed to do so in time.\r\n\r\nthe object was exactly the same thing we used to see dancing on the horizon over athol, but now it was passing directly over my head in the pitch darkness. i would estimate that it was no more than 400 feet in altitude, seemed to be following rt.32 north toward keene, roughly, and was maybe the size of a subcompact car. it was moving...Probably about 35-45mph, land speed.  when we used to watch it moving between athol and vt, though, it would dart very quickly, covering 30-40 miles in just a couple of seconds. it can really move when it wants to. tonight though, it was just very subdued, slow, moving willfully but not fast at all.\r\n\r\ni was able to get a really good look at it, as it went right over my head. it was pretty much formless. it looks like a splotch of hot-pink fire, with hues of orange, and subdued/dulled flashes of blue and green.  it was perfectly soundless; dead silent.\r\n\r\ni rolled down the road hoping to find my friends at their campfire pit, where they surely would have seen it cross over their property. they were indeed sitting at their campfire pit, but they had no fire going and were facing in the wrong direction.  it passed literally about 300 feet behind them only a minute or two before, and they didn't even hear it. i think it should be noted that this is also the only time i've ever come here to find them facing in the direction they opted to face this night. any other night, and they would've been facing in the direction of the object.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":78576,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.7545671,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08212016-0002","longitude":-72.2717667,"occurred":1471730400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1471738962000,"summary":"Following rt32 northbound, went right over my head. i got out of the car and watched it.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"03470","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Richmond, New Hampshire","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:70008"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Burnsville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing outside waiting for my dog when i noticed the first object. it appeared out of nowhere to the ne, below 2 faint stars. it appeared very bright then appeared to travel away from me drifting back and forth as it went. after about 15 seconds it faded away. almost immediately after that another one appeared in the exact same spot and did the same thing. then the third one appeared just below and north of the first two. i think this was a satellite as it traveled directly south across the sky. no turns or drifting back and forth. much more faint than the 1st two. although it didn't fade in and out as satellites often do. i watched it for about 4 mins until i could nolonger see it. when i saw the 1st one i called to two people inside to view this. they did not come out in time to see the 1st two but did see the third.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":78575,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.75852949999999,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08212016-0001","longitude":-93.2566298,"occurred":1471729200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1471738129000,"summary":"3 separate lights (crafts) 2 appeared out of nowhere, very bight, travel not straight then faded. 1 traveled across the sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"55337","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Burnsville, Minnesota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:70009"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Gladstone","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving south on m 1 highway in gladstone, missouri with my niece.We both noticed real bright lights in the sky southwest of us.  we were talking about how it was just hovering with no blinking lights like airplanes or helicopters have.It just sat in one spot. we were watching it for maybe two minutes joking that it might be a ufo then it just disappeared. it never moved and there were no clouds at all in the sky. it just disappeared! we were shocked and couldn't believe what we had just seen.
