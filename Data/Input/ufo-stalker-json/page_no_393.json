that i noticed the object in the photos. at first i thought it was the beginning of a lightning strike until i noticed the object moving as i scrolled through the photos. the object appears to move from left to right at a high rate of speed. there were big cumulus clouds in the sky and a lighting storm going on at the time. i estimate the object to be 1 to 3 miles away. as you can see in the photos there are stationary objects in the back ground to compare the movement to, i was about 40 feet away from the street lights in the back ground and the lights are about 50 feet apart. as the object abruptly stops and changes direction it appears get taller or even have something pop up from the top of it or out of the dome. when moving it appears to get smaller or flatter and the protruding top seems to go back down. it looks almost like a box at times but this may be because of the way it is illuminated in different sections. i would say it is probably dome or saucer shaped. upon seeing the object on my phone i knew this was something that exceeded the technology that we currently supposedly have and was happy to have captured it on photo. the photos i have provide are from the burst on my iphone camera. i have more and i uploaded these to my laptop then a memory stick so some of the time stamps may be off but i have the original photos and burst still on my phone unaltered. these were taken at a place of business that's why i didn't give a physical address. i would be happy to give more information if that would help though. i also made a video of the burst

lights about 200 300 ft above the homes across the street from my house moving at a very quick pace. at first thought it was a small plane, but realized there was no sound. i watched it travel from the southwest to northeast. i then noted the blue lights slowed and craft slowed as well and came to a complete stop! no plane can do that! the blue lights went out, at least that what i thought, but realized the craft was turning around and the blue lights were in the back. as it turned i now saw 2 bright white and one red light. it then shot straight up about another 100 - 200 ft and started heading back the way it came toward the southwest. as it passed me i could make out the shape and could see the blue lights flashing again. i noted the the craft was not moving as fast and the lights we not flashing as fast as they were when i first saw it. i watched it travel in a straight line about 600 or 700 ft off the ground for about 25-35 secs before it was out of sight.  \r\nthis was no airplane. as i'm former air force, and for sure was not a copter.. it was larger than a car or truck, but not by much. very sleek and the back sloped down where the 2 beautiful blue lights were located, if these were light and not some type of propulsion the only reason i say this is because the speed of the lights flashing were consistant with the speed of the craft. so cool, i know this was not a star, or planet or some secret military craft. this thing moved way to easy, stopped, hovered, turned in place, shot straight up and changed speed.\r\nno i have not been drinking or doing any drugs.. \r\nhope someone else reports this ufo.  \r\nred lion, pa \r\nso cool.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
