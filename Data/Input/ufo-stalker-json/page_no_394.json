things that are frequently reported as ufos such as aircraft, birds, bugs, and advertising lights.  i spend a lot of time sky-watching, and hadn't seen anything unusual in over a year until last night.  \r\n\r\nat 8:23pm, i noticed a bright glowing orange light a few degrees east of due north and about 20 degrees above the horizon. at first i thought it was a plane because it seemed to be near long beach intl airport, but the color wasn't typical of aircraft lights. through my binoculars, it looked slightly vertically elongated as opposed to round. i noticed no other lights on it. i also couldn't bring it into focus and the upper portion was fuzzier than the bottom portion.  it slowly moved upwards and then slightly eastward, and then it moved slightly erratically and quickly faded out without a trace. having read numerous reports about the propensity of orange orbs to travel in groups, i watched for more, but no more appeared.\r\n\r\nthen at about 8:45pm, i was looking towards the sse at a light that was probably a high altitude jet, and in the same general area a bright blue light appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon. it was about as bright as venus when it's at its brightest. then less than two seconds later it disappeared without a trace.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":78534,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.79211277522968,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08192016-0010","longitude":-118.13490247619906,"occurred":1471551780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1471611447000,"summary":"Orange

but also home alone. i grabbed my keys and hit the road the second it happened. called it in but i'm sure they thought it was a prank or i was just under the influence.\r\nthe second fireball/orb was a couple days ago. i was looking at the full moon with my telescope when i noticed one crater lot up like nyc. i live in the sticks, coyotes are one thing but the owls are rare to hear. anyways after looking at this crater, the coyotes were drawing nearer and the owls start (i can't explain the noise, it was too eerie). then i hear a splash? a pile of liquid just appears next to me on the cement then evaporated almost instantly. that's when i looked to the east and saw the fire-orb as i wish to call it. hovering above the tress it lingered to the left then to the right. bobbed as i was calling my mother over to see it and even though she was in perfect view to see the last 2 seconds of it, she couldn't. it had vanished, before the both of us, but only i could see it. shortly after, my phone couldn't decide if it wanted to work or not. the yard light (basically a telephone pole light) went out. then the crickets were chirping as quick as cricketly possible!! i had a hard time

be very interested in getting interviewed to give the detail of my personal experience with this phenomenon. \r\nas far as the sighting and experience i went through it happened on june 10 of 2014 north of dallas texas near mckinney texas on a toll road at 3am. on this particular evening me and an ex-girlfriend had just gotten in an argument and broke up and i left her house and started driving home back to dallas from mckinney texas on the toll road. at this time there were no cars on the freeway it was completely empty probably because it was so late. the area that i was in and its also very country there's not a lot of construction it's mainly open fields in the location where i was that driving back. so i was headed back to dallas on the freeway then all of a sudden i could sense or feel something following my car, and i look behind the car and i saw what you will see in the image which was like an object of light that could shape shift between a circle to a triangle to an oval shaped object. so i knew that was definitely not a drone. and the object kept following my car when i looked to the right side of the car it was following me it must've been probably at least three or 4 miles at this point since it started following my car. again i was the only car on the road at the time. not exactly sure how far the object was for my car but i can tell you it definitely changed shapes and sizes, and it was  maybe 500 feet from the car or so. when i picked up my camera i initially wanted to take video, but i was driving at a high speed probably like 85 miles an hour and it was a little too dangerous so i went ahead and just took three photos but it's really weird because it's almost like the object sensed that i was taking pictures because right after i took the last photo it moved so fast that the naked eye could barely catch how fast it moved then it disappeared. so obviously it did not want to be photographed. here is what i saw. i will send three attachments to make sure you got each picture. \r\n i wanted to add to the description of what i saw. if you pay attention to the photos you will see that the yellow light is the streetlights and the white circular/oval shaped light that shape shifted is the ufo. also notice that the ufo does not leave a shadow, i thought that was very weird. the light was a white light and it could've been a craft that change shapes as well as change dimension or size of the craft. in my opinion the craft probably hides under the lighting it projects so you can't really see it's true material or form. that's all i wanted to add thank you very much.

went to the beach end at the end of my street too see what it was. i then noticed flashing lights of different colors in sequence near what seemed to be the middle of the object. the object seemed to be stationary. i then noticed what seemed to be helicopters coming from the stratford/devon area towards the object. then over head came three low flying helicopters at rapid speed. at first i thought there must be some explanation or that it was in fact a blimp (however large) until the helicopters showed up. i then observed for about a half hour. as soon as the helicopters came near the object it disappeared. i didn't see any trails or anything. just one minute it was there and then it wasn't. i did not call authorities because i didn't want to seem paranoid or crazy. i watched the helicopters comb the area for about a half hour. three broke off and came closer to my location and i thought i could see something like a parachute or something hanging below one of them. they then reversed direction and headed towards stratford/devon ct. one by one they seemed to land, except one. this one seemed to patrol the area. i then went home to tell my wife. i am still not quite sure what i witnessed but it was definitely strange. sikorsky aircraft is in stratford and they sometimes test helicopters but never this late at night. we don't have any bases in this immediate area that i am aware of. the object seemed to be beyond charles island, which is small but not tiny and the object seemed to be much larger as it was farther away. when i first saw the object i wanted to go down to the beach end and see what the heck it was but then i got a whole lot more. my wife thinks i'm nuts and i don't have any video or witnesses. i kept looking around hoping someone would show up so i could have backup but no one did. i don't know as of yet if anyone else observed the object. as i am reporting this right away so it is still fresh. i wish to remain anonymous as to avoid and ridicule

eerie feeling again. i was afraid to even keep watching it. so, instead of waking my husband up again, i felt like i might be able to get a picture of it with ages old kodak digital camera (kodak easy share c 613 200-af3x). while i was trying to get a sighting in the view panel, i could not belive what i was seeing. i clicked and shot 4 or 5 pictures. the 1st shot that i had taken when i printed out the pictures, came out blank. what i remember of what showed up on the viewer, was a fan-like shape-3 blade shapes, looking like a propeller. however, all the other shapes, once i enlarged the individual shots, left me stunned and bewildered, as well as confused as to what the object really was. i feel that this sighting was something unnatural. i can only speculate that it was a ufo

is what made me think it was a drone). after viewing the object in my binoculars i was sure it was not a drone, uav, or a weather balloon. it was very exciting because my whole family got to witness it and look at it. once we looked at the pictures on the computer it really got us to wonder exactly what was this we just viewed. finally it went into the clouds and we did not see it again. i would be very interested in finding out if anyone else saw the same thing we did and what it was. i have showed the pictures to several naval pilots and others who work in aviation here at pax river and they encouraged me to submit these photos. i also work in the aviation industry.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and sister on my mother's back patio when we saw a formation of 10 or 12 extremely bright lights due east approximately 30° above the horizon.  each light appeared about the size of an aspirin when held at arm's length and the total formation covered a width of about 10 inches at arm's length. the formation seemed to twist on a central axis slightly  then the lights on the outer ends suddenly and quickly  moved towards the center in an arc movement, merging with the next lights in. those lights then moved quickly and merged with the next ones;  this continued sequentially until there was only one bright light in the center which then emitted a cloud of swirling,  sparkling smaller and dimmer lights just as it disappeared.   our sighting lasted for about 8 seconds but the lights were already there when we saw them so they could have been there longer. it seemed to be extremely large, quite high, and fairly distant. all three of us witnessed this.  \r\nthese lights were definitely not fireworks; any fireworks close enough to appear that large would have been audible as it was a quiet night and there was no accompanying cloud of smoke. three aircraft were also in the same quadrant of sky moving towards the area where the lights were but they were too high to identify. the aircraft did not appear to be in formation but were moving fast.\r\nmy mother called the local sheriff's office to report it. the deputy she spoke to stated that a similar sighting had been reported the previous night.  i also posted to a local facebook group and one other person replied that he had seen it as well. additionally, the cat seemed very disturbed and climbed to a spot she had never climbed to where she sat staring in that direction for nearly an hour. note: i grew up in this area and am accustomed to seeing maneuvers from davis monthan afb being carried out over this valley;  this was most definitely nothing like that.

airplane or helicopter etc. what struck me was it's size. i was larger than any star and moved smoothly in a westerly direction. at this point i realized that i was observing something unique and stopped walking to watch carefully. as i observed it, it slowed slightly, than sped up a bit and then changed intensity as it moved across the sky. i watched it travel across the sky for a period of about 60 - 90 seconds from east to west, than it stopped, paused for a second or two and than disappeared completely. i realized at this point that what i saw was not an airplane, planet or a star but a ufo. i went home and told my family who initially thought i was joking around at first but i insisted what i saw was
