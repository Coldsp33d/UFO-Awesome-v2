guessing it would fit onto a football field.\r\nthe ufo was not spinning or rotating. \r\nthe windows/portals maintained same position while craft moved. \r\nit made no detectable noise at any time during the observation.\r\nit tilted slightly forward on descent and ascent.\r\nit wobbled when hovering or moving very slowly.  \r\nit acted like it was being controlled. steered. directed at all times.\r\n\r\ni had a good 8 hours sleep before my drive. i was very much alert/awake. i had just stopped before the sighting to get gas and a coffee. i have no history of mental illness or hallucinations. i don't drink or do drugs. i felt the wind in my face and even pinched myself to make sure it was real. it was a totally real experience, and i'm so happy the ufo let me see it so clearly. there was nobody else on the road except for a 18 wheeler truck coming the other way, heading east. i looked at the drivers face as we passed each other. he was unaware/oblivious to the ufo.\r\n\r\nthis happened to me over 30 years ago. i've only told a few family and friends about it. i'm so grateful for the experience! i didn't have a camera at the time, but i can draw a picture if requested.\r\n\r\nphilip \r\n \r\n\r\n          ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":78502,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.101766500000004,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08182016-0003","longitude":-94.57492669999999,"occurred":427526700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1471491083000,"summary":"Oval/disk shaped. perfectly round circles windows/portholes, perfectly spaced,all around main body. bright beaming white light projected thru each window.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":37,"maxtempi":99,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":32,"meantempi":90,"meanvism":17,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":27,"mintempi":81,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":37,"maxtempi":99,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":32,"meantempi":90,"meanvism":17,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":27,"mintempi":81,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":12082,"locationName":"Kansas City, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:70167"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Eau Claire","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Standing outside of backdoor to my house, after stubbing out a cigarette, i noticed a yellow-orange streak of light just at the treetop level, towards the ne. it was stationery and i didn't hear any noises. i realized we'd just had a meteor shower so figured it was a streak from a falling meteorite, didn't think too much of it, and went inside. about 45 minutes later i was outside smoking again and i was surprised to see the light was still there. it appeared to be longer though and i noticed it was pulsating. i kept staring at it and realized it hadn't moved, it was in the same place. each time after that, when i went out to smoke, i had to look for the darned light and it was still there. it didn't move but you could tell the stars gradually did. about 1:30am i went to bed. the streak seemed to get longer as the night progressed, starting out about 1/3 inch long and ending about 1 inch long. the light was gone the next morning and isn't there tonight. i'm wondering if it could have been a weather balloon high enough in the sky to catch the sun's rays?

familair with many, many air craft, being in the usaf, living near airports most my life.  and during the summer i am outside just about any and every chance i get, but of course, mainly taking my dog out and i also just like to sit and watch the sky. \r\n\r\nthe first one i seen, i only noticed it because of he extremely bright light, which flashed maybe one, possibly 2 second, about a 45 degree down and forward, (fantastic brightness).  then still moving from north to south, dead center of a wide open spot in front of my house it flashed the exact same way, then once more the exact same way and then it was out of view.  but the distance it traveled in such a short period of time was just incrediable.  at the altitude it traveled at and taking maybe 3 to 4 seconds, it would take a standard air liner any where from 3 minutes to around 5 minutes.  but every plane i have ever seen, you could always hear them.  these other's, well not one single sound, vibration, no sonic's, just totally quiet and amazinglly fast.  to tell the truth, i have never seen any thing move that fast, in a straight, level path fly at such an extreme speed.\r\n\r\nand as for the other four.  same light or lights flashing out.  the only  difference was the directions they traveled.  all straight, level, varied altitudes, some moving east to west, south to north, west to east.  all on different nights, but fairly close to same times, within around a 2 hour variation.  but all as fast, silent and just so, so fast.\r\n\r\nthe last part may be or may not be related, but i had my phone outside one evening taking photo's of the red moon, (blood moon).  when i looked in my lens i could only seen the moon.  but when the photo's were saved, there was another very large object on the bottom left and on every photo.  i cannot explain this one at all.  i still have the photo's on my phone, plus i downloaded them onto my computer in order to enlarge them, but i am not a photo expert of any sort.  still, it just seemed very strange to me.  if you would like i can upload those to you if you like.\r\n\r\nwell that is all i have for now.  i sure hope to see more real soon.  but they are few and far between.  or so it seems.  and i have no night vision equipment of any type.  and sure nothing to take photo's of such fast flying objects like those others at night time.  sure wish i did.  but,

and i know the speed of trace bullets. i know this images of fireflies are rare so far i know only nasa have. please i would like to create a dynamic in the planet with crazy people like me u likes to observe the sky to trace and triangulate this logistic movements of our friends or please help me saying and proving that what i see every day all year it is man made. for more incredible this sound it is true what its happened here in portugal, i got much more info and data about proved patterns, not table and desk theories.\r\ni do zoom with my cheap camera there are some pixels on the images but the fireflies are very distinct as you can see, better see in a laptop or please fell free to enhance the image.\r\nmy aim is about recording all i can about this phenomenon's to the future, it is also about the security, because here its where the planes make the turns to lower or higher there flight concerning the landings.\r\ni am a real passionate amateur astronomer and a convict ufologist u likes to hunt ufos since the 80s, the great show on earth its to looking our skies.\r\nthank you\r\nmanuel salvador  ","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

was very high in night sky also it did not shimmer like the stars did, just solid blue /white lights …........\r\n\r\nthen to   my  surprise spotted another craft of this type a few mins later (17)

them. the direction change of this object i have been watching was like no balloon i had ever released. the direction of the object was in a straight line heading northeastern passed above a cloud

fair mall. i have driven this stretch hundreds of times before. the time was approximately early or middle afternoon in the month of april, year 2016. i first noticed the object because it was shining and just within my field of view. it was above the horizon, but only because it was in sky that was between two large hillside, that almost make a v shape. i would eventually lose sight, as i traveled down the highway, which goes into the valley between the two hills. in this span of time i went from thinking just another aircraft to something maybe odd. now there is a small airport that planes fly over the highway to land at, and i have seen all types of small engine planes and a few helicopters here. none being military that i can recall. \r\nafter noticing the object, i kept my eye on it because of a previous experience, i always make sure if possible. and as a short time passed i noticed no lights, just shining it was sunny fair weather, very slow movement that was hard to notice except for its proximity to the horizon. it always seemed to be close within a mile, not large, slow probably straight trajectory, and no altitude change. it was too far to distinguish shape, noise, color, and relative size. after i figured all this, i lost sight as the highway dipped into the valley that made the slight v on the horizon, where i initially saw it. it stayed closer to the left hill, and went behind it mostly due to my change of position, but its as well. when i saw it again, further down the highway, it was doubtfully within view of where i first made contact. i got the best view now of it. it had become stationary approximately 100 ft off the ground, over swampy water just before a side road on the left of the highway, about 250ft left of the highway when traveling southbound, and a little less distance before the side road. there is a hill in the background of the view i had and at one point it was below the top of this hill, as i was driving approximately 50-60mph the whole time. as i was passing it i could tell it was of metallic color, reflecting sunlight, cube shaped with slightly rounded sides, had no emissions or sound, nothing attached to it. size was at most 15ft least 6ft at any of its sides. no definable corners or edegs, almost like a silver mylar cube balloon. this was an obvious thought especially, because when i had come up on it the second time it was not moving, i was driving and did not notice any type of wind speed or direction. but just after i passed it, i started looking back out my side window, it started to move at a barely noticeable pace again towards the highway, but lost sight of it for the last time, due to the highway directional change. i could not tell if it had actually gotten to the highway or not.\r\nthis was my second unusual sighting at the time and felt incredibly personal, like on a spiritual level as did my first. at the time of this report, august 16th 2016 approx 1130pm i have had three ufo encounters and the third was just 2 days ago and felt no where near like the first two, much more coincidental. i have not made a report on my first and last encounters but plan to do so in
