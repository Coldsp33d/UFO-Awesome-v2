we were driving it was about 12:15 when i noticed two strange lights in the sky, we were passed sfo airport but these lights did not have green or red lights signaling where they were going. they were bright orange orbs, as i pointed it out, one disappeared. afterwards i started recording and will include the video files. the one light that remained stayed stationary for a bit in the sky only to dim out and appear again across the road this time brighter and lighting up the sky and the clouds behind it. it would dim out again but the bright aura still could be seen through the clouds. next what happened after i stopped recording, i saw the ship behind me about maybe 300ft hovering in the air over a building. it was rectangle in shape and had red and orange-yellow glowing lights underneath and strange markings live i've never seen before. the ship was at least 30 feet, maybe bigger. one of my friends saw the ship as well and described it like i just did in the same way. i'm certain we both saw it. i felt like i was being watched, it knew that i knew that there was something strange going on and it felt like someone was staring through my mind. after the ship appeared behind us it quickly teleported again or moved really fast but after that it wasn't seen again. i think it was observing the meteor shower that was happening a few days ago and it noticed that my emotional levels were spiking because of witnessing a ufo. it wasn't there for long but my friends and all saw it and can agree that it was an ufo. i've reached out to many sites but everyone just

and there, what appeared to be airplanes with normal lights. i used to fly a little (172s, cherokees, sierras and a cessna 410 once!)but i could not determine the altitudes with any certainty. i set up my spotting scope and zoomed all the way out. they were orbs all right. we couldn't tell that with the naked eye but you sure could with the scope (60 power?). there wasn't much movement and none joined others or flew in formation. they just kind of hovered, pulsating white to orange/red (thought i might have seen blue or green once in a while too)almost like an energy source of some kind inside of a membrane or translucent shell. after a while i went to bed thinking that there had to be a logical explanation. atmospheric conditions causing normal stars to appear????? yeah,

did not reply, can't say why but just a feeling.  anyway i am ready to go forward.  i observed a triangle shaped ufo when i was living in tucson az in 1998 around august at 2 am in the morning.  i just could not sleep and went outside to my patio to have a drink and just look at the night sky.  i lived in an area outside of tucson in an area called rita ranch.  the sky is always crystal clear and the stars are just so bright!  as i was looking out to the west i just had a feeling there was something above me.  i looked up and all i saw was black, which was strange because i should have seen stars!  i kept looking and i heard a very distinct humming/pulsing noise.  i kept looking and then noticed that the black was moving.  i saw that it was a triangle shape, it had large white circles on each point of the triangle and large red circle in the center that pulsed.  i started looking round the neighborhood to see if any neighbors were up, and of course they were not.  i just kept watching as it moved very slowly overhead and it took a good 5 minutes to where i could see stars where it used to be.  then all of a sudden it just took off, not going up but just in a straight line and was gone in the blink of the eye.  i kept standing there thinking i must be really tired and i was just seeing things.  then  3 a10 warthogs came screaming overhead.  the air force base is close to my house and a10's are seen a lot so we are all accustomed to them.  however i had never seen any of them late at night.  the next day i heard that several people at work had seen the ufo as well. i was not able to take a picture but i am attaching a jpeg of the exact thing that i saw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

driveway, had just come home from dairy queen. i looked out the window into the field coming up the driveway in our house, spotted a bright orange floating light  in the shape of an orb.  it looked like a ball of fire.   my daughter and husband spotted it and we stopped. it did not move but there was a tree blocking our view some want so my husband backed up and stopped. we watched it for about a minute and then it started blinking and then it just blinked itself off. like someone turning off the light switch it was gone.   i am a private pilot,  so i am familiar with most aircraft and required faa lights.  at first i thought it could be one of those chinese lanterns but it never descended or went any direction.  i want to say that i have seen this same thing several times.  this one was not as close or maybe it wasn't as big. it is very fascinating and whatever it is makes you feel calm and not afraid at all. i was at the airport two weeks before,  a round 10:30 pm. we were hanging out at my dads hanger talking and noticed one of these lights at the east end of the runway.  i thought it was another aircraft coming in with the landing light but then i noticed how orange the light was and not white like most landing lights. i told everyone to be alert as an airplane was coming in, but as we all stood and watched the light, it never descended, it just hovered and did the same thing as this other light, it just blanked out. i want to add that they are round looking fireballs, or that they are rounds fears with some form of energy or lights that make them look like they are on fire.\r\n on fourth of july, we saw another light like this but i also wrote it off at the chinese lantern because it was fourth of july. it was 3 am and we were leaving early for the airport in jonesboro, ar go to chicago for the week. now that i think back, i'm not so sure it was a chinese lantern at all. i am not the only one that keeps seeing these orange lights.  some years ago, i think it was in 2011 on new year's eve that i reported seeing 8 to 10 of these lights and watching them for well over 10 minutes. i know this sounds crazy, but i do believe they are angelic beings of light and not craft. you may contact me for full explanation.  i am always in a group of people, most with my family, and no one ever feels fearful when seeing them. i feel like they are starting to be around a lot now. when i first started seeing them back in 2011, i thought maybe they were afterburn from some kind of moa activity  from why did air force base. my house is under and moa  if you will look on a aerial map.  in 2011 we saw those bunch and i was guessing 8 to 10 of them, a couple of them were dropping out white light, and the only way i could describe it was like fairy dust falling out of them.  several people in our town saw these orange fireballs or ufos so i know i am not crazy, but it is taken me several years to come to that conclusion. i see other people report them on twitter and get pictures of them or video on youtube.   i have studied them for a few years now and still quite curious, but i do believe they are a benevolent or they would have done something by now.  i seem to have become quite intuitive since i have been seeing them for several years now. i know it sounds crazy but i can't help but wonder if it is because i have seen them so many times.  i have no pictures or videos as it seems when we see them, i am just mesmerized is to watch them and forget to take picture or video.

this is when i estimated that it would have been aprox10 km or aproximately 6miles away. the object must have  been over the sea. i live beside the beach but i couldnt get to the sea and could not see if there was a reflection. it looked like a star but when it got brighter this is when i thought it must be nearer then what i first thought. i cannot edtimate the size as it was glowing constantly but ot must have been larger than a airbus (jumbo jet). i look at stars every night and can spot different kinds of aeroplanes. this was not one. not a satellite or anything i have ever seen in the sky. a great experience and hope to see more!!!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":78438,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8387992,"location":null,"logNumber":"ES-08152016-0008","longitude":0.1050557,"occurred":1470700800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Valencian Community","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1471266045000,"summary":"Light orb looked like a star dissapeard","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid","timeZoneName":"Europe/Madrid","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"03700","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Dénia, Valencian Community","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:70257"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82750,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":396}
