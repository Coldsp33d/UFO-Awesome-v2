although this object appears to be hovering, it moves slightly side-to-side, was not visible by naked eyesight. i film in ultraviolet, which makes the constant color change even more dramatic. i play the footage for a bit, at normal speed, but speed it by 250% because of the length of this event. i provide close-ups that seem to have a definite 3-dimensional feel, but the ball is in constant flux, reminding me of foo-fighter stories. edge detection was done, as well as inverting color. the time and date stamp are correct, and i was present physically, although did not see anything at the time.

2016. on the night of june 4,i was attending the night vision skywatch at the orion lookout point. the facilitator was allowing attendees to use her night vision goggles, but i had brought my 7 x 50 binoculars. i saw a number of objects through the goggles that could qualify as et spacecraft, but these were not included the more definitive sighting(s) that took place from about 10:20 pm to 10:43 pm.\r\n\r\nas a long-time star-gazer, i was looking up at the night sky with my own eyes, enjoying the cloudless clear desert sky when about 8 to 10 glowing objects appeared in the northwest. they were comparable in brightness to the planets mars and jupiter, which were visible in the sky (along with saturn) that evening, but probably a little brighter. they were very easy to spot with the naked eye. they made no sound. the first wave of ships was not in a clear formation. they flew across the sky in a scattered array. i did not count the exact number because i focused on some of them with my binoculars to discern individual craft details.\r\n\r\nthe following text is an excerpt from my journal entry that i made on june 7th, 2016:\r\n\r\ni could make out details with my binocs. the main swarm included 8 - 10 teardrop or oval shaped ships of colors from white to red, blue, amber, purple, and green. i could tell they were spinning in my binocs. when a laser shined near them, they would flash light back in a crescent shape on the ship. the blue ones (2) flashed white: \r\n\r\n\r\n(color drawing of blue ship)\r\n\r\n\r\nthe white ones (2) had a gray discoloring or highlight:\r\n\r\n\r\n(color drawing of white ship)\r\n\r\nthey all rotated clockwise as they moved across our field of vision from left (north-west) to right (north-east).\r\n\r\nthe circumpolar constellations were easily visible. cassiopeia was on the north-east horizon, rising.\r\n\r\nthree flew by in formation after the first group appeared. these were blue and purple. i recall 2 blues, and one purple. i don't remember the color the purple one emanated. \r\n\r\nthe last one was an emerald green, \"star,\" which was alone. diffuse green irregular splotches of light appeared above it as it flew by. \r\n\r\n(color drawing of green ship)\r\n\r\nit was smaller than the others. it curved away from us as it flew by. none of the ships made any sound.\r\n\r\ni couldn't count them all, but i thought that there were about 10. a woman i spoke to later said she counted 8.\r\n\r\n(color drawing of red ship) - i don't remember the highlight coloring (white?)\r\n\r\nthe purple one seemed \"out of focus.\"  like a (point) source of light (unfocused). it appeared grainy. it was closer to a perfect circle in shape. i don't recall a highlight or a crescent.\r\n\r\n(color drawing of purple ship) - 1 only\r\n\r\ni didn't get a close look at the amber ones. they were in the first part of the swarm, and i moved my binocs to look at the ones in formation. i didn't finish counting them before moving my binocs to the ships flying in formation.\r\n\r\n\r\ni also saw multiple possible ships through the night vision goggles. i saw a few, \"power up,\" and, \"power down\" as they moved in straight lines, well above the horizon.\r\n\r\n(drawing of ship waves, the northern horizon, polaris and cassiopeia.)\r\n\r\n(end of excerpt)\r\n\r\ni had initially thought that the time between the first and second waves was about 30 seconds. the time between the second and third waves seemed to be about 2 minutes.\r\n\r\ni did not see precisely how the ships disappeared, except for the final green one. i could tell that its path veered away from us. it disappeared over the north-east horizon, flying toward the constellation cassiopeia, flashing as it receded. i was moving my binoculars between ships, and they just kept flying to the north-east. strangely enough, i don't recall how any of the ships in the first two waves left my field of vision.\r\n\r\ni could not make a reliable estimation of the sizes or distances of the ships. i saw no effect of their lights on the ground.\r\n\r\ni texted a friend of mine who was at the event, in another location.\r\nmy first text was at 10:30 pm. it read:\r\n\r\nmultiple sightings at orion lookout. nany colors. amazing!!!Get down here!!!\r\n\r\n10:31 pm: many colors. (corrected my spelling)\r\n\r\n10:43 pm: at least 10. lost count. from north west.\r\n\r\n10:44 pm: another one. or two.\r\n\r\nit thus appears that about 15 minutes passed between the second and third waves. i took photographs of my texts, and the time stamps on them. i'm trying to save them for later reference.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw them, i was certain that they were et spacecraft. i had seen plenty of planes that evening, as well as all my life. i did wonder about this, but the protocol included shining powerful hand-lasers at them. we were told that it's illegal to do this to airplanes (it blinds the pilots). \r\n\r\nif they had been airplanes, the entire conference would have been shut down, according to the facilitator. i could see the beams of the lasers as i observed the ships in my binocs, as well as their flashed responses.\r\nover the decades, i've seen planes through binoculars and telescopes at day and night, and these nothing like anything remotely resembling jets or planes. \r\n\r\ni have been star-gazing since the '70s, and i know how to identify objects seen through optical instrumentation.\r\n\r\nof course, i was excited. a shout went up from the crowd. we were heard all over the joshua tree retreat center. i had participated in observing exercises, and have seen objects that could be regarded as et craft, but this was my first definitive experience in these matters. it was far and away, the best part of the conference. \r\n\r\ni hadn't planned on staying out there that long. i had expected to go to the party where the conference presenters were hanging out. but i enjoyed the beauty of the view so much, that i was in no hurry to leave the observation point. i talked to one of the assistants, and she was impressed with me for having my own equipment, and invited me to stay with her to watch the sky. they were rotating people through due to the limited number of night vision goggles. i had left my telescope in my car because of the distance i would have had to carry it - i didn't want to risk dropping and breaking it. apparently, i had made the right decision to just bring the binoculars. \r\n\r\ni was told that there was a film crew at the sighting, and that they were able to get footage of the sighting. i'm trying to follow-up with people who were there.\r\n\r\nthis experience was a life-changer. i ate a late dinner with the facilitator and some of the assistants. they shared a number of veteran stories of sightings and experiences with the big names in the ufo community. i didn't want the evening to end. i bought some new equipment to better observe the sky and look for more et spacecraft. i am certain that i will see them.\r\n\r\ni informed other people in the ufo community about my experience, and am in the process of taking a larger role in search and contact preparation activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n(i'll include scans of the drawings later. i've run out of time. sorry!)","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":78424,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1563434572519,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08142016-0023","longitude":-116.3719771565543,"occurred":1465078800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1471206299000,"summary":"Night mass ufo sighting of 10 multi-colored spinning egg-shaped glowing vechicles in 3 waves","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":42,"maxtempi":108,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":32,"meantempi":90,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":42,"maxtempi":108,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":32,"meantempi":90,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"92252","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":70,"locationName":"Yucca Valley, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:70301"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"St. George","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was 1986 flying out of bermuda on military patrol.  just after take off i was conducting an inspection of the acft. when i entered the cockpit to report it was full of very bright white light.\r\nthe pilots and engineer were in a stupper and i had to screen at the pilot to level out. i had to push the yoke forward to level it out or we have stalled and crashed. after i felt they were ok i went back down the back of the plane. each crewman were in a stupper and confused.  i ensured each was back to normal. i heard the pilot call center and asked if they showed any radar contact. they said no, and would you like to report.  he said no.  this was a classic ww2 foo fighter. it circled our plane as we took off at full pwr so it matched our accent and speed.  thank goodness it did not effect me or .??  we continued the patrol but we were looking every for anything. we landed and all got drunk.  two days later i had a air traffic controller come to the chiefs club and got him in a talk-a-tive mood and asked if that stuff happened a lot.  he stated every third or forth nite.  that was the only time it happened to us and we flew out of there for years.

explained to them i was experiencing occult influences in the form of entities that were able to control my thoughts and talk to me with my own voice.  it has been going on for seven years.  i thought it was a mixture of alien and supernatural but was not sure and needed help.  i told them i did experience seeing a ufo at least twice.  i saw one fly over my home around seven years ago when this all began, it was very large, about the size of my house, and flew off extremely fast when i saw it for about a second there over my house.  the second event was around five months ago and it flew left, then flew right, stayed there for a short while.  i showed no interest because of my symptoms and it disappeared.  i have been guided into believing the control over my mind is robotic and from implants.  they have mentioned reptilian to me.  i saw a grey once in my room but am not sure what to consider actual because i know they like to trick and manipulate.  the word illuminati comes up a lot.  i have been getting attacked both mentally and physically.  when the paranormal group came they tested me for emf signals, and i was emitted them from the left side of my ear and my arm.  the

for a beverage to share with my wife ,it was a quite night with clear skyes and no over cast reported.While driving no more than five hundred yards i saw a flash of pink light with the sound of thunder.Icould only think what in the world was that.I proceeded to dive while looking up to the sky very puzzled about that flash of light.My only thought was to hope nothing is going on at the power plant nearby.\r\non my way back home,on the same street where i saw the light  i could see my house in the distance and was vocused in on an red object that seemed to be hovering very close to home.As i got closer i said to myself what the heck is that over my house. i then parked my car and grabbed my drink, got out and staired at this glowing beautiful ball of light.It was maby two hundred feet directly over the top of my home.After one minute i ran into the house saying something is outside in the air over the house.\r\n my family did not want to take a look or believe me because im always playing around with them.My daughter finally got up and came out side and to her surprise,she also was in awe and completely shocked.We started taking photos with our camera and then the activity started.There waere several orbes launching from out of no where,they all moved in the same direction away from home towards the nuclear power plant high in the sky.These orbes were clustered up togeather like little red stars in the night sky. it was about eight orbes total.When there wasent any more orbes  launching i ran in the house to get my cam recorder and when i came back out one last orbe showed up .It was bright white.The others where plasma orange.I was able to record as long as i could before going off track because is was amazed and not focused anymore.This last white orbe took the same path high in the sky and joined the others,then they vanished with the snap of your finger.\r\n several years has past and im just getting to where i feel as if i should show and tell my

Frances","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"As usual on saturdays i was house cleaning. i went out back to the deck for a rest, facing east i sat down and put my feet up as i leaned back to rest. \r\n\r\nwhat first made me notice the object was that as i was leaning back, looking ahead at the sky the object came into my right side peripheral view. a guesstimate is that the object was about maybe two and a half avenues east of my location and no more than one thousand feet high. it would have been underneath any cloud cover if there had been clouds.\r\n\r\nmy initial thought was the object though unusual likely had to be a weather balloon. i always presumed weather balloons were a single ball and for some reason thought they had connected a few balloons together. \r\n\r\nthe object was actually a number of very bright white solid balls or spheres (referred to as ‘the object’) moving along a south to north course across the sky. this is the same path as the avenues which more or less begin at the river which is a boundary between canada and the us.\r\n\r\nduring this period, at any given time and as though slightly blowing in the breeze, some spheres moved closer together; moving further apart; or moving slightly upwards or downwards; and, a number of times the spheres seemed to all have pushed together forming the shape of cocktail sausage. although not detectable, these spheres appeared equidistantly tethered together, maybe about an eight foot circumference; and, moved along a fixed horizontal, south to north course. i did not detect any type of mechanical or other noise coming from the object.\r\n\r\nthe computer was just inside the back door and i quickly googled weather balloons. from all the images the single ball thought seemed correct. i thought it odd that the object was traveling on a straight even path and knew enough that even though it was not windy out there are air currents that would cause a balloon of any sort to be tossed around in most if not all directions.  with my binoculars i went outside again. \r\n\r\ni called my roommate outside to have a look. she said to google it and i asked her, but google what. she said google an unidentified flying jellyfish as the movement of the individual spheres reminded her how jellyfish would move. this movement was the only resemblance to jellyfish – the object was clearly a number of more or less solid white balls or spheres, seemingly equidistantly loosely tethered together.\r\n\r\nduring this time, i called a family member who lived across the railway tracks and a couple blocks further down the avenue. i asked him what a weather balloon looks like. i asked him to watch for the object as at that point it was to the left (north) and past the railway tracks. i presumed it would continue on as it had been doing for at least the past 20-30 minutes. i went back in to do my housework.\r\n\r\nfor reference, there was just one house between my home and the railway track. the railway track comes into town from the east at maybe about a 35 degree angle.  \r\n\r\nbetween about two to three and a half hours later i was on the phone with a friend and told her about what i had seen. she asked if i had taken pictures which i had not as i thought it was most likely a weather balloon. she asked if the object was still there.\r\n\r\ni went outside, looked up and the object was hovering above the railway tracks. my friend said to take a picture which knocked me into action. i ran inside, grabbed my camera and back out again, just seconds. the object was almost out of view, it had to have shot straight up to about the height jets fly and then out of sight. \r\n\r\nstepping back onto the deck to see the object just hovering and then again with camera in hand was when the curiosity of the experience turned to eeriness. there was no way to put this into context. i had the strange thought the object was aware of me and that i was about to take pictures. my friend laughed and said this sounds like a fish tale.\r\n\r\nat that time, my perception that unusual objects in the sky were typically disc shaped and occurred at night. over the past years i have watched television shows discussing these types of experiences or sightings. in the past week i viewed a number of shows that prompted me to present my experience. the last straw in this was during a show where some people had been discussing their daytime sighting and one of them said to go in to get their camera and take pictures. when that person went back outside with their camera, the object had shot out of view.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
