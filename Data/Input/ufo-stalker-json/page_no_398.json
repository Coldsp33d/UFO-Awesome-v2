because my house was so hot i couldn't sleep. i had a fan on the right side of my bed, but thought i would be cooler if i had one in my right side, too. so i went into my sisters room to get her extra fan she keeps in between her bed and nightstand. i walked in her room and went to get the fan, but stopped when i saw a tiny white light out of her south-west facing window. coming up from behind the horizon was a tiny white light, a little bit bigger than a star, but smaller than a planet. i knew from first glance that this was not a satellite or airplane. it was rising in an almost squiggly motion, and it was hitting each star on its way up. almost like a connect the dots, although it left no trail. it kept getting closer, and as it came clearer into view, i saw two smaller white lights following the big white light on either side, and together the formed a triangle. the figures were now almost overhead at treetop level,  and all of a sudden, two small rainbow rays of light shown out from either side of the main figure. it then sped up and disappeared above my house. i have absolutely no idea what this could have been. i was too astonished to remember to take any pictures/videos, but believe me, i am so mad at myself that i didn't. i would do anything just to see it one more time. whatever it was, it was very close to landing on earth.

rest stop, just east of ne nm/az border, to use the facilities. my wife was driving when we arrived at the rest stop and i had been taking pictures of the scenery nearby along the way. after stopping, i took a few more pictures with my cell phone. the sun was directly above us(as you can see by the shadows below the trees) and it was hard to get a good look at the pictures with the glare from the sun. when we reached our final destination, in albuquerque, i uploaded the pictures from my phone to the computer to see how the photos came out. i noticed something reflective in one of the pictures and wondered what it was because the sun had been directly above when i took the pic. i enlarged the photo and i was stunned to see that it was a metallic looking object with no wings, propellers or rotors. i never saw the object with my eyes. i wasn't taking a picture of a ufo it just appeared in the picture. about a year later, in august of 2015, i read in the paper that there was a mufon symposium nearby in rio rancho, nm, where i now live. i went there, waited patiently (for 2 hours) to show the presenter my photo. he seemed unimpressed and i was disappointed. i've often thought about reporting it but, until now, felt that if the guy from mufon was unimpressed then who would be. i still don't know what this was and no one i've shown the picture to can figure it out either. i

slowly over us after we started heading back to our hotel room for the night, we were playing at the school's playground with our two little kids and it was getting dark. there was a beautiful pink sunset and we were looking at mt. adams, pointing out contrails over the mountain in the sunset. only a few stars were starting to show since the sun had set, and from where we were standing looking up a light appeared and was flying pretty steadily, soundless, no contrail, no blinky lights, not shaped like a helicopter or an airplane, and it was as bright as maybe 5 bright stars put together. we didn't really have any clouds in the sky because its a hot summer night and i'm pretty sure it isn't a satellite or the space station because of it's brightness. we had our camera to take pictures of the kids and we started to take a few photos and see if anything would show because it was getting darker. i uploaded them and zoomed into a few of them. one of the pictures is very odd looking. i bet if somebody could alter the raw pictures they might be able to notice something better than i can. i did notice in a few of the pictures reddish glow around one side of the object, purple, and blue. i only saw bright whiteish yellow with the naked eye. this thing flew directly above our heads maybe a few miles up? not sure on the distance. we watched it for a good 5 mins and then it kept flying and went behind trees, we followed to see it some more but after we came to the other side we didn't see it flying anymore. we have the moon in a few of the pictures for size reference. i zoomed in on the first picture and it looks really weird, if you zoom in on them all and i have more to submit they are all different. this is strange and i'd like to know if anyone else knows what this is.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

to the far side of the object then as the flame disappeared, the craft became like either invisible, or it matched the background of the sky,we could not see anything moving nor could we hear anything in the sky at all...We just stared up at the sky wondering what it was that we just saw, when a the sudden there north of where we last saw the object disappear there was a big black blob of what looked like a deflated black balloon descend to the earth...Neighbors thought it fell into my back yard, but i knew the distance was greater than that and i took them into my back yard to prove to

immediately got up and went on the patio to verify if it was an actual ufo or a plane by looking up to see if i saw any other lights to compare. i counted 4 very slow moving craft consistently flashing a red and either a white or green light (im thinking white) and determined those were completely different from what i had seen. the craft i was seeing when i went onto the patio was very

walls,it was the most amazing thing i have seen and the color was the best blue i have ever seen,  about a week later i was sitting up late at night and i heard a strange noise that ive never heard before, then about a min later i saw a net like device that was the same blue color to the orb ,it came right thru my ceiling at about half way up the house and extended itself till my whole downstairs was lit up by this net, it stayed there for about 30 seconds then the blue net started to withdraw, the whole time this was happening a bright white light was coming thru my back kitchen window and door ,i had a terrible feeling that i was being scanned or something in my own home, i thought i was about to get abducted ,ive been regularly seeing strange ufos around my property since, im worried about my 4 kids safety and my wifes aswell as my own after what ive seen. ive started to come up in round blisters since and my doctor is even baffled by whats causing these blister like
