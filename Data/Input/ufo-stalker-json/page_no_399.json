(august 11-12)\r\n\r\nmy daughter and i went out to view the perseid  meteor  shower late on thursday, august 11 at a small park in rochester n.H., and while we were looking overhead toward the south we spotted a small light moving slowly in all directions. as we watched we realized it wasn’t moving away from us. after a few minutes we realized it was shaped like a triangle with a bright light toward the front and two dimmer, green-tinted lights in the back. we also noticed that there were very faint green lines forming the triangle and connecting the three dots. it was a solid object and the lights never changed distances from one another.\r\n\r\nthe movement did not resemble a helicopter, airplane, satellite, drone or anything we had ever seen fly in the area before. it made no noise that we could hear and it clearly had nothing to do with the meteor shower. it in no way looked like a shooting star. sometimes it moved quickly to the left or right. sometimes it moved forward in the direction of the brightest light and then backed away in the direction of the two green lights. however, it always remained above us with no real pattern of movement.\r\n\r\nwe were in an open field surrounded by trees and it remained above the open area from 11:45 p.M. on aug. 11 and we left the scene on aug. 12 at 1:57 a.M.\r\n\r\nat one point it seemed to not only move toward the spot where we were sitting, but down towards us. it then quickly backed away again to its original spot in the sky. \r\n\r\nwhile it did move some distance, it never left our sight and was almost always directly above our heads. \r\n\r\ni made phone calls to the pease air force base nearby and asked them to look to see if they saw anything on radar or any other equipment. however, they said they could only see flight plans and transponders. the man on the phone said he would look into our sighting further.\r\n\r\nwe also called the rochester police department and they responded with three vehicles. the officers observed our ufo and somewhat laughed it off, but nicely. both the police officers and the man from the pease air force base wondered if it might be a drone, but i do not know of any drones that are solid, triangular with three lights. it flew in so many directions for such a long period of time and made no noise of any kind. in any event, our sighting was documented by an airport and the local police. \r\n\r\nthrough the entire event the object never moved very quickly, but it did change speeds and stop and start again. \r\n\r\nmy daughter noticed that there was a grey coloring in the solid area between the lights.  she also so on the side of the triangle lights, smaller rectangular lights separated almost like windows.\r\n\r\nthis was the first ufo sighting that either of us has ever experienced. we saw no evidence of aliens. all we saw was the object itself. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

narrative.  on the opposite horizon at almost due west, we saw an identical orb about 15 minutes after we noticed the first. the object was lower on the horizon and much closer than the first. it also glowed brightly with flashing lights from red to yellow to white to blue in rapid succession. it hovered for awhile and then it began its path further west, hugging the horizon the entire time. i was primarily watching the first orb, which continued to hover and move around quickly in the sky to the north and my boyfriend primarily watched the one to the west as it moved further away. both

black cloud low in the sky and not all that far away.  we watched it for a few minutes still talking about it going back and forth weather it was a cloud because as we got closer so it seemed it seemed more defined edges and solid.  i decided to take pictures half thinking i was just taking pictures of a single solid black cloud.  the pictures did not turn out well because it was with a cell phone a little past sun set and zoomed to the max.  after taking several pics and looking threw what i took i looked up and there were now 3 black classic ufo shape objects.  then two and then one again.  i did not see them seperate or come back together if that is infact how there became three and then one.  it then seemed to pick up speed continuing north towards ogden.  within seconds it was gone.  my brother and i both thought the object was about 500 yards across and about half that tall.  we all at first were not excited about what we were watching but slowly realized it was no cloud and then when there were three horizontally and evenly spaced apart about 600yards we became real excited and kids a little scared.  i don't know what it was but i know it was unusual.  there was
