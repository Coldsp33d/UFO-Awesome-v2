typical flight path of military aircraft en-route to luke afb.  distance at first sighting was about 15 miles.  as the object continued to fly in a south east direction, it began a gentle arc towards the east and then east north east.  the object flew almost directly overhead and was observed with binoculars.  it was about the size of a golf ball at arm's length and through the binoculars, it could be seen that there were no typical navigation or landing lights - instead, there were golden colored lights at each of the vertices of the triangle which cast light on the body of the object abruptly ending at what appeared to be sharp edges of the triangular shape.  \r\n\r\nthe object was silent as it passed overhead and continued its arc towards the north.  a jet engine sound was heard after it passed overhead and within about 60 seconds, a military aircraft (most likely an f-22 from luke) was seen at about 3000 foot altitude coming from glendale (luke) on a direct intercept of the object.\r\n\r\nthe military jet and the object were observed as the curved flight path of the object took it on a heading of about 345 degrees true and the fighter continued to overtake.  the two craft were observed as they departed the area through the binoculars.  last observation was of the object seeming to disappear (whether through distance or other means) while the military craft continued on the same heading for approximately 1 minute after which it executed a 180 degree turn and overflew the observation location in the direction of glendale and luke afb.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

out of the house until 2 am which was the last time i was out. the final time was when i noticed this strange object that couldn’t have been more than a football field or two away, so it was pretty close which allowed me to get a pretty good look at it even in the dark. i could see it was in the shape of a blimp (it was so close i could see the outline even against the dark sky). i couldn’t see any windows, it just had lights at the center of the object on the bottom. there were two different lights (all at the same place on the craft). one set was turning basically all colors of the rainbow. the colors would change after a second or two. the second set was acting like spotlights and the color was white. it looked like there were three of the spotlights looking in different directions (i could see one shining towards me and i thought i could see another shining in the opposite direction). it was hovering completely still. i know this because it was hovering around the same height as the trees in the area and i had walked and lined up a neighboring house’s roof up with the craft and it was completely stationary (i was trying to debunk it as a helicopter or something because i’m not sure a helicopter or anything man made would be able to be completely still like that.)  the object made no sound at all. this “sighting” took place over about five minutes. i stayed looking at it in dismay the whole time. i was shocked. after i comfirmed that it was completely still, i couldn’t think of anything that could do that. so i just stared and tried to appreciate that i was lucky enough to witness something like this. the sighting came to an end when i saw a shooting star to my right (the whole reason i was out there in the first place) so i turned my head and looked. i must’ve turned my head for seven seconds before i looked back to the “ufo” and to my surprise, it was gone! i was startled. that did it for me. not only was it strange looking, hovering stationary, and made no noise. it just completely vanished within seconds, no noise, no nothing. i was just beside myself on what the hell this thing was! i went inside afterwards finding it hard to go to sleep. it’s safe to say only the people that know how serious i am believed me when i told them what i saw.

could see of any kind except for a glow of a turquoise orange that i could see when the object was flipping over left to right and right to left. an aircraft doing tight turns like that would probably make the pilot pass out from the g forces and the plane would probably fall apart if it was a normal airplane. i was wondering if maybe the government has an experimental craft. i have seen a stealth bomber and fighter flying overhead. this did not look anything like that. i lost sight of the object as it went over some trees headed southeast. maybe the tampa airport saw something on their radar.

was just before the last nor'easter was to hit the east coast. i just had happened to look out my driver's side window, and this faint red- orange disk was high in the sky. i knew it couldn't be the sun, there was no break in the clouds and it would have been too high in the sky for the sun to be, since sunrise was around 7am at the time. also, the distance it was away from me it was considerably smaller than what the sun would look like. i was able to keep my eyes on it for a good 5 - 10 seconds transfixed on it and making sure to keep my eyes on the road. but then, without any flight or movement, it vanished. nothing moved in front of it, it just disappeared. i kept looking for a sign of it in the sky but at that point it was gone.
