(again, i am a young tween & this was many years ago. but it changed my world view & i could never forget this event.)\r\n     we kids knew it was out of the ordinary, but i don't remember emotions other than puzzlement.  we left & went to our houses to get others to come out, but it didn't return.  no adult was present. \r\n     i still didn't think much about it until the next day (? maybe 2) when i remember someone saying the \"newspaper said it was a goodyear blimp\" which i knew was impossible as they can't maneuver or travel at the velocity we saw.  from that time on i knew we were not alone on this planet.  \r\n     my dad had driven stock cars (#41). dave mcdonald & front neighbor (when i lived on 12005 e. hallwood dr., gi-80278, in el monte, calif.-phone #'s & addresses used to be drilled into children) & family friend (eddy sachs) died in the indianapolis 500 super crash.  i drove quarter midgets as a 6 year old. i 'lived' cars all my childhood & i understood speed, travel & automobiles well enough to know what we saw was no goodyear blimp. i'm giving names & addresses to verify my ufo account to prove my location & veracity.  this page says not too, but this was so many years ago, i don't see the problem & i want this to be taken seriously.  a map will show my beaver court address so the direction of the ufo can be gleaned. \r\n     for all these years it has haunted me & i've told this account to those close to me.  i want to tell this now in case it can be linked up with others who may have reported this. i wish the internet & my life situations had allowed this accounting to have been years earlier, but i'm glad to finally get this out into the world.  i hope it helps.\r\n     the boxes above don't allow me to state data accurately.  (date, hour, sounds, surface of ufo, emission, altitude & the like.  i had to check a box as it 'required' me to mark boxes, but i would have preferred not to put down anything).  i was very far from the actual ufo so i can't give better information in a check box. also, i'm not sure what all the words meant without definitions after them & i hope my description covers what is needed.\r\n      i don't want to die never having reported this. yes, i know how fallible memory is (hence why i can't remember if there were 2 or 3 neighbor kids with me, the date or time of day), that's why i gave corroborating, verifiable facts (names, addresses) for credibility.\r\n     ","distance":"Over One

of 500 feet moving from the nw to ne on a fixed path that was also nw of my present location. its focal point of the craft remained fixed on a line of trajectory as the craft its self rotated much

anything like that until these events happened to me. \r\ni would also like to ad im only doing this so that someone can help me undertand more of what happened as i cant talk to family or friends bout this ...No one believes me. \r\nim hoping to get some info on regression therapy from someone who is local to me.\r\n\r\nok.. so roughly 10 years ago i was sleeping in my bed next to my girlfriend at the time. we were living with her mother. her house was right at the egde of the woods and just following that was open what used to have been corn fields.\r\nwe werent in the country by know means just where our house was just happen to be right on farm land ( i can get gps coordinates if youd like)\r\n\r\nour bedroom had one window , and it was facing the trees and field. as i lay sleeping i sorta wake up and see a couple of light balls come thru window and into room , i dont remember being scared or anything. the rest plays out like scenes , no transitions tho. next thing i see is the lights are gone. and i see 3 beings in my room.. 2 small ones and 1 bigger... all were small tho... 2 maybe 3.5 feet and 1 maybe 4.5 feet.  i remember not being able to move , one was standing in front of t.V. and i remember it was almost transparent as i can see the tv thru him... almost like 50 percent transparency. the other was standing by girl friend... \r\nthen i remember one on top of me , i couldn't tell if it was strattling me or not but i was laying down so i assume so. i was in complete fear , no words can describe it , i tried my best to wake girlfriend but she wouldnt move.   the one on top of me got inches from my face and its eyes alone paralyzed me. the next tjing i remember is waking up at 6 am being really thirsty.   \r\ni have had 3 other similar times this happened as well... in different locations.   i never remember being on a craft tho this just takes place in my room. but from research ive read that 99 percent sure i was taken from my room. that's the answers im hopping to get. sorry for the grammar , im at work now doing this quickly on my phone.\r\n\r\nlike i said its happened a couple more times (that i recall)  , like once a couple years. most where similar to the above bit did have one that was really different. if you'd like i can tell that one , and if you need me to get in front of a laptop and take more time to write out better i can. i would really like to speak on the phone or personally with someone. \r\nthis has changed my life forever just wanna be heard and get more answers.\r\ncall anytime i will also work

peninsula road just south of peninsula village in the cuyahoga valley park region.\r\n\r\nas we my wife was driving i observed a large craft traveling north west just over top of the tree line on the left hand side of the highway. i did notice several white lights on it, no other lights were observed at that time. as the crafted passed over head just in front of the vehicle i leaned forward in order to observe the whole craft and it was at least 40 to 60 foot across as it passed overhead. things that were noticed was no other lights except the perimeter lights which were large, about 6\" in diameter going around the perimeter of the craft spaced evenly. \r\n\r\nanother thing that was noticed was that the craft was wide on the outside perimeter, probably 4 to 6 feet thick. i did have my window down at this time and noticed the craft my no noise as it passed overhead. my wife had made mention of oh wow look at that helicopter. i told her that, that is not a helicopter, this craft is to big and made no noise. it also appeared to have a slight rotation as it passed overhead. the craft traveled north west across the roadway then stopped over a field at corner of akron peninsula rd. and bolanz rd. north west corner of the intersection. i also noticed high tension lines in the area of the craft. when observing the craft from the roadway it appeared to be v shaped because of the light pattern, but after what it was their was a small section on the perimeter of the craft that did not have the large led type lights which made it appear v shape from a distance. this craft at the farthest distance away was no more then 300 to 400 ft from the roadway.\r\n\r\ni also noticed that when the craft stopped over the field a red light had came on under the bottom of the craft. then just west of the craft you could see 2 other craft approaching just over top of the trees towards the stationary craft, they did have numerous perimeter lights along with each having 1 red light on the underside. they appeared much smaller craft. i the at that time told my wife to take the next street on the right so that i could get some pictures. my wife instead of making the right, she continued down the roadway, just as if she never heard a word i said? almost like a trance. just after telling her to make the turn i myself forgot what i had seen until the next day. i called her from work to talk about it, but all she could remember was the big helicopter? the area consist of all rural with no inhabitant in the area. i am attaching a couple of pictures to show the area. i wish i could have taken a couple of pictures because they would have been the best documented pictures that have ever been supplied considering how close the craft was.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

been wishing for some sort of closure on this event, maybe i can find it here.\r\nwas late november or early december 2000, witnessed only by myself (murphy's law) at my then residence roughly 10 km west of duncan, bc. it was a clear winter night, not a cloud in the sky. very little light pollution from surrounding towns and cities and it made for gorgeous star gazing. a black sky with bright stars everywhere. \r\ni was about to head to bed and went outside for a final cigarette. i turned off my porch light as i enjoy watching for passing satellites at night, and the light would hinder that. so with the lights out, i stepped outside and lit a smoke and looked up...Waiting. i knew it wouldn't be long before at least one satellite started cruising across the sky. i was not disappointed.\r\na few minutes went by before i first noticed... \"it\". at first it appeared to be just a run of the mill satellite, lazily sliding across the sky from the north'ish, heading south roughly. cool. it was moving at a constant speed as far as i could tell, and a fixed trajectory. after all why wouldn't it? it was a satellite as far as i could tell, and these things don't change course or velocity. that perception was about to change very rapidly for me. \r\ndirectly above my cottage that night was the constellation orion, and it's \"belt\" perfectly centered over my head as i looked up. the belt that night was roughly orientated nnw to sse. so i'm standing there having my smoke and watching this little point of light begin to pass through orion, paralleling the belt and just above it (from my perspective). i'm craning my neck to watch as it's passing directly overtop of my position, straight above me. \r\nso orion is above me and this object is travelling from right to left (north to south). as it passes the first star in orion's belt, it quickly and suddenly begins to slow down coming to a stop just past the 2nd star in the belt. the moment it stops, i lose sight of it among the vast blanket of stars in the sky. it's there, i'm sure, but it's now indiscernible from any star in the sky. so i start looking forward along it's trajectory, clearly i must have blinked and lost it. satellites do not and can not just stop like that... i've missed something. i look to where it should be, nothing. i look back to the belt, nothing. \"the hell?\" i think out loud. where did it go? \r\ni decide to keep watching the belt, knowing that satellites don't just slow and stop like that. but that's what it appeared to have done... it must be there. \r\na minute or so goes by and suddenly one of the \"stars\" over orion's belt starts to move. gotcha! it quickly accelerates to it's previous velocity and then begins to alter course, with a nice 180 degree turn so it's now under the belt and heading back the way it came. almost as soon as it's finished the about-face, it starts to slow down again and stops just under the 1st star in the belt. again, i lose it against the backdrop of the night sky. then it beings accelerating and doing another 180 turn back to it's original track... and immediately starts slowing down yet again so a stop. and almost as soon as it's stops moving, it's going again. this time with no acceleration, just motionless and then moving... like a billiard ball hit by a cue. it doesn't move far, up and thru orion's belt and then as fast as it started off, it comes to a sudden dead stop. \r\nat this point it's course has made a funny figure 8 thought orion's belt from my perspective. also at this point i become utterly horrified by what i'm seeing. i know that what i'm seeing is technically impossible, yet there it is. every hair on my body stands on end and i get overwhelmed with terror. and this was just it's thing's opening act...\r\na few minutes passed and nothing happened. i looked around the sky again thinking maybe i'd lost track of it, and fixing my view on the belt every so often. then one \"star\" above the belt where i lost sight of it started getting brighter. the cigarette in my mouth fell to the ground. it grew brighter and brighter until it was the brightest point of light in the sky by a large margin. suddenly it rocketed across the sky at a speed that defies words. it did not accelerate, it was just still... then moving at a horrific speed. and it came to an equally horrific dead-stop to the north just above the horizon. it moved without sound, and no tail like a comet. \r\nwhen it stopped, again i lost track of it. given it was now on the horizon where night time stars are almost impossible to see, it's no wonder. but about a minute later there appeared a star, a point of light at least, growing brighter and brighter by the second. and again even on the horizon it grew so bright that it became the brightest thing in the sky. once again it defied physics and soared from horizon to horizon in roughly one second. a burst of speed so phenomenal that my eyes had a hard time tracking it across the sky. no comet tail, no sound. just a point of light moving at terrifying speed. \r\nit came to a dead stop without deceleration on the southern horizon. and almost immediately it again began to get brighter and brighter. until it was yet again the brightest point of light in the sky. i was expecting another burst of speed, but instead it just blinked out of view. it was there one moment, the next it vanished. gone. \r\ni stayed out for quite a while after, hoping it would return or maybe i'd hear a delayed sound, were it within the atmosphere. it did't return, no sounds were heard. it had to be outside the atmosphere in orbit. \r\ni have no idea what i witnessed that night. all i can surmise is that it must have been in orbit, and it maneuvered in a way that would at least liquefy, if not vaporize, any substance know to humanity.  what i witnessed is impossible... yet i saw it. \r\ncan someone help me... what did i see? a \"ufo\"? a military vehicle? both, or neither? i'm at a loss. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

looked out the window, it was about the size of a buss and was churning, rotating, buzzing... also seemed to be in distress, as though there were objects tumbling inside it. my thought at the time was i hope they were alright, i knew it was an alien craft because behind the red domes there seemed to be humanoid beings. as an artist i drew the craft which at the time made me recall seeing it in the

in a ne direction.\r\n\r\nin 1991-92 i received an implant on my right leg above my ankle, circular, ocular while living in brooklyn, i knew it was an implant which i surmised was inserted for

travail et fin octobre dã©but novembre avec un collã¨gue on a parlã© de nos enfant et en cherchant une photo du mien sur mon portale je suis tombã© sur un ã©cran noir avec une lumiã¨re au milieu et le

choquã© dans le sens oã¹ j'avais filmã© quelque chose d'incroyable et surtout que je ne me souvenais pas l'avoir fais par la suite j'ai regardã© la vidã©o rã©guliã¨rement et des souvenir me sont revenu. tout ce que je me souviens c'est qu'un soir vers minuit une heure du matin (je ne suis pas sur c'est peut ãªtre 4h00-4h30) je suis sortie devant chez moi pour fumã© une cigarette, j'ai entendu un bruit ã©trange je n'y es pas fait attention et comme a mon habitude j'ai regarder les ã©toiles et c'est lã  que j'ai vu quelque chose de pas normal. je ne sais plus si j'avais mon portable avec moi ou si j'ai ã©tã© le chercher dans la maison pour filmã©. ce qui me choque le plus c'est quand j'ai vu ã  quel moment j'ai fais cette vidã©o, elle est de mars 2017, je n'arrive pas ã  comprendre

lumiã¨re blanche qui forme un triangle et une rouge au centre plus une autre qui clignote ã  coter d'une blanche. sur le coup je me dis c'est un avion un peu bas, je rentre et 2 ã  3 minutes aprã¨s j'ai envie de ressortir car ã§a m'intrigue donc je reprend une cigarette je ressort et lã  les lumiã¨re en question sont plus proche et plus basse et elles se dã©cales vers la gauche et tourne et une fois au dessus de mon terrain je vois un trapã¨ze d'oã¹ il sort une lumiã¨re blanche mais devant cette lumiã¨re il y a comme un gaz vert et deux grande silhouette noir et devant elles environ 3 autres silhouettes plus petites et toutes donnes l'impression de ce donner la main ã§a a durã©e entre  dix et vingt seconde je dirai et aprã¨s je me rappel seulement ãªtre rentrã© dans la maison et avoir fais un croquis de ce que j'avais vu et je l'ai jetã© \r\n\r\npour la troisiã¨me histoire c'ã©tait toujours au mãªme endroit mais en 2016 j'ã©tais avec un ami on avait beaucoup bu d'alcool et j'ai regardã© les ã©toiles et sur la droite j'ai vu une ã©toile plus brillante que celle du berger ou que venus je me suis tournã© vers mon ami qui roulait ã§a cigarette pour lui dire de regarder et ã§a

parecen unas linternas, entonces volteo y lo veo extraño, ya que el decía que eran unas linternas, yo le dije que tenia que ser una linterna muy potente para que se iluminara así. entonces nos pusimos a detallar bien y no era una sola si no varias, entonces comenzaron a subir y bajar a una velocidad muy rápida, es de mencionar que en ese momento era de noche y estaba nublado el cielo con tiempo de lluvia y había destellos en el cielo de relámpagos, específicamente cerca de las nubes donde estaban los circulo. hubo un momento que una de las luces hizo una parábola en dirección donde estábamos pero a una velocidad impresionante. me dio tiempo de grabar un vídeo corto, pero como no veía si de verdad lo estaba captando mi celular deje de grabar, entonces como en el trabajo tenemos radios de comunicación, llame a otro compañero para que subiera y los viera, cuando llego también se asombro y dijo que no eran linternas. las luces tuvieron como media hora en el lugar donde habían nubes con descargas eléctricas, después que se disipo el tiempo dejaron de verse. las trayectorias de las luces era verticales, horizontales y otras que no puedo explicar por la velocidad. mi teléfono es un samsung galaxy s7 edged, y debido a la distancia no capto casi nada, y quisiera enviarles el vídeo para que lo analicen y ver si lo pueden mejorar para que corrobore nuestra experiencia.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:01:33","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
