attending a buddhist festival in conishead priory, ulverston, united kingdom. i have never spoken openly about this sighting before, but it has perplexed me over the years. i was 18 years old at the time of the sighting, attending the lamrim teachings and blessing empowerments of je tsongkhapa and dorje shugden with venerable geshe kelsang gyatso.\r\n\r\nlate at night, or possibly in the early morning hours, i was sitting on the grassy bank behind the temple, and was staring at the beautiful night sky. there is very little light pollution in this area, as it is located between the lake district national park, and the irish sea, so millions of stars are clearly visible to the naked eye, and i was enjoying the night sky. it was at this point that i witnessed a perplexing sight, which i have never been able to explain.\r\n\r\na bright and steady white light suddenly came into view in the far west of the night sky, moving at such a speed to the east that i initially thought it was a shooting star. the light, which was single, bright and constant, abruptly stopped mid flight directly in my sight, but slightly toward the south-east, having travelled in a completely straight line. the object did not remain in its stationary position for more than a moment, before travelling at the same incredible speed to the south-west night sky, where it disappeared from view. there were no other witnesses with me at the time. the distance of the object/light was hard to gauge, but my initially mistaking it for a shooting star may give some idea of possible distance. during all movements, the object travelled in a completely straight line.\r\n\r\ni felt quite amazed and shocked by what i had seen, as i was previously dismissive of the likelihood of the existence of any aircraft which could move across the entire night sky in such a manner. i remember going through a mental check-list of possible explanations; a shooting star – no, it had a deliberate artificial change in trajectory, following a moment when it was entirely stationary. a laser beam – no, the night sky was entirely clear and cloudless, and the object appeared to produce rather than reflect light. an aeroplane – no, the speed was too fast and the trajectory impossible for any plane i had ever heard of. a satellite – no, the speed and trajectory were completely different. my experience left me with the knowledge that there are things which exist, which commonly offered explanations do not account for.\r\n\r\ni am unlikely to discuss this sighting with many other people, but am happy to record it here, if it is of any interest to those who catalogue such matters.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

21:00\r\nfredericktown oh  43019\r\n\r\n\r\ni was working in my yard and sat down for a break. i was watching a couple of chemtrails being stretched across the sky. the first going west to east the second going south to north.  i was facing north when i noticed a white object in the air over the farm across the road. at first i thought it was a drone. it appeared to stay in the same place. i watched for about 5 minutes. i also wondered if it was a weather balloon.  it was not windy. \r\n\r\ni went into the house to get my binoculars.  when i returned to the back yard  and looked where i last saw it, it was gone. disappointed, i sat down and was looking around and spotted it over my neighborhood, toward the east.     again it was stationary. i tried several positions for a steadier hand to for viewing. through the binoculars it was circular and a yellow orange around the edge. the center changed from this color to grays. by this time the sun had set.  for the most part this eliminated the reflection of the suns rays.\r\n\r\ni felt there was communication between us. i asked for a sign. the cicadas started up and then was joined by a higher electric static noise. it was not pleasant to hear. it was a noise i had not heard before associated with the cicadas. the rest of the evening the cicadas were on the quiet side.  a thought crossed my mind that the noise was the sign. \r\n\r\nit was dusk. through the binoculars i watched it move toward a star that was only visible through the binoculars. it then moved below the star a short distance then continued on  its original path. it stopped just over a binoculars width   from the star and moved away from me.  without the binoculars these movements were not visible. by total darkness it had disappeared from my view.\r\n\r\noccasionally it looked to have a “cloud” form around the top.\r\n\r\ni feel that the triangle the stars formed and the smaller triangle that it went into had some significance.

watch to see if it moved. while watching you could see clouds moving but this object continued to stay stationary. eventually a jet liner passed by in the area but this object stayed at the same

window frame, that helped a lot but did not show me any more than a round object. i could tell object was very far away, when jet liner flew past jet was very far too and object seemed even further.

yellow light above the horizon. it looked relatively close to the treetops, but i assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the airport across the river, and that it was just an optical illusion. it was moving slowly, not necessarily coming towards me, rather rising into the sky. it quickly darted to the left a little bit, but it was such a small motion i figured i had just blinked at the wrong time. however, it kept repeating such a motion. it would rise a little bit, dart to the left or the right, hover in that position, then rise again. now i was beginning to think it was a drone (what kind of plane moves like that?), maybe a consumer one belonging to someone in the neighborhood because i still couldn't really gauge the size. as the craft continued its dart-hover-rise routine, it also began slowly moving southwest, diagonal of where i was standing. it eventually stopped its previous movements and just hovered for a bit before continuing on a steady southwest path. as it moved closer to me, i could see that there were four yellow lights in a row on the front of the craft, and two red, blinking lights on the back. still completely bewildered by what i was seeing, coupled with the craft's color matching that of the clouds overhead, i couldn't really make out its shape. yet as it moved closer to me, i could see that it was a flat, square or possibly rectangular object with four yellow headlights and two red taillights on the back corners. my phone had died when i got to the park, so i couldn't document what i was seeing. i did not notice any lights on the underside of the craft, and it never passed directly over to me. the craft continued moving southwest, and i lost sight of it when it became obscured by some trees. i thought i heard a very quiet, jet-like sound coming from it's direction, but i didn't notice it until it was at its nearest to me, and a lot of jets go by because of the city airport to the south so it may not have been the craft making that sound. i didn't feel strange or affected by the object, just absolutely bewildered by what i was seeing. when i first saw the lights i facetiously said to myself \"what's if it's a ufo?\" regardless of the object's nature, i'm pretty excited to have a cool story to tell people.

at night on aug 9, 2016 to take pictures of nice sunset in an otherwise clear blue sky but soon long thin domes of black clouds started to appear here and there, slim in wide but a little domed in the middle.  some would fade and others appeared but no lights or anything else.  \r\nthen all of a sudden i noticed these black forms forming on top of dark strips of clouds over the reddish orange clouds of the sunset and the forms almost looked like a little cityscape, like black forms of buildings.  i got a picture but have to develope this film.  through a set of good binoculars they were pretty strange.\r\n\r\ni kept watching the sky because something seemed so odd about all the formations i saw so far and notice little white dots moving here and there and assumed them to be small planes over quebec, across the river from ottawa.  i saw one of those bright white dots before, during and after the sighting of the large oval form i will tell you about next.\r\n\r\nthe night was very warm and humid.  i all of a sudden realized that another type of cloud was forming in the north east over the river more than over quebec and it seemed to be in the shape of an arc, made out of white/grey clouds in an otherwise clearer blue sky in that area.  the black thin clouds were in the background, not near this arc.  the white cloudlike arc was just a half an arc but huge, took up half the sky it seemed and i watched it as it started to change more.  from that bottom half an arc made of light whiter clouds there seemed to radiate several, maybe 5 long ray like lines that went up into what seemed like a centre of something.  you still couldn't see a total form of what now looked like a huge disc but you had the feeling that the form was definitely there.\r\n\r\nthen i realized, just out of nowhere that this thing was moving.  i thought ti was stationary then as i watched it i noticed that it was in fact slowly moving as a huge mass southward and over my apt building.  at that point i also notice that above the white arc that made up what seemed to be the bottom of something the whole middle area was in fact much darker than the sky around it.  that is when i started to freak a bit.  i also notice what i think was a sort of vibrating inside me although i didn't hear that sound i felt i should have due to this sense of vibration and the size of this thing moving over my neighbourhood.  i got a few pictures of it but it was so massive i couldn't get it all in the frame and again have to get these films developed.\r\n\r\nit was getting dark out but the whole event lasted about 45 minutes from the first time i noticed the whitish clouds that formed the bottom arc start to appear, they weren't there before, to when the massize object moved to the south and disappeared - moved very slowly.  i honestly think that i just saw a mothership.\r\n\r\nthe way the whole centre was darker than the sunset sky around it, it all stayed in one huge shape, the oval bottom that was first to appear was out of place in the night sky with the other clouds black and disappating and then some appearing but this huge object stayed the same and appeared solid.  i never saw any lights on it and the white rays i saw on it at first that went into the middle of the object slowly disappeared after a bit.  for a minute in the middle of the sighting i think i saw a centre that was lighter than the rest - almost like the the whitish grey of the clouds that formed that bottom arc.\r\n\r\nbecause of the heat here there were lots of air conditioners going that interfered with any sound it might have made but like i said before i am sure i felt a vibration as it went over but can't be 100% sure.  i just seem to sense a deep vibration.\r\n\r\ni am a bit shaken up from this sighting because it all just seemed to form out of nowhere and before i knew it there it was and moving slowly out of sight.  it was huge and you got a powerful feeling from it.  i have had other sightings of various ufos in this same area over the years, all different.  something is definitely going on in this area.\r\n\r\ni got the feeling that the majority of this huge object was cloaked or invisible in some way.  none of it dissipated at all from the first i saw of it forming as that cloudlike arc.  the centre was definitely much darker though like i said compared to the darker blue of the sky around it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:31:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

3pm ,08/02/2016 a little cloudy, sunny and breezy. i took a short cut as everyone in the neighborhood does thru the alley where apartment garages are. i heard the same noise as always of a jet passing fast that nobody ever sees. i looked up to see if i can see what makes this noise other than at my house looking. what i saw starting from a garage rooftop was a snake shaped smokey figure moving like a snake towards the sky. it was about 5-6 feet long maybe 5-6 inches wide. i stared at it wiggling up for 10-15 seconds then the clouds in the sky in the background blended with the snake figure that i couldn't see it anymore. i remember someone telling me this before. i found out it was my son and his now ex girlfriend. he and her saw the same thing but maybe another block a way behind the

daughter. \r\n\r\nlast sunday 8/7/16, my wife, and my 2 daughters (8 and 5 years old), and myself went to the beach at coney island 2 blocks from my house at about 11;30am-12pm.  we set up our blanket and since my kids were relaxing on the blanket, i decided to go for a swim for 5-10 minutes.  when i got out of the water we started eating something.  my wife then asked if i saw the objects in the sky and i said that i did not.  this was around 1pm. \r\n\r\nshe described about 5 to 6 (my daughter said 6) needle or rod shaped metallic objects which were flying in formation at high altitude.  several were reflecting the sunlight and the others were dull. it was a beautiful sunny day with few if any clouds.  they were very high as some planes appear when they fly at high altitude (much higher than the planes we see taking off and landing at nearby jfk airport).  \r\n\r\nthey were flying in formation heading east with three in the front side by side with the other two rows behind with objects moving but to the east but with simultaneous lateral movements.  the formation itself did not deviate from the movement to the east. \r\n\r\nthe speed at which they were flying appeared to be high.  the movement across the sky was similar to the movement across the sky the planes taking off and landing at jfk were doing, except the planes were a lot closer and come in out of the south.  \r\n\r\nthe attached sketch was drawn by my wife later that evening.  \r\nthe object below is the reference of the top of our beach umbrella.  the objects appear as the small lines at the upper left hand of the sketch.  the middle shows an enlargement. \r\n \r\n\r\nneither of us have ever witnessed a ufo in the past (i wish i had seen these).  she insists that they were not birds.
