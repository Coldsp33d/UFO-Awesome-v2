(out of character for him). i tried to videotape with my cell phone but when we got back there was nothing visual at all. we only have the audio which is embarrasing because i used a lot of profanity but didnt realize it at the time. since then we have been searching the net for similar stories and are compelled to seek similar experiences. we definitely want to know more and hope that reporting now may find someone else with a corroborated version. came across this site in our search and have broadened our horizons on this ufo thing a little. hope our story helps ultimately, even if just a little. we feel like no one will believe us, and without photogrphic evidence, it will just be \"our awakening\".

my back yard with a headache. sat down, leaned back, rest my head on chair with closed eyes. i was facing northwards. when i opened my eyes i saw a tiny white dot in the sky through the leaves of the tree. assumed it was a plane or a high flying bird but the orb of light did not move at all. after about 3-5 min of waiting for the light to move i thought, \"could be a ufo?\" \r\n\r\ni ran in the house, yelled at my daughter, \"there's a ufo outside!\", grabbed my camera, and dashed back into the yard. was sure the light would be gone when i got back outside but it still hovered in the exact same spot. i sat in the chair, popped on my zoom lens and maxed it out. it was still nothing but a blob of white light on the view screen. \r\n\r\nby this time i was excited because i didn't know what could hover motionless in the sky for so long. i noted that all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking and wondered if the light had something to do with it. i took more photos then moved to the drive way for a clearer shot of the object. \r\n\r\ni got one shot off and noticed the tiny form of a turkey vulture soar through the sky near the orb. i realized i was still wearing my sunglasses and took them off so i could focus better. when i looked through the viewfinder to find the ufo i couldn't see it. i put my glasses back on and it was there again. i took the glasses off and on a couple of times and each time they were off i couldn't see the orb in the sky. i put my glasses on took a quick shot trying to capture the vulture and the orb in the same photo. at this time the corners of my viewfinder went dark and i thought my camera was going to shut off or finally conk out. \r\n\r\ni looked down at my viewfinder to see if i'd captured them both in the same shot. it looked like i hadn't so i looked upward again to find the orb. it was gone! i spun and scanned the sky and saw the orb zipping away with the speed of a meteor toward the south east. it whipped past the moon and faded into the distance. \r\n\r\nseeing the unbelievable speed with which the orb escaped left now doubt in my mind i had just witnessed and potentially captured on camera... an actual ufo.

slightly dim lights together in 20-30° angle. told my father & he also was watching. he went to get shoes on as i was still watching. i observed the 3 fade away slowly & / or appear moving towards the north slightly west horizon. my father did not see the 3 as they faded. he then noticed they were there again. however, there were only 2 now. i thought it was odd how they just reappeared in the 1st position where i first seen them. they seemed slightly brighter than when i first saw them. my father & i watched / observed them asking and talking to each other. asked what the heck & what are those. we both thought they were strange. the 2 also seemed to move away toward the horizon & also faded away / vanished. the right one however seemed to move upward toward the horizon instead of a straight line path towards it. my 1st thought was maybe they are flares but they weren't too bright & were hovering. i then thought chinese lanterns but when i seen the 2 balls / orbs of light reappear. i thought if they were chinese lanterns, we would've seen them ascend upwards slowly, but the 2 orbs that appeared or returned were already in the air floating or hovering. when the lights were out, i didn't see an object, craft, airplane, blimp, or helicopter where they were. occasionally, we have airplanes fly overhead with & without landing lights as well as helicopters flying at low heights. however, the objects weren't any & did not hear an engine, any sort of wind turbulence, or any noise from these light orbs. i have no idea what i saw. i thought maybe it's some kind of energy being released from the earth or some atmospheric anomaly, possibly both. i lost sight of the 1st 3 orbs/lights gradually as the lights appeared to fade away and / or move towards the horizon. the second set of 2 lights also did the same. the only difference was that the right orb / light appeared to move slightly upward as well as fading or moving towards the horizon. i didn't want to go inside to grab my phone to take a picture or video as i didn't want to lose sight of it as it was something i haven't seen. my conclusion is that they were something i've never seen before and

was 5th april 2014_22.55 minutes italy time.\r\ni was driving with my wife (also witness) and my son in car to home.\r\ncoordinates of the sighting are 44.042 n_10.161 e.\r\nduring the trip to home the street goes on mountains and beside the street there is a black railing, always in the dark.It was glowing with segmented blue lights like projected on it.So i've slowed down the car to see that, and after few meters passed the railing the car get completely illuminated inside of these electric blue lights, in the windshield and the dashboard.\r\nthere was also a metallic and cyclic sound in my ears so i've stopped the car and i thought \"man who is joking me with lasers?!\"but my wife immediately push herself over the dashboard of the car and through the windshield saw on top of the car at the height of treetops this big circular set of blue electric lights of a diameter of 8-10 meters. she screams me to run away because that huge thing was practically on top of us, so i did but i was totally flashed in the eyes by those blue segmented lights, that makes me drive like 20 meters than i stop and that thing was gone. believe me seeing those thing up in the sky at 2000-5000 meters is a thing, see it at 5 meters is another matter, you really freak the hell out. that was a machine, not human,the sound i've heard was like an electronic sequence that cycling was accelerating until the vehicle was jumped away maybe vertically.\r\nitalian aeronautics received my information through the police and they get to interview me and my wife, and guess what, they were really prepared regarding the subject. i've asked to him, a leutenant\"do you know other cases in the area?\"and he said\"i'm not authorized to talk about this\".\r\njust a last thing: during the mess this machine did on top of my car, my side window was slightly open, and the light coming from that thing hits my left eye, in the angle opposite from the nose,and it get irritated like a sunburn.But my wife saw it fully from the windshield and didn't get sunburned from it.Maybe the glass protected her from that light.","distance":"20 Feet or
