States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Throughout my childhood my family and i would take a vacation to a bed and breakfast called the hazen inn located in northern wi. while at the inn we would partake in a variety of actives, one of which being fishing. my dad would fish all day and then i would always join him at night to go fishing from about 7pm until 11pm for muskies. going night fishing was nothing new to the both of us as we had been doing this for many years before this on long lake (the lake the bed and breakfast was on). i remember the experience almost as if it had happened yesterday. only two of the events i am unsure about, but i will make that clear when i tell the story. \r\n\r\none night, after dinner, my dad and i went fishing. the night started out as any other night would. we were fishing on the southern end of the lake as the sun was on the cusp of setting behind the trees. i casted my bait out into the sun's reflection on the water, as i normally would hoping a fish would be in that golden strip of light, when my dad, who was behind me, exclaimed, \"look at that!.\" i turned around expecting to see a musky following his bait in when to my surprise, there was nothing. i asked him what he saw, he just looked at me, shook his head and said, \"nothing.\" i turned back around not thinking much about the event. i then took another cast out toward the shore where the sun was once showing. as i was bringing my bait in, my eyes began to wander and make observations about the shoreline and water. after a little my eyes began to look at the waves right next to the boat when i noticed two green glowing lights at the bottom of the lake shining up toward me. the lights almost looked like a car's headlights at the bottom of the lake, shining up through the murky green water. the quickly exclaimed, \"dad look!\" as he turned and i looked back where the lights were, they had vanished. he asked what i saw and i tried to explain what i had seen. he then verified that he had seen the exact same thing moments before. little did we know that this would only be the beginning to one of the most terrifying moments of our lives.\r\n\r\nnot feeling too scared by the event we continued fishing. after taking another cast i noticed two white flashing lights above the tree line. the lights were in a vertical line flashing at the same time in a steady pulse off an on. being in northern wisconsin and fishing this lake many times, i could not recall a radio tower ever being there. i asked my dad, \"do you remember there being a radio tower there?\" he looked at it but could not recall a tower ever being there. we stared at the tower for a minute or two when the lights began to move apart. one of the lights went beyond the tree line while the other flew to the northern part of the lake into the town. normally, we would brush the experience off as being air planes; however, the flashing light to the one flying over the lake was moving in random direction. with a plane you can normally track where a plane will appear next in the night sky, but with this there was no clear path as to where it was going to appear next. in this moment we knew that we were witnessing a ufo. feeling trapped, my dad being the comic relief to all situations said to me, \"lets try communicating with it.\" i got a little smile on my face from the little joke as my dad went to the navigation lights on our boat. he put his hand on the switched the lights on and off three times. on the third flash, out of no where, we were the sound of a saucer buzzing our heads. the sound can only be compared to perhaps the sound that the cars make on the cartoon show the jetsons. feeling scared out of our minds my dad then said, perhaps those were birds to which i said, \"those were no f$#&ing birds dad.\" he looked at me know that to be the truth. in this moment, i am not positive of this, but a green light (for a moment) flashed me in the eyes to which i could not see. i say that i am not sure because it only happened to me and it was brief. \r\n\r\nin this moment i distinctly remember looking around the lake. normally, at night, the lake has activity on or around it. whether that means a pontoon boat riding around or someone around a campfire, normally there is some type of human presence. in this night, there was nothing. the colors almost seemed to be vanished and the whole lake appeared black and white as if we had just entered a story book. with our navigation lights off, my dad and i slowly began to move into shore in the dark of the night as if we were being hunted. we eventually came up to a desolate spot on the shore well away from houses. my dad, being the crazy fisherman he is, said to me that he had seen some bait fish earlier today off of the shore and thought perhaps they may have moved in closer to shore and muskies may have came up to feed on them. so he stopped the boat and took some casts. not moving i stayed put in my seat. right into the first cast we noticed a light in the middle of the woods. at this point it was pitch black in the middle of the north woods. it could have maybe been a person, but the chances of that seem unlikely. my dad would explain the light as an intense light that was bouncing around in the woods. in this moment we didn't even turn the engine on. we quietly trolled down the shore line until we approached a house. the house was either red or green, i believe it was the red house at the end of charlyes road on the bay of the lake. the lights were around this house again. we sat in silence as we watched the lights dance around on trees behind the house. every light in the cabin was on. at some point, the lights from behind the cabin began tracing the outer edge of the windows on the front of the cabin. the light did this for each window on the cabin. then, as if a light switch had been hit, all the lights in the woods and all the lights in the cabin went out at once. \r\n\r\nwe slowly made our way back to the bed and breakfast fully expecting to intercepted on the pier where we tied our boat up. to our joy, we did not run into anything else. we quickly drove back up the hill and into the inn. we ran into my mom and told her to the story to which she verified that she also heard the buzzing sound a half mile down the lake from where we were. she was up in her room reading a book. to this day, we have been unable to explain the events we experienced, but it makes for a great story to tell friends who are interested.

there's not usually people  at the lodge when we go because it's so late. but this time there seem to be someone there. so i plan was to just sit there until he left. we saw his car start up and him start to drive.  we saw this guy driving to a place that we've never seen before so we it was followed him. it was just another building that we haven't discovered. we hid until he left. when he left we just started messing around at the new building that we descovered.  as were doing this we where still paranoid that could be someone around that could catch us. we are on the left side of the building looking toward the lodge between us in the lodge were a lot of trees. there was streetlights by the lodge and we saw the lights from the streetlights seeping through the trees and reflecting off some sort of vehicle in the distance i ran over to check it ou. there was street lights by the lodge and we saw the lights from the streetlights seeping through the trees and reflecting off some sort of vehicle on the distance. i ran over alone to check it out it was very dark so i got frightene i ran over alone to check it out it was very dark so  i got sort of frightened. so i turned around and told my friend to come with me through the path to the vehicle. we got there it was just a little bulldozer. so we just started messing around with it. my friend climbed inside the small bulldozer the bulldozer was facing a lot of trees. i saw shovel so pick it up just to look cool.  my friend and i often use an app called snapchat. so on this app you pretty much just take videos and post them so your friends can see him.  my friend was in the bulldozer taking a video for snapchat. i was standing on the rim of the wooded area with the camera on me. i heard some rustling to the left of me as i glanced over i saw  many of the branches flowing towards me like someone ran through it. i get really frightened thinking it was a coyote or something. i run just around 10 feet turn around to look at my friend.I tell my friend to get out of the bulldozer. he couldn't speak he couldn't move he was so frightened. he told me he saw face next to my left shoulder. i wasn't too  frightened at this point. i thought there's no way that that could be. due to the fact that i couldn't think of an animal that was as tall as me that if gotten that close to me when i've hurt me in addition it was orange would look back on the video. we continued to hang around the golf course. when we left the golf course we check the video on my friend snapchat. on the video it shows me and a shadow come from the right of me. at this point it's hard to see but is definitely there. it's when it passes me you can see it the best. when it passes me see a bright orange stripe that kind a looks like it could be an arm. once i saw the video i was so frightened. the fact that that thing was close enough that i could of bit me.  the crazy thing about the video is when it shows me look to the left that's when i heard it when i look to the left of the being had already passed me. so whatever it was it was so fast so stealthy that i didn't hear it until i had already passed me. my friend said that when he saw the face all he could see was it go past me really fast and go back into the woods. i've tried rule out that this is an extraterrestrial. but there's just no other explanation.  in the video after my friend has put the camera down and looked at himself in the bulldozer. when he looks back up at me yours have to slowdown frame by frame  and look at my right shoulder first and when i say right shoulder i mean from which way the camera is facing. look right at my neck you'll see the shadow pass you have to watch it a few times or maybe not but is very apparent . after you see the right side continue with the rest of the video frame by frame. the most apparent image is when you see an orange thing i don't know what it is it could be an arm but you see a pass behind me to my left shoulder.  keep me and my friend were only messing around despite what my stupid friend says in the video.","distance":"20 Feet or

of his best friends to spend the night on a weekend night.  to me, the evening was a typical, uneventful sleepover night where the boys stayed up late and slept in the next day.  when they awoke, we were all surprised to see that it had snowed the previous night, about 3 inches.  this was enough for much excitement, so i bundled the boys in their coats, hats and gloves and sent them outside.  not a few moments later, my son came back to the front door with a panicked look on his face.  “mom!  come quick-you have to see this!”  i grabbed a coat and ran outside.  my son was at the bottom of the front steps cautioning me to look down.  we were on the front landing.  to be able to see comfortably through the front window from the landing, one would have to stand about 7 feet tall.  what we saw directly below the large front window were two big “footprints”.  my cell phone at the time was an older nokia flip phone, and i didn’t know how to do videos with it.  frankly, the thought didn’t even cross my mind as i was dumbfounded by what i saw in the snow.  the prints looked like large (size 13 approximately) “y” shapes with the “y” stem and “toes” being large.  being careful not to disturb the prints and surrounding snow, we walked to about the middle of the yard, about 20 feet away to follow the prints as they progressed toward the house.  with the new-fallen snow as fresh and undisturbed as it was, it was absolutely unmistakable that the prints “appeared” in the middle of the yard and advanced toward the base of the front window.  this looked as though the creature was “set down” in the snow at that particular point in the yard.  the boys were obviously extremely concerned about what we saw.  i recall somewhat passing it off as a bizarre creature that had somehow made its way to the house.  after all, the parents of my son’s friend were to arrive at any time now, and i had much to do that day.   \r\n\r\nfast forward to march 2010 and my son, now 16 years old, was on spring break.  we had tickets to a chicago bulls game and he and his friend were anxiously packing for the long weekend trip to the windy city.  this was the same friend who’d spent the night five years before.\r\n\r\nwe were in the kitchen going over the necessary items for the trip, and my son said to me most seriously  “mom” (pause), “do you believe in extra-terrestrials?”  “why, of course i do”, i responded whole-heartedly. \r\n\r\nmy son and his friend began to share the story of that night back in 2005.  as the boys were still fairly young, they stayed upstairs to sleep, rather than in the basement.  the upstairs of our ranch house is simple and without a foyer, a guest would open the front door and walk right into the front room. \r\n\r\nthe front room has a large 13 foot–long window, approximately 3 feet tall.  it has blinds on it that are partially open at all times because the open /close mechanism is broken.  the area is backwards l-shaped, and as you walk through the front room, there’s a small sitting area directly across from the large window, toward the back of the house.  this is where the boys set up camp, complete with tv, couch and sleeping bags.  \r\n\r\ni was asleep in a bedroom down the hall and was unaware of anything happening throughout that night.  according to the boys, they were lying on the floor facing the tv, with the large 13 foot window to their backs.  they began to get ready to sleep, so the lights were turned off and so was the television.  the room was completely dark.  just a few moments later, somewhere between midnight and 2 am, both boys saw a reflection on the tv and the wall in front of them of a bright green light. the frightened boys huddled on the couch, barely peeking their heads up, to see if there was something they could see. this green light emitting into the room filled up the entire 13 foot-long window initially.  then, the light began to pan from left to right, accelerating with every second.  suddenly and at the speed of light, the brightest green light ever imaginable was seen and disappeared.   \r\n\r\n…it had snowed that night.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

and when i walked to the end of the carport i looked up to see the stars or maybe also with the home of seeing a ufo.I have witnessed more then 8 sightings right down here in se oklahoma over the span of the last 4 years but this will be my first official report.When i caught the lights of the craft with my pariphial vision i told my nephew to look up that there was a ufo and it the ufo was just darting all around left to right up and down and in circular motions all the while doing all the jumpin all around it stared to slowly move a way back behind a bunch of trees.I have an app on my phone that lets you use your phone as a flashlight and its pretty bright plus i live in the country so theres little light polution from the city.Ok so on t\r\nthe app there is this flashlight which is realy bright.It also has a setting on it to make it flash \r\nlike a strob.So i started flashin the light and it seemed to respond with rappid movements and strobing lights.Then ot pretty much faded away behind a line of trrees.Ok so around a hour later me and my nehew go outside so i could smoke and do some more uwhat tching and boom there was what i thought might have been the same object so i started flashing it with my phones light and then the object really started to dance for us.Ok then that happened around 2 in the morning.Me and my nephew go back inside so i could download a app that flashed red and blue strobes like a cop car. when i came outside there was i have to say atleast 6to7 slow and silent obje cts moving over my house and all around it all going pretty much going towards the object or objects if you will.All of them had red flashing lights on them that blinked pretty slow.And they all had like a yellowish looking set of lights on the backend of the crafts that were flying overhead and around my whole property at verry low speeds as if surveillancing the place.The objects looked to be round in the front at the nose and flat in the back where the red and dirty looking yellowish lights were flashing in what looked like a sequence of up to 6 maybe 7 lights.We got nervous because there was a lot of them flying back and forth over us so we went back inside.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

from the windows in my livingroom i have a full view of the little mountain south east of my home. it was dark outside at this point. i was sitting in the couch when i registered some outside movement in my side-sight. i turned towards the window and saw a bright, round white oval-shaped light hovering in the sky over the mountaintop. the sky was clear of clouds so i could see that it wasn`t a star. at first i thought it was a plane, but it stood still and i saw no other lights coming from the object as i continued to watch it. i opened the window to hear if it was a plane, but it was no sound. the object started to move, very slowly, a bit up and a bit down, but it didn`t go anywhere. after about 15 minuites of watching this thing i decided to look up on my computer if there were any planes that was passing in the area. there were none. i went back to the window, the object was still there, but now i could see to more oval-shaped lights coming in slowley from each side directly underneath the larger one. it almost looked like they merged into eachother and hovered underneath the bigger one. the objects remained hovering like this for about 30 minutes, before being what i only can describe as pulled into the larger object overhead.Then the larger object started swinging a couple of times before shooting up and in a matter of seconds being out of sight.\r\n\r\ni did not feel afraid during this observation, but rather intrigued. i tried in my mind to come up with rational explenations, but i had a feeling in my gut that this was something \"not of this world\". i have

light being up high and the left being lower, then it disappeared from sight. i did notice that there was a plane flying up high with blinking lights to the northeast of where we were standing.  we were all very perplexed as we had never seen anything like this. my father was in the army and we all grew up seeing different aircraft from safb (scott air force base). it did not have a red blinking light and it was far lower than any planes we had seen aside from crop dusters. it was also dark and we heard no sound that would indicate aircraft we're used to seeing. my husband and i left within

tried at the time to get more information from her but she was unable to give any. now please remember that my grandmother was a simple woman, born in rural india in the height of the british empire, she never learned how to read and in all the years that i knew my grandmother she never showed interest in aliens or ufo’s or the like and i always got the impression that she never believed in life beyond the stars mostly because she lived a simple life.\r\n\r\nevent two– balls of light from construction site.\r\n\r\nthe second event happened over the period of many years and i believe it started when a fancy condo was being built next to my grandmothers apartment block. at the time she was living in hackney, england around 10 years ago.\r\nshe reported seeing strange lights floating in or around the building site and strangely enough the building site took a long time to be finished because it kept having structural issues and kept falling apart. in case you are curious the site was previously a children’s library.\r\non one occasion my grandmother reported seeing a ball of light enter through her window and float around her room for a minuet or so before flying back out of the window and vanishing.\r\n\r\nso to conclude these two events my grandmother witnessed and now i have relayed them to you. i hope it becomes of help in the future.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":78198,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.542758318670955,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-08052016-0002","longitude":-0.056373176311120564,"occurred":915224400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1470365312000,"summary":"Orbs

sky at approximately a 45 degree angle on the horizon.  it appeared to be approaching at a rapid speed.  the object then appeared to stop and hover.  my first impression of it was a very fast moving aircraft.  the object hovered for several minutes in which time i began to record it in time for it to descend rapidly below the tree lines.  the object then reappeared several moments later moving to the east before it made a very rapid ascent to a higher altitute, roughly 70-80 degrees to the horizon.  it remained in a nearly stationary position in which it emitted a red/white light which appeared to either flicker or possibly strobe.  \r\n  it remained in this position for approximately 3 minutes or so before it began a near vertical descent.  it's rate of descent increased as it got lower to the horizon.  it also appeared to be closer as the object appeared larger as it neared the treeline before disappearing.  \r\n  my feelings at the time was of disbelief and of trying to identify the object.  i have a master's degree in aeronautics and i was trying to figure out how to rationalize what i was seeing.  the only possible explanation i can come up with is a drone with a light array on it, however, from my viewpoint and with the time/distance traveled, it appeared to be moving way too fast to be a drone.  \r\n   i am attaching the video i took and am hoping someone from a different vantage point will report it as well so that a triangulation can be made to determine if this was a drone or something else.
