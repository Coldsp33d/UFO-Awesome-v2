disappeared. and when we got back to the truck one and one half hours had elapsed.My friend and i discussed the event briefly and agreed to tell no one.Not long after this we quit speaking to

were sitting in the float tubes on a calm summer night. you could hear a pin drop.  there was no wind either.  at about 3 am i was facing the shoreline and my friend was facing the other direction fishing deep water.  when i went to cast i saw a blue fireball appear about 30ft above the trees right in front of me, then another and another until it formed a giant circle. the second the first \"afterburner\" connected to the last one the whole circle ignited. i looked towards my friend because the light was so bright.  then i realized i could see for miles beyond the lake.  it was like night turned into day. i looked back at the circle and right when i did...Boom the exact sound you hear when a jet breaks the sound barrier.  i know because i have seen it a few times at air shows. in that second it just vanished.  in other words it went from a dead stop to breaking the sound barrier in a split second.  no human made craft can do that.  the scary part was before the lights.  we never heard nor saw anything. it hovered over our heads to get to its take off point and we had no clue.  i know it sounds crazy. at first i thought i dozed off and dreamed it, but after the light and the bang my friend starting freaking the hell out. i knew then what i saw was real. people can deny all they want.  i know now they are out there...It all happened it about 4 seconds. i was too

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" left mother-in-law's house (festusmo) with my wife driving a convertible car i'm in the front passenger seat car top down (no alcohol no drugs in system).  traveling on highway m  about 8 miles south of byrnes mill missouri and  before hwy 21, i noticed long white streaky clouds  approximately three or 4 miles away best guess, then out of nowhere vapor streaks of appeared with no visible object in front of them (3 or so  timed out every couple of seconds ---)\r\ni thought how unusual the vapor streaks were very bright  and straight heading east.\r\nthe vapor streaks maybe several hundred feet long stopped when they got to the narrow cloudbank i had been watching.  my emotions were that was interesting why could i not see a lead craft i see them all the time living in ballwin missouri on top of a hill and a frequent jet route both military and  commercial. \r\n this really got my attention, and my wife noticed that something was up, she also saw the streaks but only after i pointed them out to her. i continued to watch this long drawnout cloud bank, when suddenly a darker metallic round (maybe cylinder)  object appeared out of the clouds where the streaks went into them on the opposite side .  this was more of a long drawnout cloud not very wide maybe quarter-mile half-mile wide.  the object  was traveling south by southwest ( away from the car ) and a moving along the edge of the cloud i watched it until i could not see it anymore. this was an interesting experience i honestly do not know what i saw experimental aircraft, extraterrestrial, don't know.  one final observation was that when the craft was flying along the clouds it's speed compared to the speed of the streaks was maybe one fourth in other words it was moving much slower than whatever caused the streaks,  that to me was not normal aircraft.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if this is the form for reporting my life ufo incidences, but here it goes condensed old to new.\r\n1) my friend michael liautaud (owner milios subs) 1970s upstate wisconsin while in car  bright light comes towards car and the car electronics is fried,  parents confirmed story.\r\n2)1978 returning from chicago to cary illinois i  noticed several lights near barrington road and algonquin rd,  upon finally getting to that intersection i noticed very large metallic object moving slowly and making a sound.  this observation ended with me staring up at it outside of the car as it moved away from me . (the ironic part of the story is that mike leotaud  was the driver of the car).  according to my high school science teacher there hadn't been strange sightings in this area before.\r\n3) 1993 my mother had just passed away in her home at  venice florida.  that night i engaged in conversation with a retired air force colonel.  getting into a spiritual conversation while holding his latter during a lightbulb replacement in front of his house,  he told me a story that he claims he had only told a few people.  mid-1960s during practice touchdown and takeoffs and fighter jets they were scrambled to a identified flying object his partner in the lead \r\njet  said that the object was doing circles around him  before it left out of sight.\r\nin  the early a.M. after he had gone to bed his door suddenly opens and sure enough men in suits debrief  after he had gone to bed his door suddenly opens and sure enough men in suits debrief him him and tell my moms neighbor that this never happened you will never talk about it or you will lose your career.\r\n4) in  approximately 2001 laying down face up on a pair in madeira beach florida i watched a circular object that actually appeared to be pinkish on color  and about cloud high  just go right by in a straight line faster than any military jet i have ever seen fly above me.\r\n5) while visiting a  friend of my wife's that lives a  little east of desoto missouri. his property is on much acreage and on top of a hill.  he opened up to me out of the clear blue that he had never been ufo kind of guy but and approximately april or may 2014 he had seen three or four  white orb type of light moving at incredible speeds north east of desoto.  i could tell from his story he was quite shaken up.\r\nthe end\r\n except for the last incident i'm reporting today. \r\n(also it appears that there has been many sightings in missouri in what i now call the triangle\r\nan area  going from byrnes mill to arnold to desoto missouri.)\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional
