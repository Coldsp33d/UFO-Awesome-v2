first thought was it's too bright to be venus this early in the evening with the sun still up. looked at object with binoculars and it still just looked too shinny. started watching the object with a telescope, and it looked too shinny. kept watching the object with the telescope, because the brightness did not appear evenly across the surface, the object appeared to be moving, and there appeared to be an electrical pulsating effect on one side of the object. watched the object thru the telescope until 8:15 pm (45 mins.), and observed that the object was getting dimmer, instead of brighter; as you would expect a star or planet later in the evening. also, noted that the object was now due west; meaning it had moved north from the southwest.Even with the object dimming and moving north, which did not make sense for a star of planet, i decided that i likely had been watching venus. however,at 8:15 pm i observed \"venus\" split into two pieces, or became two objects. one object remained stationary, and the other object appeared to accelerate toward the ground. both objects appeared to fade away quickly after separating. remained outside looking for \"venus\", but it remained missing from the perfectly clear evening sky after separating into two pieces.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

monday august first. we brought a blanket so we could lie on the grass in the courtyard by her condo and watch the stars.\r\n as she was getting comfortable on the blanket getting ready to snuggle when i saw the bright red light in the sky to the north. the big dipper was up and to the right of the light.\r\nmany planes fly by here since the airport is a few miles to the east so i thought at first that it was an airplane heading straight for us since it looked as though it was stationary.\r\nthen i noticed that there were no other lights so i thought it might be a light on one of the towers so i moved to see if i could see any other lights or the hillside and all i saw was the light and sky between it and the horizon. i couldn't figure it out so i started to lie down to snuggle and it was ruined by a ufo..The light or object dropped like a rock, not a leaf. then stopped..It didn't slow down or bounce it just stopped. i sat up real fast and my girlfriend was alarmed and wondering what was wrong..I told her and she sat up to watch the light. we watched it hover for a few minutes and then it shot to the west at incredible speed..It didn't have to build up speed. it just shot off to the west.  my girlfriend was freaked out and ran after it to if it was going to do anything else. she kept saying,\"this is crazy, i have never seen anything like that in my life.\" \"this is crazy\"...\r\n\r\n we were in a courtyard between the condos so when the light took off it went behind the trees and condos. my girlfriend ives here so she ran to a clearing to see if she could see it again and where it was headed.\r\n my girlfriend was very excited and wanted to see it again..She wanted to stay out and watch for it to come back...Then she couldn't stop talking about it. then when we were in bed she opened the blinds to watch for it.\r\n i have seen many ufo's and i have seen 3 alien vehicles. with witnesses,in massachusetts, we saw 3 ships..Not just lights..That was in 1969. then again in 1976 there was a huge orb that looked like the moon was sitting over my house in riverton ,wyoming,.Then a huge ferris wheel looking object was over the ranch in laramie ,wyoming..\r\nso i am very happy that my girlfriend and i saw one together because she didn't really believe my stories before...But it is such an incredible feeling knowing you saw something from another world and there is no doubt about it..\r\n\r\nthis is the most difficult thing about this is the lies from the powers that be and how they humiliate and discredit people..Good people who see

path which at first made me think it was an airplane. upon closer inspection (i walked right up to the window) the object appeared to be the shape of an elongated pentagon at the bottom with a similarly shaped but slightly more rounded top. object had two steady bright white lights at the front of the craft, two of the same lights at the back and along the bottom there appeared to be three red lights that moved in formation ie. one at a time, then repeating. the object moved in a straight path across the sky and this along with the lights made me initially lose interest as i thought i was seeing a plane. something made me look harder however and a faint but still clear outline of the described shape could be seen by me. the object appeared to be moving at a speed slightly faster than normal for an aircraft and in a diagonal direction across my field of vision. object went behind cloud cover, flashed once through clouds and then was gone. immediately after i left the room to gather paper to draw the object from memory and told my father, the only other person awake, about the object.

degrees west of our location. tonight we attempted to use a telescope to view the object and although the telescope was centered on object, only blurred light showed through. viewed through binoculars

light strobed blue, red, green and yellow-orange in a random order. the object moved up, down, sharply to the left and right and at odd angles. a second object of similar make, but further away came in about 20 degrees from the horizon and from approximately 220 degrees ssw. it moved north of the brighter object and up to approx 30 degrees and remained located at a 120 degree angle from the object at approx 310 degrees wnw of the main object. it moved in a similar but random pattern once it came across approx 10 mins after sighting of the first ufo. two air force fighter jets were in the sky flying in a circular pattern around the ufo at approx 18 degrees to the horizon, never moving higher. an air force surveillance plane was seen crossing the area from the north. none of the aircraft landed at hill afb, 1 mile east of our home that we could tell. the fighter aircraft moved off after 12 mins to the south away from the base and the surveillance plane appeared to be on a heading to salt lake international airport where an ang base is also located. it was in the area of the ufo for no longer than 8 mins. we observed the ufo for one hour, six minutes before going in for
