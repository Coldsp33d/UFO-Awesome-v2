a friend of 20 years to olallie lake near mt. jefferson , in oregon.\r\ni brought two reclining lawn chairs for stargazing with the milky way front and center.\r\nour site had an enormous open sky view. we were enjoying our second night of viewing.\r\nwe were pointing out meteors as they became visible, as well as the satellites above.\r\nour site was lakeside ( campsite # 26 ) in the peninsula campground. we were fully reclined in our chairs with a wide field of view with our peripheral vision . \r\nmy buddy at one point said , \" there's another satellite .... oh, and one next to it\".\r\n this comment is what made me turn my head to see what he was talking about. my first observation began as the two lights , which were not only larger that the tiny dots that satellites are seen as , but also greater in diameter that the stars by approx. three times. once i started watching these two lights emerge from behind a tall tree to my right ( on the lake side ) i witnessed them moving very slowly and absolutely silent. they continued slowly heading south for about 30 seconds and then ... together as if on either end of a common structure , it started to turn without any change in speed ( an extremely tight radius ), and the lights kept an identical distance away from each other as it did a complete u-turn and just as slowly as it approached, disappeared behind the trees . \r\nas we digested and discussed what we had both just seen with our own eyes , we turned our gaze back toward the milky way . within 10 minutes i heard my buddy say , \r\n\" there it is again \". i followed his pointed finger and saw it coming from the south this time. and i cannot emphasize enough the total grandeur of witnessing the second sighting as it appeared directly in front of the milky way as if it had just crossed eons of time to present itself. it moved as the first sighting , slowly and completely silent. from my line of sight the two separate lights  seemed spaced at a good distance apart from each other. gauging its altitude was impossible . it did seem to be flying low to the ground. if i were to guesstimate its altitude at 1000 ft. i'd say the distance between the lights were at least a football field's distance apart, if not greater. so, because of its slow movement , my buddy and myself were really able to scrutinize what was virtually flying (gliding) directly overhead . if things weren't interesting enough , this is what i witnessed next, and being only three nights ago i want to write this down while it is still vivid in my memory... as it flew (glided) basically right over the top of us , i was focused on the light on the right side as i saw it. i saw a fine outline around the light as though it was a wing tip with the light positioned just inside the end , centered between the parallel sides and the end. without thinking i said out loud to my buddy ...\r\n\" it's cloaked \". 10 seconds later it disappeared behind the same tree , following the exact same path as did the first after it's u-turn. and that is how i remember the events of just a three nights ago. my feelings at the time were of complete awe !!\r\ni  will mention that i am a fine woodworker and artist. my life is all about being detail oriented and i have a very good eye. my projects require 1/32\" accuracy. i have also been supremely fascinated by high technology and feel i am quite aware of all things known to the public regarding military capabilities. i am 46 years old and have never seen anything even close to what myself and my buddy witnessed together last friday night. my buddy is probably the biggest sceptic on earth and he is reeling from what he saw with his own eyes. i am convinced that i have been given my once in a lifetime glimpse of true reality. it kind of feels like christmas as a kid. \r\n\r\np.S. i have a very interesting series of google earth images over a desolate area of peru i'd love feedback on.

and appeared to want out.  i checked the clock and saw that it was 11pm.  i took the dog out side and immediately noticed a large bright (red/orange) object in the sky diagonal from where i was standing.  \r\n\r\nthe object was so bright and large, that my first thoughts were that a small aircraft was on fire and possibly in the process of crashing. i yelled for the dog to come inside fearing it was a crash in process. \r\n\r\nwithin a few second or so, i noticed that there was no sound and the object seemed to move slow at a steady pace, which was a relief that it wasn't a craft on fire. the night sky was cloudy but rather clear and i could see the bright colours and that there were clouds above the object easily.  \r\n\r\ni was confused as to what the object was and wanted to get a picture, but figured that by the time i got my phone, the object would be gone, so i decided to watch the object for as long as i could.  \r\n\r\nthe object continued the diagonal path over a large housing plan and across the road. as it got closer to my location i saw that there was no tail or after-burn, and that the bright lights were steady and didn't pulse. i also noticed that there was no noise at all.  \r\n\r\nthe object moved slowly and smoothly as if on glass or a calm body of water.  i saw clouds above the object but had no real idea on its height from the ground.  since there was so much light around the object, i was unsure of it's shape, but thought it was a bit like a fin (more vertical).  i thought of this because as the object moved closer to me(more to my front, but still as high as it was in the sky) i saw it from the side (sort of), and the lights looked taller and skinnier. so i guessed that the object must be tall and flat and not circular and fat. \r\n\r\nas the object passed to my front, i looked for the dog and he was by my side sitting quietly.  the object moved over my house and as i looked to its rear i noticed that it seemed smaller than the front.  the object moved over the trees and then out of view.  \r\n\r\nnot once was there any noise coming from the object.  i stayed outside for a while and heard nothing.  several planes fly overhead in my area and i've always heard an engine of sorts.  after i went inside, i looked at the clock and saw that about five minutes passed.  \r\n\r\ni was very alert at this time and wasn't sure what i saw.  i kept looking out the windows and around 11:30pm i heard a large aircraft.  i looked out my front door and saw that this was indeed an aircraft, and that it was big, made a nice loud noise and flew over my house almost along the same path as the object.\r\n\r\ni thought perhaps it was a drone, or maybe some other small aircraft, but than thought that it didn't seem either of these would be out at night or that bright.  i have no idea if this was an object or space junk or even some sort of optical illusion, but i wanted to see if anyone else saw anything like it, and figured that this organization would not immediate dismiss the sighting and may have more information. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n

porch to watch a storm system that was approaching at approximately 8:30pm as the sun was setting.  i noticed a look on her face that caught my attention and immediately upon looking south i noticed a very brightly lit \"sphere\" moving towards us rather quickly from the distant sky to the south.  it was so bright and moving so quickly that it gave the appearance of being close.  the color was a bluish tint but did not appear to be casting light in any direction.  \r\n\r\nas the object got closer it abruptly stopped and hoovered perfectly still for multiple minutes.  at this point i began recording with my cell phone... after about :90 the sphere flashed \"off\" and left just a blinking, or pulsating red light.  at this point my friend took off down the road to try and get a different view and possibly see what size the object was.  when the craft  went to a blinking red light i could see several other red lights further away.  i recorded at couple more minutes of the flashing red before it began moving again.  it did a couple circular patterns before returning to it's fully illuminated state.\r\n\r\nat this point it descended below the tree level and began moving from right to left.  i could see it through the trees before it disappeared out of sight.  i kept the camera rolling because i noticed a strange amount of car horns honking and dogs barking after the craft disappeared until my friend came back from down the street.  she reported the same things i saw from the house to include the hoovering, changes of color, and the apparent descent down out of view.  she said that it was much bigger than a drone and had no apparent characteristics of a helicopter.  \r\n\r\ni want to mention that the red flashing appeared very distant and dim, but the illuminating glow was shockingly bright making it hard to judge distance.  i had a strange feeling that what we were seeing wasn't meant to be seen and it even made me feel afraid.  heavy breathing and very high heart rate during the 10min ordeal.

either three or four and when i heard this story it came as somewhat of a shock to me.\r\nit all began a few years ago in 2008 when i was staying with my grandmother for a few months and all of a sudden my grandmother relays a story to me about when i was a very young boy when my mother, father, her and me went to manchester and stayed overnight in a hotel. strangely enough there was two strange incidents in this trip but i’ll focus on the main incident first.\r\nso my mother and father had one room and i and my grandma had another room and my grandma was in the hotel room when she said she saw what looked to be a fiery meteor flying towards us. she said that it struck the steeple of a church opposite the window and then proceeded to fly at the window of the hotel room.\r\nshe said it then materialised into a small white man in the room. my grand mother ran over to me and grabbed me and began to pray. being muslims we know prayers from the heart and she began to pray. she then said that the little white man began to run around us in a circle but the whole time she held me in her arms, now remember at the time i was maybe 3 or 4 so quite small.\r\nshe then told me that the little white man apparently was warded off by the prayer and then walked away into the bathroom and vanished. she checked and there was no one there and she was convinced that the being was trying to get to me or us and that by praying she stopped the being.\r\nnow just to clarify two points, at the time i heard this i was stunned by the sudden admonition and i called my mother who claims never to have heard this story which is strange because my grandmother must have not mentioned it for ever a decade until one day out of the blue she mentions it to me.\r\nnow before i wrap this up there was another mysterious event that happened during that same trip that my parents talk about to this day. when we drove back to our home in houslow middlesex which is about 3 or 4 hours from manchester depending on traffic about halfway home they realised they had forgotten their address book in the hotel. but the strange thing is that upon arriving at our home what was on the table in the middle of the living room, the address book. which is strange because they had used that same address book to find a place they had traveled too in manchester to begin with.\r\ni will not speculate as to the how’s and where forth of the address book and how it returned home or whether it ever left the home to begin with. that’s a discussion for another day but i do find both accounts of the same trip odd.\r\nnow i asked my grandmother for details of the white being and she seemed reluctant but not afraid of the memory. i will add this my grandmother was brought up in rural india during the age of the british empire and she never learned how to read. her english was understandable but she was not well educated and never went to school, i doubt she ever learned what aliens were and she was highly pragmatical and faithful. i doubt she would ever have thought of aliens from beyond the stars and as such i find unlikely that she would think to make such things up, although in all my decades knowing her she never once lied to me. but remember at the time my grandmother was an elderly lady and has since passed on but the story she relayed to me has stayed in my mind for years and now i am doing my duty by relaying the story to you.\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":78102,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.1403927,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-08012016-0007","longitude":-79.02382399999999,"occurred":650322000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

encounter this is always the first that comes to mind when i think of encounters i have had in the past.\r\ni will briefly elaborate on where i was. i was 14 and this was when i was in a boarding school in the midlands of england. i was in my dormitory which normally had three occupants including me, but it was a sunday morning and the two other occupants of the dormitory lives close enough that they could go home every weekend.\r\nas it was i was alone in the room and for no reason what-so-ever i awoke in the morning. i normally never awoke that early and it was early enough that i could look out of the dormitory window and see the early morning glow of the sun-rise outside and i could barely make out the tree-line of the hills outside.\r\ni remember looking up and seeing this huge craft filling the sky overhead. i got the impression of it being triangular in nature but in truth i could barely make out the sides let alone the horizon. i watched it for several minuets as it very slowly drifted overhead.\r\nat no point did the craft make an attempt to shift or suddenly jump away. instead it continued to slowly drift across the sky.\r\ni will describe the underside as best i can. the underside of the craft of either dark grey or black, every now and then i could make out small lights, the majority of which were still but a few blinked. i think most were either white, or some shade of yellow through orange but defiantly there was no shade darker than this.\r\nthe underside of the craft was not smooth, no in fact it was filled with ridges and what looked to be tubing or pipes although to be honest it was far enough away that i could not make out details of these tubes or pipes on the underside.\r\nas i watched it i remember getting the impression that i was watching a floating city, although in truth i have no idea how my teenage mind would come to such a conclusion. i spent several minuets watching it until it was gone, i did not see any engines on the craft and when it was gone i remember having a still feeling.\r\ncome to think of it back then even until now i have always had this kind of still, almost blank feeling when i remember seeing this thing. i have heard in some cases people feel awe inspired or it changed them and i will be honest this is the first and only experience i have ever had with these things in regards to seeing them with my eyes and yet. in truth i have always had this bland feeling when remembering it. which in itself feels a bit disconcerting because i feel like i should have more awe when thinking about these things. but anyway. this is my account. given to the best of my ability and hopefully someday it may be of service to you or humanity at large.\r\n","distance":"21-100

was occupying in the sky. \r\n3. box kite were the initial reaction but quickly dismissed as it were unmoving yet started to move a moment later. \r\n4. perfectly still, perfectly vertical, perfectly symmetrical at first blush. as i watched it it seemingly wobbled as the opposing side rotated slightly towards me. as it did that and then back you could see a projection or appendage, same glossy material, same stark sharp lines. appendage protruded at a 30 degree downward angle and appeared to be half the width of the depth of the overall craft. appendage ended in a 30 degree downward sharp angle. as if it were a 2\" x 4\" piece of lumber angle cut. cut portion had sharp lines just like the rest of the craft and matched the line that makes the bottom of the craft, again symmetrical in shape (followed the same line as the bottom and top of the object). it rotated back to the initial position seen and that was when i went for my cell phone for a photo. seconds later i was at my window camera ready. it had moved in a line away from the initial sighting but not quickly in appearance it had covered some territory. the photo taken is not good and shows what was clearly seen by me to be a square to be not so square, blurred. samsung galaxy 3. took a second pic but you can not distinguish it in that picture as it was being covered by a passing cloud. 20 to 30 minutes later you could still make out a black speck in the same general area in a break in the cloud formation. also, when it were initially turning in front of me, there were some change to it's glossy nature on the side that faced me. as it rotated it appeared to have an elliptical irregularity to the surface that drew some attention from me but, it still somehow appeared flush, flat and black even though the elliptical shape covered fully 1/4th to 1/3rd of that side. more of a line suggesting an oval rather than a protrusion on the surface itself.\r\n\r\n5. have seen a lot of things in my life. many things but this one was a new shape and color unlike any ever seen before.\r\n had recurring dreams of 1 alien creature. humanoid, grey, standing in near total darkness. these persisted for a few days .. up until i spoke with someone about them. they have since stopped after 1 additional dream and all of these dreams have made me wake each time at the same point. a classic grey alien in a near black field. not truly a field just the blackness of a dream with one identifying feature. a grey standing looking my way. likely my psyche reacting to two sightings (earlier report by me on file) very close together.\r\n\r\n6. it truly was a speck when i stopped watching it. hard to make out with the unaided eye. also, when i tried to photograph it. my camera kept changing focus from the object to the closer object, a telephone pole and transformer. really thought i had snapped the pic as the focus box was on the craft .. unfortunately my cell ahs never taken very good pics. it
