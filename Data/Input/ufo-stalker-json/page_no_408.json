observed by all three of us approaching from the sw, just left of the world trade center, heading on a straight course ne, and completely disappearing in an instant just south of the kosciuzsko bridge

it's size, color and velocity, in addition to being completely silent, was unlike anything else we have ever seen. as we watched the object continue to approach, we kept questioning what else it could be. ultimately, we were left in a state of shock and excitement as we witnessed it disappear instantly amonget a completely clear patch of sky. had it not been for this odd disappearing act, we would

would not provide a phone number so i used mine. the witness and his three young children ages 13, 11 and 6 were on vacation in sunrise beach, mo in approximately 1969 (exact date unknown)in july. the witness took his children to a local motel and then to some kind of event. upon arrival at the motel, which is no longer there, they were given a key to a room at the end of the building which was a one-story building. the family noticed that there was a group of people in the picnic area and children on the swings. the people were all dressed in 1900's clothing and they were not speaking or making any noise at all. this family looked over at the witness and his kids, just staring at them, which made the witness nervous. there was also a man sitting in a chair right next to the door of the witness's motel room, which the witness found odd. they said hello, but the man ignored them. a couple of hours later they left the motel to go to the event, and all of the people were gone. he stopped in the office and asked who the people were and the clerk said that no one else was staying there at the time and there shouldn't have been anyone else on the site. the witness and his three kids then left for dinner and the event, which i believe was a rodeo. they drove back to the motel late at 10:30 pm at night, and as they drove along noticed a craft hovering on the side of the road, the craft then moved very slowly over their vehicle. the witness did not intend to stop the car as he was afraid, but the car stopped on its own. the craft, which was a dark metallic gray color and a disk shape approximately 60' in diameter, had white and red lights on the bottom of it. the red light shined a beam inside the vehicle, lighting up the interior of the car with a red glow. the boys were yelling, yet the youngest child, a girl, did not wake up the entire time. then the oldest boy stuck his head outside the window to look up at the craft and got a good look at it. the craft then moved on very slowly and out of sight at the treeline. the witness said that the craft was only about 20-30 feet above their car and it had no noise. he thought they had missing time as well. when they returned to the motel room they all went to sleep and slept through to the next evening. when they woke up they were all disoriented and did not immediately remember the incident, but they gradually did remember it over the next couple of hours and it concerned all of them. no photos were taken. i am reporting this now because it should be on record.

home, wife & i working in back yard painting outbuildings. as i was painting the top edge of the east wall of the storage shed, this orb\r\ncaught my attention. i watched it for about a couple minutes then went over to my wife who was doing trim work around the garage windows.I\r\npointed out the object to her. as she was observing the orb,i went into the house to get my binoculars, ( 7x50 ).  we could then see the colors and color changes.  it went from bright blue to white then to red-orange.\r\nthe color sequence repeated during the whole time period. roughly about\r\na half hour elapsed and a 4 engine jet aircraft which looked to be all white with no markings and possibly no windows as on a commercial craft\r\nflew in an arc from east to south. the orb was quite a distance away\r\nin the north west sky with no sound. the aircraft was fairly low about\r\n( a guestimate ) 5,000 feet. there was also no sound or vapor trails\r\nfrom the aircraft. the sighting of the plane was brief.\r\n\r\nthe orb when first sighted was in the north west sky.  there were some clouds but  it was overall clear and bright.  from the first sighting point in the north west, the orb very slowly moved to the west, stayed\r\nat that position, distance unknown, came back to its starting point,\r\nstayed there, stayed at that position then moved slowly again to the\r\nnorth east. again it stayed at that position. with the few clouds in the sky, the orb stayed out of the clouds.  i can't give you the duration of\r\neach stop position as i'm not sure but the timeline of observation was from 11:15 a.M to 1:02 p.M. \r\n\r\nas for feelings/reactions, everything was normal.  we did let a visitor\r\nobserve use the binoculars and i asked her what she was viewing and she verified our findings. \r\n\r\ni went in for a lunch at approximately 12:40 p.M and went back at 1:02\r\np.M. to once again observe the orb and it was gone.\r\n\r\ni have no additional evidence or film
