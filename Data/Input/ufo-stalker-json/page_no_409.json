home. we bought a home in the country to enjoy the quiet and safety for our kids and pets. i went outside to take the call because the kids were excited about presents and we're running around the living room. i stood on the deck and looked up as i talked. i noticed planes going back and forth, but not asending or desending the slightest. i lost sight when they each were too far away to see. i asked my friend if he knew where any airports were in amelia. he said he didn't. later, i found there are no airports and the closest one is in powhatan, but i believe it is only for private planes. i could be wrong, but upon internet sesrch, this is what i read. amelia is very underdeveloped. powhatan is about an hour from us and although it also has no city and has a lot of farm land, it's a bit more developed than amelia. i highly doubt we could see planes coming and going from richmond. they have a large airport. my first thought was, 'wow, a lot of people are traveling to see family for holiday.' i began to count as i talked to my friend, but didn't tell him what started to come to mind. my heart was beating out of my chest as they flew with hardly any distance apart from each other. there was no way at all i could say the distance they were from me/the ground. they had blinking lights, some white and some a reddish orange. because they were going both ways, it was difficult for me to be sure i wasn't counting some of them more than once, but i do know there were at least 200 and that's when i stopped and just kept watching. all night they never stopped. after hanging up with my friend i sat outside and continued to watch. i tried to take a cell phone picture, but it was just a blurry pinpoint of nothing. upon looking at it, it could have been anything. that phone is broken and long gone. i felt if i showed family, they would think i was crazy and tell me it was an airplane. eventually i went in and asked my husband about airports. he had very little information. i looked online to see if va was having any air shows anywhere, but couldn't find anything. i told just a handful of people on my facebook 'saw hundreds of lights in the sky tonight. anyone else?' only my older sister responded with, 'hello! didn't you people just read this! wow!' but no one, including me, ever said anything about it ever again. my then 11-year-old son believed in aliens and said they had visited him once, so i told him and he believed me and has never forgotten. i don't believe he was visited because we adopted him at age 6 and he was born addicted to every drug imaginable and he is schizophrenic. i never wanted to tell anyone because i've always been the black sheep in the family and i  didn't want them to think i was lying, crazy or trying to get attention. that is not my charecter at all. i finally decided to somewhat come out (to mufon at least) sense i have stage 4 cancer and nothing to lose. if i can help uncover the truth with my one small story, i hope it will be helpful in the tiniest way. i would love to know if anyone in my area also saw these hundreds of lights in the sky a couple days before christmas of 2014. thank you for reading and for

looked like paper in the air high above the highway. as i got closer i noticed they had stopped sorta and were manuerving back and forth. at that point i was floored. broad daylight these things were so bright white i immediately pulled over. turned on my i phone video camera and the video speaks for itself. i felt as if they wanted to be looked at don't know why i felt that way but i even state it in the video. i was sorry no one else was stopping to look at them because whatever it was it was showing off for sure. there were like 30 or more of these things they flew in what looked like formation so at first that why i thought they might  just be birds. once i stopped and focused on them they were making shapes like one shape they made together appeared to be and arrow another one looked like an old satellite dish and so many more i was over whelmed with this feeling of joy while watching them. the material they must be made from had a very cloakish type look from one minute to the next. i could see them then i could not . i really would love someone to analyze my video because you will surely see the most amazing things they did.  at about guess 6 minutes into it i have this overwhelming feeling that i needed to hurry down the highway and that i would be able to see them once more before they left. i keep the camera rolling never stopping footage. sure enough and right in front of a highway sign showing you where i am they reappear and do more amazing shapes they move right left up down turns no aircraft moves like this only birds. but you will see in video there is no wings actually ever flapping. they just look like huge flat pieces of paper. they were incredible at one point as they disappear from my visual i beg them to come back and show me one more time and sure enough they come around on my right side and come up so close you definitely at that point see they are some foreign object. whatever they were they were fantastic and this was my finest moment because i have seen more then this but this one i caught on video. truly amazing and i was not scared of these at all. i have seen others types of ufo's since then as well. a few days later i was over my sisters house and while swimming i was floating on my back and noticed a big silver ball way up above us i asked my nephew and my brother in law if they were seeing the same thing that i

compelled to go out front so that i could see the stars. immediately i noticed a peculiar light traveling e by ne. what was odd is that the craft had lights emitted from it in a pulsating randomized way. from what i could discern the craft had multiple lights blinking both white and reddish amber in color, but never at the same time. what was also odd is that every time the lights blinked, the craft appeared to be zig zagging while crossing th sky. it was like the craft disappeared and reappeared just inches from where it was just at, creating this zig zag pattern as it flew across the sky. the blinking of the lights was randomized and not in any discernable pattern, as far as i could tell. \r\n    for whatever reason i put my hand up into the air, as if trying the use my finger for a size reference. once i put my hand up, the behavior of the craft immediately changed. the blinking lights began to dissapate and the craft appeared to fading into oblivion. the very moment it faded away, an object appeared directly over my head and a brilliant yellow light flashed instantly and was roughly the size of a quarter (if i were to hold a quarter outstretched in my arm). after the light flashed, the sighting was over however the experience was not. \r\n    as i was witnessing the mysterious object my heart was pounding. i was overcome by excitement from having just witnessed what i truly believe to be a ufo. once the light flashed overhead, i was instantly overcome by a feeling of peace. just as i had the conscious thought of the newfound feeling i was experiencing, the wind began to pick up. i looked at the trees over the wall separating the street from my apartment, and they were calm. it were as if a sudden gust of wind was only in my near immediate vicinity. i also noticed it was completely quiet, almost eerily quiet. i live next to the main road and cars travel on it even at all times of night, although there is less traffic in the early hours of the morning. however after the light flashed it was almost as if i were standing in a vacuum. \r\n   as i stood there in complete awe of the spectacle i had just witnessed i began to feel an intense burning feeling in my big toe on my left foot. i looked down and saw no reason as to why my toe was hurting. it burned more intensely and stopped as suddenly as it began. \r\n    now i included what happened after witnessing the mysterious craft as i believe it to be pertinent to the sighting. this total experience left me startled to say the least. i was left with the impression that i was meant to see this, for what reason i may never know. i have seen many questionable objects over the past few months however this sighting stands out, not just because lights and object i had seen, but hat also happened afterward that i find to be highly unusual.

garden during the day.We stayed over to complete the work the next day.Since both of us smoked,we went to the side kitchen door,and sat on the wall,that surrounds the back steps to the house,and kitchen door.I was talking to my friend tony,when i looked up and over his shoulder,i could see in the night sky a complete circular,swirling mass of what i first thought was a cloud.This thing was massive,i asked my m8,if he could see this,to which he answered yes.For some reason he was reluctant to look at it directly.As i observed this circular mass,i was aware that their was no clouds in the sky,apart from this ring,yet to the left of me stars were visible,but nothing could be seen in front of me apart from this ring.The mass was swirling in both a clockwise,and anti clockwise direction,and the outer edge was being pulled and curled inwards as if forming a wall within itself holding the circle completely in place.The centre of this ring was black,as black can be,nothing else was visible directly in front of me.I watched this swirling mass for what seemed ages,but was 15-20 seconds,when suddenly,this thing just blinked out and disappeared completely.I was in absolute awe of what i had just seen,and was trying to talk to my m8,when suddenly this from nowhere,this thing burst open again.It seemed to open from a single spot in space and create in a mini seconds this same circular swirling mass of cloud and light.I noticed that it had moved a small distance away from us,but still in the same height in the sky.I could'nt understand how it was generating its own mass of light,and illuminating the circular cloud formation of this swirling circular mass,again i observed this for about 10-15 seconds,when it blinked out.Each time it disappeared,the stars that were visble before its appearance came into view,but again ,disappeared when this thing burst open.All that was visible in the sky directly in front of us was this giant ring of clouded light,and its dark centre.I observed this happen about 5 times in total,each time slowly going away from us,until we both went back in the house about 15-20 mins later.At no time could i see anything entering,or exiting out of the centre of this mass,nor did i have the common sense to go get my cell phone to try and video this,i was just awe struck by the event.My friend has'nt for whatever reason discussed this with me,or made any comment on this nights events.My friends house backs onto wooded farmland,in a semi rural area,street lighting,and village pollution lighting is minimal at the back of the house,tho this is on the flight path to glasgow airport.I presume that anyone else who may have been around and out that night may have seen a similair event to me,but as yet i have'nt heard anyone

me sleep more than 2 continious hours.\r\n\r\nthis 3rd night, i fall slept at 2am aprox and i suddently woke up very confused at 3:00 am exactly when i noticed that my proximity sensor was activated, but the sensor was disabled since a month ago.\r\n\r\nthe functionality is to play an alarm when the sensor moves away from my mobile phone. the mobile phone and the sensor connect by bluetooth. the sensor is attached my car and house keys. the bluetooth was disabled in my phone, so in theory, nothing can turn on the alarm sensor.\r\n\r\nat 3:00am exactly in july 28th 2016, i was woke up by a blinking light and a sound 'bip' that started like 3 short bips every 4-5 seconds and changing frequency each 30 seconds aprox. it sounded like morse code. i turned the light next to me and i realized it was my proximity sensor.\r\ni took my mobile phone, that was next to me, to turn the sensor off, but as i mentioned, bt was not enabled and when i did enabled the bt, the sensor was not detected by me phone. i was shocked, and i reached the sensor to restart but it didn't work. \r\nconfused and shocked just holded the sensor in my hand and at 3:06  aprox it stoped making the morse code sounds, suddenly it was detected from my mobile phone and working perfectly.\r\n\r\nthe morse code sounds that the sensor made are not configured, if the alarm of the sensor goes on it has a different frequency, a more harmonious one.\r\n\r\n\r\n

comets but traveling very very slowly across a clear dark night sky.  he saw this for perhaps a minute before they traveled out of sight.  didn't have a cell on him to take a picture.  he thought it might be space junk?? as it appeared there were pieces falling off of these lights or objects.  or it could be something else...  traveling too slowly for a comet or a meteor. i'm commenting because these were apparently sighted in az, ca and los vegas nv. and perhaps other places as well, and all tonight.

looked like sparks. it maneuvered around trees, buildings, power lines, and homes. when i saw the movements i thought something was off so i tried to run after where i thought it would land or crash. nothing was there so i continued to search the area for about an hour.  i was in shock because i've seen strange things like this that seem to be getting stranger as time goes on, but nothing like this.  i got tired when i was looking for it and became kind of dizzy. i thought it might have something to do with the black substance emitted from the object, which was not smoke so i went home. i
