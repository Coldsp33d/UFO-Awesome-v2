on a patio swing with my 4 year-old niece, who loved watching and learning about the sometimes steady stream of aircraft whose flight paths were directly over the backyard, which had no trees, and no patio cover. the open sky view was excellent there, one of the only things i liked about being there. having been from a family of pilots, mechanics, and airplane fanatics, a favorite pastime was identifying whatever flew overhead. march a.F.B.Is about 30 miles north of the house, and there were plenty of flights coming out of there (mostly cargo planes; c-5, c-17, etc.) and this day was very clear that afforded an extraordinary view of the skies. the swing faced to the east, that way the afternoon sun was at our backs, and allowed those seated to lean our head back for a relaxed view straight over our heads. this day, i'd gone out and took a seat there with payton, and realized i left my camera on the kitchen table, which was just through the open french door about ten feet away but i decided i didn't want to get back up for that. just as i assumed my head-back position, i spotted a c-17 straight overhead leaving contrail, which was typical. the c-17 is a darker shade of gray, and has a very distinct outline, easy to i.D. when it's at cruising altitude. it took a moment to make sense of what i was seeing, which was a long, white, tube-like object trailing it at the same altitude. a little longer than the c-17, it clearly had no wings or tail section, and was not leaving a contrail like the jet. from my estimation knowing the size of the c-17, the object trailed it by nearly a quarter-mile and held just to the right or starboard side of the jet. as they flew in a southerly direction, the object eventually crossed through the contrail to the port side of the jet, as though staying out of the wash from the wings. after approximately 90 seconds, the object flew off at a slightly higher speed to the left of the jet and ascended quickly out of sight. i'd never heard of cigar-shaped objects, especially white in color so i mentioned it only to a few people, but later learned that it's a relatively common shape and color. i was always open-minded enough to believe in the existence of other life in the universe, but like so many others, am too busy with life to spend a lot of time seeking them. i felt it couldn't hurt to contribute this experience now, having had one other sighting very soon after that one but at night. sightings are very personal in that, it elevated me that day, it gave me reason to believe in all possibilities, and perhaps that's all it was about but, considering the state of our country, knowing there's an intelligence monitoring the ignorance that governs our governments, i sleep a little better each night.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the backside of the dam. i am a retired law enforcement officer. i was very much concerned by this observation and felt that this encounter was unnatural by the size of this creature. my wife was not concerned and wanted to go follow it. i had a feeling that we might be in jeopardy and i wanted to leave immediately. the bird had a wing span over 10 feet and was larger that anything natural i have ever seen fly. it made no sound and when it left the tree directly in front of us it glided approximately 50 feet into a row of trees across the creek and i couldn't see it land. she wanted to follow it and i had this feeling of doom and wanted to leave. i knew it was unnatural and there was a sense of impending doom to me. i couldn't readily see a head, beak, tail, legs or claws. this \"bird\"

past i have experienced uap that resembles natural earthly species of birds that the origin of which is unknown. most recently on or about january 18 2018 at 1720 hours while i was outside on the back porch i observed a large \"bird\" flying from the e towards the w in the nw quadrant of the sky at an approximate altitude of 200 feet. the sky was mostly cloudy and the visibility was clear and unlimited. it was at an approximate elevation of 25 degrees. i am a student of nature, science, space, military and aviation in particular. i am familiar with anything that moves around us in our natural habitat. this flying object resembled a bird. it portrayed the flight characteristic of a bird as it had a set of primary wings mid span of its \r\n body. what stood out was it had a secondary set of smaller wings at the end of it's body. they flapped in tandem at the same rate as the large thin primary wings. the body was slender and long. it had no discernable head or beak. no underpinnings like legs or feet were present. it looked like a skinny b-29. but the body of this uap was thin like a snake. the wings were very thin and long. it moved at times like a eel or snake as it adjusted it's flight path up and down or to the left at slight increments. it was a gull grey in color with no variation across it. i got up and moved through the yard to follow it as it was unnerving and unfamiliar. i followed it above and through the surrounding neighborhood trees and lost sight of it about 30 seconds later. this uap was not a terrestrial object. it did not move in a mechanical fashion and it was very fluid like in it's motion like a live natural creature. it moved through the air much like a sea born creature would move through the water in my opinion. i would estimate the very thin body was at the minimum 10 feet long as were the very thin main wings. the tail wings were about a quarter size of the main wings. this was not any natural earthly flying creature.

flashed approximately every 3-4 seconds, at first did not seem to be moving in a specific direction, but moved around randomly in a small area.  upon noticing that there were no red or green lights like normal craft, i stepped inside, grabbed my binoculars and stepped back out to observe this anomaly that appeared to be at high altitude.  the binoculars showed the same as i could see unaided.  a single bright flashing light, but by this time it was moving in definite eastish direction.  it moved slower than commercial jets i have seen at similar altitudes.  i was slightly excited to be observing something out of the ordinary and lost sight in the binoculars a couple of times.  i then got it in my sights, and as it moved eastward, though still high in the sky it started to become
