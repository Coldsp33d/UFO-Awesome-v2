flashing lights as well. \r\n\r\nit was floating there for a while till i entered the highway just passed the loop and as i continued to drive on the highway it was floating over the highway in a path

translated to english from portuguese and emailed to l. flechtner, field investigator, to file a report.July 27, 2016 at mufon hq in newport beach,ca.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nintroduction in inglês: \r\nbesides these cases, there is also collegues i met two \"not human beings\". maybe reptilians or something else but they taught me some things about them. i met them personnally. i met seperately them and they passed me some knowledge. the first one i met in 2010. the second & last one i met in 2012. i never saw them again. the cam to me, passed me whatever they had to pass me (knowledge) and i never saw them again. the way they teach is not vocally - by words - but by mind. i was lucky because, for the last 20 years of my live, i studied spirituallity, so i was able to learn with them, to understant some things regarding them and earth. \r\ni was - kind of - born with some ability to \"see before happens.\"\r\n\r\nbesides all the portuguese close encounters, the last one was on a summer 2013 in portugal - in the city of cascais where i saw a big \"kind of cigar\" - flying shape. it was big, it was moving slowly in the clear sky, just above the big supermarket called \"jumbo - auchan\" - in cascais, it's color was all metal color shine like stainless steel. it had no windows, it was just a big metallic shining giant look \"cigar - shape\" ufo. i tried to take it a picture because it was moving relaly slow but unfortunately i have no camera - just a cheap cell phone and nothing cam in october.\r\n\r\nalso just to say that: i don't use drugs, even i do not drink alcohol. i am vegetarian and i don't know if i have some kind of alien implant on me because when i was 13 years old, i was at the beach and felted something on my foot. later my mother redbourn me to an x-ray and i remember the doctor saying: \r\nyour sun has somekind of small strange body inside his foot but it seems not to bother at all so, let's not operating him. i am 53 years old and know i never felt any pain related to this small body. maybe it was a needle from a fish? \r\ncase 1\r\nfaro island beach faro august between 1986 and 1988\r\n\r\n\"almost 30 years after this incident, i remember having told a good friend of mine who politely refused to believe, because he did not believe in ufos;. doubted and tried to find a logical explanation for my true if not i gave a lot of importance because the beholder is witness to something that others do not see later, after a few days, he calls me and tells me.: \r\ni believe everything you told me, as a friend of my great confidence, just report a similar case with your on the same beach. now i believe you. \"\r\n\r\nthe year is inaccurate, since nothing pointed about this my first report of a strange vessel at sea and two color gray aliens just a few meters away from me. \r\nfaro beach on faro island in august. 1986 or perhaps 1988. \r\ni was on vacation with his family in august, the municipal campsite of faro, on the island of faro. in front of the park there is a road and across the beach. \r\nthat night, i decided to spend a few moments on the beach, it had been during the day with his back to the sun, needed to refresh them. i walked on the beach at around 22h00, my idea was to sit by the sea, but after the first steps in the sand, i noticed that in front of me were two gray color figures, behind a small sand dune . i thought were two lovers of the night; they moved the two bodies quickly and compulsively in a movement always circular. i decided not to bother and stayed at the beginning of the beach in silence, sitting and i began to admire the sea; the lights via the sea: the lights, which were of various colors: from one side to the other moved: the left side to the middle and on the right, various colors of lights were in the middle. i thought were small fishing boats but after a few minutes, i asked myself: lights with different colors in the sea? for what? the lights were yellow, orange, blue and other colors and when were they changed color. i found it strange but as did not want to disturb the shadows that moved in front of me - very quickly - i decided to stay there. but i found strange since moved up so quickly and were indefinite bodies, i saw only two gray bodies to move quickly, in rotary motion, one over the other. suddenly, to my right, appears a couple of lovers who enters the beach, they were sideways to me at a distance of about 20 meters. these two lovers did not see me because the beach was deserted. they were taken steps slowly along the beach and stopped: i noticed that the man had a flashlight in his hand that turned and pointed to the sea ... \r\nat that time he points his flashlight into the sea, i thought: they will bother the two figures that are moving quickly behind the dune - even in front of me. and in that moment i look at the figures again that, in a split second, arose, and came together in a flash escaped to the left side of the beach covering about 200 meters in a second - or less - they 200 meters from the beach! two gray figures came together to form one figure and 1 second or less made about 200 meters from the beach in a straight line and then saw them jump from the beach to the road. \r\ni remember all this as if it were today, as i got up quickly, after only have time to move my head to keep up with the speed with which they moved sideways and saw them jump into the road but then ... i did not see anything, they disappeared. \r\nhe did not know what to do, his heart was pounding, i was nervous and enormous questions in my mind, i decided to approach me now from the sea. quietly got close to the water, much to fear but wanted to watch those lights in the sea, i felt that they could have been related to the two super-fast figures gray color disappeared completely, leaving no trace. but the lights had already gone and when i approach the sea, i see what i think was a ship, a strange vessel was floating in the sea and was completely made of what appeared to be metal - new steel stainless metal natural color shine steel. a little moonlight (moon) took me to see this object that was in the sea. he had a kind of rivets around, it was not because boats have boat mast and boat shape. that none of this had and it was all made of what looked like bright stainless steel. \r\nall this made me even more curious and questions but no answers and fear, decide leave the beach and go to my tent camping. the track is fast, just a minute and you enter the park and when i arrive at the beginning of the beach, with the road in front of me and the campsite on the other side, very slowly, start to hear a sound coming from the left side (left side because now i was back to earth and not the sea) direction i saw the two figures gray to jump to the road. the sound seemed to be a metal object and had a certain rhythm, a certain measure. that sound made me look and see two figures side-by-side that i thought were two men to walk side by side as assertadamente two soldiers were without exchanging step, without delay each other or it forward step. all to the rhythm of the metal sound that was an object of the beings had with him and beat. for clothes, i thought that these were two beggars or two crazy but ... your clothes, what looked like rags of beggar, of various colors were and were these pieces of colors united to each other forming clothing: small pieces of fabric completely new and boiled bright color or joined to each other forming a costume for each. i found it strange, as they walked slowly as if robots, many erect, rigid and rights and with a certain measure by the subject of sound. i thought they had not seen me and finding it strange that clothing be as new and consists of numerous small color, decided to let them pass: that mommento not relate it to the figures from the beach, only i found it all very strange but i thought they might a crazy and evil by fear of them, i decided to let them pass. in front of me it was precisely the entrance of the park and when they playing that object came just ahead of the park in my direction âlgulo, one of them, which was the road side, looked at me for a second and then .. i caught the biggest susta of my life! even today, after these 30 years, i shudder, because the face that appeared to be human transfigured up and in that split second he looks at me - and that still did not stop his slow and certain cadence step - the face it was a monster! i not know how to describe! for only i had the courage to look for a second it was. the shock was so great that quickly hid: i was standing quickly and i remember saying: \"ai\" and a quick reflex downloaded myself thinking quickly, \"let them go let them go -!. please do not hurt me !. i closed my eyes in fear and only mentalizava those words full of dread i was and after a few seconds, the long promenade that follows the road ... they were gone the sound was over and they disappeared the only thing i remember hearing in my mind - was later:. \"forgets what you have seen!\" \r\nthe face of these things made me, it was just to scare me. \r\nand in fact, i never went back to that beach. to date, there never was. \r\nthe next day, in the morning, even i asked my cousin which measures roughly 2 meters tall, long legs he has and how he played basketball, i asked him for it go the point i saw the aliens to the point of the end of beach where we left them to see. said to him, runs this route in the sand as quickly as possible, as if you were running to a goal. he asked me why and i told him, just run as soon as possible. he ran and calro that obviously it took much longer than the aliens to travel the same path: one second - if that was what the aliens took the travels that path of about 200 meters. of course my cousin would never run 200 meters in a second ... but i honestly still do not want to believe it all. \r\nonly 10 years after this close encounter, i began to dedicate myself to spirituality. and obviously that reporting this to only a few people, everyone laughed at me but later a friend of mine who did not believe in ufos, one day, i decided to tell you this true story. in the end he did not believe but past days, his friend was just telling her about strange lights in the sea, on the same beach on the island of faro. already a friend of mine told me that some fishermen were afraid to talk about it, maybe talk to a lot of fear, only the influence of alcohol, after drinking a good amount of alcohol (wine or beer) and then one or another fisherman spoke of strange lights in the same location. \r\nthis my friend who did not believe in ufos, came to believe and found it interesting that he already knows the mufon. i did not know it was a chance - i will say i know your organization, because it was through a video channel history i saw the name of your organization and then decided to contact you. \r\nthis was my first encounter. \r\nhere are now others. \r\n\r\ncase 2 \r\nthe clawed alien to me and alien in switzerland - sion may 2009 \r\nfor many years of my life, even when i was younger, i knew i could guess the future, i, after studying spirituality, assubntos knew that no one else knew. \r\nwhere does all this spiritual and information about the earth or information about a specific event? \r\nthese questions - as well as others, such as the power to heal people and children with cancer and other ailments, somehow born or were past me but ... how? \r\nmy spiritual learning i believe i have not been enough to do so. \r\nbasically, since again, i always felt i was receiving aliens information - directly on me, i had any kind of connection with extraterrestrial beings - they passed me information. i went to many spiritual masters to explain me what was wrong with me but ... none could tell me what i had in me. \r\ni thought even one day have to go to a priest to bless me or do any kind of exorcism but never got to do any of this.\r\n\r\n. \"in 2009, for months, i felt my very stuck energy, it was as if my soul was missing me i decided to make a pmt query:. a pyramidal technique that was invented by a swiss - i believe i explained to the therapist i was without vital energy for some time after the end of the consultation, the therapist tells me.: \r\n\"you had an extraterrestrial being grabbed you, to suck or to wear your life energy. this is why he felt no energy. i sent be away, pulled it from itself. the being was not bad but the energy et this being is very strong. this is why you know so much. \" \r\ni was happy because already felt better, but a little sad too, because that is, the distance it was, passed me a lot of wisdom. after days, i went to switzerland with alice - a friend of mine portuguese-swiss nationality. \r\nwe were in sion, one of those hot days. sion valley - city of french canton is called \"california sion\". this name is given because of the high temperatures in the summer can reach and ultrapasssar 42 degrees. this was one of those hot days. i was at the bar drinking just a sip of wine to make company to alice my friend, her mother and stepfather. i do not drink, never liked alcohol and not smoking drugs. in a conversation i little understood in french, after about 30 minutes, my friend, comes up to me and whispers the following: \r\n- do not look now to your left side but is a man i do not know whether a man or a man disguised alien to do some very strange questions to a customer here restaurant.\r\n\r\ncovertly and slowly, without trying to attract attention, i looked at the strange man (who was standing) ... i realized it was no man, felt it was not human. he was dressed normally as if the heat would affect not: \r\nhis face was not transpired, the skin even shone, he was very calm and the temperature that day reached 43 degrees and the time, did not bother him; not a drop of sweat or skin glowing. he was asking questions for us humans are strange questions and never do. \r\nthe questions: \r\n\"what do you feel when it's cold? \r\nhow do you feel when it's hot? \r\nhow it is that you temperature difference affects? \r\nhow do you feel the temperature differences? \"\r\n\r\nobviously that man (the restaurant customer) that was being questioned, nothing strange to those questions, since it was already a little \"spilled\" by the effect of the wine which took involved in the heat completely impossible to bear; all inclusive people i was perspiring. but i found it all very strange, and after looking at this being, man dress, told my friend alice in a low voice: \r\n\"he's not human, is alien.\" \r\nand in that moment, the strange being realized our conversation, he felt that we were talking about it and calmly remained standing without moving, without the eye but when i looked again, their eyes were turned forward, started looking at my side but jogging covertly as you face when you do not want to attract attention only that his right eye looked at me and was moving like an eye of a chameleon. \r\nthis was an alien i met identify that - as is normal in aliens, they try to stay calm, since many do not suffer from human emotions.\r\n\r\n

late watching a movie. i cannot state where i live as i also work there, and any mention of the organization i work for by name gives them the right to own this report, but i can say i am a fire lookout. my job is almost entirely encompassed by watching for things and locating them, including aircraft and weather patterns. my location is isolated to the point that only two stationary man-made lights are visible from my position and both of them were in a different direction then the objects witnessed.\r\n\r\nat about 22:30 i had to go to the bathroom and walked out onto the catwalk of my fire lookout and noted a white light with red and green flashing lights to the north just off the horizon. i assumed it to be an airplane, but took note of it because it was not on the general metropolitan to metropolitan flight paths that cross over my area, and it appeared significantly lower than standard planes. the lights were also brighter and larger than standard far-off commercial airliners. the lights were in fact brighter than any star, planet, or other craft in the night sky at the time. no clouds were visible in the sky along any horizon, and i had a clear view of the distant object and stars.\r\n\r\ni went back into the lookout and finished my movie, and at about 23:00 i went out on the catwalk to brush my teeth and noted the object was still there and appeared to have not moved at all. this surprised me, as neither airplanes nor satellites stay in the same place for that period of time. after brushing my teeth i returned inside and looked at it through binoculars briefly, then pulled out my spotting scope and fixed on the object at 60x. i cannot accurately gauge the object’s distance without a horizon and since it was just lights on a dark background, but judging by the increase in size of the object through the spotting scope, if it were equivalent to a 60 foot drop ship i would estimate it to be 30 to 50 miles away with an exact azimuth of 22.2 degrees from my position (as measured with an osborne fire-finder 1934 model). the object was kite like in shape, but narrower side to side and longer top to bottom. it had a white/orange light in the center similar in color to an old halogen headlight, with a red light below and right of the white/orange one, and a green light above and left of it. the object itself was dark, and i can only estimate at its shape due to the visible light emitted from the white/orange light. the white/orange light remained constant but the green and red lights were strobes and alternated their flashing in a consistent pattern. as this is the standard pattern for commercial aircraft, i then wondered if this was a helicopter and my mind was simply making the shape with the visible light it could see. within the 60x magnification of my spotting scope however, the object did not move out of the frame from 23:00 to 00:00. that would require an object to remain absolutely still, uncharacteristic of helicopters.\r\n\r\nat midnight is when i witnessed its only visible change. at midnight exactly, another object entered the sky while i was looking through the scope, so i did not see it immediately when it became visible, but it was there when i brought my eye up from the scope. i noted the time at exactly 00:00. it was below the previously listed object, slightly to the right, and did not come more than a few degrees above the horizon at any given time. i also looked at this object through the spotting scope. the shape appeared to be two isosceles triangles facing down, connected together at the widest point. the color was red at the top, orange in the center, and yellow at the bottom, with these three colors seeming to be lit up in a repeating wave pattern from top to bottom. one triangle was dark while the other was lighted, and once one triangle went through its lit cycle of red-orange-yellow, it went dark and the other one repeated the cycle. the rhythm of this light show of the two triangles was extremely fast. the right triangle appeared in full and to perfection as i could see all three corners; however when the left triangle lit up its top right corner was cut off at an angle. this leads me to believe the right triangle was closer than the left, and the object was slightly turned away from me so i was not viewing it straight on. this object was either significantly closer or larger in size than the previously listed kite-shaped object, as i could make out its pattern and shape clearly and distinctly with the naked eye, and it filled the spotting scope to a greater degree. upon first viewing, this object was rising upward slowly, stopped, hung at a single point without moving for exactly two minutes, then at 00:02, dropped below the horizon. during the two minutes the double-triangle shaped object was in the air, the kite-shaped object previously listed in this report, rose in the sky nearly 20 degrees (measured with an osborne fire-finder) straight up at the exact same azimuth it was at previously. the osborne fire-finder can observe a tenth of a degree change for any given azimuth, and the kite shaped object did not move a tenth of a degree.\r\n\r\ni remained awake until 01:30 hours when i had to fall asleep as i had work the next day. i am accustomed to waking early so i was already quite tired. the kite shaped object was still in the sky and still located in its second position listed in this report. i awoke at 07:30 and the object was no longer visible. no sounds were audible from either object during the event.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path then

times people have claimed to have seen ufos; myself being among that group. although i believe the first real time i ever saw one was back one night in february of 2016, the girl i was dating at the time was with me. we were in the car one night around 01:00-03:00; parked around the corner from her house. it was extremely dark, we were stargazing; which we did quite often. then she said “look it’s a ufo” (jokingly) i began observing it. it was a bright white light that would dim and get brighter and every time it would get brighter these two smaller rid lights would form right underneath it, creating a triangle. *i realize that this sounds cliché*. then it disappeared and appeared at a different location in the sky southeast of the original location, slightly brighter and flashing a little faster before it would disappear again appearing northeast of the new location about thirty seconds after it vanished, once more it was brighter and flashing faster; at this point the two red lights that appeared forming the triangle were more visible. it vanished once more, reappearing shortly after southwest of the original location, it was much brighter. so bright some of the light thrown off of it was actually causing shadows inside of the vehicle as if someone had pulled out a flashlight. my heart was pounding at this point, it was no longer a joke anymore. it vanished, i began to relax because it had been minutes since i had seen in. then right above and northwest to its original location it appeared. a blinding white light with two large glowing red lights (although much dimmer than the main one) below it forming the triangle. i continues to watch it frozen in awe as it got brighter. it appeared to be moving closer; taking no evasive measure to disappear; it was at this point my girlfriend was yelling at my to crank the car and drive off; i did so putting it in reverse and whipping it around, we left the location. i have not returned since. \r\n         almost one week ago, i was doing research on this topic; and got a good amount of information. i went to sleep this night and found myself running in my dream, no clothes on, covered in some sort of filth, i was constantly turning my head while running but i never saw what i was running from. it was on a landscape i had never seen before, barren, flat, rocks, hills, and mountain ranges in the distance. while running i remember seeing images carved into the rocks and ground. i woke up about 04:21 freezing and drenched in sweat and opened my eyes and for a brief second, not even long enough for i my eyes to focus; i saw a face, not human. next thing i know its 10:00 in the morning and i’m awake. i promptly began drawing a sketch of the face i saw and some of the images i saw before i lost them from memory. i will be including pictures of this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":77971,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.3679771,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07272016-0017","longitude":-80.19402529999999,"occurred":1454211000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

was roughly 90 degrees away in the s.E. the strange light was just that, a light. no sound, no movement, nq action. it just looked like a second moon covered in cloud.\r\n as the clouds moved over it, it sometimes appeared as a dumb bell shape, sometimes round, depending on the clouds. i waited for the cloud to move away which took a few minutes even though there was a lot of clear sky about. eventually the clouds slowly peeled away but revealed no source of the light, just dark empty sky. i was baffled and have never seen anything quite like this before. when the clouds moved back over the same piece of sky, the light reappeared. this lasted over an hour. there was no visible beam shining onto this patch either from above or below and i still cannot account for what i saw. the light was coming from fairly low cloud so i assumed the light source to be fairly local but apparently untraceable.\r\nminutes previously to this i had seen another strange object zip over my house at high

anime or something else inside like using my computer but, we had no internet at the time for some people working somewhere nearby.I noticed the object after i shifted my eyes slightly to the right then to a cloud when i was looking at the moon. it was flying in an open spot, right above our bradford pair tree then flown west, northwest above a cloud and that's when i lost it.\r\n  when i first saw it, i thought,\"no, it couldn't be one, could it?\". before i even saw it, i was thinking about how nice would it be to see a ufo at that moment, on this sunny day. \"but for me to think that just before seeing that object would be almost unheard of normally wouldn't it?\", i had thought after seeing it. i wanted to think out all possibilities before truly believing it was a real ufo. i live near a military base, so we hear a bunch of sounds and see a bunch of crafts flying overhead.In fact i think i even heard a ufo before, a few years ago while taking my dog outside, early morning/late at night. but dismisses it for it sounded too much like a jet yet sounded too short and closer to the ground.\r\n  after losing sight of the ufo, i first talked to my neighbor.Then texted and talked to a friend of mine on messenger about it. he talked about military drones and i looked them up, but none looked like the one i saw, i even took sky pictures in case people wanted to know what the weather was at the time.\r\n  the object was definitely metallic and reflective, it almost looked white for it was close enough to the clouds to reflect them. it was an oval, disc shape but i think that was only so since it was flying on its side in the sky. it also may have slightly moved while flying but it was hard to tell for i am near-sighted, if a far sighted person saw it, they would have definitely seen the whole thing in much more detail and clearly. if i had to guess the type of ufo i saw , it would be the common movie,flying disc type or something similar. when it flew through the sky, it made no sound or anything else, it only flew towards and over a cloud.And the directions it flew towards was a bit difficult to actually tell but west to northwest.\r\n  i didn't feel too excited or anything else during and after the experience as i think anything is possible in this world and thought if it was a ufo, that it was pretty cool that i finally saw one.\r\n  \r\n
