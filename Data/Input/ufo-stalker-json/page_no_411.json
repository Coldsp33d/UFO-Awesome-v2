barely 5 years old. as we were a middle class family, i was sleeping in my garden on a wooden plank. suddenly in midnight i was waken up by some humming noise. my father was working on a night shift. my mother was in a deep sleep. i observed 3 light orbs in the sky. they were circuling around. i was paralised by fear. suddenly something lifted me above the ground. absorbed into the darkness in the middle of three orbs. my eyes opened and i regained consiousness inside that vehicle only to find myself on a disection table with a nazi officer laughing and saying something in german or some other language. what i noticed was a white face, an ss insignia on arm, and a very big injection in his hands. a doctor like person was also standing besides him with red eyes. i couldnt move myself. later i dont know why they let me live left me where they picked me and last thing i remember is that the aircraft slowly disappeared in night sky. i can still feel them. later in my life when i came to study i read about haunabeau then i realized that they were germans. how i know their leader name it is another story.","distance":"20 Feet or

the wedding of william and kate. while taking these pictures i felt as though i was being watched or that i had \"eyes\" on me. i took the picture with a simple canon power shot sd750 camera. i realize it is blurry but i clearly see something that should not be there. everyone that has seen this photo says this \"thing\" sitting on the landing in my home looks like an alien. i noticed the reflection in the photo about a week after taking the photo. i almost erased it because it looked blurry but then i saw what clearly looked like \"something not of this world\" in the photo. i downloaded it to my computer and zoomed in on the landing.Since 1997 i have had strange occurances happening in that home that are \"unexplainable.\" my reaction to seeing these entities on my staircase landing was one of horror that something could be in my home observing me and i am unaware of their presence. i have since moved out of the home but i still own it. the people that i am allowing to stay in the home until i sell it, their daughter has seen and complained of seeing \"strange beings \" in the house and would not want to sleep alone.\r\n\r\nthe photos i have included are:\r\n1) the photo with the \"things\" on the staircase landing.\r\n2) a photo from my camera of the mirror that reflects the landing of my stairs and the same landing with nothing on it.\r\n3) what my staircase landing should look like when i am home alone without \"entities\" on it.\r\n\r\ni hope that you can come up with some logical explanation for what is sitting on my staircase landing observing me through the mirror while i am home alone so that someday i might be able to go back to that home. i give you full permission to examine these photos with any and all technology available

thing my body went dead, no movement, nothing, there was no life in my body. my feet floated up and my whole body followed. i was floating upward. i could move my eyes. there was black all around me except for lights floating pass me. i could look from left to right. i looked straight up, there was a triangle shaped object ahead of me. there were lights all under the object. i then blacked out. the next thing i know i woke up in a dark room. they placed me on a table. all of a sudden my whole body started vibrating, from head to toe. i would make a groaning sound ever so often. i could not see them but i know they were there. when i was placed back in my bed, i was waking up like coming out of a knock out drug. the next day i was very tired. the whole week i was tired. when i woke up the next morning the thought of what had happened that night did not come to mind. i got in the shower and started praying the incident came back to me. it was so strong that it stopped my prayers. i was speechless. when they take you, you have no control. sometimes you can see what is going on and sometimes you can't. ever since i can remember i have been abducted many times before. they are just blocked out. only these last 3 years i can remember something's of the abductions. \r\n  i cannot remember the day or time but this abduction was the one that changed me forever. this happened in 2014. i was watching television, the next second the power went off all over the house. my tv has to reboot so i didn't want to wait so i just turned it off. the next thing i know i was floating out from my room. when they were taking me it was well lit. i was lying on a table they were standing on either side of me. there seem to be one on the right side of my head as i was floating out from where they had taken me. i woke up in my bed i still couldn't move my body but i could move my head. i looked towards my bedroom door and saw the shadow of an alien. the head was large the arms were long and thin the hands were thin with long thin fingers. i yelled out because i thought it was my son. i kept calling his name and no one answered. when i first yelled out the alien stood still, he did not move. i started to get frustrated because i thought it was my son and i wasn't getting an answer. the next minute there was a flash of light coming from where the being was standing and he was gone. i got up and went to my son's room and he was fast asleep. it wasn't him who cast that shadow. the next morning i was on the road in front of my job. there was a sheriffs car parked between two buses. i drove on into the parking lot and was backing up to park. there was only one car parked on the left of me. i started sending my daughter a message. i looked up there were two joggers  running right next to my car. they ran so close they could have hit my car. they ran together as if they were sewed together. i could not see their faces. i never saw them coming or going. it hasn't happened since. it was kind of strange for that to happen. after my abduction . \r\n  i have an allergic reaction to something they used on me. i have had anal bleeding severe pain in my female organs. the pain is so severe i can't walk and it travels from there to my rear. i have seen apparitions. i have seen dark figures in my room. i have had ear ringing when certain aircraft flies over. i see flashes of light at night when i'm out now during the day as well. i have learned to ignore them. i can be driving and don't know how i got fro point a to b. my daughter would hear strange noises coming from my room like operating room sounds. my tv would turn itself off sometimes.(sunday 1-10-16, 8:00 pm)","distance":"20 Feet or

minute drive from roswell, nm\r\n\r\nflashes came from direction of altair\r\nwe were standing in front of chuck's pick-up truck facing se.  altair was in our clear vision in front of us.\r\ntruck: front grill led strobe on off on off on off sequence\r\nno response\r\ntruck: front grill led auto strobe 4 flashes pause 1 flash (with remote control)\r\nresponse: bright light yellow/light similar in size to mars that night.\r\n                    2 quick flashes back from area of altair\r\nrepeated with same light sequence and got same response next 2 times.\r\nthe total sighting time from start to finish was approx. 2 minutes.  after the third returned response we got no more.  all 3 responses were from the exact same spot and identical in size, color and flash sequence. we tried an additional 6 times with no return response.\r\n\r\ndocumentation:\r\n9:15pm: i had tried to focus my mini cam on the area when we first arrived but because there was no moon there wasn't enough light for the camera. chuck was sitting on the tailgate of his truck and noticed a single flash to the nw.  he thought it was a meteor coming straight in but never saw additional evidence of this.  chuck thought the flash could have been an iridium flare but never saw additional evidence of this either.  we moved to the front of his pick-up truck and stood to star gaze.  there was no moon so the sky was dark with the milky way clearly visible overhead but slightly to our front vision.  after just a few minutes chuck said \"i'm going to try something\".  he took his remove for his truck grill led lights out of his pocket and hit the button.  the first sequence was an on off on off on off.  chuck decided to try the next sequence which was 4 flashes, pause, one flash.  we never expected to get a response.  the response was flash, flash.  chuck looked at me and said, \"did you see that?\"  i replied \"yes\".  we both laughed.  i said \"hit it again\" and he did.  we never expected it but got a second response, flash, flash. chuck said \"i can't believe i'm seeing this\" as he looked at me in shock.  chuck said \"what do you think?\"  i said \"hit the remote again!\"  chuck did and we got a double flash third response.   chuck kept saying \"it's got to be a plane from behind the clouds\". i said, \"there are no clouds, that's the milky way!\"   chuck decided to keep hitting the remote while i looked frantically in the area of the light for a plane, helicopter, satellite, iridium flare, anything.  after the first 3 return double light flashes there were no more responses.   i checked the star charts from my ipad app to best determine what area the flashes came from (altair) and noted the time (9:30pm).\r\n\r\n10:30 pm: the cows in field across the road began to moo and coyotes began to howl. chuck had taken his night vision binoculars out a few minutes before to look at the milky way.  he thought the flash we had seen had come from behind a cloud but i assured him there were no clouds just the milky way.  the night vision binoculars proved that.  we were looking at a section of the milky way, no clouds in our field of view.  the night vision binoculars worked at first for just a few minutes, then quit.  while chuck was working on them discovering that the batteries were drained, his truck dash lights came on without any action from either of us.  we were not in contact with the truck.  emf and animal reaction was now present.\r\n\r\ntime: 10:45pm. (1 and 1/2 hrs. after light that flashed)\r\nwith the emf effects present we decided it was time to go back to roswell.  it had been 1 1/2 hours since the light flashed.  we were approx. 40 minutes from town and something was causing emf and animal reaction.  we were worried about the truck electronics going out and the two of us stuck all night on the side of the road.  the locals had told us of a road they feared and wouldn't drive at night because of \"strange goings on\".  we weren't sure if this was the road but thought it was time to leave.  besides, if et wanted to visit us they obviously from the flashing light response, knew where to find us.  we both agreed that the emf was most likely coming from an outside more local source that was monitoring us being watched.\r\n\r\nnote: a dark pick-up truck passed us heading towards roswell just before the emf effect.  chuck also saw a red suv.  it traveled down the road we were parked at the base of approx. 1/4 mi and stopped.  we had only seen 1 vehicle prior.  one was seen right after we arrived and then two more at approx. 10:30pm. the area is very rural.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":77936,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5025761,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07262016-0012","longitude":-104.7394927,"occurred":1467538200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

home and told me about them. i asked him if he could show me. we arrived at the area at first there was nothing. we were on our way back we caught sight of the lights. first there was the triangle. the shape was triangle form but long. when  the light flashed on it was a bluish green color around it then the bright white light. they were very close so we knew they weren't stars. one of the lights disappeared. it didn't light up the sky. it was stationary. the other two lights were not as bright as the one that came out of nowhere. when i saw it i was very excited so was my son, not a happy excited. we tried to take a video of it but we couldn't catch it. you can hear us very well in the recording of what was happening. after the lights were gone, flares were being dropped three always three. we were almost out of the area and the lights came back. from where we were they were behind the trees. we turned to go get a better look from where we were then they were gone. they dropped three more flares. when i say they it was the military. this was happening over the military base. you can see the difference between flares and these lights. the flares left traces of smokes, the lights didn't. the flares lit up the area where they were dropped the lights didn't.  there was no sound or smell of anything.  there were helicopters flying around that area. we stayed there for a little while to see if the lights would come back, they didn't. we decided to go to the lake, it's a few miles from the base but close to the area where we came from. what happened next made me think the military was watching us. we were at the lake outside the car all of a sudden a helicopter came from that area and flew over us. before we got to the lake i mentioned to my son that if the police comes out here then something is up. after the helicopter flew over us not five minutes did the police show up. while he was there the helicopter flew back over us from the same direction it came before. they flew very low over us both times. we left and went back to the area but everything was quiet.  my son was very shaken after this and during. he and his friend were so shaken when they saw it themselves they were both crying. he said their chest started to hurt while they were seeing the lights.  when i went back with my son for him to show me i developed a throbbing headache.  he also mentioned there was something running in the woods beside their car as they were driving. my son said it looked grey and about the height of the car door from the bottom of the window to the ground. the night sky was very clear.

back to glen burne md. my wife is usually finished with work around 5 pm ,and it takes 2hrs , approximately, to get there from king of prussia pa. we picked her up from work, drove to her hotel , to

i was compelled to look out the passenger side window. at the time i thought nothing of it being i'm always looking upwards trying to find things in the sky. but now , i had no reason, at that time, to look that way but i did. and i saw it. it was pretty far away but i new it was something different. at first i thought it was a balloon, and maybe it was,but maybe it wasn't. so , i pulled to the burn of the highway to get a better look. i stopped the car and got out. i walked to the gard rail and got a real good look at it. it was teardrop shaped with white and red coloring. some silver too i think. it did not move in the sky and never made a sound. i grabbed my cellphone and took some pictures as quickly as possible just in case in left. then i ran back to my car to get my camera. about a month prior to this my 12 yr old bought me a camera from the local thrift store. it's a 1970s cannon with exchanging lenses. it's old school but i love it, and that week we went to walmart to but the battery it needed, and film. i , that week especially, had that camera with me every where i went and ready to go. i took probably 7 to 10 photos of the object and then labelled the film canister ufo. it still is in the negative form. i never developed it. i guess i didn't want to be doubted that i saw something and that would always be my proof of that day.\r\nafter watching for a while i decided to drive up the highway alittle more to try and get a better look. i jumped in my car and as soon as i pulled away i looked over and it wasn't there anymore. \r\nwhen we got home that night i had to!D my wife and kid about it and as usual that didn't care.","distance":"Over One

helicopter at that height would produce a lot of noise when compared to the object i saw.It was black and i could see thin white line at its border spinning it had like 4 red lights and was spontaneously glowing.I lost the sight of the object because it passed through the buildings. i just got to see it for 10 seconds and i was not able to capture it because but i have the sketch how it
