the greater philadelphia area (langhorne, bucks county) that likes to point my lens towards the cosmos and snap slow exposures of the night time sky.  its become a fun little hobby for me over the years.  \r\n\r\nrecently, on july 15th 2016 at approximately 9:15pm i set my nikon d90 on a tripod and pointed towards the sw sky..  set the camera for 30 second exposures while on the tripod for maximum light and clarity.  no movement is optimum.  after snapping 4-5 similar shots in the front yard towards the sw, i repeated the same process stated above, except i went in my backyard and pointed my nikon towards the ne and snapped 4-5 of the same 30 second slow exposure shots of the night sky.\r\n\r\ni really don't have much more information than what i have included.  when shooting the set of photos i had captured, nothing seemed different or weird when i was shooting.\r\n\r\nthat said, after shooting the photos i mentioned, i came in and started to look thru and see how the stars & planets looked in the night sky.  most of the photos came out like they usually do, but 2 really stood out to me.. because there was things after the fact while looking at the captures on my computer that i noticed some things. \r\n\r\nphoto 1 in my front yard is facing sw has a spiral - tri-spoked - greenish looking orb bright in the sky..  maybe some type of weird light reflection\r\n\r\nphoto 2 is in my back yard and facing towards the ne.. this 2nd photo has a bunch more preset orbs, streaks or 'swooshes' of light and a very obvious cigar shaped 'object'.. \r\n\r\nlike i said, maybe weird glitch in the system or weird refracted light - but yea - not sure.. \r\n\r\nany how.  thanks in advance for your time.

lengthen.  at other times it was not in two pieces but a single white craft.  since a piper type aircraft is 22 feet long, and the craft following the plane was 60% of it’s size, this makes the craft 13 feet in length.\r\n               \r\nphoto of tower:\r\nat 12:36 dst an image entitled “tower w 18 orbs” was taken at 96° (east), and after working to enhance the photo, and inverting the colors,

was the clearest in frame :19 and has been cropped and enhanced entitled “enhanced orb”.\r\n\r\nsummary:\r\n1.\tat least one dark orb was seen during the shooting of the 4th video at 12:33 dst in the

90° (east), at least 18 different dark orbs are seen surrounding the tower.\r\n3.\tan hour later at 13:29 dst, at 346° (nnw), the 5th video of the two white craft shows that one was an airplane, and the other is an unknown uav which seemed to be stalking it, that was 13 feet long.\r\n4.\tin addition to the white craft, two small dark orbs can be seen surrounding the white craft. \r\n5.\ta total of at least 22 craft were seen over the span of an hour.\r\n6.\tcase 76946 (full spectrum camera images) was shot on the same day, about an hour after the last image in this report.  four craft were

was the clearest in frame :19 and has been cropped and enhanced entitled “enhanced orb”.\r\n\r\nsummary:\r\n1.\tat least one dark orb was seen during the shooting of the 4th video at 12:33 dst in the nnw.  it was seen travelling very rapidly through the viewfinder in 1/3 of a second, making an abrupt directional change of 50° straight toward the zenith.\r\n2.\tthree minutes later, at 12:36 dst at 90° (east), at least 18 different dark orbs are seen surrounding the tower.\r\n3.\tan hour later at 13:29 dst, at 346° (nnw), the 5th video of the two white craft shows that one was an airplane, and the other is an unknown uav which seemed to be stalking it, that was 13 feet long.\r\n4.\tin addition to the white craft, two small dark orbs can be seen surrounding the white craft. \r\n5.\ta total of at least 22 craft were seen over the span of an hour.\r\n6.\tcase 76946 (full spectrum camera images) was shot on the same day, about an hour after the last image in this report.  four craft were seen in that report.  thus in the span of two hours that day, 26 craft were filmed and reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

pictures with my 20.1 megapixel nikon koolpix. it is a mountainous, forested area. the picture in which the object appears was taken facing north towards lake memphremagog. i did not see the object when i took the picture, and other pictures that i took of the same area and at the same time do not show the object.\r\n\r\nthe day was cloudy and overcast but not raining or foggy.  temperature was about 83 f, fairly humid, and  light breeze.\r\n\r\ni brought my camera home with me after i left the area, about a 40 minute drive.  when i got home i hooked the camera into my laptop to look at the pictures i had taken. it was at that time that i discovered the photo with the object in the upper left hand corner of the shot. \r\n\r\ni would estimate that i was about 10 miles away from the lake that appears in the photo.  there is a small airport to the left of the area that appears in the photo, also about 10 miles away.  i did not observe or hear any aircraft during the time i was taking pictures.  i did not see any birds when i was taking pictures.\r\n\r\nmy initial reaction to seeing the object in the photo was that it was a bird or an airplane that had somehow gotten into the shot.  but as i looked more closely at the object in the photo, and zoomed in on it with various magnifications, it did not appear to be either a bird or a plane. but i could tell that it appeared to be a solid object of some kind in the distance.  again, i did not see the object with the naked eye, but only when i got home and was looking through the photos i had taken.\r\n\r\ni certainly have no interest perpetrating a fraud by sending you this photo and information.  i would just like to get an informed opinion as to what the object in the picture could be.  if you have any questions or need any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\ni was not sure how to fill out some of this reporting form since i did not see the object with the naked eye, but only by observing

noticed me and my mom looking at them. their lights slowly faded away and i couldn't see them anymor3 ( there were no clouds in the sky ). one of them remained in my sight and flew west. it disappeared goo but then i noticed a brighter light in the sky blinking three times (once every minute). and after that every light was gone. i was amazed because i always wanted to know what it felt like to witness something like this but a few minutes later a weird uncomfortable feeling hit me and didn't leave me for 10 minutes. it's still the only thing i can think about and what i find weird but this is probably just a coincidence, is that i was searching for exposed cia projects (stargate, mk ultra etc) earlier that day just for fun. and this past couple of days i was joking with my

triangular object. but it was black and hard to see. it was still and probably 100 or more feet up. he decided to take out his flip phone and take pictures. he took 6 pictures in all but mainly you can only see the two lights. i tried to enhance them but with not much luck. but i am attaching them anyway. the last two pictures are the ones that are smaller as it is ascending straight up and out of sight. normally during the day small aircraft are allowed to fly over our area but not at night. i called the farmingdale airport to report a craft may have been  flying in a restricted area/time and asked them if they had anything on radar. they said that they had not seen anything on radar (we are only about 3 miles from the airport). i tried to enhance them at one point for more detail. it was so long ago i don't even know if these are the enhanced ones or copies of the originals (the dates on the file are from nov 2007 and are not the original times from august so they are at least copies). these look to me more like the original un-enhanced images because i remember when i enhanced them digitally it seemed a triangular shape became fairly evident. but here are the images. i was in the process of reporting a few (past) sightings of my own (for the record) so i thought i might as well throw this in!  you may have better enhancement techniques. the first 4 pictures are of a similar view / distance (pix 1 thru 4) so you may be able to get something by overlaying the images etc....    best luck - i put down that there were two witnesses because my daughter was in the house
