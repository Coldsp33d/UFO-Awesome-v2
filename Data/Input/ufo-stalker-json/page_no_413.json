at the same time i noticed it, my son said, \"why is that star moving?\"  i was at once startled because for the past 5 years or so, i've been keenly aware of the north-south flight path i live under.  planes depart from bwi and new york airports and travel south to destinations along the east coast. i've noted these using the flight aware app.  i'm very familiar with both the bwi flight paths and those into reagan national.   the reason i was so shocked when i saw this (and heard my son's verbal acknowledgement of the same) is because planes never ever go on this path.  sure, maybe in a rare case when they are stacking planes at reagan national but that's usually only in bad weather and more importantly, they do so at less than 10,000 ft. this object was at 25,000 ft or above. i know this based on flight aware data from passing planes. \r\n\r\ni know this is a low value sighting of basically a reddish light in the sky moving along a path. but it was unusual.  additionally, after i shuffled my son to bed, i went back outside to see if anything would return but nothing did...Except a shooting star, traveling northeast. classic streak of light type shooting star. \r\n\r\nanyway, felt i should record this one.
