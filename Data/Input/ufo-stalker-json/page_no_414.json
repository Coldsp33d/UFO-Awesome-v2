to use the zoom in + app that i downloaded from google play store to see if i could zoom in on it but instead, i saw the triangle formation. after taking a picture of that, i went inside and came back out 45 minutes later and tried again to video the \"disco ball\". it was far up in the sky but was in our atmosphere; i pressed record and zoomed in and that's when i saw the orbs. it was 2 white orbs

straight section of road ( from 510 58’ 54.27’’ north to 510 59’ 26.97’’ west ) at 15:20 bst       ( 14:20 gmt ) approximately. weather conditions were bright sunshine with a few scattered cumulus clouds.\r\ni was returning home after a days work travelling north as i do every weekday. after passing through junction 12 on the m1 i continued on in light traffic. when the road curved around to the section i mention above i noticed what i thought was a light aircraft, although i could not make out any details it just seemed to be a white dot against the blue sky to left of the motorway high above and to the north of the trees. i was struck by the speed of the object that made me think it must be a high performance aircraft, which further tweaked my interest as i am a pilot and professional engineer in the aerospace industry.\r\ni was startled when it pitched down into a dive at 45 degrees. my first reaction was that it was going to do some aerobatic manoeuvres and felt i wanted to see this and find out what type of aircraft it was. as i watched it descend i was looking for wings and a tail but could see none. it descended to just above the motorway and then appeared to be flying just above the motorway traffic approaching in my direction.  as it approached i realised it was circular and thought it must be a helicopter but could not see any rotors or other structures. when it passed the electricity pylon nearest to me on the right hand side of the road i could see it was a shiny silvery white sphere about 2 metres or 7 feet in diameter. it also had a yellow circular light at its centre. it then seemed to veer off towards the right hand side of the road descending and the last time i saw it it went behind the trees about 150 to 200 metres ahead on the right.  \r\ni attach some slides i have made using images from google earth and street view to show the location, path lengths and my position on the motorway. the last slide i constructed to show what the object looked like. the duration of the sighting was about fifteen seconds. the wind direction was from the south west, in other words at right angles to the motorway and the path the object followed. i said to myself afterwards what was that? i was shocked.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

that was disappeared in southern sky. we was talking about this and was looking at south. after near five minutes we did see the object in the same place that was disappeared in south. but little smaller than before because now the object was traveling higher than before. took only 10 seconds to cross the sky to reach same place of north. we whispered and i was counting one to ten as how the clock running in seconds. then we are waiting while looking at north for 5-7 minutes or 10 minutes. then the object appeared aginbin nort and was small as a lime. i was counting to 15 when it reach south and disappeared in same place in south. also another 3 people joined us from the second sighting. as we think any aircraft can't reach that speed to cross a large area of sky over clouds. we have seen jets and kufeer fighter crafts but have a great noise but not moving at this speed in this much above in sky.\r\nthis is not my first time seeing these things. i was 7 year old boy when i got my first experience. was 8:00 pm at colombo. a white octagonal object with triangular shaped on it and glowing with a nice orange light around it. but can't find where the light comes from. just like the object reflecting a light comes from nowhere.\r\nthen before 20 years i was securing my paddy fields. i think the month was december or november. i was with my shot gun and laying on a large flat granite rock. i could see the clear sky. i was listening carefully about wild boars. at about 2.00 am i did see a set of lights arranged as a triangle and was at accurate horizontal line when i was laying i could see directly above. these three lights are became larger than before but took 15-20 minutes. they looks like landing or decrease height. they were changing colors green to blue and white. all lights got same color in same time. and was below the clouds. after getting enlarged to a size of a 3feet × 3 triangle. it was started to blink these three lights and was showing an accurate triangle object with three lights on corners. then the triangle disappeared but the lights still blinking. then the lights got double there power and went to horizon in a great speed. and now that was a three inch triangle and disappeared. whole time was about 25-40 minutes.\r\nin 2003 or a nearly year i was going home with my daughter after bringing her to a doctor because she was suffering from flue. i was riding my motor bike, my little daughter was sitting on the petrol tank. i was riding at 50 km \\h. after passing the kalawana town there is a large paddy field. you can see a large area of the sky from your both sides of the road. i started to speedup because rad is straight and clear from vehicles. just i saw something is passing me from my left hand side. a nice large green light a papaya fruit shaped glowing light flying ower paddy fields parallel with me i was looking at this and wanted to check the speed. i accelerated to 85 km/h but that object shooting just in a second. i need to see where this thing going and started to follow as possible. but i lost the site because the area of paddy fields are passed. i reached to wembiyagoda junction and did see two people looking at the sky. i asked did you see something? they said yes, a large green light.I asked what could be that was. they said that is a devathaa elya (gods light ) sri lankan villagers using this name to introduce these flying things. also i had seen may things like this but can't explain what are these. but these things are helping people in uncommon ways.If you started to see them then they are always visible to you. these things can inform you about emergency incidents.I make notes when seeing these. my diary page about two sightings below. thank you.
