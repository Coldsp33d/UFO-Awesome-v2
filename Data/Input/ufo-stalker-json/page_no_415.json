pool to swim. sometime around 7:15 i happened to notice a small white ball approaching slowly andy northwest direction. i didn't pay it much mind as it looked kind of like a balloon. however after a few minutes of playing in the pool with my kids i happened to notice that it was still in the same general area now moving through the clouds so i kept my eye on it for a moment and realized it looked unusual. i decided to get out of the pool and try and take a picture with my cell phone that i had in my backpack. i dried my face and hands and got my phone out of my backpack and tried to take a couple pictures. the sun was so bright that i couldn't tell if the pictures were coming out very well so i decided to videotape it with my cell phone. but again the sun on my screen made it difficult to see if i was capturing it or not since it was a white dot in the sky i filmed where i thought it was but couldn't tell if it was in focus or not so i decided to go home and try with my video camera. i got my video camera but the battery was nearly dead and only filmed for a few seconds. i didn't want to waste time trying to charge it so i decided to film with my cell phone again. the clouds that it was hovering around had moved on but it was still in the same place, my estimation is about 20-40 thousand feet high. for a moment i thought maybe it was a supernova or some event in space that was shining through the atmosphere since it was still daytime and very bright. i had to film it intermittently since i was feeding my kids dinner and trying to get them ready for bed. the first time i filmed it from home was at 8:03 p.M. and it was bigger and brighter as if it had descended a few thousand feet. the second time i filmed it was at 8:4pm and i noticed it had moved slightly to the north. i filmed it again  at 8:49 and the sun had se. i noticed it had moved even farther north about 90 degrees off the horizon now and almost directory above me. when i first saw it it was around 45 to 50 degrees off the horizon around 7:30 p.M. it was moving very slowly to the north while all of the stars and moon where moving west as they should. i came outside again at 9pm to film it and it was gone. around 8pm i called my brother and told him where to look in the sky to see it so i could get his opinion. he used his binoculars to view it and was silent for about a minute.  which gave me goosebumps. he then said, \"wow, that is interesting\". he then described it as \"perfectly round and glassy looking\". he said \"i can see the side that's facing the sun is reflecting the light and the other side looks like glass... it looks like a christmas bulb\". even through the binaculars he had no idea what it could be. he also told me that just about an hour earlier he was hiking on mt. diablo and saw something white and bright near the clouds by the top of the mountain and thought it might have been a super bright radio tower light but when he went further and looked for the source there was nothing there and no tower. he wondered if thus was the same thing that he saw. this could be possible since when i first saw the object it was coming from the direction of mt. diablo right about the time after he had finished his hike. note: in the video i say i saw it starting around 6pm, that is a mistake. i was thinking we had gone to the pool sometime after 6pm and didn't realize how long we were there before i first filmed it on y phone. i realized that i was saying the wrong time when i noticed the timestamp on my phone video. the duration was approximately from 7:15 p.M. to about 8:50 p.M.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

witnessed the object. it was to the east, beyond the trees in the office park next to my building. it looked as if it was at some distance. the object resembled a ball or star, white, almost glowing. it was in moving in an erratic pattern, like it was floating in tornado, around and around in the same place. it began to move to my right, and as it passed behind a tree i moved to bring it back into view. when i sighted it again, it began to eject smaller bright white objects. the smaller objects looked as if they were being dropped, like old footage of world war 2 bombers dropping bombs on japan. as they fell, they soon disappeared, as if they were evaporated or even translated. the large object dropped three objects with in the span of about 15 or 20 seconds. the original object then began to ascend up, like a balloon, as if it had gotten lighter. then it stopped its ascent, and waved as if it was a balloon on a tether swaying in the wind. then it descended a bit and hovered. i continued to look at it while it was hovering, completely still; no more erratic movements. i looked down to the floor for only about a second or two to stomp out my cigarette and when i looked back up the object was gone.\r\n\r\nthis all happened looking east from a second story balcony near junction of the 90 and the 405 in the fox hills neighborhood of culver city, ca, which only a couple

rear view mirror to check the two tiny points of its headlights were still there, and it gave me a sense of safety to know i wasn't completely alone so late at night (10pm-ish). \r\n\r\nthe next time i checked my rear view mirror, i was surprised to see a large white circle, size of a football, glowing like a headlight, following directly behind my car. my first thought was that the car had caught me up very quickly indeed and i was confused how it had done that. but then i realised it must be a motorbike as there was only one headlight and motorbikes can zoom along faster than cars. however, i could hear no chugging or buzzing noise one would expect to hear from a motorbike engine at full pelt. i noted i was going 50+mph and this thing was keeping up with me. just as i turned my radio down to silence, my brain really confused, the light circle moved to overtake me on the right and i saw it come into view in my right side mirror. i looked at it several times whilst keeping an eye on the road ahead of me, wondering what manoeuvre it would make as it wasn't overtaking. and then it simply vanished. disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. \r\n\r\ni kept driving, utterly baffled. i noticed the other car a half mile behind me was still cruising along in the distance. i replayed what had happened in my mind over and over, trying to work out what i had just seen, but i could not come up with an explanation. after i while i understood i might have had a paranormal experience and i was thrilled, and felt very honoured. back home, i did a bit of research and was able to identify what i had seen was an orb of light. \r\n\r\non reflection, i've wondered the reason this orb followed me. i think it was just checking me out. i didn't feel threatened or scared by its presence, maybe it was escorting me for a bit to make sure i was okay on my own... i don't know. lasting thoughts: it was awesome and i feel blessed. \r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or

turnpike in southern choctaw county in oklahoma, i noticed a long cylindrical object flying at relatively low altitude (approx. 500ft), in a south/southwest direction. at first, observation,the object was almost directly overhead, moving at a slow airspeed. it appeared to have no windows or outside structure and was very bright, almost chrome against the blue sky. for the purpose of my statement, the time was 1615hrs, weather was mostly sunny with temperatures near 100 degrees.\r\nthe object, continued on a straight line plan for another 3-4 miles, until it abruptly came to a hovering position. it remained there for approximately 30 seconds, before what is best described as a split-second flash of white light. at this time, the object no longer had a bright chrome appearance, but was dark in color as well as appeared to have either changed shape to either a smaller circular object, or i was simply viewing it from only one angle (front or rear).\r\nafter remaining in the hovering position for no more than 10-15 seconds, the object accelerated vertically at very high speed, until it was no longer visible.\r\nat no time, did the object make any exhaust or condensation trail, nor could i make out any sound.\r\ni did not stop to retrieve my cell phone from my bikes saddlebag, simply because i did not want to break visual eye contact. if i had tried to do so, i would have not witnessed the entire event.\r\nhaving been around all types of aircraft during my career, i have never witnessed this level of advanced flying characteristic. the vertical speed was far beyond that of any aircraft i have seen. \r\nto note, there are no major airports in the area. there is however, a small county airport that houses only a few personal fixed wing aircraft and a med-flight helicopter. the nearest military installation is the mcalester army ordinance depot, which was 50-60 miles north of my location. to my knowledge, they house no aircraft.\r\nthe above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.\r\n07-21-16\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

of hendersonville, tn. at a little past two in the afternoon. tuesday, july 19, 2016. my husband is driving, talking on the phone with his brother and i see something above the roadway some distance ahead of us that is a pretty decent size and seems to be moving our way.  we were driving about 55 mph and as a second or two past i began to think this was one of those longish government drones or something.  i thought, \"i am going to get to see one of these drones up close\" because it was coming pretty low and over our lane, but it seemed to be moving a bit erratically in its flight path.  once it got within about 4 or 5 car lengths in front of us, i could see it clearly and saw no wings, no anything, just a smooth dull reddish brown color, hotdog shaped thing, four offset feet things, and the craft/creature was making a smooth swimming motion, like an eel. i noticed that it wasn't an even motion, like it was a live thing. it looked about 15 feet long and about 3 feet in diameter. i am so shocked that i finally holler \"what the hell!\".  my husband takes the phone from his ear and says what? what? i jerk myself around in the seat so i can see this thing out the back window, as it has just passed over the car. it has risen up in altitude, has turned off the roadway to the south, southeast, maybe 50 to 75 feet up and is entering a puffy cloud.  i could still clearly see the feet as it entered the cloud. it seemed to be gently entering the cloud and when it was about two thirds into the cloud, i quickly looked at the couple of cars behind us to see if any were swerving or anything, but didn't see any indication they saw too. i turned to my husband and said, \"i think i just saw a ufo\". then i said, \"i think what i saw was a living creature\". as soon as i got to a piece of paper i drew what i saw. i just want to know if anybody else has seen anything like this. i wish i hadn't seen this. i have been sick to my stomach ever since, knowing something like this is

house on what is known as tiptop or tomsauk mountain which is the highest pointin the state of mo. it was probably around 11 or 12 in the early afternoon, while my uncles and i were playing a game of basketball when my aunt called out to us to look. we all stopped playing to see what she was wanting us to see. there she was, pointing up at the sky where all of us saw it, a ufo. there it was, hovering up over us as if it was watching us guy's playing our game. all of a sudden my aunt bolted into the house and returned with a pair of binoculars and began looking at the object. soon all of us probably twelve to fifteen total was fighting over the binoculars to take our turn to look at it up close and personal. the craft looked like a bowl on top of another bowl, disc shaped. it had lights all around the center of it flashing red, yellow, green sequentially, you know, red, yellow, green all the way around it. through the binoculars you could see windows in the craft, antenas on it as well. the craft was just hovering there, not making a sound at all. i dont know how log it hovered above us exactly, probably somewhere around ten to fifteen minutes, and then at the snap of the finger, it was gone. as far as my feelings and actions over the event, speachless. all i can say is, it was the talk and the conversation for the rest of the day, none of us could believe what we had seen. i do not understand exactly, but these craft continued to be seen around our town for many months after by many people, not a few, but many. i guess the greatest spectacular viewing, was after a school basket ball game. i have no idea at how many people was standing in the school parking lot, gazing at the heavens watching these red glowing lights dancing around in the night sky putting on a display that words cannot explain. i'm talking about doing things that no human aircraft could ever do. shoot across the sky with no sound, stop, shoot backwards, stop, go straight up, stop, then shoot staight down and stop at its own free will with all ease. however, these craft were seen both during the day and at night.

inside when he is here.\r\n\r\n2. i happened to be looking up at the stars as i often do\r\n\r\n3. perhaps a star gone nova, or a star i hadn't noticed before\r\n\r\n4. it was bright, changing colors between darken/redish/amber/golden to a brighter white/yellowish/golden color. every time i went inside to try to get somebody with a camera to answer, or tried to email mufon and went back outside it changed its location in the sky, and not by a small amount but by several miles at a time, until 2:10 when i came out and couldn't see it, i then decided i wasn't going back out there until 3 am when i couldn't resist the urge to see if it was still there, and i once again observed it in a different location until 3:38 when i checked the time and realized that since i couldn't figure out what it was and couldn't get anyone over to my house to confirm that i needed to go to be so as to be able to go to work in the morning. it was gone this morning when i awoke.\r\n\r\n5. i was at first absolutely fascinated, then a bit frightened as each time i went inside and came back out it had moved such great distances yet while i was observing it seemed to hover in place. so i started to get the feeling it may be aware that i was observing it which then made me feel frightened, and i am rarely ever frightened by anything....Truly frightened that is. after words i felt disappointed that i had to give up and filming it and that i had to go to bed before it fully disappeared from view. but as i said before i had observed it for hours and i still couldn't make sense of it.\r\n\r\n6. i didn't i finally decided to go to bed and to contact mufon in hopes that a logical explanation could be found, i will however the observing the sky tonight to see if it returns because that would give me great insight as to what it may be.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"02:39:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,
