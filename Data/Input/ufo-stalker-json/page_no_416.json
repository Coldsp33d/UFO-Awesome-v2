to granada blvd, at 8:15pm on 7-19-16, a little over one hour ago. i looked up in the sky towards the west, approximately 40 degrees up and saw an extremely bright (silver) object about 1,000 ft up, just even with the first very dense layer of three small grey clouds. the sky was very clear and my first thought is that it was an airplane reflecting the rays of the sun. i kept my eye on the object for close to 10 seconds. the sky was fairly clear in all directions and in the very far distance i could see airplanes flying the normal flight routes, very faint but visible airplanes. after the ten second constant watch,the object vanished from sight. i said to my wife, \"what the hell was that?'i explained what i saw, we pulled over to the west of a1a so i could attempt to locate what i thought was an airplane and track the aircraft with my eye. with a very clear 180 degree view of the western sky i could not see nor could my wife see any aircraft heading west, north, east or south. i was stationary at this location for 10 minutes looking for any signs of a possible aircraft. once again, the sky was very clear and cloud coverage was minimal. this very bright silver object vanished from sight. nothing came through the three small grey clouds and i never saw it again.

the beautiful full moon. \r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object? it looked like an airplane fuselage, but was hovering, or moving very slowly at least,  below the moons relative position at the time. it was also very high, possibly  in low earth orbit, even tho it was still light out, i thought maybe the suns very low position might have made it visible. \r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? an airplane until i realized no wings or tail, then blimp or balloon but it appeared to be made of metal or something reflective. then i realized it was moving to the east and appeared to be moving more rapidly and getting harder to see like the sun was not reflecting on it as much so i thought it might be the iss until i checked nasa sight for visible sighting listings, and it was over africa at that time\r\n\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. it was either chrome/metallic or white but i'm pretty sure it was a metal object. \r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. just curious as to what it was. i'm guessing some type of experimental air or spacecraft, but it's possible it was a satellite reflecting sunlight\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object? it got harder to find, since i was driving a motorcycle it was a little harder to focus on it, and i kept losing it due to trees etc. eventually i couldn't find it, it appeared to be gaining speed /altitude but it never really moved very fast\r\n\r\nthe oddest thing about it was, it appeared to me as the broadside of an airplane or rocket... the long way... although i couldn't make out whether it had an airplane like nose or not.. but it was traveling sideways, by that i mean it appeared as a jet would appear flying north and south, but it was moving east. that's why i noticed it, otherwise i'd have thought it was just an airplane. also, the full moon was out, but it was still light out, right at sunset\r\n\r\nit would have appeared to be over wisconsin /minnesota  / iowa at about 20:15 sunday evening, 7/17/2016","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
