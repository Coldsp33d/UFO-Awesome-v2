and red. shortly before the show would start it disappeared and two smaller craft appeared. one was a solid green, the other a solid red. i tried to film these craft but the were to small for my camara to film. these craft moved and incredible speed and then slow down. the altitude these craft were at exceed and drone that you could purchase for private use. eventually i lost site of the solid green object and was able to observe the solid red object from time to time. the larger craft reappeared right before the firework show and moved all around the area. these objects made no sound. at times, it appeared to be right next to the fireworks and eventually moved west towards the ocean which was close to the end of the show. at this time, you can see the object move behind trees and shrubs due to its distance and altitude. i spent a number of years in the military and am knowledgeable in our nations aircraft. it is my opinion that this was not a military aircraft. the number of people enjoying the firework show ranged within the hundreds and is unclear if anyone else whittnessed these

unidentified objects in the skies for the past six weeks. the first object was in the trees then it moved towards me and stopped just 20' from me, it was a white ball of light or orb. i didn't know what it was and took a picture with my cell phone, but when the flash went off, the object shot straight up in the air and stopped, then it started flashing blue and red, then it moved quickly further away, then stopped, seeming to be watching me. my wife and i have been watching the skies ever since this incident and along with the neighbors, have seen many different types and shapes of objects in the skies. most are a dark grey color, some are white, and others are a round disk shape with square block shapes on the bottom. some have a jet like sound, others produce no sound at all and seem to have no propulsion system. i called whiteman air force base to report this because it seemed that the objects were starting to get hostile. one chased me down the road and i became very afraid that something would happen. whiteman told me to call missouri mufon and report this. on saturday night, july 16, things culminated when we saw many objects, and while i was taking photos of them and the lightning (with no thunder) from my front yard, a police officer saw me and asked what i was doing. i told him what i was doing and he called more police in, they thought i was crazy and arrested me and my wife, and called family services to take my 13-year old daughter to my mother and she is still there. they came in and took my computer, laptop, camera, and all of my weapons in the house. i really think someone needs to come check this out as something is going on and the police don't seem to care. i don't know if it is our military or something else but it is a serious situation that

traveled outwards from the center and within about 20 seconds the moon was full with nothing obstructing it.  at this point we all thought that was it.  the moon was setting in the northeast and maybe just about 10 degrees off the horizon.  i took a final look through the scope and all the orbs started to reappear again traveling from the outside to the center of the moon.  after they again formed

my apartment balcony to look, and sure enough i did not and still am not sure what i saw. there were about 3 objects going by every 5 mins for a total of about a half hour. i took a video on my iphone and my fiance took a video on her ipad. after that i pretty much brushed it off...Until april. i was watching ufo youtube videos and it reminded of my videos. so i decided to do a frequent snapshot between both videos. after that i did zoom ins and contrast and lighting edits, and could not believe what i think i captured. one\"vehicle\" had 2 beings sitting inside of an acorn shaped object that was so small it resembled two people sitting in a bumper car behind each other. the one in the front, you can see his eyes and the top of his head. the one in the rear, you can see his whole face. the other object was even weirder. is was significantly bigger and seemed transparent in the snapshot. you could see one being sitting in the center in some sort of chair on a \"laptop\". you can also see computer screens mounted on the wall and floor. a door can also be seen. listen, i don't know if this is some elaborate prank or what. i only know what i saw. pictures and videos will be in attachments. it would be very nice if i can find somebody more experience in this field to help me out with this. my mind is completely blown from this. \r\n\r\nps. i have alot more photos. will send
