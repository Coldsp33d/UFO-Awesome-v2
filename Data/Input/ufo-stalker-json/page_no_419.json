disappeared as though someone turned off a light. i previously witnessed a bunch of red glowing orbs pass over the park behind my home, but this was the first time i saw the white glowing orb. i am always amazed by brilliant stars and moving heavenly objects! could it have been another planet? i suppose anything is possible, but i don't believe this was the case because it was in my view so briefly and moved right to left before disappearing from sight suddenly. i had forgotten about these pictures i took until recently when i was putting pictures into albums. the only reason i know the

in water. they would accelerate effortlessly and then coast for a while before either accelerating again and/or changing directions.\r\n\r\ni watched them for at least 10 minutes before some of them

like a star. they appeared to stay in one spot for 3-4 min and there was one that seemed to move independently of the others.  first it was to the right of the other 4 then it moved closer, meanwhile the other 4 stayed together.  during this time a single plane, could have been a private jet flew past them. the plane was on my side like it flew between the lights and myself.   the 5 lights then started moving, like they were drifting on the wind, sort of like balloons. it was a typical sunny arizona day with little to no wind, no clouds. the objects then moved towards the east(ish) and seemed to stop again. i'm not sure how long they were there since i wasn't pay attention to the time. one seemed to move more than the other four and would get closer and farther from them. at one point it almost looked like 3 of them, which tended to stay together went behind a cloud because they got dim and disappeared, and then came back.  i couldn't see any clouds however. then the other two would be gone and came back. it was instantaneous like a light turn off. they always came back in the same location. finally there were only 2 left, they would disappear for a second or two and show back up and then finally were just gone. they really did look like stars. it may have been the sun reflecting off balloons but it definitely struck me as odd. i wasn't scared i just thought huh, i wonder if anyone else saw that.  i took a picture with my phone and a video but you can't see anything, and i can't upload my pictures because there is something screwy with my phone not connecting to the computer. sorry, it sounds like an excuse but it is true. i do still have them on my phone, but all you see is clear blue sky. if there is an email address i can send them to you that way. \r\nit may very well have been balloons but i wasn't sure if anyone else had reported anything strange.

niagara falls ontuesday june 12th 2016.\r\n\r\ni am a bellman at one of the major hotels right near the falls. during one of my many routine luggage calls yesterday (the day of the event), i happened to look out the window of the 43rd floor while waiting for the elevator.\r\n\r\nfrom this vantage point one can see most of the niagara region and even toronto on the distant shores of lake ontario. this was the direction that i was looking when i noticed two large rectangles that would almost pass for solar panels hovering in the sky.\r\n\r\nas i watched them, the alternately bobbed up and down, crossed paths and then slowly drifted apart. i watched them, trying to figure out what they were for a few more minutes before they once again began to drift back together. \r\n\r\nat this point they appeared to be over niagara on the lake, a town about 20 miles kilometres away, and still were very visible in the sky which means they must have been quite big.\r\n\r\ni left to go back down to work and informed another bellman to look out the window during his next call. he did so and came back astonished and unable to explain what he saw.\r\n\r\nlater in the day, a co-worker called us from a different part of the city letting us know he just saw the same ufo and snapped a few pictures of it. i have attached one of the photos below.\r\n\r\na few hours later another co-worker walked into the building exclaiming he saw a ufo while driving to work. when we asked him what he saw he recounted an almost identical report of the objects we had viewed earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nthis morning i noticed that a report has been created with mufon by a person living in st. catharine's (another near by city) and once again, the report details the exact object that we all witnessed. \r\n\r\nwhether it was aliens or a secret government craft i can't be sure. all i know is that i look to the skies every day, seeing helicopters and planes flying over the falls... but i have never, ever seen anything like this before.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

0518 hours. it was a cold morning with a clear morning sky (i could see the stars). i started to walk south along the road whereby 30 seconds later i noticed three(3) large orange/red coloured spheres in the south sky around 45 degrees up. i noticed the spheres because they were so bright and low in the sky. at first i thought it must be some kind of planetary line up because the three spheres were in a horizontal line and that's what it looked like, but i realised this was ridiculous because i am into amateur astronomy and i was not aware of any such thing taking place. i also ruled out the constellation orion because the constellation was below the horizon that morning. i even opened a app called stellarium on my mobile phone to confirm this. initially the spheres appeared to be stationary for around 8 minutes from my vantage point and i began to take photos using my mobile phone at 0524 hours. when i reached the end of the road i was now looking at the spheres head on where i think i began to notice some kind of movement from one of the spheres. i carried on taking photos whilst walking where i then confirmed that all three spheres were moving in my direction heading north. i crossed the road and started to film the spheres on my mobile phone moving across the sky. i saw a member of the public and pointed the spheres out to him as i wanted another witness to

now i had seen multiple satellites very high up in the sky before, on a nightly basis. where i live there are very few city lights, and on a clear night everything is very clear. these satellites typically moved from south to north in the sky and appeared star-like. but that is a digression. \r\nlast night: so i looked to the northwest, and saw a large blue light and object, hovering over the trees and apartment complex near the top of the hill (that would be near the intersection of burnham rd. and harrier ave.). previously i'd seen helicopters and conventional aircraft before around here. however they have bright white lights and red flashing lights, and not a large blueish light as i saw last night. there were no other lights as the object approached me. just a very large blue light and outline of the craft. as it approached me, i was pretty scared, and was swearing outside. most of these ufos do not scare me. but this one was odd in its lighting and color. i felt a numbness in my head and was sure i was going to get abducted this time. in fact that happens alot when i see these strange things or look at programs about aliens and alien abduction, aside from missing time. \r\nas the object approached slowly, and i mean slowly, it was barely moving, it moved slightly to the left and right, then went straight. i was looking at the time on my clock inside, through the window, throughout the event. luckily the time stayed consistent! well then it passed over, and i went outside again. on the underside of the craft, there was a small red and small white light, and some light noise. however nowhere near as loud as a conventional aircraft. \r\n**previous to the sighting: i was inside on my computer, and felt extremely disoriented. for a second i had little or no idea of where i was, i.E. location, address, state of mind. ** \r\n***around that time also i heard noises in the backyard (it's a large grassy hillside with a fig tree and other brush to the lefet) and saw a grey flash at the bottom of that yard nearest the bottom fence. *** \r\n\r\nin the past, i have seen ufos in the skies. i have had episodes of missing time too, not attributable to drugs and/or alcohol. but what happened last night concerned me a great deal, and scared me. it seemed to me that the aliens were granting me my wishes, and getting closer. i had asked inwardly for that to happen, to actually see a ship very close to me. so be careful what you wish for!!
