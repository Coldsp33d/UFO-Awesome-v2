side roommate's car, windows down, radio on, driving north on n. 63rd st., between co st. hwy. 119 and nelson rd.  to best of memory, day was hot, clear to sparse clouds, sun at approx. angle of 45 degrees off of horizon in ssw, and unknown wind conditions.  while listening to radio and engaging conversation with driver/roommate, casually glanced around to observe general surroundings through passenger window.  when glancing to east over ground fields, detected movement in sky by peripheral vision, little to ese of car's position.  upon focusing attention, observed strange-looking object on somewhat similar course heading as car being traveled in, with the object seemingly on sse to nnw trajectory while in process of executing slight, gradual turn to its left, in a slight \"banking\" action.  object had somewhat thin, elongated appearance, with \"tapered\" rear feature, and enlarged, somewhat \"bulbous\"-looking front.  approx. mid-point object's \"body\", short, stubby \"wings\" were noted, but object's banking action maintained slight tilt downwards on side closest to car, and may have resulted in misread on actual size/shape of wings.  toward tapered rear area, noticed pair of upright, \"v\"-shape positioned rear stabilizers of perceived rectangular shape.  object was of light coloration, perceived as light-grey or grey-white, with no markings/letters/numbers observed, and no other external features noticed, such as windows, hatches, lights, etc.  did not notice means of propulsion on object, such as noticeable engines, but any high-speed prop likely not noticed, due to side-viewing orientation, and no associated noise detected, over ambient radio and car road noises.  when first noticed, object was at approx. angle of 65 degrees off of horizon, and was of a length similar to the diameter of a baseball held at arm length.  object was estimated as approx. 25-30 ft. in length, and when first noticed, was estimated as approx. 200-300 ft. distant, at estimated altitude of approx. 300-400 ft. car traveled in proceeding approx. 45-50 m.P.H., object observed traveling along at leisurely pace little faster than car, estimated at approx. 60-70 m.P.H.  initial personal thought to object identity, was some kind of weird-looking \"cruise missile\", although object's speed displayed not similar to such.  object's speed/course caused it to pass over roadway being traveled little ahead of car, resulting in personal visual observation of object lost to my view after approx. 15-20 seconds, due to view blocked by car's roof, although driver/roommate thereafter acquired sighting of object on other side of car, and was able to keep under periodic observation while driving for another approx. 25-30 seconds, before lost to view.  later examination of maps involving the sighting area, indicate trajectory of object likely resulted in performing quite low-level fly-over/fly-by of the area's noaa table mountain test facility.  sketch available.

to get some 20 oz sodas. i put on my coat due to it being only 18°f outside grab my wallet and my keys and head out to my truck. as i start my truck i look up in the sky to my south/southeast (this is the way my truck is facing parked on the street) and i notice this extremely bright light that resembles a candle flame. it looks like a flame dancing on a wick. seeing as how this is not something that is very strange in the sky i say out loud, what is that?!?\" as soon as i said this it immediately stopped flickering and appeared to take on the shape/features of an airplane. naturally after seeing this my eyes were glued to this thing in the sky. slowly it started to look as if it really was a plane because it appeared to start slowing moving, so i started to drive to the gas station. i had to turn around so now i was heading due north and stopped at the stop sign at the end of my street. i was at a complete stop and looked both ways and saw that no one was coming so i tried to spot this thing again just to reassure myself that it was an airplane. much to my surprise, i find it just as it looked as i came outside to my truck when i first saw it. it had gone back to resembling a candle flame. so without hesitation i turned left(westbound) and hurried to the gas station and kept checking it in the sky. i has to turn left again at the light and so i was going southbound and now i had a great open sky view of this thing and what it was doing was changing brightness and hue from the candlelike orangish whiteish to stark white and as it did this is appeared to be vibrating and started to look almost fuzzy. the base colors of light were the candlelike colors to the bright whiteish but within that light tiny dots of all the colors you could possibly imagine randomly blipped on it and in no apparent order. i get to the gas station and get my sodas and rush back home to see if it is still there. i park on the street facing south and shut off my truck and look in the sky to the south/southeast again. and it is still there doing the \"freaking out vibrating changing colors thing\" so i get my phone out to try and see if i can hopefully catch something on a video or at least a picture and as soon as i get my phone out, before i even unlock it, this thing stops all movement completely. then slowly this thing started to dim and then it slowly started to go higher and as it did it looked like a circular object like a meteor falling to earth like the tail of one of those but in the opposite direction as it was going upwards and the top of it looked to be rounded off. and a few seconds later it was completely gone. \r\nthe actions of this thing when it stoped and changed, felt to me like, it had a conscious knowledge that i was watching it and it changed or camouflaged itself to avoid being found out. i didn't feel threated or in any danger but i was definitely concerned as i don't really know what it wanted or what it was doing over a lake. it's like it was letting me know that it knew i was watching it and that it too was watching me. it also felt familiar to experiences seeing this same light growing up. in the same position in the sky (south/southeast) and appearing to be over a lake. i wonder how long it has been watching me. i wonder if it's the same beings that have come before. i wonder what they want. overall i feel positive about it, but wouldn't mind some answers. \r\n\r\nalso i need to note that it was completely silent.

flying low towards either las vegas or the afb.  it appeared like a smaller glowing craft was following behind the tail of the jet wavering back and forth. i felt compelled to wave at it being that i am silly at times and was excited at witnessing this event and was trying to get its attention. next thing i see is the craft making a 90 degree turn and descending towards me. i thought it would continue on, but is stopped about 500-800 feet above me and just hovered, glowing brightly and silent.  as i watched it above me, i began to feel some concerns after about a minute. and then it started to ascend almost straight up, to a point that it looked like a bright star in the morning daylight.  then grew dimmer and dimmer until it was no longer visible. what is precarious is that the jet that it was initially following was unmarked.  perhaps a 707 or 727, white janice jet with an orange stripe perhaps flying out of area 51.  this i am unsure of, as there is no way to tell where that jet was coming from or why it was being followed. i can say this in all honesty, that i was putting out very strong mental thoughts about wanting to see it closer, when to my astonishment, it made a 90 degree turn away from the jet and then started to head right towards me. as i said, it hovered above me glowing brightly, but i was able to see the surface of the craft through the glowing white light relatively easily. when it was hovering above me, it remained there for several minutes, but then i had thoughts starting to enter my head about becoming a laboratory specimen and began feeling uneasy, a few seconds after this thought entered my head, it started ascending until it was no longer visible. i don't know how to explain this, but i feel like i made a connection with an entity unknown to me.  my only hopes at this point is for it to return or remember me.  i don't know why, but its just the way i feel.  i have always looked up at the stars in hopes of seeing a ufo, but i think all i ever really got to see were satellites or nothing that was ever remotely close to this. it was one of, if not, the most amazing experience i have ever encountered. i feel they left because they did not want to frighten me. i felt that there was a telepathic connection between it and myself, even if only for a few seconds.  i feel that it was curious to see who it was that wanted to see them so badly, so it changed direction and headed directly towards me.  i live in the desert on the edge of a small town, and there was nothing around that i know of that would have captured
