thought \"chinese lanterns?\" but these were much larger and not clearly not paper or rounded. not to mention, why would just two chinese lanterns be released at 10:43 pm on a wednesday night. they were moving at approx. 35 mph. the object closest to me was observed at less than 100 yds., just 100 ft. above treetops. they smoothly flew right on by us. there were a few other vehicles nearby who may have seen the objects as well. their flight path was perfectly level and we did not observe them change path or maneuver. it is possible they were part of a singular larger object, although they appeared as independent but identical objects with no connecting structure. we were traveling at 75 mph and didn't slow down to observe. my passenger looked out back window and watched them until they were out of sight of our vehicle. moments later, observed a jet on final to clarksburg/bridgeport airport. it is likely the objects' and the jet's paths intersected, albeit at differing altitudes.

o’clock. \r\n i saw a shiny cylinder or possible disk? bright and sunny day as you know if you are in the valley area today.\r\ni watched it as i’m driving. i’m on 4000 west and about 4400 south when i first saw it. it just stood out as odd to me. it was moving very slow in a southwest direction. i looked and looked and could not see a tail fin. \r\n it looked wider, longer than a commercial jet. silver white with sunlight reflecting off it and at times a hint of grey.\r\nmoving in a vehicle it almost appeared not to be moving.\r\ni stop at a signal light and watch to see it better. \r\nit is slowly moving. the leading side seemed to be tilted down slightly in the direction it went. the flight appeared very level and steady. while stopped at the signal light.... i seen it change direction and the size of its shape did not change at all. this made me think it was a disk shape. direction change and it still appears to be the same shape. (direction change from southwest to a western heading) at the stop light i can see it with the view of telephone poles and wires to easily judge it movement against a clear blue sky.\r\nafter the change of direction and not before or during.... after the direction change i seen it tilt on a near 45 degree angle and is barely moving. it appears to be heading more west now.\r\nthe light changes so i take off and drive into a smiths grocery store parking lot. i’m watching it as best i can driving, it is slow moving.\r\ni took my eyes and peripheral vision off it as i turned in the parking lot. \r\nthen i don’t see it again.\r\ni drove straight to a parking spot which took seconds. \r\ni hurried out of the truck to look for the object. \r\ni don't see it.\r\ni looked and looked. \r\ni tried to guess by speed and direction where it might be etc.\r\ni never saw it again.\r\nno jets or anything either.\r\ni sense some people looking at me as to why i'm starring at the sky so long.\r\nweird looks from people wondering what i’m looking for in the sky, ignore them.\r\nno one spoke to me as to why.\r\ni carefully scan the whole sky in the direction it was heading etc. \r\nso then i scan to look carefully all around, the whole sky again and again. i even look where i think it could not have gone even at a speed of a jet.\r\ni was very careful to look intently and not to over look any section of the sky.\r\ni never seen it again.\r\nit had been moving slow when i last saw it.\r\nit was not even half way across the salt lake valley heading southwest when i was driving into the parking lot. \r\nif it was a jet, there was no way it could have gone from sight in that length of time i took my eyes from it to park. \r\nthe whole time i saw it, the object was moving too slow for a jet. \r\nit was an 1/8 longer, wider than a commercial jet from nose to tip.\r\nit was about as thick as the body of a jet.\r\ni went in the store and buy tomatoes and milk. i come back out in the parking lot. i watched long enough to see a few jets near the same distance the object was.\r\ni could easily see they have a tail fins. \r\nwhat i seen i could never see a tail fin on it. \r\nno tail fin and the fact it just seemed to disappear made me feel it had to have been a ufo.\r\ni would feel better if i had a chance to view it with binoculars and know where it went.\r\nto see

stars. i had been sitting for only a minute or two when an object that i can only describe as a star-like came into view from behind the tall tree line to my northwest. i immediately jumped up out of my chair and in my head i said holy s#!T, it's a ufo. as i watched the object track to the southeast and behind some trees behind my house i started to second guess myself thinking, no it can't be (as it was being partly obscured by trees, not yet having full foliage). i then thought to get my iphone out and because it was so dark shoot a rapid series of photos just in case this object was not known (shooting photos gave me more light then shooting a video). as i am shooting the photos i am going back and forth in my mind what this is. is it something known, is it a ufo? i live in the flight path of a major airport and grew up near this airport so i am very firmiliar with flight paths and what airplanes and helicopters look like (i have never seen a light like this before or since, as i noted, the only way i can describe it is as a fast moving, close star). i made the conscious decision to get my neighboors satellite dish in the photos for scale (and possible speed estimates, although i do not know if this is possible?). i took around 109 photos of the object and stopped to watch it the last few seconds before it was to disappear behind the roof line of my neighboors house. approximately 5-10 seconds after i stopped shooting (convienient right?!?) the object made an abrupt turn (although not a right angle but more of an acute curve, absolutely not possible by any know aircraft of any country today). i then watched the object in complete astonishment on a path directly away from my position (and the earth) over the next 10-15 seconds (maybe 20?) slowly get smaller until i could no longer see it. \r\n  from that night on i have almost an obsession with looking at the sky in hopes of seeing this object again. i know that i probably never will but i still hope i can because it was like no light source i have ever seen and obviously made maneuvers that i have never seen or even though possible. upon reviewing my photos i noticed that there looks to be a small private plane in the foreground and would think that there would be no way the pilot could not have seen this object unless it's altitude was much more than the aircraft. i so desperately want

concern:\r\n\r\n      hello. my name is stormie ashbrook. i am almost 32 years old and have been a resident of cape coral/pine island florida for about 28 years now. i like to think that i know the area very well and i am familiar with most normal flight paths around. what myself and two other people saw in the night sky on july 8, 2016 was not normal in the least.\r\n\r\n       i was driving home with a friend around 10:00 - 10:30 pm est on this friday night when i just happened to glance over to my left. at first i didn't think much about it. it was only 4 lights at first. as i kept looking over to my left, paying closer and closer attention to them, there were suddenly more of them, and they were grouping up with each other somehow. i immediately pulled over into a gas station parking lot and parked the car facing south toward the lights. by this time it had been about 4 minutes since i first noticed them. \r\n       after watching these things for a few minutes just the two of us, another car pulled up next to me, asking if we had any ideap what these strange lights were. he, too, had a cellphone camera out, with no luck in getting any sort of video or picture of them. now the 3 of us are watching these things move around and  witnessing their amazing and otherworldly maneuvering capabilities for a good 6-10 minutes until they started to disappear. they disappeared one at a time over a period of about 4-5 minutes,  the first two going straight up into the sky, no sounds or big light trails to note.  another would start to move more noticeably, a couple of them eventually taking a more normal flight pattern and heading to the south or southwest, fading away til gone. the others seemed to just fade away into the dark night sky, again, always one at a time. after a total of about 15 minutes, they were all gone. \r\nthe only video that came out with anything will prove only that someone else, someone not in the car with us originally, stopped for the same reason we did... to safely witness what i know was an amazing atmospheric anomaly! it was an experience that i will never forget and i am more interested in the unknown now than i've ever been. i will know that there is more out there than just us humans. there must be. \r\nthank you for your time, and i hope to hear from you soon!\r\n p.S.- i've included a cellphone video of very bad visual quality, so it definitely doesn't document anything paranormal. i included it because it shows proof of the other person who stopped with me to look at them. so only audio is feasible. \r\nthank you,again!\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\nstormie marie

katrina back in late august of 2005. only reason i remember the approximate data was because my birthday was near the day that horrible hurricane had hit my home town.  \r\n\r\never since this occurance with this ufo; it felt as if i have been marked...  i have been been having very livid dreams that seems so real....  dreams that until this tuesday morning around 3am......  before daylight is all i know since i actually went to bed around 9-10pm....  just moments before this encounter that dang near has me at wits end.  \r\n\r\ni am definitely thinking of having a psychotics  hypytise me to tell me if what i saw was reality or fiction. all i remember was the feeling of my body being paralyzed and could not move my arms or legs as if it was a weight pushing my arms and legs down onto my bed.  all i know was my back were facing away from the direction i was being pulled.  i fought hard to turn my neck and saw five figures standing outside my room....  as if the wall was tore down or they somehow turned my wall into a transparent liquid like water.   all i could think of was please don't hurt me.... and please help me with this severe pain levels i am going through everyday. \r\nall i know is all i could do was turn my neck to see what was pulling me in this direction and it was less than 10 seconds after turning my neck it was as if they gave me some kind of drug or something that knocked me out cold and i woke up laying flat on my back around 8pm that night.  i remember before i looked at these entities it felt as if something were crawling inside my spinal cord and this feeling is what woke me up. as if i was getting probed or something literally crawling inside my spinal cord.... but with no pain at all.  it felt as if i were being scanned like back in 2005.  i know what muscle spasms feels like....  this is nothing like such. \r\n\r\nthese five figures i saw is like burnt into my memory before i was knocked back out cold.  and if it was a dream....  why do i feel since tuesday as if i had a surgery of some sort.  i feel extremely sore that i have barely left bed in the last 2 days. one thing i have noticed thou....  i have been trying to reteach myself computer programming ever since november 2015. in the last two days i have made more progress than i have in several months    \r\n\r\nso maybe this aduction isn't for the worst.  it's as if my brain is running in overdrive since this encounter real or not real i have no proof. i only know i had to leave a job making $35 a hour working for at&t in november 2014.  i couldn't function...  walking became extremely painful. standing up and working aloft as a lineman became impossible to continue to carry on. i am starting to fill they are here to help if they could.  but one

being a photographer, went down to the beach. see, she lives close to the water so it isn't a hassle to get down there or anything. \r\nanyway, i started off taking a few test shots of the island across the way, trying to get it just right for night shots. not long after, me being in my haste had forgotten the memory card back up at the house. but i still had 10 shots in my memory banks, so i figured i'd use them first. so i did, i used all 10, then started making my way back towards the stairs that lead back onto the road. that's when, out of the corner of my eye, i spot a blinding light. it scared the crap out of me, i jumped, and looked toward it. i couldn't look straight at it because it was so blinding but after a short moment it wasn't as bright anymore, i could actually look at it now. at this late at night there's is no sun at that time of year. and it made night turn to day for those few seconds that it was bright. after it was still quite bright, enough to sparkle against the water anad lighten the evening, but not enough to really have anyone who hadn't already seen it to take notice. now, in my quick thinking i started going through my pictures deleting what i could, trying to save the good ones. i deleted two, but i wanted a shot, i just wanted a picture of it soo bad, i hadn't even though about what it could be at this point. so i plopped the camera down on a ledge, and set it to night capture, and snapped this quick photo before it vanished into thin air. the night darkened and i made my way back. for some reason i felt disturbed by the light and decided to stay in for the evening. it wasn't until my grandfather had spotted the photo that he considered it a ufo. and it's taken him 2 months to convince me to fill out this application. hopefully you fine people can figure out what the hell i saw that night.\r\n\r\ni must also apologise for my shaky photography\r\ni would also like to add that this object was completely still, and that i do not

thought it was a para glider because of the semi domed shape. as i observed further i noticed it was barely moving and made no sound. the sun was setting so it was picking up lots of reflection i had been watching for about a minute. as it moved slowly north i was able to see that it was 2 domed objects connected. it seemed to be about 6 to 7,000 ft up. at about 2 minute's of observation i could see it very clearly. i ran to the house to grab the binoculars which are always out. it was out of my sight for about 30 seconds. when i returned it was gone. the reason i reported this is i went to your site thinking about joining because i see so many things like this on a regular basis. as i was watching the flash slide case 74282 came across the screen. i was shocked as this seems to be what i observed. i feel i should start reporting my sightings because they are happening more often than what i would observe a few years back. the last event was sunday evening july 10, i was in the swim

from a day trip on fire island. it was near sunset so it was still light out. we were all enjoying the fresh air on the back porch and i noticed a very large black boomerang shaped object pointing and moving north along the treetops that grow along the backwater along the east side of rt 231 up from main st to about the union blvd (which is to the north of the house). several houses in the area. i saw it actually touching and bending the treetops as it moved unaffected and very steadily at about walking speed (3 to 4 mph) northward. when it was parallel to our house it stopped moving. we were kind of excited and i told my wife to quick go get the video recorder. my son doesn't remember this (he was just seven at the time) but he exclaimed, \"maybe there are aliens inside!\". i was trained as an artist and always had very good vision. i looked carefully for details on the object and i could see that it was faceted and the surface looked velcro like with a little more roughness than actual velcro. i can also say it was very stealthy looking except that i have seen stealth bombers in flight they moved a lot faster had apparent jet propulsion and made noise. this had no props, jets, nor made any noise at all and had no windows etc. only 4 feet in depth at the center so this would not be easy for anyone to be in.  remained in place not moving at tree top level just beyond out backyard fence for several minutes and then very quickly went straight up as my wife came out with the video recorder. by the time she got it turned on it was at about several thousand feet and she got about 30 seconds of video with the boomerang way up in the sky and a jet flying past it. it flexed one of its wings almost making it look elastic before it continued rising straight up and out of sight into the sky. i don't know where that video is. i gave it to a coworker who was a ufo enthusiast, was very interested, and he had seen many on a regular basis when he was living in az. he said they were metallic and ball shaped and constantly jets would chase after them and they would zoom off. but he never figured out what they were. my wife thinks we still have a copy of the video somewhere but i have not come across it (old video cassette). but that is it for this one. i have more incidents i witnessed and will report here as well just for the record. maybe someone else saw this boomerang? if i ever come across the video i will submit it but it doesn't give you as much info as i just did from my visual. video only shows a very distant boomerang silhouetted in the sky, one wing flexes a little then a jet goes past then the battery ran out.

of it so i am reporting it now. there are other living witnesses who were with me at the time who can corroborate this. for about 3 years in the early 60's i spent several weeks each summer at a friends house at virginia beach at 79th st off atlantic avenue. probably it was 1963 and probably august when my friend and i and his mother and sisters were on the beach just after dark having eaten a quick dinner at the seahorse inn. we noticed there were 4 large glowing plates, maybe 30 to 40 feet across (same size each) were doing aerial tricks maybe 100 feet offshore, rising 100 to 200 feet, hovering, then dropping to just maybe 25 or 50 feet above the water surface. i remember they were never quite eye level as i always was seeing the undersides of them. the objects flew in formation as if they were one object, but they were separate objects. they made no sound and i stuggled to look for specific markings on them but all i could see was the smooth surface emitting light evenly about as bright as a 40 watt fluorescent bulb or less and about the same coolness of white light as a fluorescent bulb (they emitted light but weren't too bright to look or stare at). they were definitely circular like plates and the edges were crisp. they were close enough so that you could see these were really like actual giant saucers. there were 100 or so witnesses on the beach and i noticed they were all staring dumbfounded at these things just like we were. it was a real curiosity. on many nights we had seen distant white lights on the horizon rising and dipping, literally on or just above the horizon (way out over the ocean), and they were not boat lights as we were familiar with them. until then we thought those lights were some kind of mirage effect and we just thought it was neat and mysterious. i still don't know if these were the same lights as those but i have a hunch it is possible they were, only closer. but after 10 minutes of this amazing aerial light show, my friend's mother suggested these could be ufos and that we might be in danger, so we all agreed to leave and went back to the house. i already had mentally identified them as ufos but didn't feel threatened because they kept their distance, but better safe than sorry (i did not want to be there actually if they decided to land). but was not in the news (paper or radio). my friends mother saw them the next night as well. i remember my friend told me she had told him that they 'had come back' again! even though i was 11 or 12 years old i knew this was not a natural phenomenon, and also that they were like nothing i had ever seen nor heard of except in the context of crazy ufo stories. i had tried as hard as i could to distinguish some detail, and also to hear a sound, but nothing, just the general surface emitted light was all smooth with no detail, and the sound of waves crashing. that's it. i felt it was odd because from there you could actually walk (a few miles if i remember correctly) to a naval base and there were a lot of witnesses seeing the same thing i described. i guess nobody reported it. there were no planes, heliocopters, or officals, police or anything that got involved. i would be interested if anyone else has reported this!
