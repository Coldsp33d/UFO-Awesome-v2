style near the south edge, looking west. the east side of the patio is the house, so i can see s, w, and n. and where i was on the porch could see almost directly above me but not quite.\r\n\r\n as i took a puff i glanced over to my left(south) for some reason and a very bright fuzzy orange light sailed almost instantly from between s and se to between s and sw while also going slightly n, from about 25degrees above the horizon and 2 miles away. it then instantly changed direction to go back to the e between s and se while moving further north still and higher on the horizon. once this happened, it again instantly changed direction, going back to between s and sw, while also moving north toward me thus gaining degrees in the horizon again. then, it got creepy! so it was now about 40-45 degrees in the s sw sky, and did another instant direction change, heading ne again, but this time it noticed me watching it! it didn't make it my s se. right after the instant change to head ne it only made it to due s, instantly changing to head n, directly at me. but it didn't go in a straight line like before. it did several s patterns, like the way a snake slithers, i would say 3, until it came almost directly over my head, at about 85degrees, and instantly stopped, as did my heart! it hovered for roughly 1.5 seconds over a house just 4 houses s, where 3 children between the ages of about 3-8 were playing. the boy and girl yelled at the same, one saying \"what is that!\" and the other \"you see that!\" while the young'un started crying. it then reversed in the same s pattern of slithering and i jumped up and took a few steps n to open the sliding door to get my mom to come out to see it, and when i walked back to the spot i was sitting in, it was gone! the father of the children came out a split second after i got back to my spot and the kids were telling him about \"that light\" and he made them come in. i estimate the altitude of this object at 1000 feet at its closest point to me, when it hovered for a moment.\r\n\r\n i badly wish i had stayed to watch how and where it \"vanished\", but the whole thing happened so fast, the way it noticed and approached the kids and/or me, and them screaming, freaked me out too! i wanted another adult witness, one that was in the air force to see it. it was doing its thing then noticed us and let us know it sees us, and that we're dumb hairless apes and that if it can do all that imagine how supreme they are over us. a few months later we had a massive flood, the most rainfall in a day ever. 6 months after the fuzzball i got a freak lung abscess that never happens in a 23 year old, and my nails started falling off my fingers but they still haven't fallen off, they're just loose. and the big brother of those kids, who was like 19-21, was just murdered 2 months ago. i'm not saying the orange ball of light caused this, too much time between happenings, but maybe was an omen, idk...And this thing moved! it went from 2 miles to my se to 1.5 miles sw to 1m se to .5m sw to on top of me in 4 seconds. i'm adding a very rough picture i made in paint to show the basic movement, i'm not an artist and don't know how to show point of view and all that so the degrees in the painting are off.. also a google earth 3d picture and a map.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

playing video games. i stepped outside in the back yard to catch the breeze. he has a picnic table so i lied down on the table top and looked up the stars for a few minutes, saw a shooting star go from se to nw and kept looking up hoping to see more when it happened. at 3:23 a.M. i noticed 5 dim, non blinking, yellow lights, in a v pattern, moving over the top of a tree headed due south toward downtown. i jumped off the table wondering what the hell it could be, looked at my phone for the time, and stood there watching. it flew directly over me at what i guess was 300-350 feet altitude! just slightly higher than the top of the tallest building in town, which is where it was headed. that's when i could see the outline of the craft against the black sky. the stars were clearly visible between the prongs of the v but not the lights, so it was, in fact, one single chevron craft. it made no noise. i lost sight of it about 15 seconds after contact, when it flew behind a tree and into the light coming from the downtown area. i was startled to see it but not scared. i waited around a few minutes before going in and telling my friend, who went out for a while to see if he could spot something. i have always since seeing it thought it to be a secretive u.S.A.F. stealth aerospace craft that was conducting a test to see if its noticeable at low altitudes. if i had not been looking up and the lights weren't on, i wouldn't notice it. i'm sure they fly around with no lights on alot and go unnoticed. absolutely silent. \r\n\r\ni have another very close sighting in abilene that was definitely not ours, and the neighbor kids saw it too and screamed, but can't remember the exact date, first week of  march 2015. i'll be posting that soon.","distance":"101-500

the horizon. clear night and starry sky. drove beyond the next valley and see a mixture of the lightning flashes in six quick intervals and a flash of red light on the horizon. the 3rd valley exposed the object to our line of sight which was massive and about 300 yards ne of an a-frame structure i had driven by many times before. this time, the object builds up energy within 3 seconds, getting brighter red, before flashing out. the next flash occurs while we are within the closest proximity of the object (500-600 yards away). we then saw that the object was larger than the a-frame structure and gathered up energy within 3-4 seconds, dim red to bright red before flashing out. noticed that it hovered about 20 ft. above the ground and reminded me of a jellyfish in transparency and had the shape of a pacman ghost, but more fluid. the flash was like that of a flashbulb that photographers used pre-1950's. we rolled the windows down to see if there was any noise or wind, for which there was not. wasn't able to catch video or pics as i noticed we were the only other lighted object in the road and there was a frantic migration of jackrabbits from the south side of the road to the north. i was also being cautious not to hit any possible cattle or antelope that graze in the area. the object repeated the same process maybe 2-3 more times but was at that time in our rear view. by the time we made it all the way out to the paved road, we stopped and exited the truck at a safe distance. staring back, we noticed that the flashing had ended and was replaced by a constant, yet still bluish-white light that was also much smaller. the white light must have been at least 100 ft. or more in the air, but also moved from the a-frame location. the same light then started to move north towards the cinder crater (meriam), before stopping, splitting into two lights, which then shot off in opposite directions (one north and the other south) at top speed, then out of sight. we proceeded south on the paved road back towards flagstaff. we continued to look to the west and saw nothing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
