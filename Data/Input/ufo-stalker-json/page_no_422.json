colored lights rising from a tree line in the distance. at first i thought they may have been helicopters, since they were coming from the ‘somewhat’ general direction of a shuttered airbase (castle afb); but, being i’ve lived in the vicinity for over 40 years, and have seen many types of aircraft come and go, these looked like nothing i’d seen before; so, i stopped and took a photo of both orbs. as i was doing so, more started to ascend from the same general area, so i quickly switched my phone to ‘video’, and started to video them. those were the first two of approximately 15 of those auburn colored orbs i witnessed that night in merced county. they came up from the north, low, over the horizon, slow and steady, apparently noiseless, in an unorganized assent and headed southeast, crossing over state highway 99. and, though i could hear the relatively steady noise of the not too distant traffic, i did not hear any distinct prop or jet noise from them  through the whole 15 minute duration of the event, as they rose above the tree line and faded into the distance before blinking out. also, anything with a prop, at the distance they were in comparison to the traffic, i would have definitely been able to hear. in fact, you would think a group of anything that large would make some sort of racket; as they weren't that distant from me and didn't reach that high an altitude before blinking out. also, aside from the solid orangish light they emanated, they didn't have any wing or tail navigation, proximity or flashing-position lamps from what i could see. neither from their front as they approached nor from the rear as they departed. note: this happened in merced so i was hoping anyone from the area traveling on the north or south lanes of highway 99, at approximately 9:00pm to 9:15pm, just over the 16th street overpass may have also seen them, as (from my point of view) they looked as though they may have crossed that highway.","distance":"Over One

just stepped into the lot behind the building for some air. my friend first noticed the object, & pointed it out to me. she asked me if i thought it was a star, because it was unusually large & bright. when i saw it, i knew it could not be a star.\r\nthe light was brilliant, & it was constantly changing its intensity. it melted into red, pink, orange, white, yellow & (occasionally) a green-blue at random & with no apparent pattern or timing. we thought it could be a satellite, but it moved like a mosquito, hovering all around & up & down. at this time the object was far above & away from us to the north.\r\nafter a few minutes, my friend jokingly called out to it, asking it to come closer. we were just chatting & watching it, when suddenly it began to zigzag upwards above the tallest pine trees, putting it into very clear view. that was when we could see that the light was actually coming from the base of a larger, round, black object.\r\nas we stood there & watched, it moved slowly closer to us. after a few minutes of this we got scared & ran inside. about ten minutes later, though, curiosity got the best of us & we went back out.\r\nthis time the light was to our right, floating high above the neighboring building. we attempted to record it on our phones, but it was not visible over the glare on the cameras from the street lights. we watched & discussed what we were seeing: a rounded, flat disc with a rounded/square top that was only visible sometimes; it was very large and solid. we started to get scared again, but we continued to stand & stare. after a few more minutes passed by, a second light emerged from the bottom of the hat, & dropped about a hundred feet. it hovered there, & then went back and merged with the original light. it was about this time that we were startled by approximately three unexplained flashes of white light that illuminated everything all around us. a few minutes after that, the colorful light in the sky blinked out, & the object was gone. almost in the same moment, we heard a strange machine-like noise that sounded unlike anything we'd ever heard. it was very loud, & we ran inside the building & didn't even want to talk about what we had just witnessed for quite awhile. it gave me the worst migraine i've ever had, which lasted for about twelve hours.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

fishing sun glasses and i could no longer see the object until i put my glasses back on. i then have my glasses to my wife who was very skeptical at first, as soon as she put my glasses on she saw the object too. the object was changing its speeds from fast to slow, to almost hovering before it started to ascend well above plane altitude. there was a plane in the far distance way further out then the sphere object and you could visible see the difference between the plane and sphere objects shape. the object ascended well above any plane and stopped on a dime and hovered for a couple seconds before it just vanished. the day itself was a very warm day with no cloud coverage around and about five minutes after the object dispersed a jet going high speeds went slashing by the area the object had been. i'm not completely sure how far the object was out over the ocean, so size is very hard to determine, but i would guess it would have to be over 20 feet in size to visible from that distance. i hope others report this, but i do know that the object was not visible with the naked eye nor another type of high end sun glasses like my wife was wearing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ludington, mi.  to my parents house witch is about 5-6 miles out of town. it was around midnight and ive made this trip excessively around that time in my life. there are few lights down that stretch of road. i left a friends house between 11:30 and midnight to go home, which is usually between a 20 min-40 min bike ride depending on how i was feeling. i made it a little over half way that night and was coming up to the last street light in that area before turning on to another road. as i was riding in the darkness toward the light i felt a sudden skip in my sight and did not feel right, disoriented. i stopped and stepped off my bike to collect myself. it seemed like i glitched up the road 10 or 15 feet. i got on my bike after that and continued to ride home not really thinking much about the situation until i got home and looked at a clock. i started to panic a little because it was just after 5 am. like i said the trip only takes 40 min max. around 5 hours were gone and the only logical answer was this skip. i believe in e.T. and this event just blew my mind because of the fact that if i was abducted, they seemed to pick me up and put me back all in motion on my pedal bike. ive never came across any kind of this information doing research. over the next year id say there were 2 other skips either walking or riding in that same area. they were not as noticeable as the first one or what i assume was the first. the second one i barely noticed and i'm not sure the time i left town, but i think there was an half hour to an hour missing. the third time i felt it wasnt even noticable. i just felt the same feeling and assuming. ive had a few significant paranormal events around that time in my life and the greatest one was on the same stretch of road. this is making me question the case of abduction. thats a different story. id like some feed back on this and see what the experts think. id like to say that i'm a very logical person and these event make me

of creatures in my neighborhood that go back about thirty years. these creatures appear to be tall, thin and to be wearing wetsuits, most likely without a mask. i first encountered one of these creatures in my backyard sometime between 1986 and 1988. i was home alone sick when i saw one through the slide door window looking out into my backyard. i panicked and it noticed me watching it. it also panicked then ran off into the neighbor's yard. i lost track of it after that. mostly because i was very young and scared. i also believe it was also raining that day. it is my belief that they used to get around the neighborhood in the daytime when most people are at work or in school. i believe they used the greener yards of the past for cover. as the neighborhood became arid and more sparse over the years they needed to find other methods for getting around. now they appear to run and jump from rooftop to rooftop late at night when most people are asleep. i, as well as some residents in my neighborhood, would like an investigation to be done. we are curious for some answers. \r\n\r\nthank you\r\nmichael
