my grandma’s farm in baltic, ct during the summer. my family would help on the farm and stay till late and then my mom would drive my sisters and me home. one night, she parked her car along my grandma’s long driveway about 17 yards away from the house and where there was no lighting, because my aunts and uncles had taken up the parking spaces closer to the house. just as she started the car a large circular flying aircraft flew from the direction where the mohegan sun country club is now and then stopped right above our car and just hovered, it seemed like forever. \r\nmy sisters and i never told anyone for fear they would call us crazy or just wouldn't believe us because of our age at the time, but are mom was the one who noticed it 1st as she seen it flying toward us and told us to get down on the floor so they don't see us, but as i crouched down i couldn't help to look. remember being scared and amazed at how huge it was and all the lights going around the edge of it. i honestly thought it was cool as i watched it. my mom looked terrified. i don't know how long exactly it lasted but it stayed there for quite some time. \r\ni am telling my story now, in hopes to see if anyone back then seen anything similar like us. given my age that would be between 1978-1979 \r\n(telling my age, lol) \r\nbut anyhow back to what happened. i didn't fall asleep but for the life of me i think we lost some time cus the next thing i remember was standing outside the car a little further down the driveway near my grandma’s barn going towards the woods and seeing a glowing whitish person walking towards me and then being back in my mom’s car and watching it fly off very fast in the direction towards downtown baltic like it was flying in a southeastern direction. i don't recall how i got out the car or getting back in to be honest or the length of time it all was but it felt like hours had gone by. and my family never wanted to talk about it.\r\ni have always wondered about the lost time but shrugged it off. questioning if what i remembered truly happened? but now i'm a little nervous seeing articles and videos where some people have under gone past life regression and had a similar experience of lost time and found out that they had been abducted. i'm not saying my life been peaches n cream but that would scare the life out of me to find that out. i'm undecided what to do. hopefully someone will see this post and has had a similar sighting.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned

there to hear mufon oc's guest speaker yvonne smith. ms. smith is the founder of an experiencer support group (cero) that she started in 1991. \r\n\r\nafter the lecture, a group of people who attended the event decided to grab a bite to eat. the group tried a few restaurants but due to circumstances beyond our control, my wife and i had to leave. it was close to 1am in the morning. we both had to work the next day including taking our children to school.\r\n\r\nwe jumped on the 73 toll road heading southbound. as we were approaching the jamboree road onramp/offramp, i thought i observed a grey alien or the outline of a grey alien with it's arms raised in the number 1 lane on the freeway. in the dash cam video included with this report, you will hear me exclaim at the 8 second mark \"what the heck is that in the road?!?!\" i felt foolish right afterwards so i decided not follow up with my wife. i believe i was thinking i must be really tired to have seen an alien standing in the highway with both arms raised in the air.\r\n\r\nafter that, my wife and i banter back and forth about me not liking onions (i haven't liked them since i was a little kid) and i am not a fan of mcdonalds either. we ended up at the drive-thru for a local mcdonalds before jumping on the toll road. \r\n\r\nas we started coming out of a bend near macarthur blvd. onramp/offramp (1 minute mark on video), i noticed a strange series of blinking lights hovering very low on the west side of the toll road. the lights blinked on/off in unison and were all red colored. there also was a smaller pair of blue/white lights that did not blink; just remained constantly lit. the red blinking lights, approximately 4-5 of them, seemed to hang down vertically. they reminded me of a string of xmas tree lights.\r\n\r\nthe lights then appeared to slowly move westward, hover, continue to move west and then descend. the object was moving very slowly. i was driving so i did not have a good view all the time as i had to keep the vehicle under control. my wife had a better view and was able to capture a small video on her samsung galaxy note 5 mobile phone. she actually thought the object was going to land. however, our views become obstructed due to a hill upgrade on the road and a wall that is parallel to the road. based on the dash cam video, the object appears to between macarthur blvd and bonita canyon drive; hovering right above a residential area too. \r\n\r\nat the 1:40 mark on the video, a strange fast moving object is observed travelling from south to north down the left side of my vehicle. both my wife and myself did not see this until we retrieved the video from our dash cam. it is right above the road and is moving extremely fast. it may be a bird or an insect but we are not sure.\r\n\r\nnow, i as i am driving i am thinking to myself i should exit and go check this thing out. but something compels me not too. in fact, i felt a strange sense of giddiness while all this was happening, like i was drunk or something, and to just keep on driving. when i heard my voice on the video, i realized something was not right with me. i just sound different other than my normal self when i speak; kind of lackadaisical. \r\n\r\ni am not saying this is an extraterrestrial aircraft but i can rule out a couple things. it's not a jet aircraft based on the flight characteristics i observed (unless it was a vtol and i highly doubt that). it could be a helicopter but i've never seen a helicopter with this type of navigation light configuration. in addition, john wayne airport ceases flight operations at 10pm for departures and 11pm arrivals (mon - sat). so if this is object is man made it was operating after the airport closes which would be in violation of the local noise

and what i did during/after the sighting. i believe i must have been on a break from school or it was a weekend, because this event occurred during the late morning. i should also mention that the weather was bright and sunny (i can't remember if there were any clouds or not).\r\n\r\nthe sighting occurred just outside my home. i was walking around my house, and had been walking from the kitchen area into the living room. there is a large window in the living room that looks out over a clearing where a small pond sits. i liked looking out at that part of the property, so i turned my head to look out at the pond. \r\n\r\njust to be clear, the clearing is about 125 ft across and is surrounded by trees on all sides, save for the side my house is on. the treeline is probably about 55 or 60 ft tall ( with some variation).\r\n\r\nwhen i looked out, i thought i had noticed something moving among the trees in the northern part of the clearing. i stopped and stared out towards it. \r\n\r\ni thought that it was a shiny, metallic balloon when i first saw it. it made no sound whatsoever- if i hadn't been walking by at that moment, i probably wouldn't have seen it. at first, it was hidden behind some trees, but it slowly started to come into better view out of the trees. i was viewing it at a distance of about 100 ft. it was fairly large, approximately 12 or 13 feet across, and about 4 feet tall. it hovered around 30 or 40 feet above the ground, and was slowly making its way south at a rate of about 2 or 3 mph. it was moving very slowly. the object itself looked like a flying saucer. i couldn't see the bottom of it, as it was almost parallel to my line of sight. the saucer had three 'steps' to it. the surface was totally featureless and looked like it was made out of a really shiny, reflective metal. i couldn't even tell if it was spinning or not- there were no features or markings on the object. the whole thing looked like it was cast from a single piece of metal, no seams or bolts. \r\n\r\nafter watching it for a few seconds, i got really excited. i had never seen a ufo before and wasn't really scared or anything, so i ran back into the kitchen to try to find a camera that is usually in a small storage cabinet. i couldn't find it... i started yelling for my mom to look out over the pond- and she could hear me. unfortunately, she was attending my brother, who needed vitamins, and told me she would be finished with him in a minute. not knowing what to do, i ran back to the living room and continued to watch it as it slowly made it's way south. i was not observing it for about 20 seconds. \r\n\r\ni've asked my mother about the event and she recalls me yelling to get her attention, but she did not actually look out over the pond to witness anything. \r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object when it started to reenter the treeline at the southern end of the clearing. i must've watched for another minute or two until i couldn't see it anymore. i didn't go outside to investigate further- the thought never crossed my mind.\r\n\r\ni have always been really curious about what had happened back then, and so i've finally come to the decision to make a report on this. \r\n\r\nwhile i did not check to see any effects on the vegetation as a kid, i should mention that the forest is quite thick near my house: any straight path that an object of that size would try to follow would be bound to intercept trees somewhere. i don't remember any trees moving or being touched/affected by the object as it made its path. \r\n\r\non the making of this report, i decided to look at the trees around where i thought the craft may have touched the trees... i couldn't find anything abnormal.\r\n","distance":"101-500

so i do.We are in the flight path of some aircraft heading into dayton international some miles away as well as traffic for wright patterson afb i see etc.I often watch as  used to fly when i could.\r\n     on 23 june 2016 i was outside looking at the stars and saw what i thought was an inbound aircraft as it had a red light on the right, to me appearing like a directional light.As a white light appeared to the left of the red one, i thought landing light immediately, but soon realized that it was not near bright enough.Now really focused on it, i noticed the flight path was appearing way to low . that's when it got really close and stopped.The white light moved slightly left,appeared to get stringy , then up and down it went. it is moving up and down rapidly making the actual shape hard to determine.\r\n    now i am hollering for my son to come and see.He gets out on the porch in time to see it make a straight line exit to the right speeding up as it went.I was trying desperately to get pictures or a video, but not being as young as i was once nor any good with this small phone,i dropped the ball,no pics. the neighbor guys were sitting in their car while this was going on almost over top of them.When they came upstairs i ran to the door and asked them if they saw that?In my zeal to explain, i told one of them to come onto the  porch.I start yappin' about what i just saw, and he says, \" you mean that there?  \" yep ,came back over from our right, flew straight and level, stopped  , reversed direction and looked like it was sort of leaving vapory string behind as it went. but the leading spot got almost laser red as it increased in speed.It was surreal.\r\n    so,forward to the night of july 2,2016. i am watching for sure now a lot. i see a few home fireworks rising and falling nothing to write home about. in the s w direction sits the old mound plant. they used to make nuclear triggers, now mostly things like thermo electric generators for  the cassini spacecraft etc. smart folks.\r\n    in the far distance i see red lights starting to form a shape as it goes from far left to the right. now they form into what an art student would call perspective lines, and begin to travel to a distant point as they disappear.There were some small white lights as well. having called my son to see them, he arrived after they had nearly disappeared and did not see them. just before he got there, i took a picture in the direction they fadded into ( 11:13 pm) . not impressed at this one, he went back onto his computer. a few minutes later ( 11:17 pm)i spot a white light closer and higher up, so i take a picture but it disappeared quickly and i did not figure i had gotten  anything. boy was i wrong. disappointed i was going over the pictures, i did see something.When showing them to my son and the image was green ,i told him when i saw it was white, which it was.So i went into the phones image place and began messing with the color.That is when i realized there were images in the other photo, but not the one i thought i was taking a photo of.The question kept going thru my mind that my son asked me,why is it green? after looking at the photo of the street i noticed that some of the light was green some not, why ?  then it came to me, some lights are incandescent some are mercury vapor. in the one photo, it may just be me, but i think i  see counter rotation happening. when i took the photo all i saw was a white light momentarily move quickly and to the right and out.I believe it captures a transformation of matter or light itself into a cloaking phase shift.\r\n   until next time, that's all i got...\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

my hobby. never have i caught anything out of the ordinary til this one week and caught alot weird things on differant days in this week, but sadly havent see anything since. this is the first day of that week and hope to capture more in the future. traveling west on padden parkway to the i-205 north ramp for about 2 miles. i like to take pictures of clouds kind of a hobby of mine. (i hope saying this doesnt get me in trouble) while driving i pulled my cell phone out to take pictures of the clouds not taking my eyes off the road snapping pictures randomly hoping at least one would come out good later when i checked them and did this despite my girlfriends protests but told her \"well im not texting or calling anyone so i dont think im technically breaking any laws\". when going through my photos had almost deleted them until my girlfriend asked me \"why arent you even gonna check them?\" had replied \"i dont know\" in kind of a daze or my mind running on autopilot. before i could hit the delete button my girlfriend looking at the screen shouted \"stop, dont do it. look, what is that\" snapping back to reality i hit cancel and clicked on the picture i hadnt even looked at yet she was pointing to. what i saw shocked me, made me freeze in horror, i still get goosebump and a bit anxious/ nervous/ scared im not really sure how to describe the feeling it gives me. i clearly remember or at least think i know i never saw this thing with my own eyes, or at least wasnt visible to my eyes. and before any nay saying pay closer attention, its not something on my window or camera lens. because this thing followed in front of my truck changed direction, altitude, angle, and distance getting closer to me. i cant identify what it is, what it could be neither could anyone else, i have never seen anything like this before, and asked a few family members if they could but no one has any idea other than an extremely weird shaped flying weed whacker. or long armed/ tailed floating thing. \r\nbelow this part it asks what kind of picture, i dont know really anything technology so i hope im doing this all correct these are the original pictures unaltered and non-tampered. also the best way to reach me is by phone, i havent been able to figure out how to get into my emails in years cause as i said im not good with tech. and maybe now i can finally get some answers about this, thingy.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":77523,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.6399281,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072016-0009","longitude":-122.6566461,"occurred":1464031860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1467897748000,"summary":"I think its a lifeform, invisible to the eye but visible in picture.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/77523_submitter_file1__1324366712249574875174397669865629941213860o.jpeg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/77523_submitter_file2__1323523312249575141841037928024296739129866o.jpeg"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":19,"maxtempi":67,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":16,"meantempi":60,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":12,"mintempi":53,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":19,"maxtempi":67,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":16,"meantempi":60,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":12,"mintempi":53,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"98662","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":44,"locationName":"Vancouver, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:72741"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Kokomo","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Witnessed object hovering in the distance. too far away to tell exact shape but got to see it move in different directions before flying away at a high speed to the west. in the video there are other objects that weren't noticed until viewing the video frame by frame. about 3 hours later i took a picture of the progress we made that day working on my barn and there is another object in this picture to the west of us above the tree line.

random grouping,appeared stationary.Took me 10 to 20 seconds to realize what i was seeing.I was driving in a 50 km zone no traffic near me,i slowed to about 10 to 15 km per hr watching the light orbs,about 30 seconds into sighting,%70 to %80 of the objects started moving to west ascending at a 5 to 10 degree angle from 1st observation,they moved what i would think to be about 1.5 miles then stop and hovered,other objects did not move from 1st sighting point.I pulled across highway and parked in mcdonalds parking lot,looking east the stationary group had 1 object with a regular pulsing that did not stop during entire observation,there were 6 to 8 other objects near to the blinking object that moved very little from the blinking object.The group of objects that moved are in a wnw direction from blinking object,the wnw group started moving and disappearing,some from the nwn group traveled fast enough to leave a light tail behind them and made 120 to 140 degree chanegs of direction and then disappeared,1 object from nwn group did not move and stayed stationary for about 10 minutes.At about 10 minutes into oberservation the east group and the object nwn moved towards a single point to the north fast enough to leave a light tail behind,the movement was very short and seemed to me to be an aggressive or threatening move!!!! after that there was not much movement but some objects very faint moved into view from time to time and some objects moved small distances slowly. close to the blinking object,100's of feet and slightly high,there was a dark object that had a different shape,kind of like a clingon battle cruiser!!!!! seems crazy,but it was there and looked that way!I ran out of time as i had someplace i needed to be and left. i took video,unfortunately after the nwn group had left! i realize now i should have took some stills! the object in the nwn group that did not leave blinked from time to time.The objects in the nwn group departed in what seemed random directions,they did not fly out of sight,they disappeared,i think mostly at the same time!","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sun would be at 4:00pm i think.It was stationary in the sky no blinking. it looked like two stars very close side by side.Very bright .I went inside my apartment and came back out at 2:oo am . now it was in the southwest sky and looked like it was farther, not as visible but had same shape. this happened every night except a couple nights that it wasn't visible,over a 2 week period.I tried binoculars and i thought it looked like a dragonfly shape and gold color. my glasses made them difficult to use, so i didn't try again.The night of july 4, this was the second time i saw more than one and 3 of them made a triangle in the southwest.Tonight, at midnight i could see one in the west, two in southwest and looked like one was moving from southwest to east. low enough now to hear it and see blinking red lights on it. i watched till it disappeared in a cloud but could still hear it. now it's 1:31 am and i don't see anything.Altogether, i've had 3 witnesses besides myself. my grandaughter, one neighbor and a local policeman. not all on the same night. i  tried to take a picture but it didn't appear in any of the 3 photos i took with my phone.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"04:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":77516,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.09239117837581,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072016-0002","longitude":-83.25592098176386,"occurred":1467754200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1467855811000,"summary":"
