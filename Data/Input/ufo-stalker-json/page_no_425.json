ignored it but when it happened a 2nd time and stayed floating in front of the window, i stood up and asked my colleague to come to the window.\r\nwhat we saw was a shiny, mercury colored object that looked to be in the shape of stingray. without the long tall but had a sort of domed shape in the middle. the odd part was that it moved around like a stingray would in the water, was held together but appeared to be in a liquid form.\r\nit moved slowly around the the window from west to east, the whole time staying at eye level with us. at times it would drop down but then slowly rise up to our eye level. the whole time we were about 5-10 feet away from this object. these were the windows facing south.\r\nthen it decided to move over to our east side windows, hovering as it did, without a sound, just like a mercury liquid sting ray.\r\nwe both lost track of the time but then all of a sudden, from a dead stop, the object moved from where we were to the mount saint-hilare bird sanctuary in about 1 or 2 seconds, a distance of 50 km. there was a cloud over the mount and we could see a shiny spec, which was about the size we could see it now, up straight into the clouds.\r\nthe odd part was is that my colleague and i never said a word to each other nor did we ever discuss what we had experienced at the office.\r\nafter the event, i went to my office to pick up my things and went

and decided to stop at the performing arts plaza to get a nice view of the bay and eat a snack. it was raining lightly and overcast, so looking from the plaza, the first thing that caught my eyes were the plumes on the horizon from a petroleum plant that operates a few miles northwest of my location. inside the plumes was a rectangle-shaped dark patch that was moving away from the mass of smoke. i watched it with curiosity for a few minutes because of the odd, dark shape, but discounted the object as a dense cloud of smoke that simply hadn't dispersed in the wind. after the object had cleared the smoke, it was an obvious rectangle shape, but i instead assumed it was a flight from vancouver or overseas, coming in for landing at the local international airport. i began eating and watching, noting the slowness with which the object moved across the sky. after 15 minutes, the object was lined up with the airport from my perspective and also began diminishing and returning from its black rectangular shape into a black square, similar to looking at a dead pixel on a computer screen. the rectangle would also slowly drift halfway to it's starting position and back again. my belief that this was an aircraft began wavering, so i turned the zoom to maximum on my phone camera and filmed a few (shoddy) shots of the object for posterity. after filming, i saw a jet take off from bellingham international airport and watched it transit the rectangle. the jet was almost as big as the object, but clearly closer to me, giving me the notion that this object was much larger than the jet. i continued waiting, watching two helicopters pass over the bay and one more jet taking off from the airport. i had expected to see the rectangle bank and land at the airport, considering that i may have misidentified an aircraft waiting for landing clearance, but instead, to my surprise i saw the object drift slightly westaward one last time, ascend a few more degrees away from the horizon and slowly vanish into the black 'pixel' shape, as though it's distance from me had significantly increased. the last i saw of it was a slow fade into obscurity among the clouds. during the majority of the sighting, i was convinced the object was a large distant aircraft, but in conclusion, all of its behaviors and drifting patterns defy explanation by myself.","distance":"Over One

feet across at widest top of craft. at the bottom was a light, too bright to look at, rotating throughout the sighting. \r\n\r\n\r\nfirstly i sighted a flashing light which was too brilliant to look at - about seven miles down a divided four-lane straight and level highway - no trees along highway except in the distance where craft first sighted. it was travelling toward me just over a very low power line along the highway. the power line it was over was, at the most, 50 feet from my car and built below the roadway in the ditch. when the craft passed me it would not have been more than twenty-five feet above me as it travelled only about twenty feet or less above the power line. it was travelling at a speed which was slightly faster than my car (60 mph) and the cars in oncoming lane. it came toward my vehicle at a steady rate over the power line, without wavering; although there was a wind of about 100+ mph that afternoon around 5 pm. (extreme strong winds are common in this area.) as the craft came closer, i could see the light at the bottom was rotating but too bright to look at. \r\n\r\ni watched the approximate ten minutes it took to travel along the road toward my vehicle. it passed me and continued down the highway over the power line until i lost sight in my rearview mirror. it made absolutely no sound.\r\n\r\ni watched for sighting reports in our local paper and on tv that evening and next day as the highway was very busy with after work traffic. i never saw a report of any kind which left me stunned. i, also, did not report the sighting to anyone as i had my newborn daughter in the car next to me and felt someone else would report as many, many people had to have seen what i saw - close up in the early summer afternoon!\r\n\r\ni watched the craft intently making note of the size very carefully and searched the red craft for any sign of doors/windows. the exterior appeared to be solid with no cracks for a door or window. a smaller man would have been able to sit inside but a tall man would not have been able to stand erect.","distance":"21-100

there were several things that didn't make sense, if it was a helicopter... first the lights did not blink (this is against faa regulations).  second, if it was a helicopter looking for something, it was at night, no lights were emitted from it, and it was way too high in the air to spot anything on the ground with out the use of spot lights.  so i believe it was a ufo emitting the sound of a helicopter.  so i proceeded to take multiple videos of the object.  as i am doing so, i realize there are literally hundreds of lights that appear and disappear around this main green and red light.

town and was at my neighbor’s house enjoying the fireworks around the valley.  at 10:37 pm, a bright light, white in color, caught my attention overhead.  the sky was clear with possibly a very thin overcast and stars clearly shining through and no moon.  my first thought was it might be fireworks but there was no “trail” and explosion and it was way too high.  \r\n\r\nthe object was about as bright as venus at its brightest and several times larger.  it moved slowly from due south to north covering approximately 20 degrees of arc.  next i thought it might a satellite or the iss but unless they changed its orbit, the iss doesn’t fly a polar orbit.  this was definitely a polar orbital flight path.  what makes me think there was a thin overcast is the light “plumed”.  the object itself got very bright and a “halo” effect surrounded it opening to about 1 degree or a little more than the diameter of a full moon would appear on the horizon.  the halo looked like it might be the exhaust of a rocket going away from me and after perhaps 10 – 15 seconds the object dimmed to a star point and disappeared.  \r\n\r\nas for its location in the sky, it traversed roughly 15 – 20 degrees of arc 3 – 5 degrees west of celestial zenith and 5 south of zenith to about 15 degrees north of zenith.\r\n\r\ni tried finding information about any nasa launches but nothing came up for this timeframe.  i googled “space launches july 4 2016” but nothing showed.  might this have been a vehicle launch into a higher orbit or something else along that line?   what i do know is it was definitely not a meteor, comet, fireball or the infamous “swamp gas” of michigan.  there was no sound except from people around the valley firing off fireworks and by that hour only a few people were doing so anyway.  please let me know what you figure out.  i am curious as to what we saw.  i might have to invest in a “smart phone” because taking video with my “dumb phone” takes too many steps and i didn’t want to miss observing this thing; whatever it was.\r\n\r\non a personal note, i am retired air force and an air force navigator/electronic warfare officer as well as a private pilot.  i am also an amateur astronomer.  \r\n\r\nthank you\r\ncapt. gene leone (ret) usaf\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

to see who it was thinking it was a car pulling in. i didnt know this persons house well so it didnt strike me until after that the position on the driveway theres no way the lights could have been facing our direction. so i looked out the window and the light got really bright. thats the last thing i remember before i remember sitting on a diffrent part of the couch (it was a sectional) and asking another friend aside of me what happend. he just said its okay your fine. almost like he was trying to calm me down for being upset over nothing. like you would talk to a comfort a child when their lollypop drops in the dirt and its the end of the world for the child but your cool and collected. i couldnt figure out why noone was feeling the anxiaty and confusion i was. i remember looking at the t.V. and seeing the credits down the screen. and just being very overwhelmed. noone talked about these lights or what i felt just happend at all. like nothing happend. again adding to my confussion. i instantly felt isolated, and honestly a little crazy. this happend about 11 years ago. ive told one person. its not something i talk about with people but in my head i feel like ive kinda become obsessed trying to logically explain what happend that night. ever since my attention has been drawn to the skies. i find myself always looking up, i just cant explain it.

they follow.\r\n \r\nhowever today at approx 12:30pm we heard this really weird humming noise in the sky almost like electro static energy or a sub station would make, and we look out over the see and saw this weird looking triangle shaped aircraft or craft (see attached images). it was moving really slowly about 5-10mph about 200m off the coast like just to the south of tywyn off the beach moving in a northern direction. i was walkign my dogs in the sand dunes at the time. now i am ex raf and i have a very good knowledg of all military aircraft but i have never seen anything like this. it was no drone or uav and was the size of a raf typhoon fighter jet. as it moved up the coast line it dropped two bright red coloured glowing spheres down into the sea and they disappeared. i quikcly got this shot on my iphone of the thing as it moved off and just after i took this image, it stopped in mid air, moved upwards and then just disappeared. i called the coastguard but they said nothing unusual had been reported.\r\n \r\ni think this was a ufo because it was certainly nothing we are the americans have in terms of military technology or aircraft. it was intelligently controlled almost in an over the top way.\r\n \r\nmy wife and i saw this as well as two other dog walkers one of which called the local police to report it.\r\n \r\ncan you report on this as i definately thing this is

there was a cloudless sky. we were all spread out on the street, i was facing west, 2 of my friends both looking south and one facing west. the one facing west experienced a bright light that he thought was a car which caused him to turn around. the two facing south had the best view of the ufo and i'll try my best to describe what i did not see based off of them. i'm someone who is constantly star gazing night sky, but at this moment i was facing the opposite direction of the ufo and looking 'down' at my dog. i few moments before this occurred i was thinking about an encounter story i had watched on tv; a group of friends had been paralyzed by a extremely bright blue light. i have no explanation why i did this; i saw no light behind me nor hear anything. my friends were all silent as i rolled my head back towards to se. i didn't even look at my friends just directly to the object. it was a large circular orb that was heading towards ew i believe. the tail of it was extremely vivid and long. it was mainly white/blue but there were yellowish sparks coming of the tail. i was the only one that heard a very slight swooshing/humming sound yet i was farthest from it. my boyfriend saw the most of it and he said it moved slowly across the sky then shot off. he wasn't going to say anything because he didn't think anyone else saw it. at i first thought it was a firework but it was way to large to be a firework. my dog didn't even flinch when it occurred. we had so many conversations about space and aliens leading up to this effect and thats what really freaked me out. it was defiantly something i'll never forget.

appendages. it was a simple cigar shape, but at least the length of a football field. it was perfectly camouflaged to blend in with the night sky. i was only able to see it due to the slight shift in depth perception around the craft, since it was only traveling at a height just above the treetops. as it appeared from the south, i observed 3 white lights on the craft in the shape of a large isosceles triangle. once the original triangle was centered above me, a second set of 3 red lights appeared within the white triangle to form its own smaller isosceles triangle. it continued north in
