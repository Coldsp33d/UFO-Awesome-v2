back in the north east and this time there could be no doubt there was something unusual about it. it started to flash on and off at a very regular interval but between flashes it changed positions in a random pattern with the distances between locations varying wildly. some moves were far enough to seem impossible. this activity continued for about 8 to 10 minutes then quite suddenly two very bright lights came on, no more fuzziness, no more blinking and i could see a semblance of the rear structure of the craft as it moved very fast off to the south east until it vanished over the lake

an older, 1 bedroom house in the middle of nowhere outside sarcoxie night before last. neither of us has ever spent the night there before and the house isn't particularly nice, or clean and has the portable kind of air conditioner with 2 large hoses that you have to wedge in the window. we had moved it to the bedroom and at 3 a.M., very bright lights came in through the area where the curtain was pulled up and to the side because of the a.C. hoses. it lit up a straight line, going up until reaching the ceiling, about a foot thick. this continued, line after line, almost like the lights under a scanner. when we looked out the corner, the lights were so large and bright, it almost looked and sounded like some type of large farm machinery, and there are 2 big fields behind and beside the house. on the right side there is type of metal barn, then the tree line begins. it would be near impossible to even fit something like that next to the house, much less turn to go to the back. after several minutes after \"scanning\" the entire room, it moved to each room in the house, doing the same thing, but not in the front, which faces the highway. this was during a thunderstorm and the rain quit above the house the whole time this went on, which was for 2 hours. the thunder and lightning never stopped and the thunder was louder than any i've ever heard. almost immediately after it left, the rain returned. last night, i had a similar experience that i would be more than happy to explain over the phone. it was not a drone or  farm equipment. the closest neighbors didn't see it, so i'm thankful my friend did, or i might worry i'm going crazy. i don't know what to do or who to call, but i am absolutely terrified. please contact me as soon as possible, at any time.\" \r\nthe event occurred at 3 a.M. to 5 a.M. in the early morning hours of july 3, 2016\r\nasd contacted the witness by phone today and obtained further information. the witness went back to the house with her boyfriend the next night (actually later the same night july 3) and again the lights appeared but at the earlier time of 10:30 p.M. and the witness was afraid and called her parents to come pick her up immediately. the witness and her boyfriend searched the exterior grounds and house but found no evidence of a landing or damages to vegetation. further information will be in my report.

sky off to our right at about 9pm. they formed a triangle - the brightest was the one to the left. around half an hour later we noticed that they hadn't moved at all (in relation to each other - or in relation to their position to us it seemed, despite the fact that we were moving at speed along the interstate).\r\n\r\nwe first noticed the lights as they were very bright in the sky - they were eye catching - then we kept noticing them as they weren't appearing to move. we didn't know what they were at all; they didn't look like anything we'd seen before - they didn't look like natural lights and they were too high up but they were unsupported, so we assumed they must be a plane or helicopter, but they hadn't moved at all. \r\n\r\ni had my camera with me (we were on holiday in america from the uk so it was constantly out in case of cool roadsigns and bumper stickers!) and it has a fairly good zoom so i tried taking some pictures of the lights but i couldn't get a perfect shot of them because of the movement of the car.\r\n\r\nwe were joking that it might be aliens as i was zooming in, purely because they were so stationary it didn't seem right or normal, but when i got a better look at the zoomed photo i got a shiver and i didn't feel like we were joking anymore as we actually couldn't think what else they could be. that sounds daft/stupid but i started shaking with an adrenaline for some reason. i felt like i shouldn't be looking at it, and my partner said she felt the same. it looked like they had flames or trails coming from them.\r\n\r\nwe were going to pull over at the next opportunity so i could get a better photo but before we could come off, the two less bright lights seemed to blink off and the last and brightest one shot straight up into the air at a speed i've never seen before and disappeared. it went so quickly i couldn't get a photo of it or really even have time to tell my partner what was going on. \r\n\r\n(i feel like i should point out that when we got home from our holiday and i started looking into this i've found that there are military bases and things nearby and my partner has pointed out that it could have been a plane or something from one of them, but at the time we both totally didn't think the lights were planes. however, i am uploading photos and am happy to be told that i was overreacting to what i saw if you can confirm it was a plane! thank you!)","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

around\r\n10:30 pm. the weather was rainy; the cloud cover went from horizon to horizon. i was\r\nable to see the type of cloud cover from the ufo appearing out of no ware under the cloud.\r\nno sound, just a huge white circle of light at least two football fields across.\r\nit was so bright looked like a giant light bulb. the light it gave off was enough for me \r\nto see that the cloud cover looked like a black quilted blanket. this month was the first\r\ntime ever it rained every day in dallas and fort worth, this was history making.\r\n\r\ni stood there looking at it thinking i am getting ready to see what no one else has\r\never seen. it was going to come by me very close. i was going to be able to see the\r\nfront and back. i was able to see it for around 5seconds then the light it went off,\r\njust like turning off a light bulb with a switch. i was so aggrieved, i then turned and\r\nwent back towards my camera as i was walking i looked down and saw a light on the\r\nground in front of me. holey! i realized they saw me. i left my head light on which\r\nwas on top of my cap. i was even then more aggrieved at myself. i myself away!\r\n\r\nonce i got to my camera i then said—listen to this: ok you owe me for what you\r\ndid two nights ago. i know you brought in the clouds so i could not see the moon. i know\r\nyou did it. so how about it let me see the moon? what would it hurt? you owe me.\r\nyou know and i know nobody will believe me you know it. so how about it?\r\nthe next thing the cloud cover started opening up in a circle pattern direction.\r\ni then said okok i need four minutes no give me five minutes ok? i then took my camera\r\nand started looking at the moon. i taped the moon, when i was done i said ok i am\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nthen i then turned walked toward my van sliding door was open, sat down next thing\r\ni stood up yield out and said ok how about it again? i looked at my watch it now\r\nwas right at 4 o’clock, i realized it was time for me to go. to miss the traffic.\r\ni know some time was lost, i know it. something happened to me.\r\ni am a very polite person. why didn’t i say something or ask a question? i just saw the cloud cover\r\nopen up. i saw nothing up near the cloud, nothing. but something was making it happen.\r\nit was invisible, something was there, made it happen. \r\n\r\nso what kind of contact was this? i wish i could be hypnotized. i think about this so often.\r\ni can see the huge ball of light when i close my eyes and wide open. i know i am very\r\nlucky to have been able to see that ufo very lucky. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

Springs","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"   because of the vantage point of our buildings patio deck just outside of our apartment we step outside every year to watch fireworks displays from memorial park, the broadmore, and anywhere else that we can observe fireworks going off...The patio is on the west end of the building and only has a few trees to the west that do slightly hinder our view of pikes peak while in bloom...While watching the fireworks this year, my wife had been watching the sky as we had a few high clouds to the north of us that had produced some lightning...While doing so she had noticed a very bright green light above and slightly west of us and knowing i had spent 8 years in the us navy working in the aviation field and having been involved with aviation all of my life, 3 uncles that served in the us navy and also in the aviation field with 2 of them retiring from the navy as well as my father that spent 20+ years in the us air force, she felt confident that i may be able identify what it was that she was looking at since it was so high above us yet very bright...When i had first looked at it i knew it wasn't a star because of the very bright green lights and the relative distance it was from us...Knowing that aircraft have red and green clearance lights on them i had first identified it as an aircraft but i also had lost interest in the fireworks displays and looked the lights over a bit closer and upon doing so it struck me that there were no red lights visible, just the very bright green lights with a blue edge on just one side...Looking even better at it, it appeared to be 4 green lights in a square pattern and on the one side there was a dimmer blue light on one edge...There was nothing else visible other than the lights..\r\n\r\n   after a short period of looking at the lights i changed my previous statement to my wife and told her that i wasn't sure what it was we were looking at...I had also noted that it had not changed position for some time and having lived here in the 'springs' from '69-'71, '87-'91, and for the last time since '95, as well as being around military aircraft for my entire lifetime and observing aircraft behavior, i knew that what this thing was doing was not typical...I leaned up against a pipe alongside of the building to steady myself and put my thumb up directly under the light in an attempt to get a fix on the light and see for sure if indeed the light was moving...After doing so the light dropped behind my thumb then came out of the left side of my thumb, made a horse shoe maneuver, went behind my thumb and then came out of the right side of my thumb and began hovering steadily in a fixed position...After a period of a few seconds it began a series of maneuvers and then shot directly north of us towards denver and by my best estimation had to have been traveling at least mach 3 with no sonic boom from breaking the sound barrier...One of the things you experience when you've been around military aircraft for as long as i have is a sonic boom when aircraft fly as fast as this thing did...No boom was experienced which was, to say the least, a little unsettling when you see something move that fast...\r\n\r\n   there were at least 4 witnesses to this event, three of us are over fifty and the fourth being in his twenties...We joked about what we had seen and shared the fact that this was our first such experience and how we would probably only tell people we trusted not to put us into a straight jacket and padded cell but i have always been an inquisitive individual and i have known about mufon for quite some time now, i have just never dreamed of the fact that i would have my own story to share and now, more than ever, i would like an explanation as to just what in the world it was that i and 3 others saw tonight...I can definitively say that it was far beyond anything in our aircraft inventory...Unless we have advanced so far as to have developed an aircraft with the capabilities and behavior that this one demonstrated tonight in which case our adversaries should beware...\r\n\r\n   the light or lights went so far north that we eventually lost sight of them but before we had lost sight of them entirely, it had gotten behind some trees and yet oddly enough were still visible through the trees...Having memorial hospital to the north of us and observing their flight for life helicopters disappear behind the same trees for some 13 years now, it was strange to be able to see the lights so clearly visible through the same trees...\r\n\r\n   after having discussed for some time with my wife about what we had seen i felt the need to call the news desk at kktv 11 and ask if they had received any calls about a strange object over colorado springs...The woman i talked with at kktv said that they had not received any calls and after some reflection about the nights events that's when i remembered your organization, mufon, and decided to check to see if there were any reports from our area of which i found none...It's still early after the fact however so i'll be bookmarking this site and checking back regularly...\r\n\r\n   i hope i've been concise enough and descriptive enough for you to have an idea of the events that have taken place here even though i know that none of us have the answers as to what these objects are, maybe some day we'll have the answers but for now it remains a mystery...This is like a puzzle and until the last piece is in place we won't have any idea as to what the picture is until then...I wished i had pictures or video but i felt that i would not have time to go back into our apartment, find our camera and make it back in time to document the event...\r\n\r\n   event duration was approximately 3-5 minutes...Approximate altitude of object was 2-3,000 ft. overhead and about 80-85 degrees west of us...Approximate size of object was at least 100 ft. from side to side, at least the size of a p3 orion, if not larger...Capable of speeds in excess of mach 3 to the best of my judgment...Very bright green light, or possibly four very bright green lights with only one side of what appeared to be a square object emitting a blue light...Lights were steady with no flickering and no atmospheric disturbances...This was definitely not an atmospheric event, swamp gas, green laser nor anything of the sort...This was an object that moved through the sky and demonstrated very unusual characteristics not found in our current aviation technology or capabilities...As far as i know...It's up to you to decide if this is worth investigating...I hope you do because i have a ton of questions now and i would probably ask as many questions as any of your investigators would or could even armed with the knowledge that you probably don't know any more than i do...In any case please contact me and reaffirm my belief that i'm not crazy because this has really rattled my cage...\r\n\r\n   thank you for being there mufon and letting us know that there are truly extraordinary events that occur and that you believe it's worth investigating...It's a shame nasa get's all that money and doesn't seem to have the same belief system that you do...Seti program seems to have taken a very big hit as well...If you put everything together it almost seems that there is an attempt to bury the fact that there is something going on...I've seen the milky way without a telescope and there is no way you can tell me we're

in the back of my mind i  had 2 questions ....1) the size of the bright light seemed to be allot larger then a full moon...& .. 2) i do not ever remember the moon being in that location. i didn't want to leave but i thought i would go inside to get my spouse as a witness as well as check my my \" skyview app \" on my phone to see where the moon was tonight. to my astonishment the moon was not even out tonight!! it is suppose to rise at 7:20 am!! and no.... there was no noise at all. it was not a helicopter or a plane.With the wind not blowing at all i could hear everything. \r\ni am an avid skywatcher and have seen many amazing things in my life but i have never written about them. i felt compelled to write about this because of it's size. although i only witnessed this for a moment i know this was something amazing.This was huge. it was like a huge orb in the sky behind the clouds. i only wish i would have had my camera to take a picture of it!! i am so energized right now i cannot even sleep!!\r\n this is my second sighting in a month. on june 7,2016 i also witnessed 2 small orbs in our winnipeg skies. they moved like they were dancing in the sky without any limitations!!They were directly north at about 2:15pm. maybe i will take the time to write about those next.Thank you for having a forum to allow us to write of our experiences.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":77464,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.88836389999999,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07052016-0013","longitude":-97.11310859999999,"occurred":1467676800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Manitoba","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1467687695000,"summary":"Very large bright white glowing circular object larger then a full moon behind low lying clouds","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"r2h 2z4","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Winnipeg, Manitoba","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:72861"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"North Las Vegas","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"4-5 objecs appeared over the west horizon moving north east.Over mt.Charleston roughly heading towards area 51. the craft were equally spaced out. about 2- miles apart from each other. i'm a student pilot and can  actually is judge distance between aircraft. all air fast promptly change direction dye north and illumination ceased with lose of, all sight  direct line of sight ceased at this time, approximately coinciding with the sunset and reflections possibly reflecting upon the fuselage of object. check flights on flightradar24, nothing listed....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":77463,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.256878100192004,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052016-0012","longitude":-115.21372157791554,"occurred":1467670680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1467686400000,"summary":"4-5 orange-red solid light objects with change of direction","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"89031","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"North Las Vegas, Nevada","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:72862"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Ventura","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was not going to report this but but now i feel comfortable coming forward since mufon did contact me about my last report.\r\n\r\nthere was no craft involved in this encounter. i was laying down on the couch one night watching tv when what felt like a small hand touched me around the right rib cage area for a second. i did not see anything at all. the hairs on my neck went straight up. i grabbed a shotgun and loaded it. saw absolutely nothing whatsoever. \r\n\r\nmoved out of ventura county. now in riverside county for over a year. about 7 months ago was shopping at a grocery store and the exact same encounter took place. same small size hand touched me in exactly the same place. this time i did not freak out i was somewhat used to it.\r\n\r\nnow if this does not get your attention, this will. my friend from high school who i sometimes talk to on facebook or on the phone, recently has had similar encounters recently from just simply communicating with me on the phone or over the internet. \r\n\r\nam i on some kind of watch list? is it possible i have already been abducted and not know it? is my friend not a target because of me? am i being watched?????

moved between flashes was sometimes really long and sometimes really short, as if it was skipping through the sky sometimes to the left and sometimes to the right. it moved from about 80 degrees south

as i frequently do. i caught site of the object about 15 deg. above the horizon due west on my location. it took only a few seconds to realize it was moving toward me. i then pointed it out to my travel companion, max. we watched it come closer as it flew about the same speed that the coastguard helicopter, with which i'm familiar, would travel. but, this object was absolutely quiet.\r\ni wanted to run into the house to get my camera but feared i would be gone before i got back out. so, i just stood there with my eyes locked on it. \r\nit flew past us, constant speed and in a straight line. we watched for 1.5 to 2 minutes. then with my eyes still fixed on this object, it went from full brightness, dimmed and vanished in about a 3 second period. a vehicle, externally lit, would leave a visible fuselage. but there was nothing, totally gone.\r\nseveral weeks later, i found on you tube a picture from somewhere else of exactly what i saw.\r\nthis is conformation to me that these unusual flying objects do exist.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
