the crowd was thinning out. the boats had all come back in. it was time for me to go fishing. i live on long island sound. i fish every night from april to january. if it happens in the night sky i see it! every moon. every meteor shower. every fireworks display. i was sitting at my usual spot facing the water. two friends were standing up facing me with their backs to the water. i looked up to engage one friend in conversation. over her left shoulder i saw a rather large slow moving oval shaped craft. it was illuminated white. it was blurred because it was flying in low cloud cover or possibly smoke hanging in the air from the fireworks. i watched it for about 10 seconds before it faded away into the cloud or smoke. it travelled slow and would have been following the shoreline heading south. as i'm watching this thing i'm going through the rolodex in my brain sorting through memories and experiences and what i know already. airplanes and helicopters have clear projected lights as well as red blinking lights. they also create sound. this was illuminated white and silent. i even thought of someone shining a spotlight into the sky. but the light would reflect off the cloud or smoke. none of that either. i've been here 25 years and no plane or helicopter has ever flown this bearing barring search and rescue. there was no search and rescue that night. i eliminated everything i thought it could be based on my experiences. what i am left with is actually a white walnut shaped slow and low moving craft over the shoreline of black rock harbor. has anyone else

seems to get bigger in sky it can maneuver incredible it seems to go out of atmosphere and flys low and slow like it hovers.It also changes from the gold or no lights to lights simular to planes red white and blue. i seen it 4 nights so far and once it was traveling about 10 or 20 mph just above the tree tops. when it got broadside to us it appeared to have some sort of force field shield that domed way around something dark with dome lit up. once in horizon large wings became visable  out past dome or at least appeared but that was june 30 when it flew real low and close to us. in my opinion  it's a govt ship. it goes on a similar flight plan every night and has been seen before dark. i'm going to be out watching tonight to see it again mufon is welcome here to see it. call

3'rd 2016 at about 9:30 p.M. when we saw just south of us by the angeles crest forest in acton,california, a very bright white light growing in intensity and then dimming.  my husband saw it first and called me out excitedly to see it.  we scrambled around for our video recorders but batteries were dead!, our phones did not pick up anything.  we did manage to take some long exposure pictures with our manual camera which do not show the shape but captures the movement patterns as well as the intensity of the light.  here, in acton we are away from most of the city lights so it appeared very obvious to us. no shape was apparent until my husband viewed it through his infrared night vision scope...Then we saw it was a saturn-shaped craft that appeared translucent with tentacle-like 'legs' similar to a jellyfish which moved directionally as the craft did..But this was hard to see.  it's surface appeared dull lead grey but also cloud-like at times.  there were 3 round lights on the craft that he saw in his binoculars when it was closer. it started out about 500 ft. or so? from us, lower than any plane would fly but then moved higher and farther away reaching up to an airplane's height. it had no direction or path, it never traveled linear, instead it was bouncing around in a smaller area of the sky ..Up, down, sideways, circular, hovering..All while this intense white light grew larger and brighter, then slowly died down to a single dot, just like a star over and over again.  2 shooting stars appeared around it during this 20 or so minutes we observed it.
