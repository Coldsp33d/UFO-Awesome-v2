was set off across a bay at the victoria beach pier which is about a good half mile away from out viewing area called redwing park. about 5 minutes into the display,i noticed a red starlike object behind the fireworks over lake winnipeg.At first i thought it was part of the show but it was constant. knowing my planets and stars i thought it looked out of place being so red and about 25 degrees above the lake due west.As i kept observing the object,i noticed that it began moving up and down several degrees.It continued to do this every few minutes until the show ended at 11 pm.\r\nat that moment i called my wife over to witness the object.\r\nshortly after the display ended,the object began to approach the area where the fireworks were being set off. it then stopped and made a sharp right turn heading north for a short distance(5-10 seconds). it then changed directions again and headed west back over lake winnipeg until we could no longer see it due to the trees.As stated i know my planets.Jupiter was just off to the left of the fireworks at about 30 degrees and mars and saturn much further to the south and east.\r\nthe altitude of the object was hard to judge but it was lower than the cirrus clouds. i estimate about 5 000 feet.\r\ni was amazed with what i was seeing. it completely took my attention away from the fireworks. the strange thing was that at least 40 other people were there. i felt like saying something but because i didn't know anybody i was hesitant to comment especially since they were enjoying the fireworks. that is why i had to get my wife's attention(she had left before me so she too was standing amongst strangers).\r\nit is unfortunate that as we stayed to observe,everyone had already departed.\r\nthat is when things got very weird.I am surprised that nobody else has reported this. there were probably hundreds of people out that night at various locations along the east shores of lake winnipeg taking in canada day fireworks.\r\nwonder if it could have been a drone???\r\nps-i don't own a phone and my wife said it wouldn't have come out looking like much on hers.","distance":"Over One

instructor made us all stand at attention, holding our horns up and not moving or talking at all, for a very long time. during this time, our instructor was walking back and forth, yelling at us and making sure we were all in line. i wasn't a fan of this particular instructor, who only came once every few months or so, and my enthusiasm was low. getting bored, i began to look around. at some point i became aware of what seemed to be a group of balloons, but at first i only caught glimpses as our instructor was being particularly harsh, singling out me and several others. when he turned his attention to someone else, i looked again to see, very clearly, that these were not balloons, but metallic discs. it was a large group of them - from what i can remember it looked to be anywhere from 20-30. it was very sunny, and the surfaces of these objects were silvery and reflective furthermore, their motions didn't match the motion of the wind, like a group of balloons would, but rather resembled the motion of a flock of birds. they changed directions rapidly  and constantly changed elevation, moving up and down in smooth motions. eventually, i had to turn my attention back to my instructor and when i got the chance to look again they were gone. i would have taken a photo had i not been standing at attention for the entire duration of the sighting. i told my mother and she didn't believe me, but the next day i asked an acquaintance of mine, who was standing next to me when i saw it, if he had seen anything, and he told me that he had but that he had no idea of what it could have possibly been. i told my mother this, and she still seemed somewhat skeptical. however, about 2 days later, she was driving in a nearby area and saw something strange, and when she described it to me it matched what i had seen. we were confused and maybe a little bit uneasy about what it could have been, but we soon forgot about it, dismissing it as an unsolvable mystery. it still comes up occasionally in conversation, and, having recently become interested in ufo phenomena, i thought that i should report it.","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 10 p.M. july 2, 2016, i was traveling due west on my motorcycle on highway 70, approximately 1/2 of a mile past the junction of 70 and 128. the night was warm, weather was dry and clear with very good visibility. the road was three lanes wide with approx. forty yards from tree line to tree line. tree height is 30 to 40 feet.\r\n i first noticed flashing lights just entering my view above the tree line to the north of my line of sight. the object appeared to be traveling diagonally across my line of sight to the southwest. it appeared to be at approx. 60 to 70 degrees above the ground. at first i thought it was a low flying small aircraft. however i quickly realized the “navigation lights” were unlike anything i had ever seen on any aircraft. my next thought was that due to its apparent low speed and height (my impression) that it could be a blimp. however it didn’t have a traditional navigation light pattern. \r\nhere is my description of the object i saw: it had a flashing white light at the back with a second flashing white light slightly below the first. a row of sequentially strobing white light along the (what i took to be) underside with a single red light at the front. above the bottom lights was a single row of six, square, hard edged “windows” that emitted a bright white light. this all seemed to be attached to a solid structure of a light blue/gray/silver color. i could not see any other hard edges, however i got the impression that the “windows” or “light panels” were attached to a “v” shaped “hull”. i could only see the side facing me but it seem that there was a glow from where the other side would be, so one might assume that it was symmetrical. once or twice when the uppermost rear light flashed, i thought i saw some structure above the light, but i am unsure of that. there were no other lights above the “windows” or anywhere else other than the one i describe.\r\n i would like to describe the lights and the order in which they flashed. the first light in the sequence was the uppermost rear white light followed by the lower rear white light (these two were the largest and brightest of the flashing lights). the two rear lights seem to have a longest duration and gap between them. after the lower light flashed, a row of eight to ten, sequentially flashing white light flashed from the rear lower large light to the front (direction of travel). these lights were fast (maybe a half second, rear to front), smaller and less intense than the two rear most lights. at the end of this sequence, at the front most point, the last light to flash was red. after a short (half second) pause, the pattern would repeat. the “windows” or “light panels” maintained a steady bright glow. the light was a very bright white with a blueish tinge. they appeared to be the same size and distance apart, taking up approx. 1/3 of the visible structure.\r\nthe object stayed in view for approx. one minute before its travel and the height of the surrounding trees blocked my view. the road turned more southerly and i re acquired the object in my view for approx. 10 to 20 seconds and then intermittently through the trees for a short while. it appeared to stay on the same course and height for as long as i had it in my view. \r\nif i extended my arm and turned my hand horizontal, i could have covered the object with my thumb, from the tip to midway past the first joint. this is an approximation as i was not able to do this at the time.\r\nmy only feelings were of curiosity as to what the object was. \r\nsome information on myself and that evening. i was clearheaded, i had not consumed any drugs or alcohol. i don’t do drugs legal or otherwise (i’m allergic to most narcotic pain killers), i am not on any psychotropic medications (nor do i have reason to believe i should be) and rarely drink.\r\n my only thoughts at the time i first saw the object were of getting home and enjoying the ride as the evening cooled off. i live in a relatively high aircraft traffic zone and have seen navigation lights from all angles, heights and on many types of aircraft. i have seen drones of various sizes. i have seen blimps in daytime and i have seen them at night at sporting events, however i have never seen one operating at night in a rural area. the object i saw falls outside of my personal experience, and searching online i was unable to find any aircraft with lights of this type, including blimps and the virgin lightships. i am a rationalist and a firm believer in occam’s razor. i enjoy debunking other people’s misidentifications and wild conclusions. i would be quite happy to have you identify this as a blimp, if, in fact that’s what this was.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

direction of view. right at the 12 o'clock position relative to where i was standing. \r\n\r\ninitially i dismissed it as a plane but it piqued my interest after i immediately realized there were no navigational lights and the second observed flash was at a distance that, to me, could not have been covered in such a short time by a commercial airliner. it was a flashing beacon of light with no other observable characteristics. plain white, not exceptionally bright. no noticeable sound, but it could have been washed out by the noise of the nearby freeway. \r\n\r\nsighting duration was too short to say for certain there was a pattern. in total 5 flashes were observed. 3 of them were evenly spaced over time. there was a short period where i'd have expected another flash as it would have happened if it were purely sequential. the flash resumed after this with the same rhythm until i lost it behind the trees obscuring my view.\r\n\r\nmy guesses at prosaic explanations have fallen short of my observation, however it may still have a prosaic origin. based on my past observations, it was far too fast to be a satellite flaring in the sunlight. it was certainly too fast to be an airliner unless it was in relatively close proximity. the lack of navigational lights and sound indicates it was, at the very least, non-commercial. military craft or hobbyist's quadcopter cannot be

school in saint lambert, quebec, with my mother and sister. very little light pollution at night, which is why i was there planet gazing with my 127mm reflector telescope. we all saw exactly what i'm about to describe. the object silently glided out of a  west-south-westerly direction when i noticed it, and was travelling in a perfectly straight line on an east-north-east bearing. i could not get a fix on it with my telescope due to using an equatorial mount unsuited for following near or fast moving objects. the object itself looked like a satellite with two parrellel solar panels connected at one end to a main block.  i say they looked like solar panels because they had a black surface with a bronzey graph layout on them. the overall shape was a lot like a y-wing from star wars. but this thing was way too close to have been a satellite; i could see the light from my iphone reflecting off its surface, so it had to have been low. it flew directly over my head, and at that apparent altitude i would say it wasn't moving fast than 30 km/h. speed and direction were both constant, but orientation was constantly and slowly changing in an unpredictable way. it turned in such a way on at least two axes, in no apparent order. the direction of these rotations were changing of their own accord. it was very visibly reflecting light as it rotated to face various directions, although it was totally unclear where the front or back of this craft could be. suffice to say it really reminded me of a satellite as one would appear if it were that close. the best explanation i could come up with was that it could be a box kite from which the string had been cut, but that did not account for the way it was moving at all, or how far it moved seeing as it kept its heading and disappeared over the horizon. also, the winds here were at an average of only 12km/h at the time, which barely registered as a breeze for me on the ground. definitely not the kind of weather that could keep a kite in the air. this thing wasn't moving or rotating like something carried by the wind, it was moving like something that had no regard for gravity at all, and it maintained its very low altitude for its entire pass from what i could tell. it was moving like an uncoupled fighter craft in battlestar galactica, able to change its orientation without changing its direction of movement. i don't know what else to say about it. it was by far the weirdest thing i've ever seen in the sky, it's contours were so visible and sharp it completely blew my mind. if anyone has ever seen something like that, i yearn to ponder with them what the heck it could be.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,
