i thought that if this was not a planet, then this had to be an iridium flare. however, if this was the case, then i assume it would not fade out so quickly. it seems as though it seemed to disappear more than fade out. i assume that this could be a reflection, not sure if a plane would qualify because it made no sound. my best guess would be a tumbling satellite. before this event, i have witnessed multiple of these anomalies, and they were exactly like this ufo, except far darker. the elevation was about 10 to 13 degrees, exactly east, maybe shifted slightly to the south, by no more

light out of the corner of my eye and looked at a cutout between clumps of trees to the south where i noticed a very big diamond shaped object (about 50 ft tall) moving to the west and a bit south just above the tree tops. it was composed of two 4-sided pyramids, with one pointing up and one pointing down, joined in the middle. it was moving about 45 miles an hour being closely followed by a red orb object about 3 feet wide. the diamond object looked like a ruby with a bright yellow/white light inside pulsing very brightly about once every 1.5 seconds. the object was slowly spinning counter-clockwise looking from the top-down.\r\n\r\n the entire object looked like solid glass lit up crimson colored. the edges were well-defined and looked perfectly straight and also razor sharp points on the top and bottom. i saw that it was on a heading that would take it behind a clump of trees coming up and i knew i only had seconds to see it. i knew if i fumbled my phone out and into camera mode it would be gone by then, so reluctantly i didn't even try to get my phone out to record. i just wanted to focus on getting a very good look at it because it was moving kind of slow and perfectly steady. the diamond object was moving without any wobbles or bobbing, but the red orb was slightly wobbly but following the center of the diamond closely. after about 7 seconds it was out of sight behind the trees. i saw the object spin around completely about 2 times making it apparent that it had 4 edges around the middle making it a pair of 4-sided pyramids. i also saw that there were no lights other than light seemingly emanating from the center of it and the crimson lit surfaces, and it had no features whatsoever besides the geometry and perfectly flat sides. the object made no noise and did not leave a trail or exhaust. there were no windows but the entire object seemed uniformly semi-transparent. at the time of the sighting i had no idea what the object could be.\r\n\r\n the extreme pointy nature of this craft seemed strange to me because it didn't look like it could easily land anywhere. it seemed more practical to me that this was some sort of machine being guided into place. later i thought that maybe there was a reason for such an extremely pointy angle on the top and bottom. i did drawings and estimated the triangles composing the 8 faces of both pyramids making up the object to be 70, 70, 40 degree triangles. later i saw someone strangely post something about a sublime triangle which is a 72, 72, 36 degree triangle and has significant mathematical and geometric properties.\r\n\r\n i wasn't fearful while witnessing the object, but later i became a little nervous that maybe i saw something sensitive but there hasn't been any trouble since it happened. i've seen a lot of orbs in the last few years and a handful of other impressive uap's but nothing as well defined as the diamond. i have no idea what or who is inside these objects but i feel like it's probably et's, robots, or humans, in that order of probability. i've noticed no missing chunks of time and the times i've seen orbs and other things it always seems like they are being playfully friendly and showing off what they can do, coming closer and revealing more over time. the more i've thought about it, the more i really want to know who or what is inside them. i'm attaching a drawing i made of the diamond. thanks","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

n/s from comstock, texas to ozona/sonora. it was completely moonless. i had stopped along the roadside, admiring the unobstructed view of the stars - west texas -rural - no ambient light = d.A.R.K. i had stopped at the base of a low hill  that raised about 200' immediately to the west... i noticed what appeared to be a fairly bright 'star'... when said object moved; very slightly, but yup that bugger moved??? a few moments later it moved again, a slight jog to the north then immediately back to original position. forgot top mention that there was a semi-steady 10-15 mph breeze, not heavy, but a breeze from the se; which is standard for this time of year... i have spent many a night on this road in years past, but only a few this year... back to story; now the object makes a much more pronounced move, again, in a straight line to the north, but much further and faster, then back, pause, and now to the left. ok; it is a drone... someone is on the top of the hill working a drone. this is a high traffic area for ins, there is a large complex in comstock... someone is operating a drone, watching traffic down on this road... i have a decently strong flashlight that i begin to shine at the 'drone', holding steady, turning on and off etc... the 'drone' now begins to make long 'verticle' slightly arcing movements. when i was younger there were little gasoline powered planes - not remote controlled mind you, but tethered and this is the motion that would best describe what i saw; tight arcs two or three, then returning to a semi stable 'base' but moving much like i would think a drone might... perhaps the operator was acknowledging my presence as i thought that at one point it did move towards my direction. at this point i decided to drive about 1-1.5 miles north. this took me to a clear view on the back side of the hill; the object was clearly not anywhere near the hill but in deed much further away, higher in the sky from this vantage, now about 60degrees and holding steady. i watched for a few moments but saw no movement, steady as a star... headed back south, stopped at same point. notice of movement, not anywhere as much as before... over the next 30-40 minutes the object held a steady path that seemed to follow the rio grande/mexico border. traveling some distance. very smooth, no wobbles as i might expect from a blimp... very slow for an air born drown - but what do i know... anyway thats my story and i'm sticking to it!

esa tarde yo estaba en la terraza de mi casa fotografiando las montañas de mi ciudad, decidí por algunas experiencias de avistamientos que he tenido en anteriores ocasiones tomar tres fotos por cada punto registrado para descartar errores. \r\npor ese motivo al revisar la foto que les he enviado la comparé con las otras de respaldo donde confirmé que el objeto solo aparece en una de las tres fotografías, así pude comprender que el objeto que ahí aparece tenía movimiento y había salido de mi campo visual al tomar la segunda fotografía en un lapso de 50 segundos. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. no noté el objeto hasta el momento que revisé las numerosas fotografías que hice esa tarde en mi computador, revisé haciendo zoom en cada foto y noté el extraño objeto en una sola de las muchas que hice. \r\n\r\n3. soy biólogo profesional y pude inmediatamente descartar que se trataba de un ave, pensé que era una estructura tipo vivienda en la montaña, pero las fotos de respaldo me confirmaron que ahí no había tal objeto. \r\n\r\n4. no pude ver ningún tipo de movimiento al momento de disparar la fotografía, porque solo noté el objeto al revisar la imagen en mi computadora. \r\n\r\n5. no tuve ningún tipo de reacción al fotografiar el paisaje, pero al notar en mi análisis que había algo extraño sentí la emoción natural que siente un aficionado al tema ovni, pues siempre he experimentado avistamientos, desde que era un niño, pero jamás tuve la oportunidad de fotografiarlos, generalmente ocurrían en las noches, pude ver foo fighters volando a baja altura entrando desde el sur y saliendo al norte de mi cuidad en un rango de 3 kms de alcance en línea recta y por un tiempo de aproximadamente 30 a 40 minutos hasta perderlos de vista. \r\n\r\notra inolvidable y frecuente experiencia ha sido ver “estrellas” que se mueven lentamente en el cielo, en grupos desde 2 hasta 9 estrellas, las cuales avanzaban en línea recta sin alterar su posición de manera brusca, solo siguiendo una calmada trayectoria a velocidad constante. le comenté personalmente este caso al doctor alberto quijano vodniza astrónomo vinculado a nasa quien me respondió: “usted está describiendo un evento ovni, usted no creería las fenómenos que he visto” !.\r\nademás he tenido la oportunidad de observar en un par de ocasiones objetos estacionarios como balines plateados a una altura no superior a los 2.000 metros. \r\n\r\n6. no pude ver cómo el objeto salía de mi campo visual al fotografiarlo. \r\npara comprobarlo les envío la foto que tomé antes sin el objeto (p1000108) y las dos fotografías de respaldo tomadas después de la foto principal (p 1000115 y p1000116). \r\nla foto principal foto 1(ovni cam) tiene el objeto hacia la posición de las 10 en punto. las otras fotografías

2016.  i had taken a vacation to ocean city, md on monday the 27th of june and left to go back home tuesday night around 11pm.  i pulled over in a shopping center to text my girlfriend that i was just going thru annapolis and was halfway home.  that was at 12:54am.  i got back on the road to head south on route 2, and when i got past the town of edgewater i saw a very bright light in the sky.  i at first thought it was a planet shining brightly in the night sky, but looked more like a forward facing search light with some smaller lights around it.  i kept watching it as i drove south towards calvert county, md.  the light was very low in the sky and i kept losing it behind the tree line, but when i got closer to the light i saw two glowing balls of light come out of the bottom, drop down and fly off.  it looked like another ball of light started to drop from the craft but i started driving downhill and the trees covered the craft again.  i kept getting closer to the craft until i got directly under it.  i pulled off the road to look and it didn't make a noise and was only about 500 feet in the air.  i grabbed my cell phone to take a picture and when i did the craft took off at a high rate of speed, still making no noise at all as it went.  i turned my truck around and tried following it for a couple minutes, but it was way to fast.  from the bottom the craft looked like a triangle with a large searchlight at the front and to small lights at the corners facing down.  it looked to be about 50-75 feet across and just hovered until one tried getting a picture of it.  i have lived near the patuxent river naval air station my entire life, where they test aircraft, and i can identify planes and helicopters, as the fly over my house every day all day and night. i have

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Rectory avenue, high wycombe, uk\r\n\r\n2nd november 2014 16:00, daylight but overcast.\r\n \r\ni was renting a room in a house on rectory avenue in high wycombe. the house was on the side of amersham hill. the room was at the front of the house on the first floor and had a large 5 pane single glazed bay window that overlooked the valley. from the window i could see nearby houses and rooftops, further away the green grass of the rye recreation ground, and in the distance tree tops that formed the other side of the valley. \r\n\r\ni was sitting on a double bed in my bedroom using a laptop. the bay window was to my right. i glanced up from the laptop and was surprised to see a formation of lights moving silently to my right in the furthest pane from me of the bay window. there was no noise that i could hear although the openers were shut but they were old and drafty. they were fairly close to me at this point (a few house away, for example) and reminded me of stars or yellow/white fairy lights like the kind that you see on christmas trees. i quickly put my laptop on the bed and went to the window to watch. there were approximately 12 to 14 of these lights and not only were they quickly moving to my right but they were also moving around close to each other. some moved down while others moved up while others moved around each other whilst still travelling to my right. as they did so, they formed a v shape similar to that of geese in flight - a v lying flat with the point leading like an arrow. they had also dropped in altitude to roughly the same as mine.  as they flew away from me across the valley each arm of the v undulated as though they were tethered by some invisible line. i definitely remember seeing the lights bobbing. at that point i quickly returned to the bed to fetch my phone so that i could take some photos. when i returned to the window they were far away and i decided not to take a photo as i had to unlock my phone and i did not want to miss anymore of the spectacle. i remember saying to myself that they looked like geese in flight. at this point, they were in a fixed formation with no bob or undulation.  up over the trees on the other side of the valley they went and up into the sky.  i continued to watch until they blended with the greyish white clouds and had flown out of sight. what i did not realise until posting this is that the former site of raf daws hill was in the vicinity that they flew over whilst i was watching. \r\n\r\ni imagine that some of you reading this will think that what i witnessed were chinese lanterns. i have seen chinese lanterns in flight many times both during the day and at night and in different conditions.  although what i witnessed was similar i saw no flickering of naked flames. in fact, i saw some chinese lanterns a few weeks ago one afternoon which reminded me of my sighting and i had the chance to compare. i knew that they were chinese lanterns immediately and although they were further away that what i witnessed i could see the flicker. what i witnessed seemed to be different, internally lit but no flicker, a constant radiance of light like a fairy light. plus they moved around each other and formed a flat v shape lead by the point. i have never seen chinese lanterns do this. some of you might argue that they were chinese lanterns tethered together but the question is why didn’t they tangle when they were moving around each other and how would you control the v to get it lying flat with the point leading? wouldn't the wind wind cause them to tangle?\r\n\r\ni talked to people at work and the people i was living with but nobody else seemed to have seen what i witnessed. i also checked on-line to try and find other reports but so far have found nothing. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100
