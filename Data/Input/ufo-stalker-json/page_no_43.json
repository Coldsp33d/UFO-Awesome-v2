view  pier in norfolk. we spent the better part of the day fishing with not much luck. i guess it was around 8-9 pm when i noticed two really bright lights one was white and very large and the other was red and much smaller. they were hovering above the second island of the chesapeake bay bridge tunnel known as the north thimble island. i thought it might be an aircraft like a plane at first, but i watched it for a minute or so and it had not changed size, direction, or shape and the red light didn’t blink. i told my wife to look at the “ufo”..She laughed and said it was a plane and looked away. i continued to watch as it hovered motionless for about 10 seconds longer and said “that’s not a plane”. just then, the white light took off to the east and disappeared in a fraction of a second then the red light did exactly the same thing. that’s when i knew it was a ufo.  i grew up in virginia beach and lived near the naval air station, so i know how fast and the characteristics of the fighter jets in the area. this was much faster and no sonic boom. in fact there was no noise at all. unfortunately i was fishing and not taking pictures at the time so you could see what i saw. i am a sargent in the army national guard for 11 years. i have been deployed to iraq and seen every type of aircraft the military uses in day and night operations. i have never seen anything take off so fast in my life. it didn’t build up speed, just went from a standstill to faster than any jet instantly. take what you will from this report but as for me, i believe i witnessed extra terrestrial aircraft

sky. they were either triangle,rectangle,or shaped like an  bottle of penzoil. on this day i felt i was being watched so i decided to film my rear view mirror on the driver's side. i noticed immediately an object by the sun lower its altitude and then go back up. it reminded me of a large insect/robot. it stayed with me flying up over bridges as i went under them and dodging other vehicles. at one point it had to maneuver around trees on the side of the road. that is when i captured the best footage of it. it had a half a ball of light on the bottom and smaller ones with it. i thought it shot at me and could hear it hit my vehicle. at one point a small one or a projectile nearly hit a school bus. i became angered at one point and said \"do you know who i am??\" that is when a orb shot towards them. either from me or from somewhere else. i lost track of it as i got into town. the entire event lasted approximately 15 minute. during the event: i felt attacked and invaded.

immediately went to the back door with a view directly over the fields to continue watching/looking.  i should think that this was just after 9.30pm.  as far as we are aware, we stood looking at it, talking about what it possibly was, until it suddenly seemed to shrink to a bright dot (probably flying directly away from us).  once it was distant but still visible, it shot straight up at incredible speed and was gone.  i know we stood there for a few minutes, not saying anything, and then suddenly dad was home from the pub and it was after 11pm.  we had only been stood at the door watching for minutes, not over an hour?  we both still remember it well.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path

was sitting on my bedroom floor with my back up against my bed. just as the intro started to play i heard this hum that got louder and louder, i noticed that a blinding white light was coming from the cracks of my door..All of a sudden the door slowly opened and the light filled my room it was the brightest light ive ever seen. it blinded me. for some reason i remember thinking it was my mother so i reached up to put my hand up to grab her but my arm felt like it was a million pounds and i collapsed. i never saw an entity (this time) but then i totally blacked out. next thing i know im right back where i was when i was watching tv only i remember thinking i shouldve been on the ground slumped over cuz i collapsed..But i was back in place where i was before i saw the light. i looked up at my train clock and it was 230am. i remember it didnt feel like 5hrs had passed it felt like it had been seconds since i saw the light and heard that hum...Looked down at both arms and they were covered in bruises and scratchmarks on my forearms. i felt exhausted. like theres no way i had just been asleep. i felt like i had run a marathon. after that i night i had hundreds of experiences similar to this. sleep paralysis as well but those experiences were vastly different from the abduction esque pbenomena.. it all came to an abrupt stop when i was 13. thats a whole different story in and of itself. ive always been troubled by this. i want to know what happened that night. to all who have open minds know that there is something out there. what it is exactly i dont know. but its something real. rest assured.","distance":"20 Feet or

out, one by one at the same height.\r\n\r\ni was standing outside at midnight as is my new year's tradition when i spotted three glowing white-orange dots. they were low to the ne, rising slowly and steadily up southwards. the top two made a sharp curve west and faded out. by the time the third, flickering slightly, slowly faded from view, 5 or 6 more in a loose constellation followed it in the same direction, disappearing one by one. a very bright one appeared afterwards, taking the same curved route as the first two. it took nearly 10 minutes for the whole spectacle to play out.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure of the exact number because once i realized they were not helicopters, i was busy trying to get a picture. later, i thought they might have been fire balloons -- until i saw the one photo that came out. i did not see any meandering motions at all.\r\n\r\nso those wild orange swirls in the photo are the motions of the white-orange dots within the fraction of a second it took to snap the photo. they are not the result of camera motion because 1) they are not at all the same, and 2) that bright green squiggle across the lower left is a string of christmas tree lights across the street, and it's absolutely unblurred and crisp.\r\n\r\ni've enhanced color and contrast to make the trails more visible but that's all.\r\n\r\nthe interesting thing is that my first ufo sighting was also of three glowing orbs and happened at the same place exactly two years to the minute on new years 2015 -- which is why i had the camera ready, though i never expected to see them

was on the rooftop viewing the super blue blood moon on 31st january 2018, with my parents. it was a moderately clear sky, with the orion constellation being the most prominently visible group of stars & then a few apart from the moon. my mum saw what appeared to be 2 stars moving towards each other like heading towards a collision. i saw it just in time to see them pass each other, move a bit further & stop to hover in a stationary position for about 2 minutes. this happened in the torso region of the orion constellation which was in the east direction of the night sky. this is definitely not an aircraft as it was at such a high altitude that my dad thought it was just another star when i showed it to him when it was hovering. we then spotted an actual aircraft traveling from the south to the west direction & it had more prominent flickering red lights & it was clearly at a lower altitude than what we had witnessed. we then turned our gaze towards the moon for a few moments to enjoy the eclipse. then as i was trying to explain to my dad what we had seen earlier, i pointed to orion's belt to explain the orion's constellation & to my surprise i spotted 4 stars in orion's belt instead of 3. then as i looked on in awe, 1 of the stars farthest from my position in orion's belt moved to the region which would be the orion's torso region approximately. simultaneously, 2 other objects which i had previously assumed to be stars moved towards this object which was moving from the belt's line. the 3 objects seemed to meet at a point somewhere in the torso region of orion & seemed to disappear without a trace all of a sudden as we were witnessing it. there were no sounds/noises audible. the color from the flickering seemed to be shades of white/silver indistinguishable from other stars in the night sky except for their in size. the objects seemed to be of a slightly smaller size in comparison to the actual stars & also seemed to shine slightly dimmer than actual stars. no other details could be observed. the event took place between 19:20-19:50 indian standard time. i could not capture the event digitally as i was not carrying my phone or my camera with me at the time.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

actually taken the photograph because i had no idea i had actually captured the visual phenomenon. on the date the photograph was captured i was at home playing online games with my friends after school since it is a common pastime for us. at around 5:30 i had decided to microwave some leftovers for myself so i proceeded into our kitchen which looks out onto our deck via french doors and a small window above the sink. when preparing my food and washing the utensils i noticed that outside clouds had set just over the sun creating a very interesting refraction effect with the light rays, deciding that the scene was quite pretty i went outside to take a picture of it, and that was the end of it until the christmas of 2017 when my grandfather was staying with us. i was clearing my gallery and was debating deleting the picture in question when i noticed what appeared to be a blue lens flare of sorts in the upper right corner of the image just inside the cloud cover. upon closer inspection it appeared to be a spherical possibly oval object with white lights lining the surface casting a bluish-green glow on the object's surface. the object appeared to be slowly ascending towards the south judging by the slight trail the surface lights made. when i realized that the object appeared to be a ufo i showed the image to my grandfather because he is convinced on the notion of \"aliens visiting earth\" and would be surprised and entertained by the image. to him the image appeared very convincing and at the time he was stunned. personally i'm not as convinced about the aforementioned notion so i was simply entertained by his reaction to the image. fast forward to the day this statement was written (january 30 2018) my grandfather, myself and my uncle were all in attendance at a dinner where my grandfather brought up the subject of my photograph. piquing the interest of my uncle i showed him the image in question and similar to my uncle he was shocked by the spherical object, and afterwards he directed me to this website to submit the image.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned
