States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Sometime in november a few years ago, 2013 or 2014, my brother, his girlfriend and their baby were living with us. we also had 2 dogs, a husky and a chihuahua, neither of them barked. the husky would \"talk to us\" if anything...But i did hear her bark once when she was frightened by the mail man, only time in 8 years though. the chihuahua did sort of bark but only when people came to the door and things like that, his barks are not loud at all though. the house we lived in was in virginia beach, va. it was a tri-level home, brother’s family on the top floor and i was on the bottom floor. \r\n\r\nmy husband had a job working in charlottesville at the time, so he was gone during the week. this was a weekday, so i had my 2 daughters sleeping to the right of me, and my son was laying on my left arm. i was holding my phone with my left hand, scrolling through news articles and facebook with my right hand. i don't recall what time this was, but i feel like it was around 10-10:30, not too late, not too early. i always sleep with a box fan, which was on at the time. i remember distinctly that i was looking at my phone when i had this sudden and very intense feeling of fear of my bedroom door, which was shut. i was so fixed on my bedroom door that i was scrolling through my phone but not looking at it, looking beyond it towards my door.  all the sudden i saw this being appear inside my room, in front of the door.  it was very tall, very skinny, with long and skinny limbs and fingers. the knuckles and joints were very apparent due to how skinny this thing was. this being had very distinct features in the face, looked almost skeletal. it looked similar to a grey. the eyes were large, but very short so it looked sort of like it was squinting, or maybe it was at the time, i don't know. \r\n\r\ni could not move, not speak, i was unable to do anything but breathe and think. it came closer to my side of the bed, was so tall that when it bent over my side of the bed it was damn near a 90-degree angle. from my phone light (i had the automatic screen shut off after a certain amount of time turned off) i could see the pores on this thing. the skin looked shiny, but not oily if that makes sense. the skin also looked like a mix of pea green and grey color. i was freaking out because it reached over me with its long arm and fingers and my heart was racing. \r\n\r\nall i could do is think. i felt like this thing was able to pick up my thoughts and feelings, and was able to do the same back to me. i had this strong feeling that when it looked over and saw my kids, i was not in so much danger anymore. like it had an intention, but changed its mind. \r\nthat's when it stepped back, and i had the oddest sensation i've ever felt in my life. i felt like a vacuum cleaner sucked me up instantly, until i looked down and saw me sitting up, phone still in hand, kids still there, i saw the carpet, my bedding, everything. i remember trying to stop but i couldn't. i started reaching the ceiling and was scared i would hit it, but then i blacked out.\r\n\r\ni don't remember anything until i woke up the next day, still in the same position as i was when i fell asleep. i had this overwhelming sense that i needed to remember something, and was just so confused and disoriented. i just sat there trying to piece together what happened and slowly i started to remember.\r\n \r\ni went to get my phone thinking it was on the left side of the bed or maybe the floor, but it was on the other side of the room in a spot where even if i had gotten up, i wouldn't have put it there. \r\ni got up and when my brother woke up he started saying something like \"man, last night was crazy\" or weird, however he worded it. i started grilling him like what do you mean, was cheyanne (his girlfriend) up, etc. etc.\r\n \r\nhe told me around 2 am (their normal sleep time was between 2-3 am) he heard the dogs barking like crazy, lots of growling, and movement. he said he opened the door which was on one end of the hall, and he could see into the bathroom which was on the other end of the hall. he said very specifically that it was very bright on that side of the house outside (where my bedroom window was on the floor beneath it), i mentioned the word \"light\" to him but he said it wasn't a light shining on the house, but a light just outside causing that side of the house to be very bright. he said he could see the light shining through the shower curtain and it lit up the bathroom enough to use it in pitch darkness.\r\n \r\nthen he said he heard this loud windy sound, and it was all over very quickly. i do not remember this at all. to me, this didn't even happen. i am a light sleeper; i usually wake up for anything. i never heard the dogs, never heard the wind, never saw the light. i felt so \"off\" for the longest time after this. i’d never had the feeling like my memory was tampered with, or that i had lost time. i didn't feel like i slept. \r\nafter my brother pretty much validated that something strange happened, i talk to my best friend about feeling watched the night before. then i start going into the details. she lived over an hour away, but she stated that she had a weird event happen to her that same night, same time, saw a being as well. i don't have the slightest clue as to what that means.\r\ni know it can sound like a trippy episode of sleep paralysis. i've had sleep paralysis before too. this was completely in its own zone. i'd definitely feel better just classifying it as sp if it weren't for the other coincidences. i don't know what happened, but i definitely feel like i \"left” forcefully somehow.\r\n\r\ni was not on any kind of medication at the time, wasn't under any particularly stress, no history of mental illness, nothing. i don't know what happened. i don't have any proof, no photos, but i do have texts and messages i would be more than happy to share to prove that this did in fact happen. the only question is what really happened. all i know is that i definitely did not feel asleep. i know sp can make you feel like your awake. but i was awake. please let me know what you think. the next few weeks i searched for strange sightings on that night but i never found anything. i haven't looked it up in a while, though.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

hawaii\r\n\r\nwhen we are little, we were taught by our parents to never tell a lie about anything. tell the truth and you will be forgiven. well, i have a story to tell and what i'm about to tell you is the truth. i know what i saw and what i saw was real.\r\n\r\non december 28, 2015 at approximately 2037 hours, i was standing next to my fishing pole which was placed in a sand spike. i was checking on my hook line connection to the swivel, to see if it was strong enough to be used again.\r\n\r\nfacing in a north easterly direction, slightly high on the immediate left side of me, i noticed a large black rectangular shaped object moving slowly in the night sky. at first, i thought it was just my imagination. after a few blinks to clear my eyes, something was there presently. then it moved from the west to the north easterly cruising and picking up speed. it had a dull satin shimmering (table cloth) like finish with three wide ray of yellow glowing mists lights facing downwards in an evenly spaced formation. \r\n\r\nthe craft was so dark, it showed a separation in color and was darker than the night sky. i remembered seeing stars with some clouds and a hint of moonlight at the time. the front and back end of the craft appeared to be blunt with no points or sharp edges. it was visualized clearly as day, as if it was placed there in a painting.\r\n\r\nas it continued moving towards the left front of me i noticed it tilted towards the north (away from me) and all of a sudden it turned into a triangle v shaped boomerang craft with the tip of the v being the front section of the craft. it had a total of five resets lighting all together. one light was at the tip of the v while the other four (2 and 2) were spaced evenly on each side. \r\n\r\nthe triangular v shaped boomerang craft was approximately a mile and a half, or even two miles long given the height and distance between us. it was far out to sea following the curvature of the north shore area from haleiwa where i was at, to kahuku, approximately 10 miles from point to point. it moved with absolutely no sound whatsoever, and blended in as it disappeared behind some clouds. as the craft faded away, the lights could still be seen shining in and out from behind the clouds now moving at an incredible speed. i could not believe the size of this thing. i know we have no aircraft of this size with this magnitude that can move with such great speeds. it took off faster then anything i ever seen. \r\n\r\ni stood there for a moment realizing what i had just seen and started coming to grips with myself. my heart was beating fast as i stared at the clouds hoping to catch another glimps of this thing again. the whole incident lasted approximately 25-30 seconds. \r\n\r\nmy wife's son was standing on the right side of me and noticed what i was staring at. he saw only the lights behind the clouds. he asked me, \"uncle what was that?\" i said i didn't know. the object left a sense of awe and fascination which inspired me to truly believe,\"we are not alone.\" i tried to brush it off and didn't want to scare him believing it was nothing to be alarmed about. but it scared the living day lights out of me? he kept talking about it as i kept brushing it off assuring him it was nothing.\r\n\r\napproximately 12-15 minutes later we witnessed two fighter jets flying side by side slightly staggered with their after burners on speeding off towards the direction the craft where we last saw it. they appeared to be very high and noticeably above the clouds. i wasn't sure at the time but i believe they came from the hickam afb direction, south going north. we saw the bright flames at first with a delay, then heard the roaring thunder behind them as they too disappeared behind the clouds. \r\n\r\nafter seeing that, i knew what i saw was real. it was a goose chase in the making. it was eerily quiet after the whole ordeal. we packed up and went home for the night. the incident scared me so much, i couldn't stop talking to my wife about it late that night. i had no camera ready or a cellular phone to capture an image of the craft so i actually drew it to the best of my knowledge. if anyone have had a similar encounter such as mines please tell me i'm not going crazy?\r\n\r\nas a child, i remembered sitting in the back of my father's pickup truck looking up into the night sky and seeing a yellow-mustard colored saucer shaped object moving across the sky. being so little with no knowledge of extraterrestrial crafts at the time, you come to wonder and believe in questioning yourself. gee that's kind of odd. i watched it for a moment as it zig zagged like no other aircraft, stopping on a dime, and with impossible speeds that can crush a human body. then the craft suddenly dashed across the sky once more only to disappear. \r\n\r\nincidents like these are hard to forget especially when you're a child. if it happens to you once then it can be slowly tucked away and not forgotten. but if it happens to you twice, now as an adult, then it's telling you something. i'm truly a believer.\r\n","distance":"Over One

before we left the house i decided  to go outside and run and play. we live at  the end of a deadend street, about 1/4 of a mile back off a main road. so as i am  running i got to the top of the hill and look up and i notice what  looked  to me like a spaceship as big a 2 football fields. it was just hovering not making a sound. i watched it for a long time maybe 1/2 an hour  but i soon noticed it  was vibrating and  kinda  moving backwards and fowards.The property i lived on was where the plantation pipeline was in the process of building a new pipeline across country and it just happened to run right throuh out property. it was neon green, the shape of what i have always known to be a spaceship.. looked like the one from the tv show lost in space except it was  this  different shaded neon green.. but different shaded , i mean the portholes and windows on it were neon green as well  but just a slightly different shade  of neon green.. at 13 years old i tried to rationalize it and figure out how  did it  appear as it did... i  tried to tell myself that it was just a reflection but  what would it reflect off of... i watched it for  30 minute but as a kid i got tired and showed my mother.. i left it sitting where it was and went on to the movie never  watched it take off.. but it was gone when we came  home..... i have always had  weird dreams  and visions of people comeing

my wife. it was one of my regular days off from work. i work nights for the state of idaho. i live in a house where the basement has been converted into that of another living area. my wife and i have our bedroom down in the basement, and directly overhead of our room is another bedroom where my brother-in-law temporarily resides. i typically stick to a schedule, and am always in bed around 9:00pm mst or 10:00pm mst. on this particular night my wife and i were in bed, and i looked at the alarm clock directly to the front of our bed, where it sits on her dresser adjacent to the television. i recall it was roughly 10:00 (2200 hours) mst. that is the last thing i recall before falling asleep, as it does not take long for me to typically fall asleep. \r\n    at some point i recall waking up in bed, and noticing the television was turned off and my wife was asleep. i recall the alarm clock was roughly around 11:00pm (2300 hours) mst. i rolled over and went back to sleep. as i was drifting off to sleep, i remember my head started to have a buzzing like sensation, and i heard a loud constant ringing in my ears (tinnitus-like) that would not subside. i must have fallen asleep, as the next occurrence i can recall is being awake, and on my back, slightly floating above my bed. i was in a zero gravity-like state, just floating above my bed. the ringing was slightly fainter in my ears, but still present. i recall i was looking up at the ceiling of my bedroom, and my arms were dangling toward the bed, and i was in a complete horizontal attitude to that of my room. i could not move, and even though i tried to look to my right where my wife was in bed, i could not move my head. i then recall the feeling of being \"pulled\" toward the ceiling, but remaining zero gravity-like. as i neared the ceiling, it appeared as though the ceiling somehow disintegrated from around me as i went through the ceiling. i then recall still moving upward toward the roof of my house, and as i went through the roof, the same disintegration of the roof occurred. the next thing i recall is looking straight upward toward a clear, star-filled sky. the air was warm on my skin, with a slight breeze. the breeze itself felt warm, yet somehow cool. i did not hear any wind, nor did i hear any of the nighttime wildlife, such as owls, or crickets. everything then seemed somehow frightening, unnerving, yet serene all at the same time. i do not recall seeing any spacecraft above me per say, yet had the overwhelming sensation that there was something there, and somehow it was in a camouflaged like state, almost like the cloaking device used to hide spacecraft in star trek. somehow i felt that even though something was there, it was reflecting or refracting the surrounding environment. i then recall being \"pulled\" in the same manner as described earlier toward the heavens. it is at this point everything goes blank. i do not recall anything past this point, until i woke up in bed the next morning. \r\n    the next thing i recall is waking up in an excited like state, and noticing my wife was already awake, and doing laundry, folding it. i was in a state of confusion, and disarray. i was freaking out thinking that i had to get ready for work, and that it was 10:00pm at night. when i questioned my wife, she told me it was 10:00am (1000 hours) mst in the morning. i was so confused, i could not recall the time of day, and seemed to have no recollection of anything past 10:00pm (2200 hours) the night prior, when her and i were in bed. in a sense, it felt like \"missing time\". it was not until later in the day, the recollection of what had occurred the night before came back to me. i discussed what had occurred the night prior with my wife, and she was supportive of my claims. her and i are open-minded individuals.

bigfoot,there were a hedge of very tall bushes to our left and on the other side of the bushes is the des moines river, about 30 feet from the road where we were walking. we happened to look at the sky and over the bushes was falling this big blue sphere , it was glowing blue , no noise what so ever. it fell to the river. we ran to see where it was but there was no sign of it. we were standing there asking each other what that was when there was a flash of light above us in the sky. the flash was real quick and bright. as soon as the flash was gone i saw what looked like a flash light panning in our direction from across the des moines . there were no people out there, and besides if it was a person they would have had to be standing in the river , not possible. what was the strangest was that i wittnessed a small black lizard thing run across the road from the direction of the river to the other side of the road. it reminded me of those lizards that run on 2legs. it was about 2foot high. this all happened within 20 minutes. also about 6 months ago we saw this triangular orange craft just hovering in the sky, it vanished and then reappeared hovering in the exact spot again. it hovered a good10 minutes and then just disappeared. i have heard that the men in black have been spotted here in s.E. iowa recently, now we know why. there are multiple people that have seen strange ufos around this little river town. i have never wittnessed anything like this before. we also always see flashes of lights that light up the road in that same area.There is alot of strange activity here.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
