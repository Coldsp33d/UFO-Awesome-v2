felt like. was quite large, no less than 30' in diameter, possibly as great as 100'. it ascended at a steady pace, directly upwards, until it was no longer visible. we actually called the national weather service which has a station nearby, the police, and the news, but no other reports were related to us. i went to school the next day and drew what i saw on a piece of paper, a classmate made

course that the water company supplied.Celebrating memorial weekend taking a 23 mile ride to a gold mine on private property my boss owned.Left his house around 1:30 am.The road we took was near his house and would take us a all the way to our destination where we would turn and go up to where the gold mines were.Was cold so we stopped often to warm our hands by the exhaust from the atvs.\r\nabout every 3 miles we would stop.About half way there we stopped to get warm and smoke a cigarette.We noticed bright lights at the foothills of the mountain to our right.Being that it was early morning of memorial day weekend we thought it could be a camp fire but the light were strobing like police cars.I was relatively new to arizona and had only been there a few years,i loved to take pics of scenery and mountains.We didn't have binoculars but i had my digital camera.I turned to get my camera to zoom in on the lights to see what was going on.My friend yelled \"look\"!\r\ni turned and saw them shoot up into the sky,but one came close to us,then shot up to join the others.I was white with strobing blue light.The others were white with red and purple strobing light.I lifted up my camera and got 2 pictures before they were gone.I looked back to where they were sitting before they took off and i seen streaks of what i thought was a smoke trail,but it was falling back to the ground.It was dust that they pulled off the desert floor.They didn't make any noise,and they wasn't pushed up by anything that came from under them.In fact going up caused a vacuum under them,pulling up dust,and not scattering it.They were spinning,but not like a top that would stay still.They spun like they were out of balance.The thin threadlike trail left behind each one would make a 6 .The threadlike trail attached to each one of the 3 orbs like they were tied together somehow.They started separating,splitting off into more of them.The threadlike trails getting longer and more were in line with each other.As they went up and separated,they resembled a snake that wiggled across the night sky.As they went out of sight,they were only a twinkle of light ,then they were gone.All this happened in a matter of a minute or two,but it is burned into my memory like it happened yesterday but it happened may 31,2010 between 3:00 am and 3:30 am.6 years,1 month,and 27 days from today.The first thing i said was \"what the @&#% was that? my friend said\"what do you suppose that was? i was confused by his answer and his being calm about it.He seen it too but was not surprised by it.He went on to tell me about his abduction when he was a child.I would not have believe him but he seen it with me.I stood there on the side of the road,staring up into the sky where i saw them last until daylight.About 3 hours i stood there,trying to get my mind to accept what i saw.It was not possible.It went against all i had been taught about physics.Maximum speeds,gravity,sudden turns,etc.\r\ni feel like i would never be normal again.Who would i tell?Where do i find answers?\r\ni took my camera home after we got back.I put the sd card out of mt camera,into my computer with a usb adapter and pulled up the almost totally black pics.I could see specs of light in then.I zoomed in on the lights and cropped them,then saved them to a cd rom.I was blown away again.It was not my imagination.I seen them with my own eyes,with another witness,and pictures i took.What more proof did i need....But what to do with it?.Nobody believed me.It caused so much problems for me for the next couple of years.It was only the first experience,i seen more things after that,that would further confuse me.They came to the ranch where i lived during a bad storm,strobing purple light again and the power surging.They were all around my house,stand far away,but i could see what looked like glowing white eyes.I won't go into detail on this yet.For another time.After this i stood in my yard at the ranch and watched something spinning,like a middle out of control.It spun in one direction,then spun the other direction,then opened up a huge circle,then something,a spot in the middle of it came out,then the circle was gone.This also will be detailed some other time.This month,june 4th,close to where i lived in az,a meteor lit up the sky shortly before 4:00 am.The area is a no fly zone now.All gps scrambled,only drive through with escort.The pictures of the trails do not resemble a meteor.We are being lied to.I have learned that what we are told is fiction,is not fiction,it is fact.What we are told that is fact...Is actually fiction.Read your bible folks.That where you will find answers to what and who they are.Be prepared.Thats the only hope you

slightly that i stood and watched it for a few minutes to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me. the sky was clear that night and full of stars. we have no neighbors around us and are surrounded by woods so it's very dark - nothing lighting up the sky but the stars. i couldn't figure out what it could possibly be, but i had never seen anything that big, bright, and noticeable in the sky in my life.  i went and got my cell phone to take some pictures of the object, and when i finally focused on it i couldn't believe what i was seeing. there were no other stars visible when looking through the camera i could only see the object - (but to the naked eye there were lots of stars visible) - not only that, although the object was only moving slightly to my naked eye, when i looked at it through the camera, it was blinking and moving all over the place. i started recording it, and i \"zoomed\" in and out on the object so that i could try and see what it was. when i magnified the object i was in awe...There were different colors coming off of it, and it was moving so much - i kept asking myself how that could be possible when what i was directly looking at was moving, but not like that! i stopped recording when my phone ran out space!

hurricane came from the south from new orleans and the gulf of mexico.... the hurricane proceeded north going over foxworth and columbia mississippi from which i were living at the time with my parents...  then the hurricane went north east/east going over hattiesburg mississippi.  complete devastation of trees; buildings; animal life -- (such as cows and deer which were thrown against and wrapped around bob-wired fences) and were later discovered dead.  in addition homes and boats completely obliterated from every  angle  the eye could see. \r\n\r\nat the time i was working on the garbage truck as a hopper for the city of columbia.  on monday, august 29th 2005 -- (after a 12 hour day hauling rotten garbage) due to the electricity going out and everyone that didn't have a generator had to throw away everything they had in their deep freezers and refrigerators.. this event was causing serious smells at every home we arrived to extremely stinking garbage to be hauled away. almost a week later there was still no running water.  \r\n\r\nso in extreme need of a bath or shower and refusing to settle washing myself down with wet rags and a bowl of water...  i decided to take a ride to a creek near by a church i use to attend.  after arriving at the creek in pitch dark..... so dark i couldn't see my hand if placed on my nose...  i stripped down and went skinny dipping feeling so refreshed washing the rotten garbage smell off my body. \r\n\r\nas i was washing my cloths and scrubbing myself down with icey cold creek water and soap...  a hugh round like airship with amber glowing orbs came heading straight towards me from the south.... south-west.  as i was watching this object coming towards me.......  completely naked while washing myself and my work cloths.....  i realized this three amber yellowish lights coming towards me at a rate of speed no greater then about 30 mph and at an altitude of about 100 to 150ft; just barely clearing the tops of pine trees.....  i could no longer move a muscle in my arms, legs, neck, fingers or shoulders.......   as if i were completely paralyzed or possessed as the aircraft arrived straight over my head. \r\n    \r\nas the aircraft arrived straight over my body; i was completely paralyzed to any motions what so ever but i did fill the water moving.  i am blessed that i was standing up in a shallow part of the creek that wasn't deeper than my waist or else i believed i would have drowned if i were swimming.   \r\n\r\nthe amber cloudy like orbs with a trace of something like a reddish yellow tent swirling inside the amber orbs had all of a sudden turned to a white colored orb with a baby blue tent swirling inside these ivy white orbs. \r\n\r\nwhen the orbs of this ufo was the color of amber; and before it was coming toward me -- i was extremely scared out of my wits.  all i wanted to do was run away from this ufo as fast as i could.  \r\n\r\nhowever seconds after the orbs of this ufo turned white then swirled the baby blue tent inside of its orb....  \r\ni felt a connection some how with this craft. i instantly went from being scared and wanting to run in the opposite direction of this ufo to feeling at peace. i felt that what ever this object was had no attention in harming me. i still have no idea what it could have been if it was not no ufo because it had absolutely no sound while moving or hovering over my head. there was some heat to the light but it wasn't hot enough to burn me. it seemed as if it read my mind to determine not burn me because as the few moments it was scanning me the lights got really hot and i asked it to not burn me in my mind and the lights started to dim to where it wasn't hot anymore. \r\n\r\n\r\nthis ufo seem to hover over my head  for about 5-10 minutes then the ivy white-baby blue orb like lights turned yellowish amber again and started to fly  from southeast-east going toward columbia and flying toward hattiesburg mississippi. i saw the amber colored orbs coming toward me at a distance of about 300 yards as it appeared just over the tree-tops and i lost sight of the amber colored orb disk like object about 50-80 yards as it flew toward columbia just over the tree-tops. the ufo never seemed to ascend or descend in altitude the entire time it was in my sight. \r\n\r\nthis was the last time i have ever encountered a ufo up close and personal.   i have only encountered lights before this that would shoot across the sky like a shooting star and all of a sudden move in a completely different direction of travel like a v shape in the sky.\r\n\r\nafter this encounter i raced back home and my parents asked me where have i been because about 5 hours had passed by on something that i felt only took a minutes. i remember leaving right after it turned dark at about 7pm and got home just minutes before midnight.  and a week after this encounter i started receiving hair loss. my hair fell out and never grew back till this day.  \r\n\r\nin 2004 i had a mri to determine if i had any back problems for an interview to be a roustabout for diamond offshore; but my father told me to stay in college and to not take the job. the mri's taken in 2004 showed absolutely nothing wrong with me. but after this encounter in 2005 i started to get minor back pains. \r\n\r\nin 2007 after getting a associates degree in electronics at prcc i took a job with at&t to work in new orleans to help rebuild the damage the hurricane caused by flood waters that got so high in some areas that actually got in the cables of the telephone poles and over the peak of houses roofs at a height of 25 foot.  \r\n\r\non september 1st 2009 i had to have a tumor that got removed from inside my spinal cord. the doctor wanted to remove the tumor because it got so large inside my spinal cord that it busted out of my spinal cord and was wrapping around the vertabras outside of my spinal cord. doctor john c steck; a very famous neurologist in marrero louisiana (ranked in the top 10 of all surgeons in this field in the usa) wanted to remove this tumor because he was scared it was going to rupture the main artery that runs down the spinal cord. if this artery got ruptured i would have bleed to death within minutes before i could get any medical attention and if i did get to the hospital no doctor would be able to diagnose the problem before i bleed to death internally.  \r\n\r\nin addition ever since this encounter i have been getting nightmares of being adducted and taken right outside of earths orbit to a bee hive honey cone like mothership and not being able to move or wake up until i am returned back to my bedroom.      \r\n\r\ni don't know if i have ever was adducted or if they caused this tumor or if i have been implanted with something that hasn't showed up on an mri other that this tumor that was inside my spinal cord or if these nightmares that seems extremely real are an actual reality and not just dreams; but i do know for a fact i have never had any back problems since this encounter in 2005.  \r\n\r\ni haven't told many people about what i saw in the summer of 2005 because the people i did mention this too including family looks at me as if i am lying; trying to receive attention; or just simply thinks i am crazy for the dreams i have been receiving or the encounter i witnessed. \r\n\r\nhowever i am extremely curious if anyone in the state of southern mississippi saw these lights i witnessed in the summer of 2005; just days after the worst hurricane that hit in the history of united stated of america. a hurricane that did the most damage cost wise in united states history. \r\n\r\ni am not looking for attention. but i am curious if anyone has witness anything similar to the most painful and terrifying surgery i was left with after an encounter that will change my life forever. \r\n\r\nthank you \r\n\r\nsincerely:\r\n\r\nstephen d. olson\r\n","distance":"21-100

grounds, the city of alcoa was conducting their annual \"pre-independence day celebration\" called freedomfest, saturday, june 25  9:40-10pm. \r\n\r\ni stepped outside to watch some of the fireworks for a few minutes at the beginning of the show, then went back inside my apartment to continue watching tv. \r\n\r\njust before 10pm, near the end of the fireworks, i went back outside to watch the \"grand finale\".... after all the fireworks were shot off (10pm), i started walking back to my apartment and that's when i noticed a bright blue light shining through the trees and moving in a southern direction. \r\n\r\nfirst sighting was 194-198 degrees from my position at an elevation angle of 25 degrees. i stood and watched for a while to see if it would clear the trees and come into open view....It did.\r\n\r\ninitially i thought it might be a commercial or military aircraft because there is a civilian and military airport nearby, however i found it very unusual to see the color blue light in the sky. i was amazed, curious and slightly confused, this did not seem natural or normal to me and not what i have observed as aircraft.  so i watched hoping to find an explanation or identity of this unusual sight. \r\n\r\n\r\nonce the object passed by and cleared the trees and came into open sky view, i observed what looked like a ball shaped (circular) object, mostly blue. \r\n\r\nthe color was similar to a police blue light but it had a slightly different quality or shade of color that i would describe as \"neon-like\".   in the center of the blue ball / circle of light was a red color ball / circle.  the ratio of red ball / circle to blue ball / circle was about 1:8....Also noteworthy, unlike regular aircraft, these colored lights did not blink, fade or pulse..... \r\n\r\nan even greater detailed description of the object: imagine a 5 point star, then overlay another 5 point star. now offset the stars to form a 10 point star. that is similar to what formed the blue ball / circle. there was a red circle in the center.  there were no definite lines of separation and no sharp points to the star. it seems like the blue color emanated from the center and became slightly fuzzy near the area of the points, but blending and filling in all together to make the form of a ball or circle of colored light.\r\n   \r\nno sounds were heard.  the object moved slower than a typical helicopter and i would estimate the distance as 2 - 3 miles away maybe further. it moved very smooth and steady, no jerky motions.\r\n\r\nshortly after it cleared the trees and came into plain view in the open sky, it seemed to change direction slightly with no change of elevation,\r\n155 - 160 degrees.  \r\n\r\ni continued to watch it until it fell below the level of the roof top of my apartment.\r\n\r\n***measurements taken in daylight on 27 june, using a magnetic compass, carpenters angle locator and my car's gps location.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

county, in the colorado mountains.   my wife went to bed and  i had decided to stay up.    i was sitting in the lawn chair just outside our tent.    i was  looking at the satellites with a pair of 10x50 bushnell binoculars.     i was trying to catch them tumbling as they traveled across the sky.    i was able to catch a hand full of satellites traveling east to west and west to east.    some of them did tumble.   as i was looking for the next satellite i saw a set of 3 lights traveling north to south   the satellites looking lights were in a triangle configuration.   at this time in my life i have never seen a set of satellite traveling in a triangle formation.  so moving my lawn chair around to get a better view with the binoculars.\r\ni look at the 3 satellites with the binoculars and saw a large black object with white lights at the corners of the black triangle.   i should have seen the satellites traveling through the stars but only saw the very large black object   i brought down the binoculars.   looking at the 3 objects, i saw 3 lights and all the stars as though there was no object   i was seeing right though the object.      i look through the binoculars again and saw the large black triangle and  the white lights at each point of the triangle,   they were not blinking.    the black object was so large it filled almost the whole field of view of the binoculars  being so large i was thinking it should be making sound of some type   maybe a jet sound.     bring down the binoculars, i tried to hear something  but not a thing.  the out in the middle of nowhere quiet.   by now the hair on my arms were started to stand up.    i was looking at the 3 satellites moving through  the stars again     i look again through the binoculars again the very large object    by this time i knew what i was looking at. \r\n i was thinking i needed to get my wife up to see the object.   bring down the binoculars, i look for the satellites looking light.    the lights were gone.   no moving satellite   they vanish.  i brought up the binoculars and started look for the large object.   no large object.   as large as this object was i should be able to fine it right away,   but it was gone.   disappeared,  vanish,  gone just that fast.\r\ni saw what i saw.   out of the 1000’s of all nighter under the stars,   this has been my one and only true unexplainable event over 3 decades of observing.   i am hoping that one night i will see again a life altering event like i did in 1981

the sky above the treeline in one of the pictures. i had taken three pictures within a few seconds of each other. the second picture has the object. the first and third picture of the same location have no object in them. the object looks rectangular, and shiny silver or white on one side. in the location where the photo was taken there were no aircraft in the sky and the only birds we had had seen were hawks or vultures. the area we were in is very secluded. there were no other people around, and no noise other than the river going over a rock bed.
