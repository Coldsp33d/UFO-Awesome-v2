i recently took a trip back to sedona to see my family. it was the first time back to sedona in five years and my girlfriend and i stayed with my parents there.  i was excited to see the beautiful sky and also got a couple powerful star pointers to add to the fun of the trip.  we arrived in sedona on 6-15 and every night we started going out to look at the stars and play with the lasers.  the moon was full the third night we were there so i was a little disappointed we couldn't see the stars better but it was still amazing.  every night we went outside at some point watching the stars and counting dozens of satellite and jetliners.   on the night of 6-23, my dad and i started watching the sky around 10:15pm right out in the dark street in front of the house.  i caught a couple shooting stars but there was a small strip of cloud above us that the moon had slightly aluminated, and it was partially blocking out the stars straight above.  after 30 min of an uneventful sky i started to point my laser at the cloud directly above me seeing if i could see the laser on the cloud at all.  i held it on the cloud for a min, blinked it a couple times then before i knew it something aluminted in in the cloud right next to where i pointed my laser.  the cloud was wispy and low.  the object in the clouds would glow so bright it was intimidating.  my dad and i froze, and just watched.  it would light up every ten secs or so aluminating the cloud around it then moving a short distance before aluminating againg.  at this point i ran inside and grabbed my girlfriend, i said \"honey ufo!\".  she ran outside just as it lit up again on the edge of the cloud, move a little ways, then aluminated again.  it moved out of the cloud and into night sky as we watched it now aluminating and appearing out of the black.  i ran back inside, got my mom out of bed and she ran out to watch it move off to the west with the rest of us. we could see it glowing more orange in the distance appearing and dissapearing in the dark. we were just speechless. my last night was the next night and my mom and i spent some time outside looking at the sky again and after some time i believe we saw the same object off at a distance over the mountains for just a min or two.  my parents are not the type of people to talk about ufo, but over the last year my interest in them has peaked.  i knew they were out there but in all my years i had seen nothing and my parents had not either.  i think my dad my be a little in shock by what we saw.  i have not been able to stop thinking about it. my girlfriend is speechless too.  one strange note about this is that we all know it happened right at 10:45pm.  i know it happened at that time too, but when i think back and remember myself running up the porch into my house to get my girlfriend, i always see it as daytime in my head.  i think its because i was in such shock and excitement but i thought i should mention it.  i feel like this thing we saw stays over that area because we caught it that second night.  someone else has had to have seen this thing.  i want to find out the truth about what i saw now...Its hard to stop seeing in my head, especially after traveling back home to buffalo yesterday and being super tired.  i hope this can get some answers....","distance":"501 Feet - 1

over ajax, whitby and possibly pickering, five friends of mine and i had decided to take a late night stroll. within two minutes of our walk and leaving my house, in the north direction, i noticed the sky was very clear. i could see many stars, and especially the typical airplane lights. over the horizon to the east-southeast, three orange orbs started to appear in view, slowly making their way into view, heading west-southwest. the further into view, the more orbs began to appear. there were more than a dozen orbs, extremely bright in the sky. their brightness' dimmed and increased seemingly at random, pulsing like so with gentle transitions. they all moved together in harmonized formation, looking kind of like the outline of the horseshoe nebula formation. they were hovering for the most part and at the least, three times brighter than the brightest start in the sky. their brightness was more prominent than the moon. at first, i had no idea, then my initial response was ufo's, possibly of intelligent origin. i called my friends over to see if they saw it as well, as all five witnessed this. at the time, the orbs had ceased their movement in the sky and simply hovered. some orbs began to glow much brighter than others. a couple started to move in two separate directions, glowing further red until vanishing.\r\n\r\nduring those three minutes, we all attempted to capture video or imagery, but our cameras on our phones were not working at their normal quality. video produced nothing but black film, but the photo came out decently ok. by the end of roughly three minutes, the orbs all began moving in their own directions, sometimes circling back to their original position, and each faded away one-by-one, until four remained in the sky in the orion's belt formation, for another minute. i ran to get my mother to witness the sighting. she witnessed the last four orbs, before they, too, vanished with a blink.\r\n\r\nanother couple of minutes passed when we decided to continue our walk, after the event had occurred. again, over the east-southeast horizon, i, and two of my friends, witnessed a much larger orb, glowing a translucent greenish-blue, while it possessed an even fainter aura of bright blue around it. it's flight path was clearly a descent, making its way roughly 150km/h. it made no sound, and took a full minute and a half to descend before it became out of view beyond the horizon.\r\n\r\nafter the sightings had stopped, several jets were seen in the area, all traveling in random directions. as well, each of us (the witnesses) responded and reported different feelings: shock, confusion, excitement; except one that was common for every individual: extremely energized. like being given a large dose of caffeine or sugar, that lasted several hours.\r\n\r\np.S. the following night, in the same general horizon location, a solitary orb of the same bright, orange/red was seen traveling slowly west-northwest, in a gradual curved path, until blinking very bright and vanishing in the blink of an eye.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

it looked just like a star but it kept going till it past the star's an got smaller and smaller till we could no longer see it anymore. every since then i don't think our government is laying to us i know they are lying to us. and it's  really upsetting to me to know that (we the people) are not (we the people anymore) now it's (we the people and the government and them) because we ain't alone

through the telescope and it was cylinder shaped and chrome-like. i couldn't see windows. there were no wings and no visible means of propulsion. it made no sounds. through the telescope you could see it was clearly solid and metallic. i couldn't see insignia or writing anywhere on it. it was smooth and the ends were rounded not flat but it was cylinder shaped between the ends. after observing the object through the telescope for about 15 seconds, it took off and was out of sight in about 3-4 seconds. i posted on facebook about it and there was another witness seeing it flying to the nw away

6:20pm so the sun was still high in the sky. it was sunny and partly cloudy. a shiny object in the sky caught my eye. i would say that it was like an oval-ish shape, i couldn't see any sharp edges but it was solid. the reflection was bright and it made it hard to see the actual shape of the object was. i did not see it appear, i just happened to notice it. i was around i-10 and dairy ashford and it was on my right, north of i-10. it was wasn't too high but it wasn't too low on the horizon to where the view of it could be obstructed by trees or anything. i just stared at it. there was some traffic so i wasn't driving too fast so i was able to see if it had a trajectory path but it did not move, it stayed at the same position. i was trying to see if it was a plane, but the way that it shone, it could have not been because it wasn't small enough, the refection was too bright and it would require a lot more surface area. the shape of a small plane could of not have cast the amount to light or reflection that this object did and from that distance, it would of been too small anyway. at first all i could notice was the bright reflective surface, but the more i looked, i could see that it was silver on the bottom part. again, it was hard to see the actual shape of the object, but it was solid. \r\n\r\nthere is a small airport on groschke road that is between barker cypress and hwy 6. i occasionally see small planes take off so its not out of ordinary for me to see things in the sky, i have even seen colorful hot air ballons come from south of i-10 in katy, i am not too sure where exactly they come from but it has been a while since i have seen those. however, this object or i guess ufo was rather large but at the same time seemed far away. if i would guess where the ufo was on top of, i would guess that it was between the mason rd to fry rd and saums to clay rd area. so as i am driving i pass under the hwy 6 overpass and when i look at the same spot in the sky, it was gone. i looked around to see if it moved lower or higher but it was nowhere. the hwy 6 overpass only obstructed my view for about 5 seconds. the length of time that i saw this ufo was no more than 1 minute. when i first saw it i felt curious and i was thinking of all the possibilites of what this could of been. when i continued to see it, i felt kind of confused because i couldn't understand what the object was and when it disappeared quickly i was just shocked and i also felt upset at myself for not taking a picture of it. i am sure that it would of been visible. \r\n\r\nif somebody knows what this object was or if you saw it too, please leave a comment. i have been trying to forget or to talk myself out of thinking that i saw a ufo. i am not one of those kind of people that think that there are aliens out there or those that do a lot of research on conspiracy theories but i cannot explain what could that could have been but i know what i saw. i can't talk myself out of this and forget it so i wanted to let others know. sorry this is so long but i wanted to be highly descriptive!","distance":"Over One

what was reported to be 03:57am mst and apparently was also visible in utah, new mexico, california, texas, and nevada. \r\n\r\ni was standing at the 19th avenue and northern train station at 4:48 am when i noticed what appeared to be high altitude missile contrails due east in the illuminated sky just prior to sunrise. i have seen these contrails on many occasions usually occurring right before if not at sunrise. these occurrences are usually explained as being missile tests from white sands, new mexico which is east northeast about 410 miles away. \r\n\r\ni am employed within the aerospace industry and one of the projects i am certified on is the \"thaad\" (thermal high altitude aerial defense) program, and that is all i will say about that subject.\r\n\r\nbeing that i was standing there looking at what appeared to be scattered contrails, i decided to snap a couple pictures with my phone camera. i showed a few people at work that day but didn't really look closely at the pictures for a week or so. \r\n\r\ni have a friend on the east coast that i sent the first of the 3 pictures to and after the fact is when i noticed the anomaly. \r\n\r\non the first picture along the right border there appears to be an illuminated object which when zoomed appears to be a large distant cylindrical craft with the curved bottom illuminated by the rising sun. in the second picture it appears to be turning, and in the third it is gone. i snapped these one after the other and all 3 are time stamped at 04:49am mst. \r\n\r\nmoments ago, just prior to starting this report, i searched the web and found multiple you-tube videos that show that same anomaly. i am certain you will search them for yourself if this anomaly hasn't already been acknowledged. i find it hard to believe that i am the only observer that has noticed this. i am attaching a forth photo, which is actually the first photo with the area cropped out, blown up in size, and pasted on top next to where the actual object is pictured. \r\n\r\nseveral years ago i submitted a report and it was explained away as \"chinese lanterns\" which i excepted as a reasonable explanation for what i saw. please explain this.

else the object slowed enough or stopped  enabling her to drive under the object which was approximately 150 ft overhead. the light beneath the object was extremely bright and cast a circle of light
