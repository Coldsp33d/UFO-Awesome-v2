have been observing and recording the above from data transmitted by the soho satellite since about 10-11 june 2016.\r\n\r\nit would surprise me if you had not had any similar reports for they have been most common. \r\n\r\nit is probably best that i simply send you the images and let you analyse them, but i'll make some comments as follows:\r\n\r\nfor convenience, and utilising my own terms of reference i have dubbed them 'blackberries', but they are are certainly otherwise unrelated to any fruit and are in fact thoroughly alien, and somewhat disquieting due to their number, size and overall 'alien' presentation and behaviour.\r\n\r\nthey are likely enormous, using the sun as a comparison scale.\r\n\r\nmaterial unknown, purpose unknown.\r\n\r\neach has at least one powerfull light source emanating from its centre. the light varies in its characteristics and intensity.\r\n\r\nover the course of several weeks i have seen many variations in presentation of these 'craft-entities'. \r\n\r\nthey vary from several joined up together with their lights making a line, to single objects with a single light carrying a bunch of 'balls' which is the most common manifestation.\r\n\r\nthe balls seem to be able to change shape. they remind me of the matal mercury but this is just an initial impression.\r\n\r\ni have pictorial evidence of these craft on occasion alighting on or near the surface of the sun and ejecting-depositing several balls over the suns surface, and certain images indicating that these 'balls' then sink into the sun... for whatever reason.\r\n\r\ni have accumulated a virtual library of evidence based on my observations in recent weeks, but will include the choicest shots which can hopefully give credence to my aforementioned descriptions.\r\n\r\ni feel this information is highly significant (for mankind) in that it portrays et activity around our sun on an enormous and continuing scale.\r\n\r\nof course, one wonders how come nowone else seems to be noticing or commenting on all this... why?\r\n\r\nthe significance of what i am reporting can not be underestimated, assuming that the images have not been manipulated prior to release by nasa

top and rectangle back. from the road we were looking up at it and it looked flat. it was almost 10p.M. so it was dark out and when the light would rythmically flash on and off, we could see it. it was flying at a slow speed going north along the highway. we were heading south. it was on our left side. when the light would flash it looked steel grey with cross \"bars\" and panels that looked like square windows. there were 2 or 3 \"window panels\" on each side with the \"bars\" between. it looked like there were thin green lines of light, straight lines outlining part of it. it was flying in the direction of the front light. we didn't stop and kept going. my passenger turned to watch it continue on its path. it was flying above the power lines, a little bit higher. we didn't know what it was. i was very interested in what it was but as we were driving to our destination and this probably only lasted a minute or two i didn't stop. i didn't have much time to think about it. my

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Myself and a friend were driving one evening in a rural area ne of rayne, la. we were at a stop sign on charlie arceneaux rd (present day name) at hwy 98 (grand prairie road) facing in a southerly direction. we were on an upgrade at this point, so when we first noticed the light we could see it about 2/3's up through the windshield. it appeared to be changing colors from red to yellow to green to blue in a sort of rotating repetitive fashion. neither of us had ever seen anything like it before. we are both science minded and after a brief discussion about what it could be, i suggested that it might be something like a super nova whose light was just reaching us now. that seemed as reasonable as anything else we could come up with so we continued driving. \r\n\r\na short while later, we found ourselves headed south on ebenezer road (which is sw of rayne) and noticed that the light was still there. we stopped and were trying to decide if it was still in the same general direction from where we first saw the light(s). as we were talking, the object turned into a brilliant bright white light and suddenly took off in a easterly direction. my friend wanted to stay stopped and watch, but, knowing the area and that there was a eastbound gravel road (theriot road) just ahead of us, i chose to chase it instead. i was traveling in excess of 70 mph down this gravel road, but the object was getting way ahead of us. it appeared to have passed a treeline about 3 or 4 miles from where the chase began, stopped again and went back to rotating the red-yellow-green-blue lights. \r\n\r\nwhen we reached the stop sign at hwy 35 (abbeville hwy) and started watching it again. right after we stopped, we observed a bright white light about 7 or 8 inches wide come down just to the right of my vehicle. i noticed it first at a slightly higher level and told my friend to look. he saw able to see it as it went past the passenger window. it wasn't like a continuous beam or anything like that. it had a beginning and an end, but disappeared after leaving a short trailing tail and then completely after we assume it made contact with the ground. we did not see any hole or scorch marks on the ground where it seemed to make contact. there was no noise at any point of this experience. with the size of the light, and how close it would have been if it had been a helicopter, we would have definitely heard the noise. there was nothing but silence. \r\n\r\nwe had a friend that lived further south down hwy 35, so we decided to go back to my home (in the opposite direction), pick up my small telescope and go out to our friend's home. it was only a 90 power scope, but we didn't know what else to do. although we were a mile or two further south when we arrived at our friend's home, the light was still due east of our location. i focused my telescope on the object, but what i saw was simply a round solid orb. but, with such a low power scope, it could not really focus in on the object leaving me to believe that it was much further away than it looked. the funny thing was that as soon as my friend took his turn to look through the scope, he told me that it wasn't there. as we looked up the object had returned to the bright white light and had taken off again in a easterly direction. at this point two our friends also saw the change in color and the object moving away.\r\n\r\nalthough i can not verify this story, later in the week, another friend told us that he had seen the same light(s) from abbeville, la., a town about 30 miles away from our sighting. he further commented that he had called a local airport and was told that they had nothing on radar in that area. my hesitation to believe his story is that he could have easily been told what we had seen by our other friends at the house and may have simply decided to add his own story to it. \r\n\r\nanyway, i have no clue on what we saw. the whole thing just didn't make sense for the times. we have no pictures or videos as this occurred over 40 years ago. my reason for speaking up now is that i'm getting up in age and the event has stayed with me all these years. it changed my beliefs on what is really out there.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then

there for a few minutes when i saw a blue blur from the corner of my eye and thought it was a transformer box blowing up but there was no sound so i rubbed my eyes thinking ok i'm just seeing things then it began ( from what it looked like from where i was sitting)rising up from the trees first i saw the blue lights then the red and i thought a plane was going to crash but it made no sound and it didn't crash but it kept coming towards where i was... i couldn't actually see a craft only the lights but the lights were large maybe larger than a basket ball and there was no point of light such as an element but more like a glass ball filled with glowing gas i couldn't really tell with the red lights but this is the way the blue lights appeared to me...I was excited and scared and called for my kids to come look but by the time they got to me it had gone, my youngest son may have seen the last twinkle of light from it but we also have firefly's so i would have to discount that.. my son was scared and asked me to come inside so i did....I came in and got my keys and went looking for it ...But nothing was to be found...And that is pretty much it... i feel perplexed i want to know what this was.... i will note that although we live in a normal quiet neighborhood on a foothill of lookout mountain i have noticed military once maybe twice a year bring all there big trucks and in full gear on my street and i tried to find out if there was a military installation of some sort on my street but couldn't find anything... and one more thing it is probably nothing but it was only when i started calling for my kids that it backed back up and disappeared.. the feeling i got from this was that it seemed to react to me calling the kids... it was a machine but acted like an animal ...Odd... thank you for your time.... i do have my ipad on a constant charge now so if anything like this happens again i can make every effort to catch it\r\n","distance":"101-500

noticed a bright light in the sky above the horizon. i debated on whether or not it was a star of some sort or craft. as i continued i decided that it was most likely a start due to the fact that it never changed direction or position in the sky and was very bright. however when i got to g.E i realized that it was a craft of some sort heading west in the direction from which i came. two white bright lights were leading followed by a bright pulsating red light. they were traveling roughly 40 miles mph. i stopped and stepped out of the car to view this craft(s). at that time they changed position from a horizontal triangular formation to a vertical triangular formation with the same light positions. therefore i am not sure whether or not this was one craft with exterior lights or individual crafts shielded by bright lights. in the end they abruptly changed direction at a 90 degree turn from going west to going south and i then lost sight as they went over the buildings. which allowed me to estimate the height to approximately 300-500 feet in the air.

working 7 years in law enforcement i have worked for the federal government for 14 years.  since i am still active in the government i do not wish to have my name used.\r\n\r\nit was april 17, 2005 and i was on my way to work around 5:30am.  i had been traveling this route to work for about 8 months now.  i turned south onto shaver road from osterhout.  sugarloaf lake was just a few hundred yards in front of me.  the road by the lake was unusually thick with fog and i could see a red and white strobe light in the road.  i figured there must have been an accident due to the heavy fog.  as i got closer the lights vanished.  \r\n\r\nas i drove through the fog, the fog seemed different, almost like steam. since i could no longer see the lights, i slowed as i didn’t want to run off the road or into the fire truck.  i decided to put my windows down to listen and that’s when the hair on my neck began to stand up.  there was not a single sound other than my car, not a bird, cricket or anything.  it was a scene right out of the movies.  \r\n\r\nas i passed the lake i noticed the lights again on my right.  they seemed to be out in the water about 20 feet off the ground and maybe 30 or 40 feet long.  the fog was so thick i didn’t see what the lights were attached to.  they were a series of strobe type lights, one red then several white that went from right to left.  as i went another seventy five yards the fog was gone and so were the lights; everything seemed to have vanished.  i turned onto the highway and looked to my right and i could see part of the lake.  it was clear, there was no fog and it was completely empty.  i stopped going that way at that point and began taking a different route.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what the lights went to.  one might speculate they were from a ufo, but i did not see a craft through the fog, only the lights.  i went back that way a few more time over the next few days trying to figure out what i saw.  to this day i have no clue.   i told my wife and a few coworkers about the incident that day.\r\n\r\nback in 2009 i was flipping through the channels watching a show on ufo’s.  they were creating a computer generated recreation of an incident observed by several law enforcement officers in illinois.  i was absolutely shocked when they had the craft turn and i again saw the exact same configuration of lights i saw back in 2005.\r\n","distance":"21-100

always excited when i get a chance to witness these cool events but recently i have seen a few things that i can not explain as i have never seen anything like it.  the most profound thing that i have seen was on saturday, june 18 at sunset. i was in my backyard. the sky was a brilliant red/orange color to the west and to the east, there were dark thunder clouds.  i was watching a pretty display of lightning.  i was just turning to go back into the house, when movement caught my eye, in the sun set.  there was a glowing orb, shaped like an eye or like an oval, traveling across the sky.  it was glowing brighter then the sky behind it but it was the same color as the sky. (red and orange) it almost looked translucent. it was the motion that caught my eye as it could have blended into the sky easily as just part of the sunset.  it was traveling in a straight line just over the big oak trees behind my house.  it was traveling quickly from south to north and i would say it was the size of an aspirin or penny in the sky.  at first sight of it, my first thought was that i was seeing ball lightning.  something that i have never seen before.  but after looking up ball lightning on the computer and investigating that explanation for what i saw, i don't think that is what it was. the description of ball lightning and its behavior just doesn't fit what i saw in the sky that day.  of course that left me a little perplexed.  i never would have thought about filling out ant kind of report even after this event if it had not been for the two other things i saw later that week.  after seeing two other things that i also can not explain nor have i ever seen, i decided perhaps something strange is going on in the florida skies.  the other two events are almost the same and my husband was a witness of these as well.  we watched a star like object, travel across the sky. at first we thought it might be the space station or a satellite untill it changed direction.  then we thought to ourselves, no way could it be plane, there were no blinking lights and it seemed to high in the sky. we were watching it, discussing what it might be when. . . all of a sudden there was a bright flash of light where the object was and then the object was no longer visible.  we have now seen this twice (although with each event the object was traveling in different directions) once early in the morning about a quarter ofter 5 and the second one a few days later just after sunset. all this time of being a sky watcher, i have never seen anything that i could not explain, until now.  what is going on in the florida skies? wish i had pictures of what i saw.  wondering if anyone else has recently witnessed anything like this. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":77233,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.953176871730406,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06232016-0012","longitude":-81.90377744299919,"occurred":1466281800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1466689408000,"summary":"At sunset, i watched an object (oval or eye shaped and the same color as the sky but brighter/glowing almost translucent travel across the sky.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":33,"maxtempi":91,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":33,"maxtempi":91,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"33813","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4,"locationName":"Lakeland, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:73298"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Muranga ","country":"Kenya","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a flying sourcer ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"01:01:18","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":77231,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-0.7745181,"location":null,"logNumber":"KE-06232016-0010","longitude":37.045283899999994,"occurred":1466575260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Murang'a","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1466675434000,"summary":" it's a foggy morning in kenya, muranga county, me and a friend are driving down a murram road video tapping the heavy fog that is falling making it hard to drive. its terrible weather for us but not for this ufo that took the chance to fly by unnoticed.
