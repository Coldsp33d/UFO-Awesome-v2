there was nothing there. in fact the next morning he went on the roof of the house, but also found nothing. when i looked at our security camera (i-pad) we were in awe of what we saw at exactly 5:00am. there were 3 short videos of only a few seconds long. the first one at 5:00am then 5:08am and 5:18am. each occurrence showed this object to have moved a little further west. the first one was right over our barns, which is a few hundred feet from the house each time the object appears to just hover there. we live on a farm in northern saskatchewan and so we have never really believed in ufo's! we couldn't seem to find a logical explanation for this but didn't really know what to think or do. \r\nthen on june 17th at 2:12am our camera again captured this similar object/lights closer to the house and a little to the south maybe only 100 feet or so from the house in front of our quonset. neither one of us were home this night. we have decided to put up additional cameras to try to find out more of what this could possibly be. we had thought this sighting on april 20th would be a one time thing. now we are a little concerned as to what this is.....\r\ni will try to send a couple

for a couple of months. it is on a tripod, pointed 90 degrees, straight-up, this happens to be in the virgo constellation at this time of year. this camera is 10-12 mps, hi-definition, with an 8x zoom, zoomed all the way, and has never given me results even near this sighting. i was outside at least 15-20 minutes during the filming, it was a spectacularly clear night, and remained that way all night, i saw nothing by naked eye. the battery on the camera lasts for about 2hrs, so this is not the full video, i have another 1hr of this sighting available. while i was reviewing the footage a couple days later, i saw blinking appear in the lower left area of the picture, slowly and randomly, the blinking appears, and by the end of this video are thousands of lights, some make shapes, lines, 2 & 3 'linked' lights, 'l'-shapes, squares, all colors, including a deep blue, there is also some kind of red and blue clouds, visible all over the screen, that appears to be associated with the blinking lights, also not visible by eyesight. i don't believe that these are 'artefacts' in the camera, there is movement of these lights even though the camera was stationary. when the blinking is most active, it almost looks like you imagine electricity moves through a circuit board. the video is un-retouched and has no audio because i wanted to present it exactly as i viewed. the camera does have a microphone, and didn't record any sound during this event. i would be happy to make the full video available, as well as the camera, for testing. could this be holographic technology, or a mass of craft, or is this a spiritual encounter, all outside of human vision? is the summer solstice part of the reason? thank you

military weapons and explosives. it is known by locals here as the tnt plant. the area was always fenced off until a few years ago when a road was opened up that went right through the middle of it. though the road is still separated from the rest of the land which is covered with unusual looking bunker type structures and old train tracks. trains still sit there at times and though it is supposed to be inactive i have witnessed things that would make one think otherwise. there is a dried out pond off the road with a bunker in the center of it. once when driving past i witnessed a man standing by it in a radioactive suit. my cousin is big into photography and had stopped out there one time to take pictures of the trains. he was quickly approached by a man telling him the place was off limits and that there were high levels of radiation. none of this would seem too unusual except maybe to say that the place is definitely still in use. well one night i drove through there and had my first and only ufo experience. near the trains there is an old water tower. directly above it maybe 80 feet up the ufo was hovering at a slight angle. i could only see the underside of it. it was triangular in shape. there was a light in each corner. it lowered until i couldn't see it anymore because of the trees and trains. i drove on and to this day everyone is skeptical of what i had seen. except for my friend that was with me. well that is my story. thanks for listening. i still drive through there quite frequently, but haven't seen anything since.","distance":"21-100
