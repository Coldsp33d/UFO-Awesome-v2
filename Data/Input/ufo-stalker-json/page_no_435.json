might be space station but it continued in a straight path over my house to the se. i watched it probably 2-3 minutes solid.  i didn't get up to see it more the corner of my house blocked my view. that night there was a bright star on right side of the moon. about 5 mins later it was about 10:00 oclock in the sw sky moving to that star.  saw it maybe 3-4 seconds then it vanished.  about 5 mins later it was ne, about 2:00 oclock in the sky by another bright star.  this time i could tell it was traveling away from me, only saw it about 2-3 seconds, then out of sight,  so i saw 1 white, round, solid light 3 different times and 3 different places.  so i just figured it was a ufo.   i've had another sighting that was much more frightening that i reported to you.  it was 9 illuminated copper

was looking above my house as it was moving to the right, towards the trees. the distance is unknown. it was was moving on a straight line pattern, following a recent jet stream. it took about 2-3 seconds to move across the sky. i thought it might have been an odd plane, but as it followed the jet stream on a slight curve, i noticed there were no wings or lights. just a perfect circle. there was no sound, no lights, no stream with it. just moving smoothly across the sky. after it disappeared, while still in the pool, \r\ni attempted to measure how high it might have been. i used my left hand and placed it horizontally as if my fingers were resting on the peak of the house. it measured 4 fingers high from where i stood. i quickly went in the house to check the clock and to write this

i've just seen what i'd have to call my first ufo.  this was ufo in the literal sense of unidentified flying object, not a classic flying saucer with obvious structure, physical characteristics, etc.  i had gone out sometime after 3 ayem to look for comet panstarrs.  the sky wasn't crystal, and i'd just been staring at a computer screen so i knew it'd take a while to dark adapt.  looking around, i noticed a flash in the southeast, maybe 30 degrees high.  it was very like a satellite flashing in the sun.  i put up the binoculars and was lucky to catch it right away, heading left or basically north.  the flash was more like a constant pulsation, about twice per second.  these flashes were bright and occasionally much brighter.  but it wasn't like a flashing light attached to an object, nor was it flashes of solar reflection.  the moving light was steady, like an ordinary star in the binoculars--white with no other colors.  but superimposed on that was the steady pulsation, as if a glowing object was brightening and dimming above a base level twice per second.  whatever this was seemed very high--satellite height.  but it crossed the sky much faster than any satellite does--two or three times as fast..  the overall impression was of a tremendous amount of power, both in its speed and light output.  i watched it cross two-thirds of the sky, always through the binoculars, and followed it right to the horizon, where it disappeared between two trees almost directly below the north star.  it never dimmed like a satellite entering earth's shadow--only with distance.  and the flashing remained constant in its rhythm, although some were noticeably brighter.  it was kind of awe inspiring: that sense of speed and power and purpose.  i've checked the satellite database on heavens above and nothing seems to match.  the important points are the time (about 3:30), where it disappeared over the horizon (just east of north), maximum above the horizon (not much above that original 30 degrees), brightness (mag 3 or 4, plus those first magnitude flashes).  this is stupid, but i got the impression that it was one of ours, rather than one of theirs--if you know what i mean.  otherwise: cool. note: i sent this report to my sister shortly after the event, so it seemed best to just copy it to you verbatim, do excuse the conversational tone. i see satellites all the time: naked eye, in binoculars, iss, iridium flares, hst, etc. this was different. powered, rather than in orbit, bright and steady pulsations, all the way to the horizon. \"heavens above\" is the website i use check satellite info. the object didn't have an \"alien\" feel to it, but more like it was being operated by some military jock. that's what i meant by \"one of ours.\" hardly a great sighting, per se, but if others observed it before or after me, that might be interesting. i got the impression it was going from a to b along the curve of the earth. disappeared heading toward phoenix. i was unable to find comet panstarrs that morning, although i had seen it the previous week--not sure why. this is all from my back yard. time is mst, az doesn't do daylight savings. have fun with it, keep up the good work, thanks, sorry i'm too broke to donate, etc.","distance":"Over One

later 1 or 2 more came from the same direction and the flew the same pattern as if the were following behind the first two. they disappeared at the same location and then 2 more came from the same

would come and attempted to see where they went and how. the storm started as we were watching. lightning and rain but no thunder. the lightning was furious and lasted a long time. after the storm passed there was more lightning in the same area we seen the flying objects appear from for quite some time. we were still in awe of what we witnessed but could not explain as it was unexplainable. we live by an airport and see planes all the time... this was not anything we have ever seen before. i asked on facebook if anyone else seen any weird flying objects in the area as the storm was approaching or during it... a friend of a friend seems to have similar pictures but just like my videos the quality is minimal and literally does no justice to what we actually witnessed. we were shook up and we are still a bit. i'd like to know what we seen and if anyone else did too. another odd thing that occurred was our cell phone batteries were both drained to near dead which never happened from taking videos for such a limited amount of time. this all occurred last night and i'm still shook up by the event. i was encouraged to contact this site and i'm hoping to get some sort

the villages of hebe and klingerstown in northumberland county, pa.  i was with a friend and two of our children, looking for deer.  as i came up the farm lane, directly ahead of me i saw a glowing/fiery circular object which appeared to be enveloped in a something of a haze lowdown in the sky just over a small mountain about a mile or two from my location.  from my truck the object appeared to be the size of a tennis ball, but it was obviously much larger as at least a mile or so away.  the object appeared out of nowhere a little above the mountain and at a rate which seemed slow to me traveled on a downward angle from right to left and disappeared behind the mountain.  i slammed on the brakes and exclaimed something like “what the xxxx was that”.  \r\nmy friend had been looking for something on the floor, and the two boys were playing a videogame in back, so none of them saw anything.  i expected a huge explosion from the other side of the mountain, as at first i thought it was a plane or helicopter which was on fire and coming to the ground.  however, when no explosion occurred, i had no idea what i just saw.  \r\ndue to my thoughts that it could have been a plane or something like it we quickly drove to the other side of the mountain and drove up and down the road looking for whatever had come down.  we found nothing.\r\nlooking back, one thing that seems strange is that this object had no “tail” such as you might see from a plane or shooting star streaking across the sky.  further, i have seen shooting stars and this was nothing like that.  it couldn’t have been a plane or helicopter crashing as we would have seen the aftermath for absolute certainty.  as it bothered me for days i looked around google and found a picture which looked very much like what i saw, which picture was labeled an “orb” in a setting of ufo’s.  \r\nfor what it is worth, i was not under the influence of any substance.  i have never really believed in ufo’s despite once before having before seen several green “dots” chasing each other around the sky when again out in the countryside of northumberland county many years before.  at this point, i honestly don’t know what i saw, but i am very interested in learning more, and discussing this matter with someone more knowledgeable than myself.  thank you for your consideration.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
