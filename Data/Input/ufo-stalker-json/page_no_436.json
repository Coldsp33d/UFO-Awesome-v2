at it as it rushed by because it looked like a computer glitch (or when a line of pixels on your tv stops responding).  it was way above the clouds and was about the size of a small pill from my point of view. it looked like it was a bright led light outline of what looked to be a rectangle with its center invisible, or two halves of a square that were slightly separated.  it came from nowhere in the sky, and then was suddenly rushing away within the span of a second before it had blipped out of existence again. while i was able to see it it either left behind a short broken up neon trail or part of the square's own line had extended back behind it somewhat. i was completely stunned because whatever i had seen had gone by so fast and was so high above the clouds that i couldn't believe that it was anything like a plane or helicopter and instantly believed that it was something i was not supposed to necessarily see. i was completely silent and stopped moving in awe when i watched it zip by and instantly told my brother what i had seen right afterward. i told him of the distance at which it had been from me, the size, the speed, and specifically the odd square neon shape.  he believed that it could not have been a plane or anything and said that it was either a ufo or some sort of military secret aircraft.  this was all unbelievable, but also odd, because this was the first time i had been back home in a month, and certainly the first time i had played outside with my brother in a long time.  i don't know if any of this matters but my brother and i were playing badminton, then practicing balancing and swinging either an 11 foot stick of bamboo or a baseball bat.  i had also been telling my brother earlier about a remote control plane a friend of mine had made recently, if any of that mattes at all. also, after i told my brother i went inside and told my parents, who then went outside to look for themselves after i had drawn them a small picture of what it had looked like. they believed me, but didn't see anything. it reminded my mother of times in the past where she had believed she'd seen ufos. i took a snapchat of the sky where i saw it and

the other stars in the sky. the two blues were changing angle from more of a 60 degree down to 55, 50, 45, etc. moving ne towards southern vermont. they were kind of paired but not extremely close to each other. the larger blue-green light was moving downs similar angles but heading nw towards southern vermont over clarksburg state forest. the larger red-orange one was maintaining a the 60 angle and was moving w/sw. they felt like they were moving at the speed that a satellite moves across the sky (slightly faster than your average commercial airplane). i watch for approximately  30  seconds, questioning everything: if these are satellites, why can i see colors? and why are they different colors? and four at the same time? and all crossing paths from a similar point in the sky? after those thirty seconds and looking into my phone to see if i could take a picture, the orange one changed path now heading nw towards the blue-green light over clarksburg state forest and towards southern vermont. i immediately called my best friend. she did not answer. phone rang about 4/5 times until voicemail greeting and automated instructions. i then left about a 45 second voicemail narrating what i had seen and what i was seeing. during this time, an airplane entered the my vision heading nw in the same direction as the orange-red and the blue-green lights over clarksburg state forrest and towards southern vermont. this had your standard blink red and white lights that are typically seen on commercial flights. the two smaller blue ones left my field of vision (there are a lot of houses and mountains) and then slowly the larger blue-green and red-oranges faded into the distance with the airplane still heading in the same direction. it was warm out about 65 degrees f and it had been up in the 80s that day. there had not been any precipitation that day nor for the couple of days prior. there were not many if not none clouds.

to look up in the air, to hook her up.\r\n\r\nthere was a town celebration 2 blocks away. i could hear the band singing, but not clear enough to make out the words. it was a beautiful clear night. \r\n \r\nthere was a perfect view of the moon. there were only 2 stars in the sky. the north star and one that was much lower in the skyline. \r\n\r\ni immediately saw a bright yellow fireball object traveling in a straight line, in my direction. it was high above the trees, but much lower than airplanes travel from cincinnati to louisville, and in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\ni starred and thought to myself, what is that? planes fly above my house north to southwest, and vise versa. it came from the east and moved straight over my house and continued heading west. there were no red or blue lights, nothing flashing, like planes have. it did not make any sound and was traveling much faster across the sky, than a plane does. \r\n\r\nthe fireball was solid yellow, and appeared to be the size of car. as it got closer it appeared to have an orange ring around it. only when it was directly above my head, did i see, the fireball was in the center and there was a red laser grid (in a rectangle shape)surrounding the entire fireball. this was only visible when it was directly over my head (like looking up through the bottom of a lamp shade).  the red laser lines did not connect to the fireball, but they had several lines connecting to each other all around the fireball. it never stopped or slowed down. \r\n\r\nthere was no sound, my dog didn't look up, she immediately ran down the line (sniffing for rabbits) on her way to the pine trees, 150 ft. away. she never barked. my eyes were locked, i never looked away. \r\n\r\ni yelled \"come here\" and started pointing to the west as it was passing over my house. my adult son, was standing 6 feet away, in the sunroom, (looking at the tv). he walked outside while i was yelling \"look at that do you see it?\" i had grabbed his bicep, in the process. he said \"yes i see it, what was it?\"\"your scaring me mom\". i said, \"sorry, i just wanted to make sure you saw it too\". i went straight in the house, looked at the kitchen

170lbs man with a stun gun type technology.\r\nthe man put the stun gun to my heart area of my chest and pressed the trigger. at first it did not work probably due to by thick coat as it was cold that night. the second or third shot finally worked and i was shot dead by the stun gun type technology that looked alien in it's appearance. \r\n\r\nmy body fell forward to the floor on the grass field but my i found my self still stood up and i could see my body lieing on the floor. i was now in the same dimension as the aliens and i could now see that their was a sphere silver exterior style flying saucer parked on the field about 100 feet away which had windows and inside i could see it had different rooms and the interior was red padded seats. this appeared to be the one dimension higher than the 3rd . perhaps the 4th. i could see cars driving past and everyone i could still hear and see the sound and light from the 3rd dimension but nobody could see me. except anyone in this now higher dimension. i quickly noticed that i was in soul form in the 4th or higher dimension. i tried to fight with the extraterrestrial as he walked quickly back to the ufo 100 feet away asking him to put my soul back in my body that was laying on the field at night with the nearest people about another 100 feet away as i was staying at a farm house that night. \r\n\r\nthe human/nordic looking extra terrestrial refused to put me back in my body and instead got insdie his beam ship. \r\n\r\nanother nordic/human extraterrestrial appeared in the craft , female , long dark , wavey hair, about 5ft 1 and 150lbs. she was seen at the window. and speaking telepathically to me through the window.\r\n\r\ni remember her clearly saying the words '' yoo , hoo , kevin '' as if i was an animal and not a human.\r\n\r\n30 seconds later another ship arrived about 100 feet from the ufo with the two nordic type being inside. this other ship was larger , rectangular and extra dimensional as the inside looked larger than the outside. \r\n\r\nthe second space craft came down from space very quickly and it has what looked like nano crystals as it's fuel source. the craft contained draconian, reptilian brown scaled and black scaled beings.\r\n\r\naround 8 of the black draconian/reptilian type beings exited the ship and stood on the ground trying to scare me. instead not knowing what else to do , i actually ran towards the 8 black scaled draconian beings and fought fieacfully for around 2 minuetes. in this dimension i felt much lighter and i was able to life 2 of the draconians as high as the nearest electrical power line and slammed both of them into it and it made a dent in the power line in that dimension but not in the 3rd where i noticed a car driving past the road at the point in the 3rd dimension. a man was driving the car and he seemed to noticed something from the 3rd dimension because when the draconians hit the electrical power line the man quickly turned his head at the power line in the car as if he noticed something but couldent see exactly what it was.\r\n\r\n\r\nafter the fight. nearly all draconian soldiers were injured and two seriously injured with one of them i am not sure if he died as he was taken inboard the ship by another extraterrestrial that was not nordic looking or reptilian looking. where he was first treated with a medicine crystal that wa sbeing orbited by another crystal in its stationary position. that being was then moved into another room. the ship seemed to be much larger inside than outside and there was lots of beings walking about further down the ships internal corridor. \r\n\r\nfor a moment there was a what appeared to be a (pretend) ship laser gun fight between the flying saurcer and the draconian ship. \r\n\r\nthen the draconians must of asked for some help as a large grey appeared to the right of the 2nd ship another 30 feet to the right of the 2nd craft.\r\nthe large grey was around 30 feet tall (tree size) and had spider like / grey alien features. it was very malevolent and very large.  i tried to lift it in self defense but i was only strong enough to bend it's knee. \r\n\r\nthe grey picked me up with it's hand and tried to eat me until the flying saurcer began fireing laser weopanry at the large grey in which the grey put me back down again.\r\n\r\ni then tried ran towards the flying saurcer to try and attack the blonde nordic looking man whom had to used the stun gun ealier but as i jumped into the ship into the room that he was situated he was sucked in my soul with what appeared to be a soul catcher (beyond event horizon , mini clear black hole within a test tube) and my soul which is made of light could not escape the suction velocity which made me think it was beyond event horizon gravitational force.\r\n\r\nfinally i was let go after a struggle in the soul catcher and slowly put back in my body that was controlled by a controller onboard the flying saurcer. \r\n\r\ni was now back in my body and my body was bought back to light , i could no longer see either the aliens or any of the space craft as i was no in this dimension. i walked back to the farm house which then i was further tortured inside the home by the 3 nordic looking beings. it was the same 2 in the flying saurcer and 1 new one and then another one whom had no hair and  was wearing a jump suit (blue) overalls. around 18 stone and about 5ft 8. \r\n\r\ni was tortured that bad at this point, i don't want to discuss it here as it was to malevolent. but the aliens made a lock and attached it to the door and locked it so i couldent get out. i was then tortured , i was shown that these nordic looking beings could shapeshift in a green reptilian form and had very large tounges like a lizard. i was forced to give them a sperm sample and eventually my memory was erased by a flash of light a number of times. \r\n\r\ni woke up in the farm house in the living room the next morning with no memory recall of the event and carried on my normal day and returned home.\r\n\r\n\r\nit took 5 years to begin recalling my memory and it came as a large shock.\r\nthere may still be more memories to come back as of yet (11 years later)\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is my recal of a human (myself) being attacked by malevolent reptilians and nordic/reptilians/grey extraterrestrials that had technology a few hundred years more advanced than as of (2005 technology)\r\n\r\nthe silver , red/silver interior ufo had anti gravitic/ hyper dimensional and probably time-traveling capability as well teleportation. \r\n\r\n\r\nalpha draconians were from alpha draconis star system\r\nlarge greys possible orion's belt , reticuli, phobos moon and deep\r\nunder the earth\r\nreptilian/nordics hybrids probably from  draco, altair/ alderberan, tau-ceti (cetus) these ones are highly dangrious they can shape shift into human form and walk among the human population in the 3rd dimension with no problems at all. (i'm sure this is what they are doing)\r\n\r\nkind regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":77135,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.852037,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-06192016-0005","longitude":-76.7353646,"occurred":1104622200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1466305441000,"summary":"A malevolent abduction by malevolent extraterrestrials","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":20,"maxtempi":68,"maxvism":11,"maxvisi":7,"meantempm":12,"meantempi":54,"meanvism":11,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":20,"maxtempi":68,"maxvism":11,"maxvisi":7,"meantempm":12,"meantempi":54,"meanvism":11,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4186,"locationName":"Upper Marlboro, Maryland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:74369"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82750,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":436}
