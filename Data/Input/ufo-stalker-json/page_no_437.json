when i opened my eyes i saw a silvery object above in the sky which was just sitting there without moving. i thought it was a balloon at first but the reflection of the sun was making it shine real bright. i decided to look at it with my binoculars that were close by but i still couldn't tell the shape of it. i decided to take out my telescope which has an attachment where i can hook up my android phone since i like taking pictures of the moon and the planets once in awhile at night.\r\n   the object began to move slowly and i was struggling to capture it through my telescope until i was finally able to get it on my phone. i began recording it once i got a hold of it. at first i thought it was balloons once again because it was three spheres that were attached to each other but they began to move in a circular motion and once in awhile the three spheres would separate from each other and come back together. so i ruled out balloons.\r\n   the three spheres together formed a triangle shape and were bright yellow almost shining, i don't know if it was due to the sun hitting the object or what. the object would move around as if it was out of control but as it was moving in one direction it would suddenly move to another direction. at one point the object passed another white sphere like object which can been seen in the video but i was unable to stay with the other object or i would have lost the three sphere object.\r\n   finally i was unable to track the object because the arms that make my telescope move were unable to move further and i lost the object. the sun was setting and clouds began to move in making it difficult to see the object any longer. the object was real high in the sky because it disappeared behind the clouds that were passing by and usually the planes that pass above my house from lax usually are real high in altitude and they don't even fly above the clouds. i was able to find another video on youtube from someone in cordoba, argentina who filmed a similar object back in may 2015.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

decided to lay back and float to look at the stars. the night was very clear, out of the corner of my eye i saw something moving, i turned toward it and then saw 2 extremely bright (what looked like stars) moving across the sky very very fast. i asked my friend omg what is that??!!! she looked too. she saw the very same thing. then she says look there are 3 not 2. the 2 \"stars\" had a fainter \"star\" behind them moving just as quickly. i got out of the pool to grab my phone to video it. my phone would not pick up the \"stars\" we watched them over across the sky and stop. they hovered there for about 20 mins, then between the two brighter \"stars\" something fell out of no where. the falling object had no trail behind it, it was a fainter looking \"star\". we stood there watching the hovering \"stars\" for over 25 mins. when i grabbed my phone i noted the time. it was 3:14am. the object hoover to the west, just to the right of the moon but higher than the moon in the sky. the \"stars\" as they hovered there pulsated, slowly. then the one to the right would flutter blink, then become very very very bright. the 3rd fainter light stayed constant. i opened my sky map on my phone to help identify the \"stars\" they were not listed. the lights were positioned next to the lower right hand tip of the constellation libra and the very bottom of alphrad constellation. this was not a plane, it was to far away in the sky to be a plane, and it moved faster than a plane. and it stopped. i do not know what it dropped, but it was something. there was not a beam or trail when the object dropped from between the two bright lights. call me what you will. it was a ufo. we were speechless, absolutely speechless and shocked. im a believer point blank now. i know what i saw, i wasn't on drugs, i wasn't drunk. that was a ufo plain and simple....At first i was like omg what is that...Then i felt in awe, then when it drop something...I was a bit afraid. my friend said she felt

an hour, and had the windows partially down.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden, i caught something moving out of the corner of my eye, on the left.  it came from behind me (i assume, because i didn't actually

the last minute. the skies were clear, little to no wind and the weather was warm for the evening. it was almost a full moon too. even though the sun had set, there still was a yellow and orange color on the horizon towards the west; towards the east the sky was black and dark blue. \r\n\r\nas we started walking south, i spotted a small star-like white object heading in the same direction. i could only view the object with my binoculars. i attempted to capture and record it on my samsung galaxy note 5 but due to the moon light and light pollution i was unable to do so. eventually i lost sight of it. my daughter did not see it either.\r\n\r\nafter this my daughter decided we should walk the dog around our neighborhood starting at the cul-de-sac towards the north end of our street. we walked over there and i was admiring the very last minutes of a beautiful sunset. the view here was less obstructed so i had a better view of the horizon to the west.\r\n\r\nshortly thereafter, i noticed a white intense light moving from west to east. the light was heading straight for us. at first i thought it was an airplane but as it got closer, i still could not see any navigation lights. there was no sound coming from it as well. i started using my binoculars but all i could see was the white light.\r\n\r\nonce the object reached about 70 degrees above the horizon, i noticed what i thought to be the outline of a black triangle. the white light was coming from underneath it and the light appeared to be in the center. at this time i started to video record the object with my cell phone. almost at this exact same moment, my wife began calling me multiple times (western ringtone music in the video). i kept having to reject her calls to keep recording. my dog become agitated and my daughter was becoming worried too. this is the reason why the video is so shaky; i was dealing with all the above at the same time. in addition, we never heard any noise from the object, it was completely silent.\r\n\r\nyou could not see the outline of the black triangle with naked eye and the camera on the phone did not capture too. i was only able to observe it using the binoculars. i recorded the object as it flew directly overhead and as it started passing the moon. i had to stop at this point because the leash for my dog was wrapped around my legs and my daughter was upset. \r\n\r\ni lost visual contact with the object as it headed in a south east direction. the light began to flicker similar to a broken fluorescent bulb before it went completely dark.\r\n\r\ni then walked home which is approximately 100-200 yards. once i got home, i learned my wife had spotted the object from our backyard. she was attempting to call me to see if i saw the object too. thankfully, she recorded the object from her position. attached are the videos from our cellphones, both samsung galaxy note 5 models.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
