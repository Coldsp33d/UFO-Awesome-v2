rain.  the iss was supposed to be visible in my area at 9:41 pm.  the storm had ended and i went outside with my luna optics night vision camera/recorder... hoping the sky would be clearing and the iss viewable.  the sky was still total overcast, but i turned on my night vision camera (with the infrared light turned on), hoping maybe to see the iss thru the cloud layer.  the clouds were so dense i could not see stars or the iss, but as i moved the monocular camera around, i was surprised to see this bright, oval object in the northern sky.  i would estimate it was maybe 60 degrees above the horizon.  it appeared much larger than points of light i had been used to seeing.  my camera was at 5x magnification, but can zoom to 20x.  even at 5x it seemed to be as large as the moon would be at 1st quarter phase.  i was very excited at what i was seeing.  it hovered in one place, tilted to the right at maybe a 75-80 degree angle.  i tried to get a sharp focus, but due to seeing it thru the clouds, it always appeared a bit fuzzy.  after several minutes it had slowly descended (from my perspective) and was near the top of the trees in my yard.  i was excited to see this, because that proved to me that it was moving in space.  it then ascended back to its original position for maybe one minute, then descended again... this time going so low in the sky that it dipped behind the tree.  i was still able to see it thru the thin branches at the top of the tree... but then it went lower and i lost site of it completely.  i kept searching the sky to see if it would ascend again, but after a few minutes, i quit filming.  in the video, you can see occasional insects darting across the screen.  any time i use the infrared light, insects show up streaking across my view.  as i was observing the object, i tried turning off the infrared light to see if i could see it at all... but nothing was visible unless that light was switched on.  prior to this sighting, all i had seen and captured on video were satellites and planes crossing the night sky.  i went out again last night, hoping to see the glowing disc again, but only saw one satellite.  this whole experience was quite exhilarating.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

things unlike any \"creature\" or \"animal\" or typical walking alien you stereotypically see depicted on tv.  they don't look so concrete, almost as if they have some sort of black holographic cloak surrounding them.  when you look at them, it is like looking into a black void, you can't make it out and it doesn't make sense. i doubt they have wings, as their flight pattern doesn't suggest a wing flap type acceleration, because they are 50 times faster than any bird or land animal on earth. i noticed it first in a hotel bathroom, right before going on my first overseas trip to great britain at the age of 16. they are much smaller than humans, and pinpointing it in the bathroom was very difficult, but i could feel it brush by my shoulders and head. i became violently ill, not sure why.  i managed to make it to gb, a three week long trip away from my mom, and at that point she hadn't seen it and i never spoke of it, but unusual things occurred in gb. time went by, and i blocked it out of my memory, dismissing as some sort of demon because of religious brainwashing i endured growing up. in 2001, i had some mental instability and ended up in a psych unit, where i met a man claiming to be the entity. (20 page chapter in my book, but yes they can inhabit humans &#128532;) after a big ordeal, the man was released first, and then i was finally released as stable, and mom was there to pick me up. at night, she took me to a hotel, where there was an indoor pool and sauna.  i was the only person at the pool, the hotel itself was practically vacant. the black swarms began again, it would fly close to my head, disappear, reappear, and taunt me to the point where i told my mom i wasn't comfortable staying there.  \"your professor said you could sleep on his pull out couch, do you want me to call him?\" \"yes, please!\" she got on the interstate and i could see it flying around the car.  \"drive faster, mom, there is something chasing us!!!\" \"i see it!\" \"faster, go 85.\" she dropped me of at professor's, i took my knock out meds and got in bed.  i left a small light on the kitchen. prof's fam was asleep, i got under covers, closed my eyes, and felt something on legs. i opened eyes, and there he was, just sitting on my legs.  i yelled screamed, professor came in turned on lights and saw it.  i looked at prof and yelled  go away. the entity sat on my legs all night, if i yelled it clamped down on my legs, so i stopped yelling. i passed out, woke up at 4 am and it was still there.  by daylight it was gone.  prof was never well after that.  he lost his job and mind and moved into a nursing home at age 53.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":77099,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.1581616,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06172016-0003","longitude":-95.98603500000002,"occurred":978814800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1466162214000,"summary":"Did not see craft, only small black entity sitting on my legs for over 7 hours","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":13,"maxtempi":55,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":4,"meantempi":40,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-4,"mintempi":25,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":13,"maxtempi":55,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":4,"meantempi":40,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-4,"mintempi":25,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5640,"locationName":"Tulsa, Oklahoma","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:74465"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Boulder City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 10:50 pm on june 16, 2016 i was setting outside looking at jupiter and the moon. also looking a the big dipper. i live about 5 miles from lake mead. there were 3 to 5 planes in the area, over the lake. suddenly when i gazed up and looked at the big dipper i notice a dark triangle gliding quickly and silently from east to west towards the planet jupiter. the object had no lights but at each point of the triangle there was a oval shape on the surface. i believe the object was lit by reflected light from las vegas. i had to look twice before i realized i just saw a ufo. my wife just went to work and i called here to tell her about. plus i went to a neighbor and told them. as the object neared the planet jupiter it faded into the dark sky.

come outside but it had gone behind the big trees behind our house. we waited a 2-3 minutes and then we could see again. it was white cigar shape, with left end round and the right end triangle shape ( like a q-tip but bigger ends) it was horizontal. going straight really slow, then stop and hover for a couple minutes, then move again, hover etc.. it appeared to be shapeshifting or morphing and changing shapes. it would appear round, then elongated, the like a triangle. a large jumbo jet flew by the ufo and it appeared slightly bigger than a jet, but i dont know if its because it was closer than the plane, therefore it looked bigger. at one point the triangle shape to the right moved away from the object (maybe 100-200 ft) and disappeared. it was too far away to guess the actual size but it appeared big at least 100 ft long. it looked too big to be a drone or helium balloons. its weird shapeshifting ruled out it being a blimp. it was a windy day but stayed stationary when it stopped to hover. \r\nit was solid white and changing shape either from rotating and showing different sides or actual morphing. it hard to explain the shape. the sun was behind me and it was not reflecting sunlight on the surface. if i held my arm straight out and compared it to my thumb. it was about 1 inch long using my thumb as a reference. as wide as my thumb. my husband got the binoculars but the ufo was too faraway and a little blurry from the morphing changing shapes to make out more details. no lights. was heading south toward the ohio river and pittsburgh, pa. i watch it for about 10 minutes until it moved south and my view was obscured by more big trees. i live about 10 blocks 1 mile from the confluence of the ohio river and beaver river. another time, we were walking the dog near a small sandy beach on the ohio river and a big orange glowing soccor ball size meteor or ufo flew over our heads and went in the river. i keep looking outside for it in case it comes

then all of the sudden i noticed 3 bright star looking things i thought they were stars at first but they were to bright to be stars i watched it sit in one spot for about 1 min they it started moving and dimming it got a bit faster then just dissapeard.The same thing happend within minutes of the first one then minutes after that it had happened again.When i looked at it sitting there it made me feel scared i just stared at it i didn't know what to do only one of my friends had seen it and she only seen one of them.Now today on the 16th of june i was laying on my recliner at about 1:20 with my eyes closed then all of the sudden i couldn't move or scream i really wanted to but i couldn't. my head was intensely vibrating and ringing and it kinda hurt. along with the sounds i saw a picture of a submarine sitting at the bottom of the sea it wasn't rotted at all then it just got very bright and everything was white and i began to get flashes of a series of 3 or 4 pictures i saw one that looked like a chart but i'm not really sure i couldn't really make out what it was.Then another that i saw what had looked like an alien.It had an elongated head long chin and huge eyes.I was only able to see the face,the third picture was a nuclear sign.The vibrating and sounds stopped for a second but then it started again with the same pictures it went on for a bit and then it was gone slowly i began to regain my ability to see,move,and talk then my body began to tingle started from my legs up that went away away quickly.In my opinion i think the weirdest thing about this is that my dad and mom were in the room. now my head is pounding and i have something like a headache but it's more in the middle of my head and on my temples. i'm am not 18 yrs or older and neither were my

right above us. there was no downdraft of apparent propulsion anywhere we could see and then it picked up speed away from us. we believe the pilots noticed they were being watched and have since changed their flight path because we haven't seen it in the same place again. we tried to follow in our cars but it was moving faster than we could follow. my radio presets were all erased when i

moving south, south-east. it looked like a plane except the light did not flash or pulsate and there were no colors. it moved faster than a normal plane but maybe as fast as a fighter jet. after moving in a straight line at a steady speed for about 20 seconds it faded out within the next 4 seconds, becoming unperceivable against the night sky.\r\n\r\n it could have been a military jet at high altitude burning its afterburners for a short duration but there was no sound and no light after it faded.\r\n\r\n also, i don't know how long it was illuminated before i noticed it.\r\n\r\n the sun had set not long ago and the object was slightly in the western sky, so it might have been the sun reflecting off the bottom of a satellite until it reached a sharp enough angle to go dark.\r\n\r\n i don't know what it was, but planes don't fade out unless they change directions. and, it didn't have extreme movements like is mentioned in typical ufo reports.\r\n\r\n i watched the video of the lights seen by the group on june 4, 2016 in the arizona desert and it looked very much like that. i have seen a similar light about a year ago in the same area, but thought it was either a satellite or a slow moving meteor that burned out. since i watched the video of the recent arizona incident, i thought i might mention it to mufon. it didn't seem extremely unnatural or man-made, so i wouldn't
