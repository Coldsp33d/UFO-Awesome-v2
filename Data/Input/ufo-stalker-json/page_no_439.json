street to the neighborhood gas station to get a pack of smokes and then returned to the pool parking lot at about 7:42 or so. i parked my car and started to take my walk, that i pre planned on doing, for the duration of my daughters practice. when i reached the end of the parking lot, i crossed the street and walked to the left up e.Greenleaf drive towards tuscanny drive. as i was approaching the stop sign at the end of the street, which sits at the top of a slight hill, light reflecting off of an object in the sky caught my eyes. i stopped in my tracks by the stop sign so i could observe the object. it was, what i believe to be, a metallic object that was orb shaped and highly reflective hovering off in the distance just above a development of town houses and trees off of tuscanny drive. when i was convinced that it was a ufo i proceeded to get my phone off my hip to take a video of the object. i put my phone in video mode, pressed the record button and lifted it to the sky and pointed it at the orb...But upon aiming the phone at the orb, my screen was completely black. so i lowered my camera to check the settings. everything was the way it was suppose to be but my screen was still black. i then checked the lens and everything was fine with that so i turned the phone off and then back on to start the process all over again all while occasionally glancing up to make sure that i didnt loose sight of the orb. once my phone was back on i put it in video mode again and pressed record, but this time i made sure that the screen wasnt black and it was recording before i raised my phone to the sky. once i was sure it was working correctly i looked up while raising the camera but the orb was gone...Or invisible. i stood there for about 5 minutes searching the skies to see if i could locate it again. disappointed upon not finding it, i continued my walk by making a left on tuscanny drive. so excited by what i saw, i called my friend, after making a left onto christophers crossing off of tuscanny, to tell him what i saw and how unfortunate i was at my unsuccessful attempt to record the orb. by the time i made a complete circle and reached tuscanny again, which was at about 8:16pm or so and still on the phone with my friend, i looked up and was searching for the orb again. after i walked about 50 yards on tuscanny from e. greenleaf dr., i saw it again or maybe even a different one. this time it was much further away and was traveling to my right and was pulsating from bright to not being visible back to bright again. i didnt attempt to film it this time because it was just to far away and i didnt believe my phone could have captured anything because of it being so far away. i observed its flight path and it pulsating in and out of a visible spectrum for about 10-15 seconds before it completely vanished from my sight. i stood there looking for about five minutes but it never appeared again. i couldnt stand there and wait to see if it would appear again like i wanted to because i had to finish my walk and get back to the pool to pick my daughter up.","distance":"Over One
