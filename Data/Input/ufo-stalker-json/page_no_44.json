some coffee and looked out the living room window (which is visible from the kitchen) and saw lights. her phones were on the table, she picked one up and began taking pictures as she walked further out into the living room.  she took 5 pictures.  what she saw scared her badly and when she gets scared like that, she doesn't talk about it until she has thought about it for awhile.  she didn't wait to see what it would do, or go, she simply stopped taking pictures ad came into the kitchen. \r\nshe never told me about it that day, the next evening she showed me the pictures.  \r\nshe had been taking pictures for a few years now, and she was recently taking pictures at night since the meteor shower.  she has caught quite a few orbs and possibly  some drones ,(or what i would think would be drones,) these things are kind of amazing to see, but i realize she has some of them quite zoomed in, so i realize that causes distortions, but even so, she has way too many pictures for it all to be just overpixilated junk.  i've looked back in her pictures and see quite the number of odd things. i took some video last night trying to film what looks like a star but likely a drone, and couldn't get to visualize for video, but could get a still picture.  in the meantime, an orb presented itself and i have footage of that. just seems like an awful lot of orbs, drones, and \"star drones\" around here.  i have just moved in with her in september, waiting for a house i bought that both of us could combine in gets rehabbed. i had noticed a few pictures also in the past that are questionable, but figured camera error.  just seems like a lot more activity, or im just more aware, or both. i attempted to take a video of the star drone she watches last night, and it was just too dark to see it for video, but was able to snap a picture of it, but also what i thought was street light coming through the bushes was actually another orb, that morphed into several shapes, and as i turned the camera/phone in towards the house, a mirror image shows at the end of the video, which if i was taking it as a reflection off the glass i would expect a mirror image, but since the camera was actually pointed in the house, i would have expected it to be a normal pic, but wasn't, and to top that, some things in the room are normal, looking into the kitchen, is an unfamiliar kitchen, i have no idea what the hell that is.  i had noticed on some of her pictures in the past i would see some kind of area at the bottom or it was refection or something, but i have seen it before in her pictures, and just kind of blew it off, again thinking crazy camera error or whatever. i should mention my sister is handicapped. she is not fearful, except for the incident i mention earlier in this paragraph.  i thank you for your time in reviewing this, and she is too. very much appreciated!\r\n   ","distance":"101-500

made my way up the dirt i couldn't help by notice a deep indention in the mud that was not there the day before, or before i turned in for the night. it was the shape of a small foot sunken into the fresh mud from the evening rain. i think it was some kind of print from a flexible boot. it measured about seven inches in length and at its widest point ( what would be the ball of the foot) 3 inches. i was taken back, almost like an excitement of shock. you see we have no small children on our farmland, and i don't think a very small child would come in the middle of the night on dark farmland during heavy rain showers. i also know for certain it is not an animal track. within the print you can see the edges are 100% smooth (edge of boot) what would be the sole, one can see like one solid marking from heel to toe, it has a curve as like your gym shoe along the side the side, and it also has lines almost like a strange traction. immediately i called my wife out, we began to take photos and videos. we then went to a hobby store and bought plaster cast material. i was able to pull a mold of the print, the ball of the foot, arch and heal is able to be easily seen. almost as if it was a highly flexible boot or something. we are located very, very close to the kennedy space center and launch pads, a lot is seen and heard in these skies and i have never thought twice, but

very bright glowing circle/oval to the nw heading in my direction. it reminded me of something i caught on video during the summer that ended up disappearing from my gallery. it was actually the exact same thing i had seen during the summer. the thing i first noticed was that there were no lights blinking, so i knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter. it was just a bright white glow as if a star had come down from space and was instead low in the sky and on a straight path. the second thing i noticed was that as it got closer, everything was silent. my parent's house is in a very quiet area. there is no sound whatsoever. the thing moved like it was almost just floating along. it was much lower in the sky than any plane would ever be in the area. in the video, the thing moves straight passed the moon headed directly for a star. when i say \"and it's going\" at 58 seconds, it almost unnoticeably changes direction and ends up passing between the moon and star instead. near the end of the sighting i was watching the object in the sky and noticed that my phone was still accidentally capturing the bright star the object had passed by. i looked away from the object for a few seconds to try and adjust my phone to continue capturing the object and within that time the object had in some way disappeared. it was just gone. there was no cloud cover. if was like it hit a delete button and was immediately gone. \r\n\r\nsecond sighting:\r\n1 hour drive away from first sighting january 28th 2017 6:14pm\r\n i was driving west on the highway when my child said \"hey that looks like that thingy we saw at grandma's!\" \r\nit indeed did. it was a bit different experience because rather than being pitch black dark in a quiet area it was sunset in the city. it was moving north to south right out in front of us. no blinking lights again, and low. i managed to get a bit of video but when the thing went behind the clouds it never came out the other side. the clouds weren't large or anything either. it would have taken maybe 5-7 seconds for the thing to pass through to the other side. it behaved in the same way, looked the same, no sound, just a bright glowing star like low flying object. i will send the second video by email to an area investigator.

a large shutdown so we had work trailers out in the field and at the time there was very little light by the trailers. i remember i was by myself as everyone was in the power plant. i went in between 2 trailers, 4 meters apart so i could see the stars better and just as i did that i noticed a huge glowing orange/reddish looking metallic disk come floating over the smoke stack from out of no where, 500 feet high, very slowly and then hovered down near me at about 200 feet up in the air. the ship was huge, id estimate it at 500 feet diameter. it also appeared to have windows that became see through for a few minutes and i could see a reddish light glow in the ship and the beings controlling the ship i could not see well, just faint shadows of what appeared to be humanoid. the ship had a very quiet hum, it was almost silent.\r\n\r\n i don't do drugs, i was not drinking or anything and don't hallucinate, i knew what i was seeing was real. i almost felt like my family returned to visit me kinda feeling. i remember asking it in my mind to fly in a circle over the trailers and then go up and down and it did what i asked to acknowledge it knew where i was and was conscious of me. i remember thinking thank you for doing that and then it took off in the field slowly and then gained speed and shot upwards on the horizon and then a bright white flash in the sky and it was gone. iv had many ufo interactions and encounters all over saskatchewan and alberta but this one was the most personal encounter iv had so far. iv included a painting someone made for me randomly after i told
