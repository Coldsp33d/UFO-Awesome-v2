along this band, each originating or first observed near to a vortext-like swirl opening in the cloud of almost identical size and visual. a fourth such swirl was seen in another, lesser band, but observation of any object that might be there not possible due to nearness to blinding sun. regardless the unusual similarity of the swirls and common nearness to uap deserves mention. this main cloud lay precisely along the descent portion of landing approach to pdx used by overseas and california pass jets, and was at the same altitude they would be at when there. parallel to the main cloud line

about 30 degrees above horiz. described as orange spot that had seemed to slowly move east untill hidden by tree, that it was at times lost in thicker portions of cloud, no apparant chang in size. i knew where there was a better viewpoint in the treeline another 50 yards further within the trees. proceeding there, he remained in case visual reacquired. once relocated i scanned the site he indicated and saw nothing.\r\n...\r\nas he had indicated it moved eastward, scanned my view on assumption it might have sped up. just at eastern most portion of cloud along that path, just as concluding no object, the last thing i was looking at was a swirl. at that postion just then, almost adjacent, a white triangular shape twisted into existance in a fraction of a second. it then twisted more gently as a yellow rectangular shape appeared just as oddly at the lower portion of the triangle. my first impression was, mystery solved: sky divers, though at their apparant distance by size, i should have been able to see at least one man, none visible. it was also odd that they both remained in their associated relationship as if adjoined. but as they at first seemed to descend, i started to return to my friend with such explanation. i glanced back just before leaving useful vantage and noted that the 'chutes' were not descending, but smaller - as if traveling south instead of descending. the triangle had vanished, and seconds later the yellow part was swallowed by the cloud. remarkable updraft, i reasoned. calculated object to be over west linn when 1st seen, at about 1000 feet, if chutes. but given cloud interactions and cloud altitude, later realised too large to be chutes.\r\n...\r\nrejoining my friend, i offered the skydiver accounting only to find he was looking at yet another object just acquired. in the same cloud band both north and east of my observation was an orange rectangle of the same aspect ratio as the yellow 'chute'. however, it was much smaller and seemed well above the clouds. there was visible a small dark dot low and centered appropriately to be a sky diver, and i thought it seemed to rotate a bit as if steered or blown like a chute. however, my friend refuted the notion, noting it was getting smaller and smaller; it was ascending, not descending. indeed this was slowly happening, with possibly a slight westward. we both lost it at the

object/object pair. if like objects as presumed by common shape/color band, 2nd object was closer and lower than first. third object almost overhead, slightly east of us. though 2nd and 3rd events had attributes of chutes, they could not defy gravity as seen. the second observance indicates a fairly large size of several hundred feet and an ability to wink in and morph. however, the space between observances in time leaves open the possibility only one object was seen winking in and out at multiple locations. the proximity of near identical cloud swirls would seem to tie to winking in, and all

and witnessed a neighbours abduction. i live in the city so the houses are very close together and it's densely populated. one craft pulled up to the neighbours conservatory and seemed to unsteadily tilt to one side (i was later told by the et's that this was the result of a faulty rotational balance in the craft). it hovered over their conservatory for only a few minutes before the craft lit up in a bright, white light and disappeared out of our reality in the blink of an eye, taking my neighbour with them. then, another craft approached my house and i was telepathically instructed \"hazel, go back to bed we're coming for you next.\"\r\n\r\ni seemed to have no control over this and felt compelled to get back into bed and fall instantly asleep. the next thing i remember is them coming into my room through the walls. the room looked as though it was folding away and made of cardboard. i was completely paralyzed and unable to move, i tried to scream but i couldn't use my vocals either, i could just about squint my eyes open to see that the room was disappearing around me and the beings approaching me.\r\n\r\ni then have memory loss after that point.\r\n","distance":"21-100

lights were headed straight towards us. she reached over to get a cigarette and i turned to look at her then turned to continue to look at the lights and they were gone. we were both shocked that we could not fine them at all. i looked all around thinking maybe it was a plane and i could see the blinking lights on the plane and nothing. then i thought... i would soon hear the plane fly over us and there was nothing. we looked every where for a plane. there was no lights and no sound. it was like those lights disappeared. we have set there many times and watched planes fly by us from kansas city. we know exactly what they do. this was no airplane and it was gone in a flash. we looked everywhere in the sky for it. then tonight june 12th. i watched a light move from north to south and it just slowly disappeared in the sky. still no flashing lights and no sound of airplane. i dont know what it was, but thought i would tell you what i saw, so if anyone else seen it, you would have

side of the screen a changing ufo so decided to continue to watch if the signal stays or not and if any more ufos will show up . \r\nsoon the fast flashes begun going around the screen very quickly , most at first were coming from the left side shooting upwards across the screen , some then even appeared in the middle of the screen , again most went upwards , later on larger ufos flashed brightly zooming by ascending or going across , it was awesome :) \r\nin the approximate time i've counted 18 ufos that i could see go by in front of the iss .\r\ni've tried my best to take screenshots but because of the speed of how they tend to move in space \r\ni didn't get all of them , then again some i did caught but noticed them later on when reviewing the these screenshots . \r\nwhen i left the site 1 main ufo remained on the screen . total time of watching was about 12 min.
