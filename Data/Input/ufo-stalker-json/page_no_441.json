smoking cigarettes. we recently moved to this house in a rural area outside of corvallis so on clear nights the star gazing is pretty awesome. i looked up and saw an incredibly bright star-like object moving pretty fast directly overhead. it was as bright as polaris is out here on clear nights. i pointed it out to my wife and it began to slow down. my wife took no intrest in it and went back inside. it continued on a straight-line path at a much slower speed. at this point i pulled out my phone to take a video of the object, but my phone camera was having a hard time picking up the image. i stood up and walked further out in the yard and zoomed in, hoping it would be visible. while i was looking at my phone trying to get a good shot of the object, i could not see it. when i looked at the sky again it was gone.\r\n\r\ni feel like i should mention that i saw a ufo when we were living in corvallis about six months ago. ever since that day i have always been watching the sky. there had been a recent increase in air traffic in this area, so i have seen many planes and know what they look like. i have also seen many satellites and i have never seen one this bright. my wife thinks it was just a satellite and thinks i have an \"overactive imagination\" although she has never said it to me. i know she doesn't believe me, but i understand. if i didn't watch the night sky as often as i do, i probably would have thought it was a bright satellite. but i have never seen a satellite that bright or change speed before. \r\n\r\nthe video footage i took is pretty useless, but i attached it anyway.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

foot fence. i saw; what at first glance was a mylar balloon ascending from about a quarter mile away. it had the speed or motion of  ball released under water. it then leveled out and came east; toward me. it moved fairly quickly slightly north of me. davis monthan air force base is about 3/4 of a mile directly south and i would liken the speed of the object like that of an a10 going by, only lower and no sound. it started to sparkle more or flicker raising in altitude as it continued east. as it got further east and higher in the sky i noticed that it was not as high as the cloud cover. it then seemed to stop and remain stationary for 4-5 seconds. at this point i would guess it to be about 3-5 miles away and the only reason i could still make it out at all was from the continuous flickering or random reflecting it was producing. the mylar balloon theory was crushed after it leveled out and started coming my direction when it was to the west. when it was as close as it got to me, i would guess the size to be at least ten times larger than an average balloon but smaller than a car. finally, as the object continued to move; after the short stationary pause, it seemed to go into the cloud. i figured that would be the last i saw it but about 10 or 15 seconds later i saw it again what seemed to be twice as far away. 7-10 miles only noticeable because of the flashing. it then continued away till i got hot and dunked under the water.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"June 9, 2016 (data recorded at 11:36 p.M.)\r\n\r\nmy life partner and i set out tonight to consciously look for ufos and to stargaze as we often do. sedona is a dark sky city as well as one of the e.T. capitols of the world, so we often engage in long, late night drives in this place. we began our drive around 9:25 p.M. and did a loop of the village, went to west sedona, and then came back to the area in between the main part of sedona and the village (near the chapel of the holy cross). we drove here for well over an hour. we saw several small ufos which may have been shooting stars… the high number of them that we saw made it likely that a few were e.T. aircraft but i have no solid proof for this other than my own personal feelings. after we engaged in this behavior, we headed towards the village on 89a. we were the only ones on the road for several miles and we were in between cathedral rock and bell rock. i could see cathedral rock’s shadowy outline out of the corner of my right eye slightly behind us. my partner (the driver of our car) spotted a very bright light off in the distance in the sky. from our vantage point it seemed to be hovering over the cliff walls to the right of bell rock (to the right when heading towards the village). it also appeared to be 2-3 miles away.   it was brighter than sirius and venus combined together and it just sat there motionless. it was impossible to immediately tell exactly how high it was but it was definitely far too low for an ordinary plane. my partner stopped the car in the middle of 89a (there was no one else around) and we stared at it… trying to discern whether it was a man-made craft or not. i began to get the feeling that it was not. it was definitely not a helicopter (no noise and it did not behave at all like a helicopter). i decided to go out on a limb and i yelled out the window (we had the windows and sunroof down), “i see you family!” (this was in reference to extraterrestrials who i consider to be my “star family.”) the instant i said that, the white light became so bright that i had to look away for a moment because it hurt my eyes… it was almost like whoever was inside the craft hit a switch that turned the craft lights on to full power. the white light appeared to be emanating from a dome shaped structure on the top of the craft. when i looked back a split second later, the craft was rapidly descending and heading straight for our car at astonishing speed. it reached us in about 3 seconds. chris scooted the car forward a few feet since a tree was starting to get in the way (the breeze blew the branches into my line of sight). the craft sped so quickly to us that it was almost scary. it was completely silent and flew at a very low altitude. it was pretty large and definitely not a drone. it was shaped almost like an upside down “y” and had a definite triangular presence to it and we saw blinking lights in the corners of the “wings” as it literally came to a point right above our car. the craft slowed down above our car. it didn’t stop but it came at us with the seeming intention of letting us know that its passengers saw us. it started to curve over us a little bit almost like it was going to head towards airport mesa behind us. i turned to my partner to see their face (full of pure awe) and when i turned around to see where the craft went, it was completely gone. no man made craft can move that quickly and we had clear visibility from every direction for many miles. even if the craft had shut off all of the lights, we would have still been able to see the outline due to a bit of backlighting from the uptown/west sedona area (it is a dark sky city but if you are headed in the direction of the shopping/tourist areas there is a bit of light pollution). the craft was completely silent the entire time. my partner stated that if we had hit a baseball hard enough, we probably could have hit it. if it had flown towards cathedral rock it would have crashed into it because of how low it was. the fact that it shined its light as brightly as it could the minute i addressed it and the fact that it literally zoomed to our car like a little white fireball was extremely intriguing. my partner remembers a blue light, white light, and green light. i saw the massive white light and the green light, but instead of blue i saw a couple of red lights blinking. this may have been because my own vantage point was slightly different. my partner resumed driving because there was no point in just sitting there and when i looked at the car clock it said 11:11 p.M. on the dot which we found to be very synchronous. everything was seen with our naked eyes. i had my partner draw a model of the craft we saw (very quickly) when we got home while the image was fresh. when we got home i instantly raced to the internet to look up triangle shaped craft… apparently it is one of the most common craft-types seen here in sedona and some people have reported seeing e.T.S shortly after these types of sightings. there was a report made last year (much like what i have described) here in sedona. the interesting thing is that it takes almost the exact path that ours did (except backwards… from airport mesa direction towards cathedral) and is very close to the same location where our sighting occurred. that particular sighting also had several witnesses. something very interesting to note is that the ufo sighting in that report that had several witnesses also occurred in june last year… around 10 p.M. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

up to an area a couple of miles from our camp to scope out a clearing by the road where we had seen several deer beds in the area that day, to decide if we wanted go on a stand there early the next morning.\r\n  this road was fairly high up in the hills and, because of the direction we parked, faced west down the columbia river towards troutdale and the portland airport, both of which we could see clearly. we hadn't had anything to drink or that could impair our senses or powers of observation.\r\n  one of my friends, who was seated in the middle of the front seat between myself and our other friend and was therefore unable to see the clearing, was watching the lights of troutdale and the portland airport and the lights of airplanes as they landed and departed.\r\n  suddenly he exclaimed loudly \"what the heck was that\" and punched me and our other friend in the arm to get our attention. when we asked him what he had seen, he said \"just watch the lights in the sky down by the airport\".\r\n  as we all watched the lights, one of them  suddenly, instantaneously, jumped to the right, a distance that we all agreed was about one to two miles. it remained in that position for a short time, a minute or two, then suddenly jumped straight up about the same distance, remained at that height for a short time, then suddenly jumped downward about the same distance. these maneuvers continued for several minutes, each time leaving a brief streak on the retinas of our eyes . i and my friends all saw these maneuvers at the same time, exclaiming \"oh\" or \"what the heck\" at the same time. we could also tell the light was moving towards us. it eventually passed over a hilltop to our left at a height of about 400 to 500 feet above our position. as it passed over, we heard a sort of hum-buzz sound, unlike any airplane or helicopter we had ever heard. the light it emitted was a strong, white, non-directional glow, not a beam. we never saw the shape or size of the craft itself, just the bright glow of the light it emitted.\r\n  a few years later, about 1991, i happened to overhear a fellow employee talking to another employee about an experience he had one night while he was working working aboard a fishing boat in the gulf of alaska. as he described this experience, i realized he was describing, almost word for word, exactly the same thing my friends and i had witnessed in the mountains above carson washington in 1984.
