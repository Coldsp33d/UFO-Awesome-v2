2nd to the 6th, 2016 with friends.\r\n\r\non saturday evening, our small ce-5 oc team went out to the \r\nskywatch at about 10:00 pm after the evening presentations were done. \r\na lady from sedona, az was holding a planned demonstration of her \r\nnight vision scopes. the crowd was rather “loud” and in a party atmosphere. \r\nshe was using a p.A. to \"talk over\" the noise \r\nof the large group that was present.\r\n\r\nthere were a number of night scopes available and there was \r\na lot of \"tire kicking\" going on, mostly looking up, for moving objects.\r\nthe sky was pretty exceptional; mars was like a “red piece of coal” \r\nto the south. the milky-way was pretty bright as it was the \r\n“new moon night”, being june 4th. the orion overlook is on a rise, \r\non the j.T.R.C. property, overlooking the campground, in the wash, \r\nbelow, and faces pretty much north.\r\n\r\nat about 10:10 pm. things started happening!  i was sitting \r\nwith friends on the dirt road at the edge of the concrete pad \r\nfor the orion overlook.\r\n\r\nas the lady was demonstrating the night vision scopes, \r\nsomeone yelled that there was something coming out of the west \r\n(from the highway 62 direction). a orb of light appeared, flying \r\nquite low, moving at maybe 30 to 50 mph, heading east-ward. \r\ni think that the first one i saw was green.\r\n\r\ni was sitting in my camp chair still trying to set up my camera \r\nand i saw it coming from the far left.  it was to the left of a \r\nyoung tree on the edge of the road and i was seeing it pass \r\nbehind this tree (at my angle through the branches)...\r\nthen it passed cleanly to the right of the tree.  i tried to re-focus \r\nmy binoculars.. everything behind it was sharp, but the lighted \r\nobject was fuzzy.  it was cruising at what i estimate at about \r\n500 feet off the ground (agl) and maybe 1,000 feet in front of us,\r\nacross the campground wash (from l to r), but appeared to be still  \r\nin front of the far hillside.\r\n\r\nthen, again, someone yelled \"there’s another one\" (same path)!\r\nthis one i think was blue. i tried to get my camera screwed \r\nonto the tripod; i could not get the threads to catch - darn -\r\nand people were all shouting...What a joke...Finally, the threads \r\ncaught!  i wasn’t expecting to see anything and was ill-prepared \r\nto say the least with my olympus point & shoot. i got my camera \r\nturned on, in video mode, and just left it run for a while.\r\n\r\ni thought i might catch something...As bright as the orbs were.\r\nin the end, all i got was the sound of the crowd and a couple \r\nof dots of light! i stopped and started the video several times, \r\nas i was not sure how much space i had remaining on my \r\nsd card.\r\n\r\nthen, someone yelled \"there’s another – there’s another\", \r\nwhile laughing. sure enough, they just kept coming... \r\nanother and another showed up...\r\ndon’t remember all the colors; i lost track of how many.\r\nmy friend were chorgling…and laughing…i heard my name \r\ncalled out…\r\n\r\ni was thinking to myself - \"were they drones?\r\nmy little drone has red & green lights, it can’t fly that high…\r\nor that steady…(not with me as pilot!)\". these were flying, \r\nliterally for \"miles\". mine doesn’t have the battery life or \r\ni thought, \"who would be flying these things for our benefit \r\nor embarrassment...If these were professional or military \r\ngrade drones..Why did we not see the craft or air-frame?\"  \r\ni do remember seeing one of our people's green laser \r\npointers reflected off of one...Something shiny… like a \r\n\"baby moon\" hubcap.  \"was it a force field?\" i thought...\r\n\r\nthey seemed to be flying along the same glide-path (like geese) \r\nspaced about about 20 to 25 seconds apart.\r\nthey all appeared to be of equal radiance; green, blue and gold \r\ncolored ’orbs of light’; maybe a reddish-gold one too. \r\ni saw at least four of them, maybe more.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound (well, no sound i could hear over the \r\nchatter of the 60 or so people, screaming and laughing).  \r\nsome people were trying to be quiet without much success.\r\n\r\nmy binoculars were in focus, but the orbs were still soft-edged.\r\ni could see sort of energy rings \"modulating\" around in them,\r\nwhen using my binoculars.  the light was pretty bright and \r\nsteady, otherwise.\r\n\r\nsome guys flashed their green laser pointers at them.\r\nthe lady, excitedly said, stop laser-ing!...Wait until you are \r\nsure that they are not aircraft...With flashing red & green lights!\r\n\r\nshe then, gave them the go-ahead to signal…three pulses of light...\r\n(dot-dot-dot) and some of the orbs did respond, likewise!\r\ni saw at least one of the orbs responded back to the three pulses \r\nof light with three bright pulses (back to dimmer light) of its own.\r\nyeow!   my chest was about to explode, i had forgot to breathe!\r\n\r\ni did not see the following happen, but someone in the group \r\nwas saying that when the orbs moved off to the right \r\n(beyond my view through all the people) that they slowed down \r\ntheir speeds, joined up and sped off \"like jets\"; or, \r\nin three different directions...Maybe into a triangle \r\nand then moving off??? just hear-say...As i didn't see them \r\ndo any maneuvers.\r\n\r\ni hope that the lady's \"crew\" has some video come out!!!\r\n\r\nthere were about 2,500 people in attendance at the \r\n‘contact in the desert iv‘ event. the temperature got into the \r\ntriple-digits during mid-day, but it got quite cool at night.\r\n\r\nthe short video segments i recorded are large files and not worth much,  \r\nexcept to verify that there were a lot of excited people in attendance \r\nand announcing the \"next arrivals\".\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

continuously-luminous flying objects approached joshua tree retreat center (jtrc) at very high speed over the western horizon (direction of yucca valley). the objects arrived singly, one after the other, and in pairs at irregular intervals over the approximate 10-minute period. none of the objects exhibited standard red, green or white blinking aircraft navigation lights. each object flew exceedingly smoothly, silently and rapidly towards the east and then each turned smoothly toward the north/northeast when they arrived directly north of the jtrc grounds. the distance to the flying craft was estimated to be less than two miles, but could have been as little as one mile away at their closest approach to the jtrc. throughout their approach from the west and eventual disappearance to the north, the objects emitted a continuous pale bluish/green to soft amber light. the craft were sufficiently bright and large to be very easily observed without the assistance of night-vision optics or binoculars. at irregular intervals during their flight trajectories, each craft displayed bright flashes of an iridescent green glow. the glowing flashes did not appear to emanate from a fixed point on the craft, but rather seemed to be diffuse in nature and sweep over the craft in an uneven manner. the flash duration was about 1 second or less. as mentioned above, the craft were fairly close (estimated 1-2 miles) and when the green flashes occurred, it was just possible to make out some kind of hull structure to the craft, i.E., the craft did not appear as sharp points of light or amorphous balls of light. when the craft were targeted by one or more hand-held lasers, they sometimes flashed green. but they also flashed a green glow at times when they were not illuminated by lasers. from its first appearance on the western horizon, each object took about 30 seconds (or possibly less) to complete its west-to-east flyby past the jtrc, perform the sweeping northerly turn, and subsequently gradually disappear over the northern horizon. the estimated distance of the objects when they first appeared over the western horizon was 5 miles. similarly, the estimated distance to the point of disappearance in the north was also 5 miles, resulting in a total (visible) flight trajectory of 10 miles. assuming this distance was traveled in 30 seconds or less, the minimum speed of the objects may be estimated at about 1200 miles per hour. importantly, no sound of any kind was detected as the objects flew past, which would be consistent with an unconventional (i.E., non-jet engine) type of propulsion system.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path

approximately 3 times brighter than jupiter (which was up) and very bright white yellow orange and had a slight tail pointing south. i instantly thought fireball, but the object was slowing down, so i instantly thought this object was space junk. this object was \"dropping\" what appeared to be hot material that was same color as the object. the object continued to slow down and dripped the strange material two times on its trajectory before the object slowed to a complete static stop. i was baffled to say the least. as the object remained stationary it dripped the bright material momentarily. the flight time from when i saw the object to when it came to a complete static stop was approximately 10 seconds - which is far too long of a time for any fireball or space junk, which i've witnessed countless times. i observed this object stationary for approximately 2 minutes in absolute amazement. i had my iphone in my hand and shot one still photo of the object prior to it coming to a complete stop and i shot video as well. all you can see is a small dot due to iphone camera not suited for shooting in dark. it also showed up on the video. while observing the object stationary for approximately 2 minutes i decided to take a chance a run in the house a grab a real camera, which only took about 2 minutes to retrieve, when i went back outside it was gone and i have no idea what happened to it. i've been a dedicated amateur astronomer for over 40 years and i know the sky well. also visible were commercial jetliners in the sky in the same general area of the sky. this was neither a fireball or space junk - they don't slow down and come to a complete stop in the sky as this object did. it was not the moon, which was up and in different part of the sky. it was not

i am the owner of ufo sighting tours in sedona, az.  i have completed 588 tours with the use of pvs 7, gen. 3 military night vision goggles (nvgs).  i was hired by the citd conference to run their night vision events at this year’s 2016 conference running june 2 thru 6, 2016.  the previous 4 listed reports on this site from joshua tree, ca were from attendees of the saturday, june 4th event that i led.  i know many additional people that were in attendance who may be contacted for reports/interviews and i may provide phone numbers.  i am a trained observer and a past mufon investigator.  i was a past member of the board for mufon oc, ca.\r\non june 4th well over 100 people were gathered at orion’s point lookout, a location at the joshua tree retreat center.  at approx. 10:00 or just prior, most of the attendees witnessed what i am about to describe.  there were 18 pairs of nvgs provided, as well as many individuals privately owned goggles present.  yet the following were clearly visible with the naked unaided eye and were seen by most present without equipment.  the following sightings lasted approx. 20 minutes total time.  i was busy leading the group and instructing them on a pa system and did not note the time, but many of those present informed me after the fact.  videos of this event are surfacing and are being gathered.  a professional documentary film crew was present on behalf of citd and achieved footage of these sightings, but i have not seen it.  i will provide it as soon as it is available.\r\nas i witnessed it:  approaching from the west and flying east across the valley in front of us, and coming low over a hill, were the following large colored lights flying extremely fast.  first to appear was a blue light, then shortly thereafter a red or amber light, and then 2 bright green ones.  after a brief pause of a few minutes came 2 more green ones followed by a single green one, again, flying over the hill at an extremely rapid speed.  this second grouping then slowed way down and came together to form a distinct triangle formation and continued to fly across the valley maintaining this formation traveling all the way in a very slow even pace.  eventually this formation disappeared from vision right in front of us.  i was not holding nvgs at the time, but those that were said this triangle formation was seen speeding up and shooting up off into space.  many said that somewhere in this mix was a purple light, but i did not see that.  this was a total thus far of about 7 clearly visible craft.\r\npeople were yelling out, applauding and very excited during these events.  after a about 5 minutes had passed, jimmy church, popular radio talk show host and his wife rita approached me.  a friend of theirs’s had called them on her cell and told them to come quick!  i informed them they just missed some remarkable sightings.  when suddenly in comes yet another large green light from over the same hill to the west.  and shortly after even another green light.  they witnessed these 2 green lights (naked eye) along with other objects that they saw using the nvgs over the next 10 mins.  soon after those 2 green ones, a very large amber light came right over us all and very quickly disappeared right above us.  including this amber one, the total crafts sighted in about 20 minutes was well over 10.  all 10 major sightings were way, way, way too fast to be satellites, completely silent, went from hauling in to slowing down to a snail’s pace immediately, and then completely disappeared before us.  all of which are things military jets and satellites can not do!  we started viewing that night at 8:30 p.M. and didn’t stop till 11:30 p.M. and continued to have sightings on and off the whole while.  i educate everyone on all the various type of planes, shooting stars, and all about satellites in order to be able to rule those out.  then and only then are we left with unknown or unidentified objects.  all these sightings were clearly unidentified!\r\nalso in use were multiple high powered green lasers.  i had brought eight 5-mile, two 10-mile, and one 100-mile visible length of beam lasers and they were distributed throughout the crowd and some people had brought their own.  as these 10 total objects over about 20 minutes were witnessed many people were hitting them with the lasers.  we use the lasers both for pointing out objects and for flashing at them to get possible ufos to flash back.  this has proven successful on most of my tours.  as these 10 objects were hit by lasers, myself and others realized that while some may have been flashing back in response, that most likely our lasers were hitting actual metallic surfaces and reflecting off of the objects!  many of the people standing near me, including jimmy church, thought this is what we were actually seeing.  this would also mean that these objects were extremely close.\r\nthe response from the crowd had been overwhelming.  many people have expressed that this was a paradigm changing event for them.  i’m spoiled.  i get to see real sightings on all my tours.  but this night, same as those, i loved providing that experience for others.  i never get tired of people’s reactions.  for me, it’s always confirmation that ufos are real and seeing them is truly believing.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the west (sfo airport), towards the east. however, as the large bright orange object approached, fairly low in the sky, i noticed that it did not have the port and starboard flashing lights of a regular airplane flying  at night. the ufo looked fairly large and was moving at a low altitude, probably approximately the same height as an aircraft that had just taken off from sfo airport and was now flying at a height of approx 1 mile. the other thing that i noticed was that the ufo was moving in straight line, but fairly slowly in the sky, much slower than a regular aircraft. as the ufo approached, i noticed that it then began to zig zag across a straight line the sky, at a controlled rate of speed, making abrupt turns. the speed of the ufo then began to change and then suddenly, it changed direction at approximately 90 degrees, then just shot straight up into space towards the right of the north star at an incredible speed  and disappeared  i have never seen anything like this in my lifetime, until now.\r\ni have to admit, that it made the hair stand up on my head and i think that i will have quite a few sleepless nights thinking about this from now on. i would be

took some random video with a full spectrum adapted video camera.  after viewing the camera screen quickly, i forgot about it.  when i happened to look more closely on computer at the video on february 20, 2016, i noticed objects that were zooming fast in the video.  \r\n\r\nthere seem to be two kinds of craft in the 30.3 seconds video.  the larger one which initially seemed like a walnut appeared three places briefly in the video.  the smaller resembled black dots.\r\n\r\nthe larger craft\r\n\tthe larger craft began to appear in frame 2:20 and vanished by 2:27 moving to the right in .11 seconds.  \r\n\tit reappeared at frame 4:00 moving to the right, reversing and going left, danced upward and left and vanished at frame 5:08, a total of 1.13 seconds.  \r\n\tfinally it reappeared from frame 26:04 until frame 27:24, lasting 1.33 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe smaller craft\r\n\tdot shaped craft shot up and to the left at 7:52 in 11 frames at a 51° angle in .18 seconds.  \r\n\ta second dot shaped craft shot down and to the right at a 31° angle in frames 24:29 through 24:47 in .36 seconds.\r\n\tthen a third dot shaped craft shot down and to the right at a 45° angle in frames 28:42 to 28:44 in 3/60th of a second.\r\n\r\nanalysis:\r\nwhether or not the infrared and uv light aided in identifying these craft will be interesting to study in the future.  many other reports have been filed by this investigator of similar types of craft coming from and going to blue springs lake.  the upward craft moving to the left seems to have come from nearly nnw at 336° in the lake.  the first downward to the right moving craft dove into the area of the lake at 0°, or due north. it is assumed that this is the same location in the lake where other craft have been seen repeatedly-- which is roughly 1 mile away.\r\n\r\nthe size of the larger craft appear to be approximately 15ft in diameter based on the size of previous similar craft.  the distance would be roughly 1 mile as well.  it seems to have remained at approximately 12° elevation most of the time, moving back and forth, going in and out of view.\r\n\r\nthe size of the dot shaped smaller craft appear to be about 2.8 feet, being nearly 19% smaller than the larger ones.\r\n\r\nit is interesting to note that the path taken into the lake by the third craft which went downward appears to go precisely to the same location into the lake at 0° where the upward craft came from second craft also went.\r\n\r\nconclusion:\r\nthe behavior of the walnut-shaped larger sphere was odd in that it would go from invisibility, to visible, move back and forth…and then simply vanished again near the end of the video.  it hovered and seemed to morph to slightly different shapes.  the smaller dot-shaped craft travelled between 275 mph to 330 mph.\r\n\r\nthe fact that at least two of the smaller downward craft entered at the exact same location cannot be coincidence.  the odds of this occurring are 332,212 to 1.   case # 60295 reported an object coming from the lake and doing a zig zag in the air….Coming from almost precisely the same location as both of the downward craft entered the lake.  the odds of this is also 332,212 to 1.  the dual coincidences taken together actually increase the odds significantly to 110,364.81 &#12310;x10&#12311;^6 to 1.  clearly, these are common locations used by craft.\r\n","distance":"Over

nevada approaching sherwood, in detroit michigan. i noticed in the distance, directly east of me a shiny chrome/silver, round object in the sky. the object appeared to be approx. 1-2 miles away and about 1,000 ft in the air. at first i thought it was a plain landing with it reflecting the sun. the object was slowly getting closer and bigger, but did not change shape or color. the object was maintaining altitude, not losing or gaining. suddenly, within a fraction of a second, the object was now going west, gaining altitude as if it was ascended into space. shortly after the object went from west to east, it was gone. this event lasted around 20-30 seconds. the object never changed shape, color or reflectivity. it never gave any indication of a flight pattern to justify a human air craft. from wes to east without stopping or turning. i have had several past experiences with similar circumstances but just found out about this site today. my last expierence was approximately 7 years ago in st clair shores michigan.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
