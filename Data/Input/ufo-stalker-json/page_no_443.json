about 11:30pm mountain time. \r\n2.We were walking back to my house and looking at the sky when a bright and large \"orb\" came floating slowly above and out from behind a nearby mountain. \r\n3.When we saw it we both were surprised and the brazilian, he was scared more than i. we were both fascinated, it was immediately recognizable as a nontraditional flying craft. it was obviously too large, too slow, and too silent to be a plane or helicopter and both are uncommon in my area. \r\n4. the craft/object was moving slowly, silently, and steadily northeast. it \"floated\" directly above us at around 5000ft the closest large mountain nearby is about 7000ft and this craft was not as high up as the top. as it passed over us and the surrounding pasture it was emitting a bright white light similar to a welding torch. what i think is somewhat interesting is i waved my hands shouted at it and flicked a lighter and i cant be sure but it almost seemed like it \"realized\" we were there and its lights began to dim to nothing and it revealed what i recognize/(believe to be) as an isosohedron made of what looked like hot metal. it seemed to cool off after diming its lights off and as it did this the hot metal look faded and it became no longer visible against the night sky as it moved off in the distance. from what i saw it was clearly a large solid, metallic geometric shape because of the size it appeared to be at its altitude. it was appearing about the size of my little fingers nail while at about 5000ft so i guess it was actually somewhere around 20-40 feet around in circumference. \r\n5. i was surprised and mildly fearful/cautious but i was more interested and in hindsight maybe too curious, this curiosity overcame any fear i was feeling. my brazilian friend was scared and told me to stop trying to get its attention. he said he had no doubts that what he saw was unique and a ufo. i think it is a craft of some metal that is clearly developed by an intelligence that understands geometry. i also think it that it was not \"intending\" to be seen.\r\n6. i think it obviously noted our presence and then began to behave differently by \"turning off\" its light and cooling and fading into the dark sky around it becoming no longer visible.

the front of me, (northeast) a little left about 11:00, two objects shaped like thin crescent moons, exactly the same size and shape, going in and out of the clouds. they were situated the same, with the round part to the side and points up and down. i slowed down and stopped when they were about 11:15 in front and above me. they were bright white and the clouds were greyish. they sky between looked blue. the clouds looked like heavy storm clouds and they had a section of clear sky between them. the objects separately went into the upper cloud, then came down and went into the lower cloud. sometimes they hovered in the  clearing but they stayed in the same spot horizontally, just went vertically up and down. the objects stayed the same form of skinny crescent moon shape. i saw a plane fly over above the top cloud, going into it a bit and it looked about 1/3 the size of the objects, only horizontally lengthwise. the objects could have been closer, but the clouds looked huge, like several blocks long, and a few blocks apart, high in the sky so the objects weren't too small. at first i thought they might have been cranes or planes or something, but their shape never varied at all. it was like they were stiff objects, going slowly up and down in the clouds and out of them, between them. i often look in the sky and i am drawn to the sky by birds and clouds, but i have never seen a bird or plane that looked like this. i just watched for several minutes and tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but it said it couldn't take a photo. i don't know why, because later it would take a photo when i got home. it was disheartening that i couldn't photo it. i had never seen anything flying and shaped like that before, but i've seen orbs that moved at 90 degree angles and others that just seemed to take a straight line or that went really fast and disappeared. i've never had the good fortune of photographing them. eventually i started my car and just drove away, looking back in the mirror for quite awhile to see if i could still see them, and i could. they were continuing to move vertically up and down as they had when i was watching them earlier. i thought they must be very large but very thin. i finally quit looking to watch the road ahead of me, but i had seen them probably 20 miles away, because i was looking for them and could still see them. i think i am a very observant person, because driving on the interstate a couple days later, i noticed movement to my right and there was a bear across the river. we stopped and my husband took a photo

 the star had caught my eye because it almost looked like the moon when it is only a quarter lit.  the side of the object that had light was facing the west.  it slowly started to move and i started following it.  it almost seemed like it was spinning really fast and only half of the object was reflective so it would blink.  it ended up going dircectly over a jet going into mdw airport in chicago.  i don't know how high it was compared to the jet but from what i could see i would say it was abuot as high as a normal passenger jet goes up.  the jet was coming from the east going west.  the object was going north coming from the south.  as it got closer it started blinking slower and slower and like i said it looked like it was spinning and only half of the object was reflecting light so when it got to the half that did not reflect light it disappeared!  there was absolutely no sound what so ever!  it had no other lights on it other then the one and the object itself was not viewable almost like it was invisable or it was black so it blended with the black sky.  the closer it got to me the closer the light blinked but the longer it stayed lit.  when it got directly over me it completely dissapeared and i never saw it again.  it was directly over me when it dissapeared and it was like the snap of your fingers there one second gone the next?  put it this way i have seen some stuff in the sky that i could not identify over my lifetime but the second i saw this i knew i had to report it just in case someone else around me saw it!  whatever it was it was really cool!  i would say the speed of the blinking at first was 2 a second and then it would slow down to once a second then back up to 2 a second.  then it really started to slow down to once every 3 seconds but it stayed lit for 3 and would stay lit for like 2 seconds.  when it got really close to being directly over my head that is when it really slowed down until it completely dissapeared!  it was like nothing i have ever seen before and i have a little hobby where i check to see when the satelites, space station, and in past the space shuttle are going to be visible over my neighborhood so i can normally identify most things in the sky at night and day.
