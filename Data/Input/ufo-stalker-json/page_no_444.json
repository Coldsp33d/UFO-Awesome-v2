a glimpse of light, a bright light.. nothing like a star though. we thought it was a plane because it started blinking for a moment but as we were getting closer my mom thought it was a planet, but i knew once we got right before it that it was like nothing ive ever seen. i told her that is not a planet as it somehow took on the formation of upside down triangles (in sets of two & four all together) without connecting the 3 lights that made that shape. i tried getting her to pull over so i could take pictures or even record it, but it was late & we had already been driving for over an hour after an all day family get together (she was tired & freaked out lol) so right after passing it we got off on our exit & it was still above & now behind us in the air.. we by passed some taller trees & she still wasnt convinced that it wasnt more than the \"planet\" she claimed it to be & said watch when we get off onto the back roads you'll see it again & then you can take a picture. i looked at the same spot as where it was because we just turned off the exit not far from where it was & it was gone, nothing there to witness or capture to have as solid evidence. but i have a great mental image of it & i actually drew a picture to show you & to find out if what i saw that night was in fact a ufo.. i strongly believe it was because i have never in my 30yrs of star gazing, have i seen something like this! i would appreciate anything you have to say about this & i hope this isnt a waste of time because it isnt an actual photo that was taken of what i saw. we are getting a

about to get in the car to leave i observed a very white shiny object quietly floating across the sky towards me.  the object stood out because the sky was very blue.  i asked my daughter what it was and she didn't know.  i grabbed  my phone to start taking pictures/record this hard to make sence of situation.  the object began hoovering over a tree as i took pictures and there appeared to be a lens on the front of the object.  at one point a plane flew by not too far from the object and i wondered why the two \"aircrafts\" would be in the sky together....So close. then the object started ascending up in the sky and just disappeared. this entire situation has left me a lot of questions.  at first i wanted to believe it was a droan but then i looked up what a droan looks like and this looked nothing like a droan.  i had always thought of ufo sight ings to take place at night in a disolate area with no one else around to witness its existence! but this sighting took place in a completely opposite environment.  i asked an employee at the cemetery what was flying over the grounds and initially he tried to convince me it was ballons that a family had released around the same time.  that is until i showed him a picture and he reluctantly admitted this was no ballon....I\r\nforgot to mention my phone was almost fully charged when i started taking pics and recording and before i could finish my battery was completely drained.  when i tried to turn the phone on to show the employee the pics ...It took a lot of persistence before it would stay on.\r\nat the time of this incident it really never crossed my mind this object could be a ufo.  i was very offended that someone would actually fly over a cemetery taking pictures of people during such a sad and personal time of their life.  after i started researching other pictures similar to mine that had been clasified as ufo i began to realize this is probably something way bigger then i'll ever completely understand or be able to get answers to. one picture i took came out fairly clear. the rest of the pics look like a bright white spec.  in the video nothing showed so i randomly screen shot footage and enlarged the image to try and get a better picture.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

cowans\r\nlocation: joshua tree retreat center/contact in the desert ufo conference: orion lookout\r\nour ce-5 team was not part of, but adjacent to melinda leslie’s nighttime sightings w/military goggles.\r\ntime: around 10:00 in the evening  \r\n\r\nbackground info: there was a small airport south of us and a marine base north-east of us-all the activity came from the west going due east. at orion lookout we set up for our ce-5 protocols. one of us was filming, one was meditating, and i was spotting with celestron stargazing binoculars and a green laser. \r\n\r\nas we began i was able to spot many stars, planets, planes and satellites as part of the process of really “looking” at what was above us-then the unexpected happened! there was a parade of 7 orbs/ufos flying faster than satellites and as high as planes & helicopters from west over the mountains and disappearing to the east. the colors of the orbs were bright, but a defused soft green, diffused soft red, and defused soft lilac blue with the blue one being larger than the others. they gave us quite a show! we pointed our laser pointers and flashed them 3x’s and they flashed us back! this was the only time the orbs/ufos flashed is when we flashed them first, otherwise they just glowed a solid color. the 2nd, 3ed, , & 4th ones formed a triangle configuration as they passed us! the crowd of around 100 people went wild with cheers, clapping, and jumping up and down. at this time i did feel a \"heart\" connection, thanking them and sending love to them. i was “gushing” with love and gratitude to them as this was such a great show they gave us! sadly, my friend that was recording came up with just audio, however i did hear that a crew filming a documentary over on melinda leslie’s side got footage of all the activity so everyone else will just have to wait till that comes out. this was the most exciting thing ever! not only are they here, it appears they are friendly!\r\n\r\n to give more details about the orbs/ufo’s, they were large enough to be seen with the unaided eye, quite large actually and through the binoculars looked like an orb of soft diffused light with no corona around them. i would guess they were maybe 800’ up. the orbs/ufo’s were quiet, they glowed with one single light (unlike recreational and military drones that glow with 2 or more). the quality of the lights was a defused soft glow like that of a green illuminated “exit sign” and not the bright brassy glow of an led, incandescent, or christmas tree lights, the type of glow was unlike anything i have ever seen in my research on military drones as my skeptical mind considered this possibility. i have high quality binoculars, i can see the moons of jupiter and the craters on the moon with them-these orbs/ufos did not look like drones-i saw no structures connected to the glowing lights, the glowing light floated independent of any structure. also, i’m going to guess (as i didn’t want to take my eyes off the action to glance at a watch) that the whole event lasted between 8 to 10 minutes. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

be a spherical object in the sky that was relatively close to the big dipper. it looked to be an extremely bright star in the sky. at the time i did not have my contact lens in and everything looked very blurry, but i could still see the object because of how bright it was. i put on my glasses and got up and walked to the window for a better view. the object was huge and it seemed to be flickering (not blinking) and it was moving in a spasmodic pattern across the sky. i observed it for over an hour, moving slowly from south to west in direction. it seemed to have disappeared and reappeared twice very quickly. there was not a cloud in the sky and it was high enough to not be obscured by any trees or houses. i took digital videos and photos on my cellphone. the video footage i took on my cellphone is too large to be attached to my email to be uploaded onto this site, but i was able to attach some photos.","distance":"Over One

very bright star that was not previously present - we have a small telescope and are amateurs and like to view planets). i went to grab my camera to take a picture but the moment i did the bright star disappeared. the next night it happened again - and i called for my daughter to come see it but it was too late. so i had her look up if our space station is in our area (we know the difference)and no it was not. it was a star that became in seconds very bright then traveled to the south but immediately disappeared when i ran into the house to get my camera. my feelings are that it wanted me to see it but not have validation of it. i only lost sight because it immediately dimmed down when i went to get my camera and called my daughter to come outside. then it disappeared.
