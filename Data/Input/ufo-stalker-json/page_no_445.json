another person in it, i couldn't see who it was. there was a large podium.  the room was filled with a pinkish/orange light. they talked to me telepathically and said i had nothing to fear from them

sky in the same area over quebec and the odd contrails i see in the same area now to add to that are clouds with so many different looks that i had to report this one at least.  i have never seen anything like this ever and hope not to again.\r\n\r\nno i'm not crazy to report a cloud to mufon.  this wasn't your average 'gee that looks like a bunny rabbit' kind of cloud or if you squint it looks like something familiar.  this was a gigantic, took up 1/4 of the sky in front of me black/grey cloud cover that was in the shape of a perfect army helicopter.  i mean this thing had dividers where the windows were, pontoons for landing, two antennas on the top of the copter/cloud plus a tail that looked like a giant fish tail.  yup i sound nuts alright, even to me, but this was just unbelievable.  of course i didn't have my camera which is going to tick me off til the day i die because this thing would make world news.  you didn't have to look twice to see what it was formed like.  i mean how can a cloud do that?  it left nothing out as far as outlining a perfect, well almost, huge helicopter.\r\n\r\nsince i have seen several ufos in this area i have reported before i have been watching clouds and a couple of my sightings including a triangle ship was hiding in the clouds in the middle of the day.  others appeared in different form about 7:30pm in the evening ona summers night, clear skies.  but one thing looks common, they hide behind the clouds, or try to.  i have seen what looks like headlights in darker clouds some nights, they are always equal distance.Between a pair and there are several pairs around.  they fade away after awhile but look like headlights.  i mention all this because obviously clouds and ufos go hand in hand, especially in this area.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what to make of this helicopter shaped cloud but something is up and i do believe it relates to ufos.  coincidental a ginormous helicopter appears made of clouds?  commmmmmeeeeee on.\r\n\r\nthere wasn't anywhere else to report this and of course no reports in media about this.  i mean it was stunning.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

germann road. as i was driving it appeared the top of a power line on the left hand side of the road was glowing. as i approached i rolled my window down and it looked like a ball of fire was on top of the pole. i immediately thought it was an electrical fire. there were cars behind me so i continued about 1/4 mile and reached a turnabout and headed back in the direction i came. i was dumb founded when i could not see the fire on the electric power line pole. i made a left turn...A u turn if you will.. and started heading back down germann road. i thought maybe an owl got zapped. i then saw directly in front of me a fireball moving across my path to the left...With a slight angle downward. i though it was some sort of electricity traveling down a power line but didn't really recall any power lines that stretched across the street. it looked like and reacted just like an electricity ball would traveling a wire. i pulled over to actually notify the police department. the non emergency line at the pinal county sheriffs office just kept repeating the same message so i hung up and began on the road..Heading east on germann...When this 'fireball' clearly came into vision and it was like nothing i had ever seen before. it also had a somewhat boomerang or long 'v' shape to it... i was shocked and clicked on the camera on my cell phone and fumbled with it in my complete shock before taking video. i then noticed the video stopped. i thought 'oh no...Don't run out of data space now!' i clicked record again and started recording it as it headed in a northern direction towards apache junction. then out of the corner of my eye i saw another bright...More of a red color 'ball' shoot out from the desert directly in front of me towards the north and then another. i believe you hear some explicit language come out of my mouth at that point while recording. i zoomed out and in a bit trying to get some sort of landmark..And followed the 'balls' as they made a triangle formation and headed towards apache junction. the 'balls' were no longer visible in my camera but i could still see them as they faded out over the superstitions. i immediately called 911...And while describing the who what where of the incident..I now was traveling southbound on schnepts road...When i got to ocotillo i did not continue on towards my home but took a left on ocotillo to head towards the end of the road and where there is nothing but desert in the area.  as i turned left on ocotillo..East...There was a pinal county sheriff officer parked on the left/north side of the road. i made a u turn and pulled up behind him and told the 911 dispatch there was an officer here. dispatch requested i keep him on the line. i walked to the vehicle and the officer rolled down his window and i said 'please tell me you saw that.'  he said 'i didn't see it'. i said 'really??? you didn't see that??'  he said no but dispatch is aware of it and an officer is responding'. the officer was short. and had an attitude like he could care less. i told him i have it on video. he looked at me like 'i don't care'. so i walked off and said to the dispatcher something along the line of 'well he's hardly concerned'.  at that time an incoming call from the pinal county sheriffs office popped up on my caller id. i told dispatch and he stated to take the call and we would hang up.(how is it they are calling me??) i then spoke to an officer who said he also saw the three objects form in a triangle and head towards apache junction. he said earlier in the evening he was with a family that we're going to release luminaries on behalf of a deceased family member at ironwood and ocotillo. i told the officer this was not luminaries...And ironwood is behind me...And these 'fireballs' shot up from ground level in front of me. and ocotillo is clearly south of me. he stated from his locating he could not pin point the 'starting' point of these 'luminaries' but said he caught sight of them as they formed a 'v' formation and headed towards apache junction. i said there is no wind and the location these 'fireballs' came from were in an area strictly desert. no homes for miles to the east or north...And a good 2/3 miles to the south. i told him i had video. he seemed very interested and glad i captured it. he said 'i could see the fire in them with my naked eye'. he stated that he had no knowledge of any military action/training in the area. ( the old rittenhouse military base is located in this general area in the closed off desert...With just a weathered landing strip remaining) the officer said he was going to head towards the people who had the luminaries and find out exactly when they released them. he also stated he would be heading out towards me...Near the incident location to further investigate. i told him i would be awake for several more hours and if he indeed did find out that they were the luminaries to call me. but...I paused and said 'they weren't luminaries. they weren't. i saw them come straight out of the desert at ground level..There's no wind...And they traveled to 'pattern' like. the officer said he'd like to see my video and would be in contact if he found out anymore. we then hung up. my feeling was this officer also had no idea what it was we just witnessed.When i arrived home i felt scared. i locked the doors and messaged my girlfriend and sent her the first video. the 2nd was too large so i posted it to facebook. then i went online to google search if anybody else had seen what i did and decided to report it when i saw your link.

highly educated, professional people with an interest in ufos.  he is a management consultant and i am an attorney and previous r.N.  i am also a private pilot.  \r\n\r\nwe had signed up for the \"night vision experience\" on saturday evening.  it involved looking at the night sky with military grade night vision goggles.  we got in line at approximately 9:15 pm  at the outer edges of the retreat center.  our wait in line was approx. 45 minutes to an hour.  while waiting, we could hear the group facilitator making comments as to what to look for and what not to look for: satellites, airplanes, helicopters etc.  we could hear as people commented they saw \"something\" but they always turned out to be satellites or aircraft.\r\n\r\nas such, were not expecting to see any actual ufos at all.  \r\n\r\nwhen it was our turn, we put the night vision goggles on as instructed and started scanning.  i saw a few satellites, discernible because of their smooth movement from horizon to horizon at a high altitude.  i saw some aircraft, discernible by their blinking position lights:  red on the left and green on the right.  being a pilot, i am aware what aircraft lights look like at night.  \r\n\r\nsuddenly, one of the group yelled out that they had seen something.  we swung our goggles to look in the northerly direction.  i focused on a white, glowing object which looked like a ball of light with fuzzy edges coming over the horizon rather fast, traveling west to east and then slowly disappearing. process of elimination set in:  not a plane, helicopter bc no blinking lights.  fuzzy edges, ball shaped.  not a satellite because too low on the horizon and moving too fast.  these objects were large enough and bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.\r\n \r\nas we were watching this white object, the second object, this time blue in color, came out of the west and traveled rapidly to the east.  ball shaped, glowing, fuzzy edges.  this one slowed down.\r\n\r\nthe third object then came from the west, this time green in color.  same shape, characteristics as above.  this one slowed down also.\r\n\r\nthe fourth, object, i'm uncertain about the color as people were now very excited and many thoughts were racing through my mind.  is this real?  i looked at them with my naked eye and the goggles and yes, they were there.\r\n\r\nnow, the second, third and fourth object had slowed to a triangle formation.  with the apex of the triangle facing 'up.\"  they did not stop but kept moving to the east.\r\n\r\nat his point, the group facilitator said that we needed to give the people in line a chance to see because they \"were dying to see.\"  so we handed over the goggles and started walking back to the center.  we lost sight only because we were instructed to leave. by my guess, there were about 30 people with goggles who saw this take place and perhaps a few who saw with the naked eye.\r\n\r\never since that evening, my boyfriend and i have been processing this event.  yes, we are interested in ufos and the nature of reality, consciousness etc..  we asked, did this predispose us to experiencing this?  my answer is no.  remember, we were not expecting to see anything but satellites or airplanes. it was just a fun experience to sign up for.  since then, we have not stopped thinking about what we saw.  we are both logical, sane people. \r\n\r\nneither one of us has ever experienced anything like it in our lives.\r\n\r\nwe cannot stop thinking about what we saw at joshua tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

like configuration whilst observing the latest image from the soho satellite. said object looks large when placed under scrutiny. perhaps almost 'space station-like' with a large vertical appendage and a long one to the lower right and short one, or that which may constitute the rear of the main body coming out to the lower left.. as depicted in the image. there is some difficulty in determining the solidity of the long structures and they might alternatively be interpreted as very large 'wings'.\r\n\r\nthe image has been enhanced and magnified and in my opinion remains significant enough in its presentation to warrant another report to mufon.\r\n\r\nyour comment in due course regarding the result of additional analysis and outcome of the investigation will be appreciated. i will expect nasa will make all efforts to debunk (should they be asked) and that is their brief, although i would be interested in their comment. any independant mufon analysis will be most appreciated.\r\n\r\ni

prefer a real answer though, one way or the other.\r\n\r\ni remain rational and skeptical but the possibility of what this could be does stir the imagination. a real life klingon battlecruiser

or if you could find anything. because once they see or hear of anything it will be gone in 24 to 48 hours. so, i thought sure why not.  well i came across something that i have only showed a few people, but it is without question a space ship. it isn't a play in shadows or light. i took pictures with my cell phone from back then just in case it was removed. i went back to the site about 3 days later and it was gone. in the picture i took it shows the site and were it is on the moon it says right on it de moreas. it is not something that can be passed off as anything but something that is built by somebody or something. all the stuff i have seen on these shows don't even come close to what mine looks like. i even printed out a picture of the screen. if you are interested and you should be. this is without a doupt proof that someone or what ever. is on the moon. once you see it i think it will be the picture that shows something is going on up on the moon. the picture is from

was right under it and my cousin who does not believe in these things yelled, \"look at the triangular object?\" \"it disappeared!\" \"where did it go?\" i was unable to look up at it because i was

it couldn't have been more than 30 feet above me.  it seemed like it was looking right back at me (there were no flashes or beams or anything like that).  the craft did not make a single sound.  the shape of the craft was eerily similar to the stereotypical pictures we see in sci fi movies or shows.  circular, disk-like with blueish-green lights around the edges.  after it was done scanning me or photographing me or whatever the hell it was doing it began moving slowly away then shot out to the horizon at impossible speed.  we always hear stories about people seeing ufos. sometimes its just a light in the sky that moves in a strange way; sometimes people aren't quite sure what they saw.  i am 100% sure what i saw.  i was not drunk, or on drugs, i have no mental illnesses.  i suppose i count myself fortunate to be sure, 100% sure, that we are not alone in this universe.  this craft was not man made. for anyone who may be on the fence, or perhaps saw something but you're trying to convince yourself that you didn't.  i can assure you with absolute certainty that we are being visited.  i wish there was a way i could verify my sincerity. i swear to everyone who reads this on my eternal soul that everything here is genuine and true. im not sure if this little detail will bring comfort to anyone, but i was never afraid during the sighting.  i was absolutely amazed but never fearful not even for a second.
