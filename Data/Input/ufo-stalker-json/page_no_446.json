faire notre ã©picerie au super c sur la rue champfleury ã  quã©bec. on attendait le taxi. je regardais le ciel qui ã©tait nuageux, comme je fais souvent, au cas oã¹, lorsque j'ai vu un objet qui volait juste sous les nuages et qui semblait glisser dans les airs. j'ai cru que c'ã©tait un oiseau mais je ne voyais pas de battements d'ailes, puis j'ai pensã© ã  un petit avion. il ã©tait complã¨tement gris, un gris mã©tallique mã¢t. je ne suis pas capable d'ã©valuer ã  quelle hauteur mais il semblait ãªtre au-dessus du boulevard henri-bourassa, arrivant sur ma gauche, comme si il allait en direction de lorretteville. nous on ã©tait dehors en avant du magasin.\r\nje ne voyais aucune composante d'un avion, soit ailes, gouvernail. il n'y avait aucun bruit. en fait, il ressemblait ã  une soucoupe. l'objet s'en allait en oblique pour se rendre sur ma droite en s'ã©loignant. alors j'ai demandã© ã  l'engin, dans ma tãªte, de se rapprocher pour que je le vois mieux. il a immã©diatement changã© de cap pour venir dans ma direction. il a tournã© sur un axe assez court pour un avion, en tournant il s'est lã©gã¨rement inclinã© et j'ai vu le dessous un peu, c'ã©tait plat mais avec une lã©gã¨re courbure, toujours sans bruit et est venu juste un peu plus prã¨s mais toujours en restant ã  la mãªme hauteur. il a fait une courbe que je pensais un peu serrã©e pour un petit avion, puis a passã© tout droit devant moi, a dã©crit ensuite un cercle pour aller sur ma droite et est parti droit devant pendant quelques secondes puis il a tout simplement disparu d'un coup.\r\nje me suis senti trã¨s serein et aussi, fascinã© et content lorsque j'examinais l'engin et, dans mon fort intã©rieur, je savais ce que je regardais. c'est comme si instinctivement, je savais ã  qui j'avais affaire et que j'en ã©tais aucunement effrayã©. je ressentais comme un sentiment de familiaritã©.\r\nl'engin ã©tait de la forme d'un disque, gris mã©tallique mã¢t. pas de lumiã¨re mais il avait une petite coupole sur le dessus. il ne semblait pas voler comme un avion mais plutã´t, il semblait glisser avec une aisance hors du commun. j'en ai parlã© ã  mon conjoint mais il ne l'a pas vu. moi qui pensais avoir un sentiment de peur lorsque j'assisterais ã  un phã©nomã¨ne ovni.\r\nmais ã©videmment je peux me tromper.\r\nje suis ã  la fois perplexe et rassurã© face ã  ma rã©action envers

from texas corners, mi in the country.\r\n\r\ni didn't study video for three days or so and then found it contained the object which was above the clouds and depending on altitude could be the largest ufo ever reported. this happened nearly a year ago and i would have reported it earlier except i kept trying to explain this away as a satellite, reflection, or some other object other than a ufo. i finally settled for it being a swarm satellite made by the european space agency because of its size, shape and altitude. the swarm satellite i believe is around 13 feet in height and with is used to measure and perhaps repair the earth's magnetic lines of force. if this is a swarm satellite i would have to consider whether my vehicle's windshield could have caused it to be magnified immensely and yet stranger things have happened. the only problem is its size above all the clouds it could be as huge as the city of kalamazoo or larger, or smaller, depending on its actual altitude. also being present in the video for 54 minutes + and descending slowly and then ascending later in an area where civilian passenger planes are frequently seen. it seemed unlikely that my camera would be the only object or entity to see this huge ufo in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe object appears to be a triangle at first when high in the sky, but as it descends to its lowest altitude it changes shape and definitely looks like a cone, a sharp pointed rounded object of enormous size and even at its lowest altitude is still high above the clouds which pass between it and earth. the object moved less than an inch on my flat screen horizontally during the whole video. vertically it moved very little during the whole episode. the object slowly ascended out of sight on the video. it never appears to move quickly, or erratically.\r\n\r\nif you send me a mailing address i will send you a copy of the video on an mdhc card for your computer and you can study it for as long as you like although i hope you will inform me of what your final disposition is. i consider this video copyrighted and must be shown with my permission only, but i do give you permission to use it, and show it, as long as you give me credit for its existence. \r\n\r\ni am 76 years old and i take this very seriously. i also study the effects of the sun on earth during solar max and now what may be known as solar minimum. \r\n\r\ni am of clear mind and have worked most of my life in the field of electronics on aeronautical and missile navigation systems, qualification and evaluation testing for westinghouse electric for equipment used

 we are currently working on bringing in several storms (as we have been) this is to cool your planet down. i can't tell you anymore because its top secret so to speak.  however, i can tell you this there are many ships surveying the planet, the sun, and the inner solar system. we also have millions of hybrids on earth all developing at different rates. that energy i spoke of is used to alter the body's molecular chemistry to advance them and prepare them for the next phase in the earth's changes.  its all part of an experiment to see how far the physical vessels can go and how much of our energy they can take before shutting down. we are also preparing your planet for our touch down. clearly we are here but we work in a distance so that you do not panic.  we will not save you for you must learn to be responsible.  when your kind have mastered repairing earth we will allow you to further explore the universe. we open the doors little by little with each achievement and effort we have observed on ground as well as above. sort of like a reward. you save a species we allow another piece of your space garbage to look around. if you go too far in exploration we destroy the object. i think i have said enough here. i am a ground keeper i observe and report the activity on earth and also give suggestions as to what changes need to occur in specific areas to further improvements and or expose areas that need work.  i also ....No i won't say that nevermind. oh look a storm!! yay!! okay time to go. i just wanted to open the doorway a little more for you guys so you know a little bit about our project here. again still not sure if it is military or not. did i say your military? no....I was talking about ours. ;) good day. i'll give you some pictures but not sure if it really matters. our ships aren't boomeranged shaped though ours are diamond or star orbs. so that boomerang one threw me off unless that was one of the ones i upgraded...Hmmmm i forgot about that! ha! woops i guess if you want to really investigate me you can take a gander at my facebook page  and go through my files most of my stuff i purposely put on facebook because it is public and for those who see they shall find. you should see my conversations i have there is so much more proof in there then you would ever need! lmao but you won't and you probably cant.  if you look at the soho and lasco c3 sometimes you will see a blip of our ships at work putting in new installments for the sun. oh if you only knew. i can't fit any more on here sorry.

with my girlfriend, i momentarily stopped walking to turn away from the breeze to light a cigarette. my girlfriend was standing about 4 feet from me. as i had my back turned to her while \r\nlighting the cigarette. she said, \"i have never felt like this before\".\r\nher tone was calm but i could tell from the tone of her voice, she was referring to something that was completely non-sequitur to any conversation\r\nwe may have been having previously. my instant reaction was that of 'no idea what she means'. i turned to look at her, and saw her mouth slightly agape and eyes looking up over my right shoulder.  i turned to look up in the direction she was looking and within a second i felt a wave of a feeling of well-being come over me, consuming my entire perception. i then\r\nsaw what appeared to be parallel waves approximately 1 to 2 feet in width,\r\nwith a total combined width of perhaps 100 feet hovering 20 to 30 feet above me.  the waves were 'rippling' within these segments, and i could \"see\" a very regular pattern. the 'light' was invisible but i could sense a series of colors in the spectrum, not visually, but more physically.\r\nthe intensity of the overall wave was overwhelmingly obvious. the phenomenon lasted, it seemed, about 3 to 10 seconds. i turned to look at her again and without uttering one single word, we both turned and continued on our walk. there was no thought of discussing it with her, and she did not mention anything at all either.  we never discussed the incident and i had absolutely no thoughts of questioning her as to what she experienced either. it was as if it did not happen at all, but here i am 45 years later still wondering what the phenomenon was.\r\n\r\nthere are esp overtones in my life, having been tutored by a past student\r\nof george colby within a year of the incident at cassadega, fla. later in life i crossed paths with ingo swann and a few other interesting people,\r\nbut never discussed with incident with
