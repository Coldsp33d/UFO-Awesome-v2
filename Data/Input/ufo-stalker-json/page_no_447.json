observed a starlike object moving from north to south. i'd say it was 45-50 degrees above the horizon. i attempted to film the object but i couldn't pick it up with my sony camcorder even with night vision enabled. the object went behind some palm trees in our front yard and i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\napproximately 15 minutes later my wife came outside. she asked if i had seen anything and i told her about my failed attempt to record a starlike object moving across the sky. roughly 1 minute later, my wife exclaimed \"what's that!\" she was pointing almost straight up. i immediately noticed what i believed to be the same starlight object moving across the sky. this time the object was moving from south to north.\r\n\r\ni immediately got my sony camcorder going and thankfully i was able to pick up the object so i began filming it. i obtained a little over a minute of video footage. at the 25 second mark, a plane flying at a lower altitude crosses the path of the object. the plane is moving from west to east. you can tell the difference between the plane and the object. i think this was a propeller driven plane but i am not 100% sure. you can also see some stars in the sky too. eventually i lost the object due to obstruction from my rain gutter and roof.\r\n\r\nas mentioned, i made this video on 8mm tape converting it to mpeg-2 format using 2.0 video grabber. i also made a duplicate video using stabilizing software from arcsoft. so you can view the original video and a more stabilized video. \r\n\r\nweather conditions at time of the sighting:\r\n\r\nvisibility 9

to be moving, and learned that it actually was. a very steady pace, seemingly too fast to be an airplane. i heard no sound to accompany it. i watched as it traveled on a straight path, roughly heading north-west. i lost sight of it as my neighbor noticed another one moving west. this one i never caught sight of, however, another one caught my attention moving south. i followed this one until it got overhead and vanished from sight. i assume it left the atmosphere. i kept watching the skies for signs of more, and sure enough, another one came from the north heading in a south-east direction, however, this one seemed almost to have a snake-like flight path. i watched this one until i couldn't see it, any longer. my neighbor and i stopped watching skyward and began discussing what we witnessed and eventually we all returned, indoors. this began around 11:20 p.M. and we came inside around 11:45 p.M. after eating a small snack, i went back outside at about 12:10 a.M. for another cigarette, and 3 of my other neighbors were outside. i told them about the earlier sighting and, as we talked, i looked up just to see if there might be more. sure enough, a fifth one was there, and i pointed it out. 2 of the 3 that were out there were able to see it. they agreed it was too high up to be an airplane. on top of this observation, i don't believe there would be 5 separate airplanes in

was googling things on my ipad when i happened to look up and saw a triangle formation of lights just to my left really close. i dropped everything and ran inside to get my husband. i knew right away this wasn't a plane, stars or planets. i ran inside yelling for my husband and he came out. in the ten seconds it took for me to run inside all but one orb was still there but it had moved. at first my husband accused me of being crazy and said it was just a plane, but right next to the orb was an actual plane. the orb was bigger then the plane and it was obvious. he was amazed, then we started noticing more and more orbs coming from the horizon or taking off from somewhere. my husband knew no one would believe us so he called for our neighbor to come out and tke a look. he and his girlfriend came out and were also in just pure amazement, then others in our building started hering the commotion and came outside to see what we were doing. we saw over twenty of these orange orbs going at speeds i have never seen before in my life. it couldn't have been flares because they were ascending and changing direction. all of them would get to a certain height and they all would dim their lights one by one.... then the most amazing thing happened. as these things dimes there lights which almost looked as if they were blinking out they would start shoooting across the sky with no noise, and at speeds i have never ever seen in my life! we all witnessed the same thing and we have no idea what it was but we do know it was no plane, blimp, hot air ballon, flare ext.. these were truly un identified flying obje cts. my neighbor got even better video than me and we coul d get it to you if interested. i took mine from my ipad and ipads don't take good videos. hers were quite clear. all of us are in agreement we witnessed something truly unique and we all came up with nothing explainable as to what this could have been, these orbs just kept coming from what looked like they were taking off but could have came from the horizon. we watched over twenty as they darted across the sky right next to eachother, changing directions, and speeds. truly amazing. i am not a good

my left ear. i went to my doctor last year when this happened and he said everything looked fine within both of my ears. ever since then, i have been experiencing sounds in that ear that sound like morse code (even right now), and sometimes ringing, beeps and humming noises (all electronic like sounds) . i also hear taps, pops and ticks on my ceiling and walls inside my house, especially in the living room, master bedroom and office. i cannot escape this and it is very tormenting to me. i also see blurps of light out of the corner of my eyes, sometimes what seem to be a very dim light that flashes in the room but my boyfriend does not hear or see any of these things. my dog does fixate on something everyday and night and then turns to look at me when i notice her staring. about a month or two ago i started believing that my neighbors are somehow involved with this and that they are monitoring me by video and audio equipment. i thought that all of this was coming from up in the rafters, through the air ducts behind the metal grills around the inside house. sounds crazy, i know! i truly feel watched all of the time. one night, about may 14th or the night of the full moon, i decided to stay up after my boyfriend was asleep and try to catch these people in the act. i shined my flashlight in every vent, one by one with all lights out. i kept hearing noises in every other room but the one that i was in. i kept seeing dim light flashing here and there and heard someone small walk across my roof. i went to the back sliding glass door that leads out to my back yard and i thought i saw a small one man tent that was illuminated by the light of the full moon. i figured these \"kids\" were brazenly camping out in the yard. i didn't see any movement and it didn't quite look like it fully was on the ground. i started to get real scared and did not want to shine my light on it for some reason. it felt like someone was right behind me so i decided to go back to bed. i got up the nerve once again to go back and look, it was gone. by this time the clock was 5:00 am. next day, my wrist watch was 10 minutes ahead, and since then my day setting, trips in half day increments. two weeks ago i had child like, two digit finger print bruises pop up on my left lower part of my arm. two days in a row i had what looked like a very small needle mark on my left arm in two different places with small dots of blood on my white sheets and comforter. i wake up with vaginal soreness on occasion. i now have what feels like a bone spur in the ball of my left foot that \"just\" popped up out of nowhere. i've changed every lock on my doors and even put a deadbolt on my office door. as of yesterday, i signed up with adt for three years. i am frightened at bedtime and sometimes keep a light on next to my bed and remain vigilant throughout the night . i am tired all of the time and can't talk to anyone about this for fear of being judged. beyond all of this, my 30 year old son recently found out that he has a benign brain cyst at the base of his brain, in the most dangerous spot for surgery. can anyone help me? i am sooo confused as to why this is all happening to me at this time and so recently.

up to a stop sign and noticed that there were (what we thought were kids) playing on the swing sets at the grade school. which was about a half a block away. i pulled up at the school and whoever it was, was gone. \r\ni pulled up into the horseshoe drive all the way and thats when we seen it. hovering above the tree line. i could see the outline and the color was white. there was two white lights at each end of the wing tips. everybody started to scream and holler go! go! go! and then the third light lit up..Kind of. its opened almost like an eye pupil. like dialating. the light was an orange color.I floored the gas pedal and we spun out of there quick. i didnt hear it make any noise because we had a little boom box in the car. we were listening to metallica and the song green hell was playing. plus everybody screaming and crying.\r\nwe went to my friend's house and she told her dad about it. he grabbed a flashlight and we went back. he went into the woods and found nothing. he went home and we all went to a local pizza place,told other friends about it and drew pictures of what we seen. we all saw the same thing.\r\n it was getting late and the pizza place was closing. so i went to go start the car and it was making a horrible noise. like if you were to keep turning the ignition when the car was already running. everybody took off running like it was gonna explode! my friend's brother opened the hood and unhooked the battery. had to leave the car there and walk home. i have never been so terrified walking home alone. when i got home my dad wasnt home but my mom was. i told her about it and she didnt say anythhing. i heard my dad come in later on that night and he was angry. telling me i better go get his car. my mom told him that we seen something and he didnt believe any of it. i couldnt sleep all that night. \r\nin the next few days i heard that there was other sightings. not in the same place but within a few mile radius. \r\ni guess that i should add that the school was on a lakefront, and that one of the other sightings was above a lake.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,
