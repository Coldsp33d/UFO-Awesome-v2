i was home, in backyard loking with my whife thru telescope meade etx-70.\r\n\r\n2. i was looking for m51 whirlpool galaxy when noticed triangle shaped siluete hovering. then sudenly fast changed direction to right (east).Then stoped. called my whife to see that. we was able to track that one object for about 15 minutes, then another triangle shaped ufo came right next to first one and both of them turned lights, all around object. then we saw clearly that both of them is 2 triangle shaped ufos.  then for about 50 minutes we able to track them on sky, for moments we lost them from site because they were so fast, and they have unpredictable directions, they was flying straigth then sharp turnes,then sudden stop, but we able to find them again. we didnt saw them with naked eyes, just with telescope so i dont know that they were in our atmosphere or in space.\r\n\r\n3. first time to me it looks like a airplane b2 or f117. but planes cant hower and change directions like that.\r\n\r\n4. howering, fast moves, unpredictable directions, fast start and sudden stop, and howering again.\r\n\r\n5. i was excited, so as my whife. that is her first time to see something, for me that was the last, but saw few times strange lights and objects earlier.\r\n\r\n6. about after 1 hour 5-10 minutes they just turned off lights and disapeared from our sight. from that day im always using astro cam and laptop in case i see something strange again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

singapore in june of 2006 before heading back home to australia.\r\n\r\non top of the merlion at sentosa island, singapore i tried to capture the tiger sky tower revolving restaurant before it disappeared from view behind trees....I took two quick shots (burst) on a new nikon d50 in raw format.\r\n\r\nupon viewing the pictures on the d50's tiny screen to see if i had caught the restaurant i noticed a dot which i thought may be a speck on the lens but there was nothing visible on the lens to note of when i checked it.\r\n\r\nabout a week later when viewing all the photos from our trip i froze when i saw the two pictures of the restaurant. \r\n\r\nin each image there is a cylindrical object of a matte dull grey colour which looks to be a emitting a beam upward.\r\nthe photos taken a 10th of a second apart shows that the object had traveled a (unknown) distance from one frame to the next.\r\nthe object (to me) resembles the same shape as a lego man's head. there is a shadow beneath it (cast from the light of the sun above) showing that is three dimensional.\r\n\r\ni have absolutely no idea what this could be.\r\ni did not actually witness anything in the sky (probably because looking through the d50's view finder) and i didn't notice anything odd through the view finder either.\r\n\r\nbeing new to the camera (and photography in general) i was shooting everything in raw format (for the whole trip) which luckily records a lot of data about each photo to do with the camera.\r\n\r\ni'm hoping by submitting these photos i may get some answer perhaps(?).\r\n\r\nthe

november morning, i could see my breath. walked from house to the shed to get my bike (about 15 feet.) noticed the moon must be full because it was really bright and thought i would look after i got my bike. once it was out i decided to look at the moon. looking toward the light source i freaked out. it wasn't the moon at all! there above my neighbours 2 story house not more than 30 feet away was a very large round craft of unknown origin. i quickly ran to the side of the shed to hide. after less than a minute i thought if something could build that thing it could have zapped me by now. so i decided to look at it full on. looking up i was amazed and frightened at the same time. it sat there motionless. trying to get an idea of its size i looked around for something to compare it to and a telephone pole caught my eye and it was a good fit for the diameter of the craft. watching for a few seconds more a semicurcular band of light appeared on the bottom red in color then another band appeared orange in color displacing the red (red remained above), then another color appeared in turn i think blue, the craft took on the colors of the band's as they appeared,there was no sound as it ascended moving slow at first but picked up as the band's went faster, in all once it started to move and as the band's went faster the craft went faster going straight up into the heavens and

lot waiting for my wife in my truck, i was sitting in the drivers seat facing the building parked in the middle of the parking lot facing the building,  with my 3 year old daughter autumn in the back seat, right behind me. and i was taking photos of the sky hopefully waiting to see the sun peak through the thick cloud cover, because three days prior i had captured what appeared to be a \"tiny - second sun\" in the sky that emitted much light but was not nearly the size of the sun, and the light it emitted is blue/white. the photos i uploaded are what's called \"live photos\" taken on my iphone 6s. it is a new model phone with a great camera and i am very familiar with lens flare effects and this is definitely not that. the light is always moving at a very quick speed very smoothly with my camera still as i am taking live photos and sometimes time lapses and i make sure to have my exposure lock turned on so that when i see it the light won't blur out my cameras contrast etc. this is the same way i take time lapses of the sun sets and time lapses of the clouds moving. as i said 3 days earlier i caught a similar tiny blue white circular light, actually in front of another good will store in rogers because i was again waiting for my wife who was in the store for maybe 15 minutes as she usually is when she goes there to look for books to read. so when i was at the maple grove goodwill (the one near elm creek blvd) i took a bunch of live photos which are like mini animations and i can show you those in person i believe you may need an iphone to view these files but am not sure. i also have other videos and photos of the sun and clouds and the sky taken in the same half hour period as the files, i would like to also submit everything taken that day. but  just choosing the best ones, i hope the live photos show up as mini videos like they are supposed to because that's the way to see the real speed this orb / planet/sun/ ufo/round object, and the speed at which it moved. when my wife got back to the car i showed her some of the live photos i had just taken, and she thought they were not normal but said maybe my camera was getting lens flares, but i know for a fact that there is no way these are caused by lens flares based on the still camera and the way they move so fast and fluidly the row the sky, behind the clouds but visible shining through thinner layers and totally visible through no layers whenever possible. i am also including a video of the video taken from another iphone 6 s. after she got in the car we went to platos closet i the the grove square area of maple grove which is only two blocks away, and i saw the clouds were clearing up just a bit that i might catch more of this light in the sky. so i started taking a time lapse video, or do i thought because it turned out to be recording the light/ object in slo- mo instead which turned out to a huge blessing. i was taking videos and pics when i was parking the car waiting to get out and bring my used jeans not to sell. but when i got out of the car to walk in i noticed a few small clearing in the sky so decided and i thought i saw the tiny sun light object and decided  to take one last clip which turned out to be slo mo (high speed footage) and even though i couldn't see my phone screen because the sky was too bright, the fact that i could not look at it without sneezing made my realize i was getting the light on film and just was hoping to catch the circle moving across the sky, which it totally did. and fast too, i kept my phone perfectly still until the end because i thought it was a time lapse. and the object was mostly behind the clouds and appeared to illuminate the sky and clouds around if, almost like a sun. but much smsller and dimmer, but still very very bright so you can't just look at it. it was nearly straight up in the skywbpve where i was standing looking straight up or almost straight up but the object moved from the middle of my camera to the bottom of my camer in a matter of seconds and even in slow motion it moves fairly fast.  i am unsure if the original video or even the time lapses or live photos may be seen on your phone unless it's an iphone so oil included a video of my watching the video because i don't know howvelsevto share a slo mo video, they don't just uploaded ike the time lapse videos do, once i got back to the car from the used clothing store, i looked closely at my new slo lo video and realized i had captured the glowing circle perfectly clearly and i realized at that time how fast it was tracking through the sky just above the clouds it appeared or maybe in orbit? but moving extremely fast? and i was feeling very excited, even when i was in the store for 5 minutes i peeked at the clip and knew it was going to be really good once analyzed and zoomed in etc. the other day when i caught the similar object at the rogers good will i was so mesmerized by it and couldn't stop thinking about even the whole 2 days and the when my wife wanted to go to good will in maple grove o thought maybe i'll get to see this poking through the sky again and i will catch it better this time, but i only caught it for glimpses hidden within the live photos mini videos. until we went to platos closet two blocks away,i realized ghost i could probably get it good because i saw a hole in the clouds and i thought to myself and said outl loud that the hole would probably be lined up just right when i got two blocks over to the other store and it was pretty much do i started taking the time lapse but accidentally put it on slo motion and i'm so glad i did that because it really caught it clearly moving behind and through the clouds, the only time i saw blue sky during that half hour was 2 times i saw holes in the clouds but all i could see through the small\r\n holes, both times was airplanes leading con trails. and it almost seemed like they were trying to fill in the small. holes i

but it was holding position, hover.  it then dropped perhaps 500 feet, then stopped.  grabbed binoculars.  craft began a fast descent, about 4000 feet per minute.  went out of site behind trees.  about 3 to 5 miles from my position at 75th ave and the 101 loop in north phoenix.\r\n\r\nin the binoculars, this had two large red lights, size of pie pans, and tiny nav light on right, green, but it was blinking fast, like a very fast strobe.  the width between the bright red lights was the width of a car, about 3 to 4 feet, very large for lights, very bright, like brake lights 'on'.\r\n\r\nabout 2 minutes later, a helicopter is coming at my exact direction which is inline with deer valley airport and we have a hospital between me and the approaching helo.  i thought i could hear rotor blades.  it suddenly stops, and i dont know how it could stop.  it dropped, held position, then it went down like a rock, about 5,000 fpm.  what i thought in my mind was, its rotors might have to brake off to go down that fast, or it was nosing down at 45 degrees, but my vision told me it was holding still, no movement.  before, i could see it was coming at me at fast speed, then stopped.  also, it appeared to have 2 white lights that came on before it fast dropped.  lights were dim, maybe pointing downwards and i was seeing their edge.\r\n\r\nthese were over sun city just north of union hills by one mile.\r\n\r\ni have never seen two red bright lights on the back of a helo or a plane.  these were also quite bright.\r\n\r\ni am a former student pilot, lots of flying time, and i traffic spot the planes, so this was very odd to see.  i also watch the planets and have basic astronomy.  so i can tell you, what i saw was radical.\r\n\r\nthe two both exhibited a 'very fast' descent.  they both could hover and both could go straight down.  this 'should' be difficult for a helo if the rotor disc is flat, as it causes drag coming straight down.  the helo would have to have blades that aimed downwards in pitch to actually force itself down at that speed, if that is possible.  \r\n\r\nwhat i thought at first was that i was seeing the back of a air ambulance helo, going into a crash status, engines out, auto-rotation.  then another helo coming at me, two lights come on, it stops, then also drops at high speed.  very odd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

with no wind whatsoever. (~20 sec. observation).\r\n\r\nit was late evening and suddenly i had an 'strong' feeling to go outside on my deck and take my new 'night vision' scope outside...  as soon as i opened up the sliding doors to the deck area and walked out, i immediately noticed a very large blue/white 'orb' moving in a northeast direction (above the tree-line about 1/4 mile away).  the blue/white 'orb' was at least 3 times larger and many times brighter than when i've observed jupiter or venus (closest approximation to relative size is holding an aspirin up at arms length). i immediately turned on my night vision scope and had to re-focus the scope from 'infinity' to more of a near-field object to get the 'orb' in relative sharp focus.  the surrounding edges of the orb were not distinct and were somewhat defused in the night scope. in comparison, if i focus the night vision scope on the stars, the stars are true, sharp 'pin-points' of light (of varying brightness).\r\n\r\nthe color of the orb (sight viewing) was a distinct blue/white and did not vary in intensity during the ~20 sec. sighting.  there was no sound emanating from the object as i could tell.  the 'orb' continued its trajectory from the southwest to northeast until i lost sight of the orb due to trees in the field of view.\r\n\r\nthis is the third time i've observed 'objects' at my lake home since my 2003 sighting of a cigar-shaped (pill-shaped) object in broad daylight, 2014 sighting of an orange orb in close proximity (wife also viewed this orange orb with me) and now this 2016 sighting of this particular blue/white orb.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

  nous ã©tions a 3 assis sur des pierres au bord de la rn 75 reliant bejaia a setif(dept algã©riens)et pas loin   du village ou nous habitons .On discutait de tout et de rien quand un des notre a remarque que la planã¨te mars s'est dã©placã©e ,car habitues a se rã©fugier sur cette crãªte pour retrouver un peu de fraã®cheur notamment en ces moments de chaleur.Avant 20 jours mars apparaã®t juste a proximitã© d'une montagne surplombant la rã©gion (tikintouchte 1300m d'altitude) en ce moment la aux environs de 21h. nos regards tous les trois sont braques vers le ciel pour designer jupiter ou saturne car on sait que venus est visible uniquement au coucher du soleil. tellement nos regards sont restes braques au ciel ,j'ai remarque un point de lumiã¨re blanche qui se dã©place au ciel (phã©nomã¨ne frã©quent;des points de lumiã¨res blanches qui se dã©placent dans le ciel avec une vitesse constante et sans clignotement).J'ai attire l'attention des autres sur ce phã©nomã¨ne pour essayer de le comprendre et on ã©voquait des avions qui volent a haute altitude ou bien des des vols intercontinentales.Soudain un avion je pense d'air algã©rie vient de traverser et se dirige vers l'est  et on a bien remarque ses feux qui clignotait et son bruit .Tout a coups une lumiã¨re dominante dans le ciel surgit au dessus de nos tãªtes(je prã©cise que notre champ visuel tous les trois ã©tait nne).Tellement cette lumiã¨re ã©tait claire et visible elle a attire notre attention tous les trois,câ€™ã©tait juste au dessus de nos tã¨tes si cette lumiã¨re est apparue subitement ou bien elle est venus de derriã¨re on ne sait pas .Ce qui est certain c'est que cette lumiã¨re ne s'est pas arrãªtes elle a pris sa course nne et nous on sâ€™attendait au moment de croisement avec l'avion qu'on observait tout a l'heure et qui a pris le direction de l'est.Et au moment du croisement il s'es tavere que la lumiã¨re ã©tait beaucoup plus haute que l'avion et on a observe la lumiã¨re jusquâ€™ã  sa disparition dans l'horizon.Sa trajectoire est directe et sa vitesse est stable mais surement pas celle d'un avion. description de la lumiã¨re;premiã¨re observation au dessus de nos tã¨tes.;forme circulaire entourã©e avec la couleurs orange et au centre couleur chrome ou bleu c'est difficile de distinguer le genre de couleur mais c'est comme un miroir .Dâ€™aprã¨s son altitude, comparã©e a celle de l'avion ,cette lumiã¨re est de grande taille et pas de bruit .J'ai voulu faire ce tã©moignage car  j'ai vu un phã©nomã¨ne incroyable  jamais vu une chose pareille ce n'est ni un avion ni un hã©licoptã¨re ni un missile .Cela s'est passe tres vite qu'on a pas pu observer autre chose comme le carcasse d'une ovni ou????","distance":"Over One

objects were gone, took less than 3 minutes to cross entire sky. still many erratic blinking lights observed for a few minutes after. myself and another witness experienced real screaming fear ( approx. at zenith, realizing can't be space station, to fast, bright and not moving exactly straight) yelling trying to wake 3rd party. once calmer, i looked at other witness and face appeared puffy around left eye/cheek, i commented that it looked like he was hit by a bus. the last quarter moon started to rise shortly later. noticed strange things like my beverage given by 3rd party before he
