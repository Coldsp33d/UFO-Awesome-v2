make contact utilizing dr. steven greer's ce5 protocols, loosely , but within the major points we meditated. in a peaceful and loving way, both of us sent out a beam of energy from our astral bodies asking for peaceful contact, so that we could have proof and move on with our lives, of which proof actually came to fruition later on, and in very different ways. \r\n\r\n   we traveled to the large hill near our home and briefly held a meditation together, asking for contact and visualizing our position on the earth, so as to share it with them and initiate contact. shortly after, my wife signaled the triangle symbol with a red led lit balloon (mimicking the one that dr. greer has adopted) at a light that appeared in the northeast sky  which could have been a plane, but we both didn't know. as soon as she did this, the light grew to 10x and began to approach us.(this is when i began filming) mind you, this thing was miles in the sky and still was lit up pretty good. no planes that night seemed to have remotely as big of lights as this glowing orb did.  as we had a similar experience the night previous to this one (5/29/16) we thought that it could be truly another being from another place. {the previous ball of light looked the same size, moved much like an airplane, then turned into a 747 after it passed over the roof of the building we were in}then the extreme experience happened. i'll be honest, the unexpected. \r\n\r\n   as i zoomed in my cell phone  video camera (htc m9) we both watched as it came closer, closer ,closer until i all of sudden get bit by a mosquito (and you will hear both the mosquito and me blowing on the camera), coincidentally (perhaps, but i don't think so) the craft does a couple wiggles left and right, then tears i mean really moves fast into no where. my wife's reaction is telling, as i will leave the audio in, please excuse the cuss words, as it was a very unexpected event for both of us, but a very welcome one.  \r\n\r\n upon walking back home, my wife exclaimed to me that nothing in this life will be able to change her opinion on the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, and i felt doubly the same. unfortunately, the mosquito caused me to look away when the craft ascended and returned the way it came, so i did not witness the disappearance, only my wife did. \r\n\r\n  when i watch back the film on slow motion, i see as the craft disappears it seems to make a triangle in its movements and stop/slow points before ascending and dematerializing or leaving, and also makes what looks like a 45

(there was a search team looking for someone who was lost and hurt earlier in the day). when we saw the object, it came from the south, and headed north, toward the big dipper, and arced east until it disappeared behind the mountain.  the light was solid.  the time frame was for about 5 minutes, and we saw the object between somewhere in the estimated hour of 9:30 and 10:00p.M.   we had no sense of the size or scope of the object, but it seemed rather large.  we all commented it was strange we heard no noise before, during, or after it passed overhead.   we could hear the river flowing, which is about 200 feet away.  we could hear our fire crackle when we stepped out onto the loop road of the campground.  we observed the object until it disappeared behind the trees and behind the mountain/hill.  we all discussed what we had seen, and our experiences were all similar.  our initial thought was it was a plane, but given there were no flashing lights and absolutely no sound, and the fact the brightness never waivered, we are at a loss to explain what we saw.  we discussed it being a chinese lantern, but discounted that, as there was no flicker.  the sighting made all three of us excited and happy to have witnessed it.  one person said it made her heart pounding in her chest.

husband had to leave for work. my 11 year old daughter and i stayed up late watching t.V. we were lying on the couch and i started dosing off. we both heard the sound of a helocoptor was right above our house. very close and loud. my daughter said she was going to go outside and see the helecopter. i dosed off and was awakened when she came running into the house screaming hysterically, and slammed the door shut. she yelled \"it's a ufo, a ufo!\"\r\n\"above our house\" i jumped up. \"i want to see it.\" i said, as i headed tword the door. \"no, no, mom!\" she screamed hysterically, while grabbing my arm, \"they'll get you.\" i quickly pulled away, opened the door, stepped down the steps and glanced up over the roof. there was nothing. but i heard our two backyard dogs barking. i came back inside and said it was gone.We both ran to the back bedroom to see if we could see it but it was gone. she was still very shacken up about it, so i sat down and had her tell me every detail about it. but first i made note of the time,around 3:00 am. she said when she walked out the door, down the steps and looked up she saw a dark grey metallic colored triangle ufo hovering above the roof of our house. it had a bright round white light at each of its 3 rounded  corners. she said she was so scared after seeing it ,that she kind of froze and couldn't believe her eyes. but then started thinking that the alien that was driving it might see her and try to take her, so she finally decided to run back inside. the bottom of the craft had a circle design in the middle of the bottem. a large circle, then a smaller one inside, then a smaller one in that one, and on and on until a dot was in the very center of the circles. the triangle was big enough to cover our whole house, and close enough to hit with a baseball. i totally believe my daughter saw this ufo. i've never seen her so frightened. she told me she had terrible nightmares about aliens that had faces covered with fur,for weeks after that.She also didn't really care to talk about it when i would bring the subject up. i tried to report this years ago, but due to a not so good computor, the very long story somehow got erased, and i didn't have the energy to retype it all again. my daughter still remembers everything from that day and i doubt she'll ever forget it. your welcome to ask her more about it.

the two aliens. it is something i wish we could just forget. but we cant. over the years weird things keep happening. an example, we woke up one morning at each of us found a dot of blood on our

clearest & crispest for observing, but i could still see them distinctly enough for viewing with & without the telescope. there was hardly any cloud cover,maybe a little haze and the intensity of the stars was blocked by the street lamp shining accross the street.  as my boyfriend was adjusting the telecope, i looked directly above me & i fixed my eyes upon a cluster of stars to the north/north east.\r\n\r\nmost of the stars in this group were distinct, but not overly bright, some small, far away, faded.  however, there were two \"white brighter stars\" that stood out a bit more.  i noticed that they both were moving toward each other, in a straight-line path, so that one was above & one was below, crossing paths & being in opposite directions of each other. (one went from the left to the right above or directly over the other going from the right to the left.) at least one of these white star-like objects appeared to have a faint trail behind it, but i'm not 100% sure.  when they started moving, i was definitely doubting that they were stars at all, and certainly not shooting stars, because they were not moving that fast, but more on the slower side, that of the speed of a plane. \r\n\r\nthe most unusual part of this all, is that when the white star-like objects crossed paths and went into opposition of each other, they slowed down and stopped. (i'm not sure about the distance they travelled, as they were way up high.) when they stopped, they both glowed white, the one that moved left to right, glowed a bit more than the other, & then they both faded, became stationary and dim like the rest of the other stars, as if these objects were \"camoflauging\" with the rest of their surroundings.  this session lasted for about 30 seconds, and when they stopped moving & became stationary or \"hovering\", they didn't move at all from their positions while i was staring at them for at least a minute more.\r\n\r\nthere was no sounds, no unusual shifts or crazy patterns of movement, however, i did find these white star-like objects unusual in themselves how they were presented, they surely stood out to me & made me question what they were about enough to make me at least want to report this incident.  psychologically, when i looked up, before i even saw the objects move, i was thinking to myself, \"it would really be cool to see some more ufo's & of course, something strange had to happen!","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":76711,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5536606,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05312016-0002","longitude":-70.55088289999999,"occurred":1464651600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1464657035000,"summary":"Two star-like objects moving in straight-line path, in opposition of each other.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"04276","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Rumford, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:77297"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Los Angeles","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I stepped out of my house to get something from my car. when i noticed 2 very bright lights in the sky heading straight into space. they looked like 2 bright fire balls. one desented into space then the other followed behind. they were not planes or fireworks that for sure! i know for a fact that a plane, air ballon or firework go that far into the sky...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":76710,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.27708824857386,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05312016-0002","longitude":-118.56483319640598,"occurred":1464641100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1464655109000,"summary":"2 bright red lights","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"91335","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:77298"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Charlotte","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 9:40 est i went outside to smoke a cigarette and talk to my boyfriend on the phone. we were talking about the north star and mars over to our left and having a little romantic moment because we were looking at the same star in different places (about 12 miles away.)all of a sudden he pointed out an object and said \"do you see that thing?\" and i said \"yea! its going super fast\" that's when he said he saw it dip down almost in a 90 degree angle but by that time it had gone out of my focal point because i was behind my tall apartment building. he was able to see it for a longer duration because he was in a more open space without buildings and trees. the object was high in the atmosphere and there were no blinking lights. immediately after i saw the object, i saw a plane fly over. comparatively, the plane was traveling significantly slower and it was clearly a plane with blinking lights on the wings. the possibility of what i saw being a shooting star or meteor is impossible because this object unnaturally changed flight patterns. upon telling my mother what i saw when i went inside, i got goose bumps and she could physically see i was excited. i'm sure more people saw the object because i live in a densely populated city and it is memorial day so many people are outside grilling and shooting fireworks.

chance i looked up and noticed a tiny dot high in the sky. at first i thought it was a planet, but after observing i realized it was slowly moving from left to right (east to south) in a slight upward angle. it was moving much too fast to be a planet and much to slow to be a satellite. curious, i yelled to my roommate to get his camera. once i was able to show him the anomaly he was able to get 5 pictures. the object stopped moving from left to right and began moving straight up until it crossed a very high altitude transparent cloud. once it was in the area of the cloud it slowly faded from sight. the entire event lasted about 7 minutes.\r\n\r\nnote, i'm aware that the iss was to do a flyover in my area, but that wasn't supposed to happen until 9:35 p.M., two hours after the observed event.\r\n\r\nit was an hour before sunset, so the sun was low to the west. to the naked eye the object appeared spherical and brighter on the side of the sun. occasionally the object would dim. at no time did it look self-luminous, nor did it twinkle. i would say that it looked reflective, then less reflective, then reflective again, but with no apparent pattern. \r\n\r\nmy roommate downloaded the photographs to his laptop, opened them in an image viewer and zoomed in up to 800%. of the five photographs, we had images of very different objects even though they were all the same object. one image appeared as a fuzzy sphere, one a metallic sphere,one very fuzzy but with two points of reflection, one oblong and orange with what looks like a silver sphere at the bottom and, lastly, one that looked like a orange gold bell with a number of reflective spheres at it's base. no two images are alike yet all are of the same object only moments apart.\r\n\r\nmy roommate saved the images to a usb stick and i opened all the images in photoshop to see if i could get a better image, but could not. the object was so distant that past a certain point of zoom the just became too pix-elated. under file info i made sure we had a time stamp and camera type used. i did not save in photoshop. the photographs i'm attaching are the originals. in all five photos you will see, pretty much dead center, a very faint dot, when your experts zoom in between 300 and 800% they will see what's got me scratching my head.\r\n\r\nif you have any questions please feel free to call or email. the originals are still on the camera.\r\n\r\nall i ask in return for my description and photos is your professional opinion as to what the heck this thing is.\r\n\r\none final note, beale air force base is about 30 miles west of where i live.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time,\r\n\r\nderek\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,
