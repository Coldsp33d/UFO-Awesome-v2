walking home at 1am i noticed what looked like a very bright star in the distance and to the east, it was so bright i began to think it might be a search light on a helicopter although it didn't appear to emit a beam, after a few moments i was unsure but felt it might be two seperate lights and decided it must be a helicopter in the distance and continued home. at 1.30am i went outside to put rubbish in a bin and saw an object almost directly overhead. i couldn't make out a shape to the object but there were four rectangular white lights in the shape of a diamond and a green light in the centre. i am guessing it was at an altitude of 1000 to 1500 feet and if so then it was probably bigger in length and width than a jumbo jet and the lights were each as big as a bus. it was silent and moving north west at about 5mph. i watched it travel about 300 metres and it appeared to stop, it didn't turn but started to move back toward me and retraced its path. i observed it for 30 minutes as it slowly moved back to the original position i had first observed it at 1am, this is how i determined it was the same object i had originally seen. my estimate of it's altitude is based in part on the fact i had to move more than once to keep it in sight because the terrain and buildings meant i couldn't keep it in view from one spot. i was now observing exactly what i had been observing at 1am and at this moment a young woman who lives nearby came along and i pointed it out to her, she told me that she and some friends had observed the same thing a week earlier doing exactly the same thing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

large reclining lawn chair positioned in the center of the lower half of our yard. my mother was approximately thirty feet away, tending to her garden. my dog was in approximately the same area as my mother. \r\n\r\nfor some reason i decided to look directly above me, where i saw the ovular object hovering perhaps three hundred feet directly overhead. if held at arm's length, i would say it would take up roughly the same space as a small pizza along the longest axis of the object.The object was roughly twice as long as it was wide. i distinctly remember feeling curious, wondering what this strange thing was. i also remember feeling a slight apprehension or incredibly mild fear at the sight of object. \r\n\r\nwatching it for several seconds, i noted that it seemed to lack a definite outline, seeming somewhat fuzzy. i blinked several times, fearing i might have accidentally looked at the sun and that this was some strange after effect to no avail- the object remained. the object itself was the deepest, darkest shade of pitch black i have ever seen. there seemed to be no shine, reflectivity, or other light affecting the coloration of the blackness. emanating from the center of the craft was an extremely dark purple pulsation that radiated outward from the center until it reached the edge of the object where it dissipated. watching it for several moments, the object eventually, in the span of one or two seconds, gradually faded out of sight. at no point did it perform any maneuvers or move in any way. i looked up, saw it, watched it, and it disappeared. i remember that it never occurred to look away from the object. i felt fascinated by it, and wanted to keep watching it. i'm also not entirely aware of how much time elapsed; thirty seconds is merely the best estimate i am able to give. being outside, i had no ready access to a timepiece.\r\n\r\nsnapping back to my perceptions, i looked over and saw my mother and dog. i very matter of factly asked her if she had seen the thing in the sky. she then replied, \"what thing in the sky?\" since she hadn't seen it, i dismissed the conversation with a quick, \"never mind\". probably the oddest thing about this is that i remember the incident clear as day, while the memory of almost all of my young childhood is extremely faded or nonexistent. \r\n\r\ni'm not sure if this is relevant, but i feel i should include that i was noted very early in my education as being very intellectually gifted. i was a candidate to skip grades several times and was tested as having the reading ability of a college freshman in the fifth grade. also of note is that as a child, i was absolutely terrified being or sleeping in my own bedroom, such that i was more frightened by being in there than i have ever been by nything else in my life thus far.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

then, went whoa!, and glanced again and saw a different thing than i've seen anywhere else.\r\n4.Especially after i realized there were long horizontal lights down each tube, the tubes seemed to have some thick ribs spaced quite a disatance apart.Joined together with something thinner & darker. the pinnacle of the isocoles triangle had a space where a star sized light twinkled. then as i was trying to see it clearly, it flashed. after the flash it got a brighter white & all the other lights on the tubes grew brighter to drown out any definition. the clouds then moved until it was covered completely.\r\n\r\n5.I was suprised. shocked how large this triangli noticed that there is a structure (metallic/lead)not very shiny,but also not reflecting the long bright white light. i was excited. the sky was clear too. each side, 2x the length of a 747 at boarding gate perspective, probably 2.5 miles awa towards pearl harbor. there were no other aircraft in the sky. i only kept looking because after i noticed the triangle shaped light in the sky, i grew up not far frorm a naval air base in the country, on their landing & departure path. bucks county fields where i saw f18's pilot wave at me below radar as a kid on my bike. so, i know this wasn't even a flying wing or black triangle. i know about the tr3b. i've driven down the highway at night when what i think was a stealth came in and was above my vehicle. afterwards, i looked around. haven't seen a picture like this triangle. definately not. no light arrangement in a long rectangle. no \"connecting dark tube? that lights up to a star sized  magenta/orange, it seemed  seperate from the triangle, then, it flashed brighter. and returned to normal. then it became brighter till it turned bright white light. then the tube lights lit up the cloud cover. i mean the moon was pretty much covered in the sky behind me.\r\n6. lost sight of the object due to cloud cover moving in once the lights blinded out the structure. \r\n\r\nthe poor quality video i took kindof on my i phone 5s is on my periscope. \r\nhowever, since i'm in hawaii on oahu;- i've seen so many lights manuvering the beach in the past. i tried to get them on i

incredible when it's clear from my view so i was essentially just admiring its beauty. i noticed about 5 stars i had never seen before that seemed to have an orb like motion and carry a bright white center but a bright purple, green and slightly red aura around this star like phenomena. (the red was a very minor glimmer as opposed to the other shimmering colors) the problem with the idea of the star looking lights moving as i saw them was that i felt like i was suffering from some sort of vision impairment. i felt like everything i was looking at became blurry and i was not any sort of fatigued nor under the influence for my vision to have appeared in this way, when suddenly my eyes locked onto this huge greyish/dark brown bat/owl/reptile looking hybrid completely silent and gliding unnaturally fast over my home.I don't really know where he came from or how my eyes locked onto this thing especially in such a dark setting. i lost sight when he silently glided over my home out of sight, but i swear he landed on my roof. i am not 100% sure of this. this strange creature had a seemingly large set of wings, and i don't doubt if they were spread the span would be incredible, but it seemed to have its wings folded in a triangle style form which lead the entire creature to resemble the worlds largest most terrifying moth!! i suddenly felt a sense of dread vulnerability and impending doom, and i felt like i was being hovered over and watched like an animal stalks its prey. i don't scare easy, and i live for the paranormal, but it is now 4:18 pm and i still am feeling the same sense of fear and dread as i did in that moment and i don't know how to tame this psychological issue. it was comparable to anxiety, but i ultimately felt like my life was about to end..I can't describe it any better. before i was able to stand up i heard a screech comparable to a bat, except it was a much lower tone, and it definitely sounded much larger than any bat around here. i live in a small town surrounded by woods, so bats and animals of that sort cross my path often. this was nothing like it. what was strange is my hearing felt distorted while i heard the screeching. i felt like i could hear it right above me, yet sometimes it felt like it was muffled and unclear, it made me second guess what i heard. this has been the most horrifying sighting i have ever witnessed so far to be honest.

telepathically. the communication gives me hope for mankind. my aunt lived on a vast amount of land in a small cottage on the hill. everyday after school, weather permitting, i would walk miles down the hill with the dogs, singing, twirling, and enjoying. i was only 16 years of age, and one day while walking down the hill, i turned and glanced a white shining orb advancing my way. i took my glasses off, cleaned them, and looked again. trying to convince myself it was just a white glowing sun playing tricks on my eyes. i choose to ignore it and began walking down, then i looked again. it was a mere 3 ft. from me, across the street, and just about a foot over my head. i  just had to tilt my head slightly to see it. it was a bright shining orb with no glare, it was easy for my eyes to look at it. looking at it in disbelief, it's as though \"they\" knew what i was thinking, at that instant,  it turned as if on an axis, and just outside the lighted orb i saw some kind of metal silver rim, that was turning, then again only the orb. my mind was convinced it was real. then a question came into my mind, something like, \"would you like to go to our planet, to come back and teach our ways back on earth. i did not have any fear, and my thoughts were too many people would worry about me, i can't go. then i thought what if it can't read my thoughts, so i ran up the hill and into the house. at the same speed of my pace the ufo came up the hill with me, it wasn't until a turned toward the house, it veered toward the opposite direction of the pasture. after looking out the window it was just outside, across the street, above the pasture. my aunt asked, \"what did you see?\" i told her, thinking she would tell me i was imagining things. she asked my to go to the porch with her to see if we could see it. we were holding hands, the sky was dimming into night, and we watched it together descend into the sky. it simply looked like a star that faded into the night. that week, some boys camping reported to our town paper, they had witnessed a ufo. my aunt took me for a hike through the pastures the next day, we walked forever with walking sticks. we didn't talk much at all, we came across a \"clearing\" if you will. it was huge, sunken pit, the tree line grew around this pit, very little vegetation inside the pit. i thought this could be where they land. my aunt told me she saw them all the time. her kids confirmed she had told them about the sightings, though they never saw them. i wonder sometimes if they chose me because at that time in my life, because i had an innocence and optimism about life. my experience left me with the assurance that this particular life form, is benevolent. i had no fear, and i do not believe i was abducted in anyway. since that time i have seen other ufo's near lake travis, in texas. my kids have witnessed them as well. one event is well documented in the news, orbs speeding down above lake travis. my son and i witnessed that one together.
