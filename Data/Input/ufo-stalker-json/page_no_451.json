interfering with the picture.  i'll post the videos and pictures that i was able to capture. while recording the 4 minute video, you'll see that a light came back that i was talking about, flying from the left to the right. disapear and then come back again.\r\nat 12:35, i shot the video that shows two lights, flashing in a sequence, from left to right. the left light seems to be brighter. there's

object moving from the north to the south in a straight line. the object was visible to the naked eye but i grabbed my bushnell 7x35 binoculars getting a clearer image of the object. i still could not make out any details because of the white light. i heard no noise coming from the object the entire time it was observed.\r\n\r\ni then grabbed my sony camcorder with night vision to start recording the object. my camcorder uses 8mm tape, has 180x digital zoom, and i used totmc 2.0 video grabber to convert the 8mm tape to mpeg 2 format. the tape can easily be checked confirming my video is not a hoax.\r\n\r\ni recorded the object for a little over a minute. at the 57 second mark the object begins to fade and disappear even though it still has not passed over me. i go to full zoom (180x) and then pan out but i still cannot recapture the object. this is why the video gets grainy. at approximately the 1 minute mark, i put the camera down in attempt to regain visual contact both with the naked eye and my binoculars. i am unsuccessful and the object has vanished in front of my very eyes. i estimate the object disappeared when it almost directly overhead.\r\n\r\ni am also uploading additional videos that were taken the next night of conventional (commercial and private) aircraft flying near my home. i took these videos between 10:00pm pst and 11:00pm pst. although these planes were flying at lower altitude, i still believe i would have observed the standard navigation and flashing beacon lights that are required on all aircraft, especially when flying in commercial airspace, during my anomalous observation from the night before. \r\n\r\nthe weather conditions for the evening of 5/25/2016, were as follows:\r\n\r\nclear - no cloud cover\r\nvisibility 10 miles\r\n0.00 precipitation\r\ntemperature 60.1 degrees\r\naverage humidity 55 \r\npressure 30.7\r\n\r\nthe weather conditions for the next night were nearly identical. \r\n\r\n1) the first video called jet 1 is a commercial jet flying over my house. the jets usually fly from west to east; coming in from the ocean towards land. this jet was directly overhead.\r\n2)the second video jet 2, is a plane just coming in from over the ocean heading directly towards my house.\r\n3)this third video is the same jet as above but now its flying directly overhead \r\n4)the fourth video is a propeller driven aircraft that was flying from north to south towards the rear of my house.\r\n5)finally, the last video is of the ufo. it was traveling from north to south but in the front of my house.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:09","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

however, we were able to rule that idea out because it was moving too quickly and had no flashing lights.\r\n\r\n4.The object looked like a particularly bright star, with matching size and color. the object also seemed to \"twinkle\" like a star. however, it was moving across the sky about as rapidly as a low flying plane (we saw several low-flying planes afterward to compare). it moved in an apparent straight line, approaching the horizon.\r\n\r\n5.Everyone was watching the object, speculating about what it might be. one person went to get a telescope, but couldn't make it in time. in the end, we agreed that we didn't know what the object was. however, the night continued on normally afterwards.\r\n\r\n6.The object seemed to vanish abruptly (faded out in less than a second) when it neared the horizon. this is possibly due to cloud cover, as there were clouds in the area. this happened just before we finished setting up a telescope to view the object.\r\n\r\nnote: immediately after the event, we saw several planes moving towards the place the ufo had vanished. continuing through the night and into the next morning, we heard various sirens.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

something strange hovering above the adjacent quay west hotel. there was a flat rectangular object that was very slowly moving towards the east. it had four dim white lights on each corner. initially, i had a hard time trying to identify the object, thinking that maybe it was a plane. i saw no navigation or strobe lights, and there is no way a plane could fly so slow. as an aviation enthusiast, i knew most modern aircraft types, both military and civil, yet i am unable to associate this with anything i knew. then i saw that there were 2 more similar looking objects of roughly equal size (about 50 m in length and 20 m in width) on the right and left of the first. the two other objects were hovering. then the first object started to rotate (not turn or change direction) about 90 degrees and then dissapeared. this procedure was then followed by the craft on the left then the one on the right. that is all. i continue to be confused what happened, but i knew for certain that it was a craft
