miles south of hill air force base.  hill conducts training fly-overs all the time, so seeing aircraft is commonplace. on this particular day an f-16 flew over drawing my attention.  thinking that i might see another, i looked to the north and up and spied a bright silvery object high in the air. it was moving very lazily from north to south and appeared to be bobbing about like a balloon. my daughter also saw it.\r\n\r\nfrom time to time mylar balloons come untied and float away, so i thought what i was seeing was a balloon because object looked round and metallic because it glittered in the sky like silver mylar balloon.\r\n\r\nas i watched the object, to my amazement, it suddenly stopped dead, moved a bit further to the south and then did a very tight and quick 180-degree turn and shot off in a direct line to the north, vanishing in under three seconds. i could not tell if it was going up, but it appeared to be, also.\r\n\r\nfor the record, i was raised in western washington in the middle of seattle boeing field, seatac international airport, mcchord afb, renton boeing field, paine field where the 747s are built and at least four regional airports. simply put, i have seen aircraft of all types. i even saw an sr-71 and a b-2 bomber in flight when they were not supposed to exist. thus, i think i have a pretty good understanding of how various types of aircraft look on the ground and in the air. i even worked at boeing field in seattle for three years.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was not an airplane by our standards. no aircraft that i have ever seen stops in midair and then pulls a turn that, to me, appeared to have a radius of the same length as the object was wide. an airplane would literally have to turn on a wingtip to make such a turn. \r\n\r\nmy wife thought it might have been a helicopter. that is a possibility. helicopters can stop in midair and turn on their own axis, but the object seemed too high for any helicopter i have been around and definitely moved too fast of one when it disappeared.\r\n\r\ni wish that i could have taken photos or a video, but the event happened too quickly.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

to 9 pm. we were talking about the planet mars and on the local 6 pm news they mentioned that you could really see the planet very well tonight. i had walked outside of the garden area to the other side of our house to place some garbage in the can. i saw how much better you could see mars because there were no lights on in the other area of our house.\r\n we were looking all around us 360 degrees and focused on venus more in southwest sky, then at mars which was about 60 degrees in the sky from the southwest in alignment from venus.\r\n we were talking about how some stars seem to appear to have another one just behind them and that it was making them look bigger and brighter and then we talked about the app you could get on your phone to map the stars.\r\nin an area that was about 30 degrees and more north from where mars was there were maybe 3 to 4 stars that were in that area and they were about the same in size, except for one that was a little brighter than the rest.\r\n all of a sudden within this little area there was a whole group of star like objects maybe 10 to 15 of them and they were all twinkling at different intervals!!! but then about four of them started making these little random jumps in the sky as they were moving to the southwest. then two of them made larger jumps in the sky and the others disappeared. the two remaining lights then disappeared and reappeared about 30 degrees from where we last saw them with the group. \r\n we were absolutely amazed as we have never seen anything like this in the skies before. of the two of us, i'd taken astronomy classes and the other is retired from the major aerospace company in tucson. so, we have been privy to different types of launches that have occurred in our tucson skies. \r\nthe two objects that were left continued on the southwestern path and they had pulsating lights on them, also there was no sound coming from these objects, they disappeared into the dark of the sky.\r\n we talked about what we'd just seen and the other person said that they thought at first that she was seeing lightning when the group first appeared. i was comparing the random twinkling to a certain type of firework that goes up into the air then explodes into a random white twinkling as it goes downward. these objects were in no way fireworks,they were traveling in a southwestern path. when the few of them did the sky jumping, light skipping if you will, i could see a light trail that was from the arch of the jump. we both felt light hearted because it seemed that the lights were kind of playing around. \r\n as a point of reference, we came out after about an hour later and we saw two planes, they were much closer and traveling in different directions and we could both hear the sound that came from the motors. one was a small airplane and the other was a jet plane that was coming in to the tucson int'l airport.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

directly overhead when first watched through binoculars).  this was a perfectly round bright, white light only, with no other lights and no discernible body.  as it passed over the city toward the

a star in the same field of vision and it wasn't squiggling. i felt amazed and curious and came right in to report this.  a lot of people had to see this (unless they were all texting).  the object

instructed to. \r\n\r\ni am writing because i have alien implants inside of myself in subcutaneous locations as well as in between my joints, armpits, spine, neck, eyes, teeth and face. i am a very light sleeper but since december 2012, i have fallen asleep completely unaware of  my surroundings. i wake up as if i awoken from a surgical procedure. what i conclude is that i am administered a form of anesthesia as i sleep. this claim is supported by the fact that my cotton sheets have a thick film of oil on them which speaks to gas.\r\n\r\ni have implants in places i have never had surgery such as my skull face, ears, nose, shoulders, spine, buttocks,vaginal areas they are every where. typically when abductees provide testimony they speak of being implanted with one device for tracking purposes. when clearly i am implanted not just for tracking and monitoring but as a means to modify my behavior. it seems the military is working with aliens to achieve that aim.\r\n\r\ni had a profession in the public sphere as a singer and community outreach professional and these implants are used to distort my looks, impact cognitive functioning and artistic creations for political, racialized and market place reasons. so when we think of aliens based on my case the public needs to start thinking so aliens as a tool to violate the civil rights of people and crucify members from the protected class. aliens are being used to help the government infringe on the rights of human beings and to perversely retool the idea of affirmative action. therefore, when we reframe the way in which aliens are discussed a whole door will burst open with regards to ufo testimonies.\r\n\r\nthe aliens are the new kkk and skinhead and when any one looks at my radiology scans this proclamation rings loud and clear. i have four types of radiology scans which show rfids, carbonnano tubes, nano wires, obvious neuro transmitters, nano stamps, some type of wiring systems around my nose, microfluidics, elastomer actuator polymer based material, nano sensors and artificial muscles/flesh. \r\n\r\nmoving forward, i have had providers admit to the existence of implants but with trepidation. for example, one nurse swore that i had surgical procedures in which a rod was inserted into my knee. however, she refrained from discussing the matter when i assured her i did not have surgery and the implants were illegally inserted into my person.  in addition, a pain management doctor said my xrays were abnormal, illuminated. that doctor felt the implant in my cheeks however he had no idea what the objects were. another pain management doctor felt an implant in my knee.\r\n\r\nfrom 1982 i have experienced ufo sightings but i did not write the date, i just took a mental note. in more present times, i seen ets from 2013 to present. i though what i observed was fake a projection by the military.  i never believed what i observed was part of an alien/military project. i strictly believed that the sightings was the working of a military, gov and criminal enterprise. however as some of these implants are so intricately linked and sneakily positioned in my body with no surgery marks, i profess that significant alien involvement is involved with regards to implantation.\r\n\r\ni have contacted mufon because i have tried for three years to get the appropriate assistance and never gained ground. after talking with the state director, i know i am in the right place at the right time ready to make history so i am very blessed and i feel like proclaiming a

to local media that a large object was seen over the east coast region and was determined to be a bolide (meteor). i was interested in astronomy and was intrigued by this but didn't give it much thought at the time.\r\n\r\ni had been on the highway near my home and got off the next exit and as i was going under an underpass i noticed my car engine cut-out for just a split second as i was accelerating. i noticed this because my car had never done anything like this before.\r\n\r\nas i proceeded westbound on the road near my house i noticed a formation of orange lights in the distance ahead over the treetops, i would estimate at the time about 1-1.5 miles distant. at first i surmised it was from the lights of the local tv station tower due to the formation i observed, but quickly realized the direction was wrong.\r\n\r\non a whim, i decided to continue past the turn-off to my neighborhood on the right and continue west just to get a closer look at these lights. even back then,(i was about 18 and i had read a few ufo books like 'interrupted journey' and 'incident at exeter') so i checked my watch for the time.\r\n\r\nwell, as i left the populated area and headed out into what was then farmland i looked up and over the field near the road i realized the lights were right there over my car (at about 70 degrees elevation) and much closer than i expected. also, i observed that they had been moving slowly to the south, they now appeared to be hovering over a freshly plowed field at 500-1000 feet altitude.\r\n\r\nthis formation was a trapezoidal configuration with two objects in the front and two others following slightly farther apart in the rear,(all were orange). i panicked and made a sharp right turn at the intersection under the objects and floored my car down the road (i'm still kicking myself for bugging-out so quick).\r\n\r\nas i fled the scene i looked over my shoulder to the left, or maybe in my rear-view mirror and i distinctly saw the four objects had come closer together and were descending rapidly towards the ground. that was the last i saw of them, but it is not the end of the story.\r\n\r\ni drove down some back roads planning to head home and was struck by the fact that there were no other cars on any of the roads on which i was driving. i had been totally alone even though it was a friday night and traffic should have been heavier.\r\n\r\nafter i got home i was scared and told my father and brother what i had seen, but my brother said it was probably just a bunch of helicopters.\r\n\r\nlater, my family got a phone call from my aunt saying my grandmother had been admitted to the hospital and she passed away about two weeks later, (strange coincidence).\r\n\r\nanyway, the very next day i was standing in line at the local fast-food restaurant and i saw a girl i knew there. so i asked her if she had seen anything unusual the night before? her eyes bugged out and she said,\"did you see those four orange lights too?\". i said i did and she told me that she and her friends had been at the local drive-in movie theater nearby when the lights passed overhead. and \"everybody stopped watching the movie and got out of their cars to look at what they were\".\r\n\r\nso i at least had some validation of my sighting. i also dragged my brother and a friend out to the spot to look for landing traces in the freshly plowed fields, but there were none.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

one time event. this happened over the cow pasture nextdoor to me. i was taking pictures of the clouds and did not notice them until later when i uploaded from ds card to my computer. i enlarged and adjusted contrast a little. the forked tailed one is quite clear the other is fuzzy due to the cloud cover and looks like it may be a drone of sorts. there has been a steady sound of a static/frenquecy noises, day and night. sounds of something running, engines or something. ground vibrates or rocks. i get sensations of falling or of being turned or being lifted. the house and ground are vibrating as i type this. i will address the clouds here before i get to the rest of the show that has been going on. the shapes range from chevrons, triangle, long cylinders with a shark like head on one end. then there are the creature shapes, dragons.Demonic looking entities some have or a kind of weird deformity. they go into one another and also exit. i have seen them meet in a large group like they are discussing something and leave in different directions. i can hear them speaking sometimes but they sound far off and metallic. they have acknowledged me on occasion and i them. i always have my camera and binoculars with me so i started looking a little closer. i believe  they are coming to the ground by way of the trees. some are using what seems to be giant nets up at the tree tops. they walk down right out of tree tops. hammock like areas in the pine trees and dense green leaves like a blind in the others. all seem to be more active at night. at night the terrain will change buildings appear and walkways open up in the trees. sometimes a giant entity will turn a tree, tip it over at its roots and little people come out. they can be under piles of debris too. singing is someting that i hear almost night, always a song i have orcistxever heard before. there are some that look like they are made of vegation, branches and dirt. then there are the robotic, insect, the little browm people,etc. i wish i could draw. i did get some night pictures, sometimes you can not see them but the camera can. i feel the energy they are giving off, it is not a good feeling. recently i somehow end up with thorn, look like little arrow headsin my skin, scratches and bite marks. the barn roof is going to fall in, they are jumping on it, another one has a machete and he can be heard chopping branches with it. most of the trees here are getting brown and or big holes in the foliage. i feel this stuff is all connected i have photos and witness. tell me , should i be calling a priest too? most of these pics were taken by me on my nikon coolpix, nothing fancy. i really would like it if you could send someone in person to see first hand,this is no joke
