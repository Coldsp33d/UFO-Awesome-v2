was that pepsi blue color. after we both were checking each other out, the ship slowly and carefully lowered a deer that to me seemed to be the size of a fawn with folded legs down to the ground where the deer now full sized ran across the road in front of us. i looked out the back of the truck window and the ship had gone back to the size of a small blue star or light and went on its way continuing along the tops of the corn. since this incident, we have seen them several times and the last time the body of the small ship it was the same size, but had the blue outline and we could almost see thru it. it was once again close to the road not caring that we saw it. the other blue lights were in a field going up and down as if they were working. neither of us will forget it. i had

(so from our pov the malrverns were infront of us, and the object moved down diagonally left [west])\r\n\r\nwe finally lost sight of it when it reached the city of gloucester and as it had appeared to be near ground level since it left the malverns it just merged into the city lights. the whole sighting lasted about a minute and a half, during which my friend and i both kept saying \"what the hell isss that??!!\" we both recounted what we saw to each other afterwards, and both agreed that the object had traveled from the malvern hills to gloucester (around 23 miles) in around 30 seconds. i did try to film it initially but quickly realised that the phone i had at the time the camera app was not working properly. very annoying! (not sure how good the quality would have been anyway!)\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are often strange objects that cannot be identified in the night sky, but until they do something distinctly bizzarre, i usually tend to write them off... hope to see another one one day, i'm only 31 and am looking up more than ever now! :d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nps i have included a .Jpg of the view we had at the time (we were slightly higher up, and it was a bit darker), the white dot is about the same size and location as where the object first 'turned on'... we then noticed it again a very short while later and it had then moved to the left and proceeded to loop and fade colour, very rough patterning done in microsoft paint. sorry for the crudeness!\r\n\r\ni hope this report helps fit another small peice to the seemingly infinitely large puzzle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering

was 8th grade basketball practice which puts this event between october and december of 1976.  generally i was scared most of my life always looking down as i walked worried about what my father was going to do when i got home late.  i do not remember what the other 2 guys were doing but i remember that i found myself standing still looking at an angle of around 60 degrees through a tree -not a thick tree easy to see through it.  the ufo or should i say spaceship was directly above the tree which was around 50 ft tall.  i noticed that it had lights of the red variety moving around its perimeter.  i have no idea what was going on with the other 2 but i sensed they were in a trance like myself.  i felt that my mind was very slowly being engaged in some sort of thought exchange or maybe they were trying to ask me to do something( which is my surmise after 30 years of thinking about it) and i was getting more and more scared as time went by.  i actually remember now that in my mind i started playing this game where i was pretending to not understand what they were saying. i felt a sensitive loving communication not forcing or aggressive at all. then when i felt calmer i built up a little more courage and started really looking at it with more intent i tried to look into its windows for any activity and i might have seen something but not sure. i then said to myself ok they are about to leave hold my gaze on the ship so i can see where it goes and maybe even follow it -i know funny eventually it took off it went to the edge of my vision in about 1 second or less and veered off to the right with a red lighted trail.  all 3 of us snapped out of it and a police car was right there at that same moment the 2 guys went running to the cop car and started recanting the story and i ran home which happened to be 2 houses away  as i ran i heard the cop say yaa some people up the street said the same thing.  whatever went on with my communication it told me dont talk about this and besides my sister i told no one until about 20 or so years later it started coming up in conversation","distance":"21-100

of my eye i noticed a glowing movement in the sky. i looked, expecting to see a commercial plane or such like and instead caught sight of approximately 3 fast moving objects with an orange flickering aura, which appeared to be launching from the north of essex. these were followed by 3 more almost immediately. they looked like fireworks being launched consecutively with approximately 2 second intervals in between, except they made almost no noise. the noise that i could hear though sounded like the very distant sound of and afterburner, that you might hear on a larger jet engine.\r\nafter about a 30-40 seconds of staring in disbelief, i ran to the back door and called to my grandfather to come and take a look. at this point i had all kinds of thoughts racing through my mind but i needed someone to confirm that i wasn't imaging this.\r\nas he came out to take a look, 2-3 of the same objects had also taken to the skies, following exactly the same path as the first 6. all except the last one. it had a appeared to be moving in a more south-westerly direction and appeared to be launching later than the others, as well as being larger, slightly slower moving and with a more firey aura.\r\nboth my grandfather and i felt a little uneasy. i explained that i believed them to be missles and suggested why they might be in the sky. the only rational explanations i could think of was that we were under some kind of terrorist attack and these were being fired as some kind of deterrent or as an interception response to something very bad.\r\nall of the objects appeared to just vanish at their highest point, and without any sign of an explosion or collision. i'm no expert but i summarised that if they were missles, it was as if they run out of fuel and missed their target.\r\ni can't think what else they could have been. they travelled at a similar speed to what you might see a high altitude jet achieve.\r\nafter the event was over, i searched for some news about it on the web, hoping to find an explanation and when i found nothing, i searched for a way to report the event and found this website.
