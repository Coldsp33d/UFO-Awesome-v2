me the \"space nerd\" and come to me for answers to questions about physics and some basic info about how the universe works. i'm no expert by any stretch but i've watched enough h2 to be dangerous.. lol. any way. the event i'm talking about was by far one of the most unusual i've ever seen. now let me state that i have seen some interesting things during my 43 yrs, but this was pretty cool. i wish i had video but i know that you accept from time to time info without media to back the experience. so here we go. myself and a fellow firefighter were sitting out back of our fire house in indianapolis and were amazed at what we saw. we had just returned from a fire and were out back of the firehouse discussing the events that had just transpired (i'm  speaking of the fire we had just put out). while we were in the back of the firehouse. i noticed it first, then my buddy whom i have worked with for several yrs. i looked to the sky and noticed an object that was traveling in a stight line from east to west over the city. this was a very large object for its distance, but seemed to be \"flickering\" or \"flaming\" as it moved in its direction. now please understand that i've seen many \"falling stars\" meteorites in my 43 yrs. but the speed that this object moved was way to slow to be considered a falling star, also the trajectory was a striaght line.. horizontal. not veritacal or at an angle. the time that the object was observed was approximately 1-3min and it was captivating because of how it moved and the way that it \"flamed\" as it moved through the sky. meteorites tend to move quickly? this was very slow for what i've ever seen as far as travel for a meteorite. the object came into view what seemed to be out of nowhere. traveled the direction, all the time being very bright, and \"flickering\". also during travel time it finally went out of sight. maybe it burned out, or traveled out of sight.? i'm not sure. we have talked about this several times since it happened. because it was profound. in all my yrs of sky watching and space study, it was truly amazing to see such an event in my own backyard. darin, i love the show. i've wanted to share this event with others outside my fire dept family for a bit now. i'm watching your show as we speak actually. lol. i'm not a goof or someone who exaggerates stories, this was truly an amazing sight.. again... i wish i had video. it would've been great for the show. keep up the good work.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was standing on my back step saw a red light in the sky. it was sitting between two stars in the northwest (nnw) portion of the sky, then it moved toward the star in the west, slowly. it had a grey circle not exactly around it but off to the side of it. this was visible at times and not at others. then it did a strange loop, a circle in the sky, then cut east and moved very fast -- faster than a plane. i went down into the yard and it was descending fast toward the horizon in the east, and then i lost it past the roofs of the houses. i told family members and they suggested it could have been a drone -- apparently they can reach 4,000 feet. this is a holiday in canada and there were fireworks going on -- i saw no fireworks and this was definitely not a firework, though someone could have sent up a drone to film fireworks. however, it seemed very high in the sky and the grey disc/circular trail attached to it i cannot explain. it moved very fast across the sky. i was surprised at how low it seemed to get without changing in size (again, could have been a drone for that reason) but i did not think drones could move that

excited to see a ufo in the sky. i leaped up on his behalf but didn't think much of it. upon viewing it seemed stationary like a satellite, yet too high for a helicopter, way too high. it was in the eastern sky, slightly south. the more i stared the more colors could be faintly detected by the naked eye. i ran and snatched my 80-200mm zoom on my dslr. this puts my focal length at 300mm because of dx crop-sensor. instantly i could detect the true shape of the object. wheel-shaped with individual lights, or circular globes, which ringed the bottom of the wheel in full circumference, throbbing a burnt orange color, but sometimes white, hard to tell, other times easy to tell when it was orange. after about 7-8 minutes of viewing the object disappear and them reappeared further north, over the san gabriel mountains when another object in identical shape and characteristics, appeared next to it...In the sky probably an inch away which means a mile or two, i'm guessing. the second object didn't last long then receded away, vanishing. then nothing in the sky. a minute later the original (i'm guessing) object reappears in the far south. we took more shaky blurred photos and i continued

wars. i stared at it in awe for a good 15 seconds before my brain kicked in and i realized i should point it out. at this time it had made its way directly over us, and i could see the most beautiful blue color i've ever seen forming thick circles, smaller ones around the edges. at this point the ship looked spherical, like a glass planet. i saw what looked like hundreds of observation windows. i told my friends to look up, and we all watched as it very slowly, noiselessly continued onward. when it was going, my one friend said how it looked like a shuttle, which it kind of did by the 3 very bright lights visable on it's backside. if i hadn't of looked up, it would have buzzed us and we would never have seen it. i live in the mountains near canada and have spent many years searching a

very eager to show others. i showed a skeptic friend first who could only mutter, \"that's not a plane.\" his girlfriend then stated, \"that looks like something out of star trek.\" i personally felt a little giddy and honestly, a little validated. unfortunately, they got creeper out by it and don't want to talk about it, so it still feels a bit like being the only one with no one to discuss it with. i have googled and googled, and have not been able to find a picture of what we saw. i had my phone, might of been able to catch something even with my crappy camera on account it was so close,

angle. i'm resting from a major vascular surgery 2 weeks+ prior. the time is about 3 or 4 pm and well lit outside. it's about 2 or 3 days before my discharge to go home. i'm non-sedated. outside,about 2 blocks away from my vantage point (approximately the 10th floor) in the vancouver general hospital i saw a few seagulls circling around above a small group of buildings. i was enjoying  their little \"dance\" when from above them i saw what i thought was another seagull drop into their midst. i instinctively expected \"it\" to loop-de-loop like the other seagulls-but it did not. instead, it stopped about 100 to 200 feet above the ground. it then proceeded straight to my room and stopped about a foot from outside my window-about 15 feet from me.\r\n\r\ni recall thinking \"hey,just like a pumpkin\" as a \"wedge or \"slice\" of it slid out from its left side. this object was an off-white and approximately a foot in diameter. there was no light or sound from it. it hovered firmly in the one spot with its \"wedge\" jutting out. the wedge had what appeared to be a lens in/on it (which seemed to be dark). last i recall was it gliding silently to my right-its left in a straight line parallel to the hospital.\r\nthe lighting outside now was night time. i thought this extremely weird, as i had the sensation that from when i first saw the orb to its departure time, not more than a minute had taken place. yet, judging  by the darkness outside a minimum of 2 or 3 hours had passed. how can that be? i was wide awake this whole time.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501
