stranger thing's. on multiple occasions we both together witnessed over 30 ufos. all with different aspects. we do have one small set of three photo's however it's felt the information gained is much more important. before seeing the specific reported ufo however it was the only one to dematerialise. as if pressing an art programs fade out button until something has vanished into tiny pieces. before it vansihed the wind stopped it was calm. but the night had been very windy and dark. we were under street lights walking in a local naborhood.Down to a local church parking lot we always walked by.  my relative told me we would see a ufo tonight. an older woman in her 40s. i was skeptical however i walked with her regardless. she often told me story's of texas and how if is have followed her all her life.Some good and some terrible. this was also a spiritual woman. when the if i was in the area she knew and i felt as if some form of energy filled the area. i'm sensitive to even tv's and electronics however this was a more massive pressure and feeling of extreme energy that felt as if it moved in a pattern. like scans over and over. countless times with a heaviness. it was not present for me considering i feel energy. we walked to the church after my relative wanted to find the ufo. we looked out into the sky at the church. we ourselves are spiritual. believing in the creator,or self existent one. she got me attention and pointed out into the sky as i turned i said hey what is it. she said there it is and i was speechless. i looked up and immediately seen the ufo with her. however over the direction about middle to the local wal-mart and shopping area only later did we realize it was much larger and further away. to figure it must have been in the bay. also that the energy feeling was there over an hour in all.  we seen numerous other encounters. 8 flew over the suburbs on july 4th they all were red. balls that time. flying random paths. the other two major if is one went from the mobile location to grandbay in cloud cover this info had been silver grey. and one red.Another was yellow all on close paths different times and days. near dark or after dark.  once we watched over 5 yoga look like they were playing in a very very bad huge lighting storm there also had been tons of tornados and topical storms at that time.  i watched this with her about 7 or 8, times.  lastly we walked down to the water in the area back in mobile. it was a river or stream. i'm not sure. late one night it was dark we talked to a high chilled area on the road near a tree line that drops into a bottem that leads to the water.  i believe the church is livingword church and the road was the name of a pirate or something of that theme. it's right by it. anyway i worn a white hoody and a cigar shapped black and sliver craft hovered over the water as if it's searching for something with a light that came out of the front. it shined near us. i took my jacket off quickly. even though i figured it could track out phone devices and knew we were there. however my relative said to take it off so i did. next we did our best to hide on the edge of the tree line and brush. the if i left it was night. around 9 pm again.  it left moving forward and over a tree line. also one time we watched a large blue streak make a check like mark and shoot off for the bay into the sky i also seen an old looking plane.I mean classic. flying out in grandbay. and it disappeared into a weird looking cloud over the bay area.  no sound.No plane.  another account i was walking around grandbay and out to the bay near dark i watched over 4 red lights move in patterns. it looked as if maby a super giant massive ship could be there. that maby the lights were just it's lights on it.  they vanished about four or five minutes later.  one encounter i wasn't there for with my relative and those past two she wasn't there. she sent me photos and i still have them. i've named them the triangle urban ufo picture's. and may release them anonymous to the internet. as sighted in mobile al.  please investigate those area's. maby people i've known have seen ufos also. we also have noticed tons of black vans and black helicopters.  sometimes chasing these strange craft's.  goodluck

rushed forward towards us and after a few seconds, those lights that were moving parallel to each other, suddenly, and with the movement very like those of insects in flight, spun around each other up

was introduced as the new v.P. of the southeast division. i can only remember his first name as \"joe\". he was very tall - i'm guessing 6 feet or taller. my head came up to his shoulder, and i was 5ft 5in at the time, and very slender. there was no one else in the office at the time that he walked in and looked around. i noticed that he seemed very pale in color, had silver-grey hair, wore a white shirt with a grey necktie, and wore a light grey suit. i walked over to introduce myself. as i told him my name, i held out my hand to shake hands with him. at first touch his hand was ice cold and his fingers were long, and as he grasped my hand a \"vibrating\" electrical shock went from my right hand up to my elbow. we released hands and i glanced up at him. his eyes were dark and he had a slight smirk on his face. it immediately went through my mind that he knew that i knew he was not human. i just slowly walked away and he walked back out onto the dock where the freight was. he never spoke a word the whole time. i was shaken by this occurrence, but i never told anyone. this \"happening\" bothered me for many months. i never told anyone for many years, except that one day my husband and i were watching a television program and the host asked \"have you ever met an e.T.?\" \r\nwithout thinking i said \"yup, i shook hands with one.\" as soon as i said it, i got up and went into the kitchen. i couldn't believe i said that out loud. my husband said \"what? why didn't you say anything?\" and i replied \"because i knew no one would ever believe me.\" i never told my husband anymore about it, and never spoke of it again. until now. i have always believed in outer-space beings since i was a child. the only reason i'm telling mufon is that my health is starting to decline and i feel that i must tell someone. over the years i've thought of it and how unnerving it was. i'm sorry that i cannot remember the exact date or time, i think it happened in  the very late 1990s or very early 2000s. i can't remember the time of year because they have no weather seasons to speak of in florida. i just remembered that within the next 3 - 4 months, it was mentioned that he abruptly left the company with no specific reason.\r\n\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":76502,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.97234370416817,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05212016-0013","longitude":-82.43644338015248,"occurred":870393600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1463847354000,"summary":"I

curious about it. my dad told me its nothing to worry about. we continued to watch it and a beam shot out of it, this whole time no sound.. nothing.. even with the beam no sound. the beam shot out of the bottom, then split into two. it did that for a few minutes then back together and then it zipped the beam back into the bottom of the ship thing. i was kinda getting scared. my step mother was crying wanting to go home so my dad got back into the car as did i. as we proceeded home, we lost track of it behind tree's. i never seen it leave or anything further. but i will always remember how
