drive-in theater in salt lake city. we saw a silver (metallic) colored disk shaped craft hovering in the air a few blocks east of us, between us and the mountains.\r\n\r\nit made no sound and didn't have any lights, it just hovered (was still) in the air, then it headed north along the face of the mountains at an incredible speed, it was out of site in a second. it then reversed its course (it was out of site when it changed direction) and came back along the same path heading south along the face of the mountains until out of sight.\r\n\r\nthis was seen at dusk, the sun had just set, but it was still light and we saw it clearly. it looked like the classic flying saucer, metallic, disk shaped, thicker in height in the middle and tapering to the outside edges, with kind of a dome shape in the middle on both the top and bottom, the bottom dome shape smaller than the one on top.\r\n\r\nit kept the same altitude the whole time, while hovering and moving (did not go up or down), just hovered went north out of site, then came back from the north and went south until out of site.\r\n\r\nother people at the drive-in also saw it, everyone looked but no one said anything or really seemed to react to what they saw (once it was gone no one said anything just continued as if nothing had happened). shock perhaps?\r\n\r\nmy older sister was at our home on the west side of the valley sitting outside on the porch at that time and also saw it, our home was on a hill with an unobstructed view of the north and east sides of the valley. \r\n\r\ni remember my parents reading a short article in the newspaper a day or two later about people reporting seeing this disk. my family did not report it then.\r\n\r\ni can't remember the exact date, but it was summer 1967 a friday or saturday and the full moon about midway in its path across the sky. i looked up full moon time in the summer of 1967 and reported the july 21 date because that is the only date that the full moon would have been in that position in the sky that summer on a friday or saturday.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

an airplane at night. the craft was gigantic, at least 3 football fields long. i could hear the traffic on nearby 395 going by, but other than the hum there was no other sound. i suddenly realized

object when i was stopped at a stop sign in jackson avenue, salisbury mills ny.\r\n\r\n2.) i first noticed it is once i stopped at the sign stop, to to make a left, and saw this unnatural and highly strange hovering and moving a straight line about a train trestle that crosses a road and a large field. \r\n\r\n3.) having taken biology, and being an atheist, i tend to observe things in a critical way. it caught me so off guard. i could not take my eyes off of it, because i was so memorized by what i saw, that i didn't even think to bring out my cell phone. it definitely wasn't a plane or helicopter. unless the train station using from strange, pulsating orange o, but i don't know. my mind was racing, trying to figure out what it was\r\n\r\n4.) this object was a perfectly round sphere. as i was stopped in my car at the stop sign, i got a clear view of it. it was hovering above a train trestle and moved at a constant speed, until the train track led into schunemuck mountain. it was a bright orange color. it was pulsating as it was slowly moving i didn't hear anything. this was very large as well. \r\n\r\n5.) after the sighting, i called my boyfriend and i was absolutely freaking out, because of course i was by myself! once i got home, i told my family, but it seems like no one believed me. i don't talk about it a lot, because i'm sure people would think that i'm lying, and \r\n\r\ni don't wan't to sound crazy (which it was i am reporting it). i was terrified for the rest of that night, wracking my brain about what it was. i needed an answer, because it's so hard to see something like that and not be able to tell too many people. as i watched this object i wish:1.) someone was with me 2.) videotaped it 3.) waited for another car to drive by me so they could see it too. \r\n\r\n6.) the craft disappeared once after it followed the tracks on the tran trestle. these tracks lead into the side of a mountain. this is where it went. i tried speeding down the road to get another look, but i never say it again.

beaches, its a nice panoramic view at 900 to 1,000 feet high. we stop there because we wanted to see the moon raising, it was around 7pm, we saw some lights coming from the northeast one following each other in a line.  we where at the edge of a canyon and the lights where on the other side, the canyon is about 1 1/2 mile wide. we realized after aproximated 30 minutes that this lights were stationary and they were glowing very bright for periods, they where less than 1/2 a mile appart from each other, just one, the one must south when over the ocean an later came back and allined with the other. 3 of them gather and formed a triangle, 2 of them merge togheter... all of this for moments and then they separated again... that day falled a big rain all around the country and the sky was clear and dark... the moon was not out at the time. i know the area and its not a populated area, there was only a big cloud far behind this lights, so i knew it wasn't a star and stimated they where like 2 miles from us just a little higher that our altitude. we didn't care about the lights at first, but after 30 minutes we started to give them more attention, then was when i started filming and taking pictures. we saw this event for more than an hour, we had to continued our trip so we lefted and the lights stayed there.   i also have some instruction in aviation and this was no planes, drones, balloons or star.\r\nforgive my english... its my second lenguage. \r\n\r\ni used a panasonic model no. dmc-ts20 (1:3.9 / 45-18 asph)","distance":"Over One

walking towards the plants and all stars seemed to be naturally moving with me. but i stopped and looked at the bright light in the south, and saw that it was not one of the stars, but it was actually very gradually moving, it moved without a sound or trail. i've seen this happen around here at least four times. that's when i ran inside to get my sister to show her that i wasn't crazy, that's when she also observed the object. the light moved in an eastern direction, very slowly, and for about 3 minutes we watched it fly and than it just disappeared into the sky like coffee would when you throw it in water, we were completely speechless. we had no idea what it could have been, but since many people around here claim to have been the victim of close encounters with these lights and objects, we figured that it must be a ufo. we were afraid of what was going to happen next. i loaded the rifle and put it next to my bed, after we heard these strange noises coming from outside. a while later there was something on the roof, it might have been a cat, but at the time i was so terrified that the only thing i could think of was being abducted by big headed
