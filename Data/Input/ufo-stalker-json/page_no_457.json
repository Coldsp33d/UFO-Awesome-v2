(i noticed i sent an email to my brother about this on august 6, 2010). i was walking home from ocean park library (2601 main st, santa monica, ca 90405), heading south along 2nd street. the sun was on its way down so i am estimating it may have been about 7pm (as sunset would have been at 7:50pm), but it would have been earlier if it was august 6th, as the library closes earlier on fridays.\r\n\r\nstill on 2nd street, approximately 2 blocks before my home (3005 main st., santa monica, ca 90405) i happened to look up at a number of birds sitting along a wire stretching between telephone poles. (the birds often due this just prior to sunset.) i saw something quite unusual in the sky behind the birds which i immediately thought perhaps was a rocket from vandenberg air force base, as it is normal to see large contrails of aircraft from vandenberg.(i have never seen a rocket from vandenberg.) it was flying se, steady, smooth, at a good speed.\r\n\r\nbut almost at once i noticed that the front of this \"rocket\" did not taper, the object was instead cylindrical in shape. white or gray in color. no wings of any type. some type of vertical marking near the back that was darker in color. the planes from santa monica airport fly quite low when taking off heading west and this was not one of them. i've seen large jets flying se, i assume toward lax, but one can easily see the wings, etc. and of course larger jets can be routinely seen very high up leaving contrails, but they can always be recognized as jets.\r\n\r\ni watched this flying cylinder  for a number of more seconds and then it was gone. i don't know what it was. i've since, for the past 6 years, looked up at jets in the sky when i am out walking, and i can always see the wings on them, even when sometimes the wings are barely visible. i have not seen anything like this cylinder again. i have been assuming that with the pending setting of the sun that there must have been an unusual optical illusion that completely hid all wings, tail fins, engines, etc., and made this appear to be a flying cylinder... although it did appear rather clear and distinct to me at the time.\r\n\r\ni thought i'd file this report in case there were others that also saw something unusual flying over santa monica/los angeles on the date i mention.\r\n\r\nagain, it was probably a jet under very unusual optical conditions, or maybe something from vandenberg? but i thought i'd file this nonetheless.\r\n\r\n~

  i was sitting on the front porch of my home around 11:00pm on the evening of may 15,2016 having a cigarette, when a bright reddish colored object in the sky caught my attention. at first i thought it may have been the international space station, as i have seen it before. because it did not move i soon realized that was not what it was. it was considerably larger than any star.It hung motionless and silent. as i was watching it, what was clearly an airplane passed at a lower altitude heading south east of the object.The plane's light was flashing red in the expected fashion and soon was gone,but the object remained,not moving and began rotating it's colors(red to purple to green),fading out momentarily from time to time.\r\n   \r\n   i decided this was very unusual so i went

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing in the parking lot of a starbucks in great falls, mt with my wife at around 1:20 pm on may 17th 2016. while she was on the phone with her doctors office i was looking at the half-dozen or so contrails in the otherwise clear sky above me. i noticed one in particular that struck me as odd. while they all appeared to be at between 25-35,000 ft, this one was not breaking up and dissipating like the others. it was stretching out laterally in very definite but fine lines that were getting more pronounced rather then fading away. it was while watching this contrail transform that i noticed a black object appear right where it intersected with a \"normal\" contrail. at first it did nothing.. just sat there without moving for approximately 30 seconds. it began to do a slow turn to the east, then changed direction basically doing a u-turn until on a heading of approximately 300°. the maneuvers it had performed up to this point i could only describe as that of an airship. turning while maintaining a level attitude without banking as a conventional aircraft would.\r\nduring this time i was trying to get my wife's attention who was still on the phone, tapping her on the shoulder and pointing to what i was looking at. the object seemed to be just hanging there which seemed very unusual and i was beginning to realize that what i was watching was not a conventional aircraft.\r\nsuddenly it began to move again. it accelerated at an every increasing speed, taking only 2-3 seconds to pass over great falls and beyond the international airport before disappearing from sight behind the starbucks. it was when the object began moving that my wife caught sight of it and watched as it accelerated out of our sight. we both immediately ran to the other side of the building to follow it's path but it had disappeared. she immediately said, \"we just saw a ufo\". it's speed and noiseless acceleration was obviously unusual enough to her not to question whether or not we had seen something non-conventional but to definitively state so. i should mention that her father was in the usaf and she had grown up in okinawa as well as various us air bases. being in close proximity to malmstrom afb she is used to constant military air traffic of various sorts.\r\nit was the rate of noiseless acceleration which was the most impressive display of flight i have every witnessed. the distance we watched the object cover, from a point roughly above an area called \"gibson flats\" to a point well past great falls international airport is between 5-6 miles. to cover that in only a few seconds is mind boggling. even if it took 10x as long to cover that distance, it calculates to a speed that i cannot bring myself to accept, though i personally witnessed it.\r\nthe best analogy i can come up with is that of a paddle ball. the old kids toy consisting of a wooden paddle with a ball attached by an elasticized string. after hitting the ball and it files horizontally away from the paddle, there is a brief moment where it's flight it stalled and it hangs mid-air before reversing direction and accelerating back toward the paddle holder. it's the return flight of the ball from hanging to acceleration that best describes this objects flight as if tied to a string that was suddenly jerked.\r\nright before the object began to accelerate i reached for my cel phone in order to capture it on video only to find an empty belt holder as minutes before my wife had taken my phone and plugged it into our vehicle charger.\r\ni wanted to grab hers but she was still on the phone with her doctors office. had i known what we were about to witness i would have grabbed it from her.\r\ni continued to watch the sky and note the appearance in size of passenger airliners in the vicinity. we can only estimate that in comparison to the average aircraft at approximately the same altitude that the black triangular object we witnessed would be slightly smaller.","distance":"Over One

8:45pm, may 14, 2016. it was an extremely quiet night & the sky was still bright. we noticed a really bright stationary steady light (brighter than a planet) in the northeast sky. no other stars or planets were out. it just seemed out of place. it didn't move for about 10minutes (we were trying to figure if it was a planet or space station). also, it was not where a planet would be (calibrated starwalk app to moon & nothing bright should have been there). my husband was caught off guard & mentioned how it was changing colors. then, it disappeared. we looked for it about 2-3 minutes and all of a sudden reappeared in same position (small light that got brighter and brighter until it was as bright as before..And there were no clouds to distort the view), stationary about 1 minute then it started moving northward (to the left) about the speed of a second hand on a watch. it moved, by perception, about 4 inches across sky, then the light just quickly phased out like it had phased in. as soon as it disappeared again my husband saw a pulsating led-like light which flashed 3 times, then paused, and flashed 3 times again (about 3 flashes in 2 seconds) coming thru the trees from southeast toward the west. he mentioned there was a plane coming although there was no noise (we were still looking for the light in the sky). he thought it was a plane until it stopped on our side of the treeline. brilliantly white bright light. then i saw it. it followed right under the top tree line (about 50 ft up). when it got infront of our trees, behind our house, then the lights started  going south to north following our tree line (sometimes a little lower in the tree line and then sometimes a little higher but was never lower than about 50 feet) until it got to the top of our  most northward tallest tree & then disappeared. just 3 flashing-then-pause-then flashing little but amazingly bright led-like white lights. we thought maybe it was a drone but there was absolutely no noise and it was too close into the trees (within the tree limbs). as well, my husband first thought it was an insect because immediately after the flashes, we could see trees and sky but could see not see anything that was making the flashes. yet, we know of no insect that creates led-like syncopated flashing white light.  \r\nplease give some rational explanation.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1

now. i am a licensed private pilot, who loves aviation, so my eyes are always turned skyward. i was in my house just now, at 3:02 am, and i heard a helicopter flying over my house very loud. after it passed over my house about 5 times, my curiosity got the best of me and i went out to my back yard and using my night vision scope, i saw it was a bell jetranger iii helicopter flying in circles of a diameter of about 1 mile. each time it came around, it passed directly over my house at an altitude of approximately 700 to 900 feet. the sky was completely clear, moonlit, with no clouds or haze. i sat in my lawn chair and watched the bell fly over approximately 20 times. i blinked a flashlight at him during his final few passes and he responded on only one of those times by flashing his red and green navigation lights on and off 3 blinks. i thought that was pretty cool! i watched him pass over from east to west and continue his usual circle to my north. as i watched him come around to the east and begin to approach my house again, i noticed a glowing orange light, which appeared very high in the sky, about 3 or 4 times the size of mars, slightly northeast of directly above me. for an instant i thought \"man, that's a huge star!\" but then i realized it was glowing orange and moving at a high rate of speed. if you've ever seen a jetliner at 32,000 feet leaving a white contrail in the sky, this object was traveling about 5 times faster than that... very slow compared to a shooting star, but very fast compared to a jetliner at altitude, or any military jet for that matter. the object was silent and left no visible trail that i could distinguish. the object had no red and green navigation lights, no flashing white strobe lights, and no rotating red marker beacons, so i know it wasn't an airplane... at least not one from earth. if the object was huge, then it was way higher than a jetliner's 32,000 foot cruising altitude... maybe even in space. if the object was small, it may have been only a few hundred feet off the ground... well above the trees. i don't know it's exact altitude, because i don't know it's exact size. all i'm certain of is that it was a glowing orange light that was moving very fast! it moved in a direction of approximately 80 degrees, so east-northeasterly. i watched it until it was out of sight near the east-northeast horizon. it was in my unobstructed view for about 30 seconds, moving in a straight line. i don't think it had anything to do with the helicopter, and i don't think the helicopter pilot (pilots) would have seen it or even been aware of it. what i mean is... i don't think the helicopter was there looking for the ufo. i think i just happened to be outside looking up and enjoying a helicopter when a ufo happened to fly by very high in the sky. the helicopter made two more circles over my house before i saw it return to the st. paul downtown airport, which is about 1-1/2 miles north of my house. so i came inside and was marveling at what i had just seen and then i thought \"i wonder if that was the international space station?\" so i went online and saw that at 3:02 am, the iss was at 41.64 north by 15.22 west, which is about 10 miles off the west coast of spain. i'm calling this a ufo because it was an object, it was flying, and it was unidentifiable by me, a trained pilot, as being any sort of aircraft i have ever seen flying at night, and because it was moving incredibly fast! i don't think it was a satellite because i've seen many satellites moving through the night sky throughout the years, and they all appear brighter white... lit by the sun, and much slower as they move through space. this object was glowing orange and moving fast!

que ocorreu em palmas-to em 2005. por volta da 00h, 1h da madrugada do sabado, eu estava com meu vizinho sentados na porta de casa, quando passou sobre o céu da cidade um objeto luminoso em baixa altitude e se chocou na serra fazendo um clarão muito forte. pela manhã \"toda a cidade\" percebeu a presença de dois caças sobrevoando o espaço aéreo, e no jornal local de meio dia, nos foi informado que um meteorito caiu na cidade a noite e por isso a base militar de anápolis-go enviou 2 caças para investigar. (e esses caças chegaram a palmas em 20 minutos, de 800km de distancia, tamanha a urgência). eu tinha 16 anos na época e nao me importava com esses assuntos, até que o mais estranho aconteceu. na manha da segunda feira o despertador do meu celular me acordou as 6h da manha, quando eu fechei o aplicativo do despertador. apareceu imediatamente o aplicativo de gravação de voz que foi aberto anteriomente. havia uma gravação feita as 5:20h da manhã ( 40 minutos antes do despertador tocar). esse gravador de voz é como o whatszapp, de modo que so realiza a gravação enquanto se está pressionando o botão. pois bem, a única explicação normal, é que 3 seres invadiram meu condomínio, minha casa, entraram no meu quarto (trancado) sem qualquer sinal de arrombamento. sem acordar meus pais no quarto ao lado, e deixaram algo gravado no meu celular e desapareceram. pois bem, o conteúdo era o seguinte, nitidamente se percebe uma conversa entre 3 seres. 2 proximos ao celular, e um terceiro falando de dentro do banheiro ( mais ao fundo no audio). a gravação tem 3 minutos e 50segundos. e a comunicação dos seres se parece com rosnados e grunhidos e gargarejos. ( e além dos grunhidos fortes, eles fizeram uma bagunça no banheiro derrubando varias coisas no chão). eu e todos da casa permanecemos dormindo apesar dos fortes barulhos. mostrei a gravaçao para várias pessoas, tenho muitas testemunhas, porém devido a repercussão negativa eu me afastei do assunto. espero que leiam e continuem com o bom trabalho. obrigado","distance":"101-500

piedmont, missouri on a farm that has been in the family since the 1850's. i lived there with my mother, father, grandmother, and siblings. when i was a kid, whoever was the youngest had to sleep on the sleeping porch of the house. none of us wanted to sleep there because the \"little people\" would visit and we were all afraid of them. i remember that my mother and grandmother told stories about the little grey people who visited the farm at night and that the stories were in the family since before the civil war. one night in particular, when i was 10 years old, i was laying in bed on the porch and i saw a grey being with big eyes walk up to the window and look inside at me. i was frozen in fear. he just kept looking at me. the next thing i knew, there were three of them, all about 4' tall with no hair, big black eyes, small nose and mouth, and thin, standing next to my bed, and i remember thinking that i had no idea how they got inside. i was even more afraid and wanted to pull the covers up over my face but couldn't. i don't know what happened after that. the next morning i woke up and they were gone. they never appeared during the day, only at night. i never saw a craft of any type, but sometimes late at night we would hear a humming sound coming from the low depression area around the pond about 100 feet from the house, but never went to look to see what it was. i think we were afraid to. we also often saw small white balls of light in the yard and around the farm at dusk and after dusk but never knew what they were. the lights were about the size of a softball. the whole family was sure to be inside after dark and we just didn't play outside after dark - the older family members made sure we came inside and as i think back on this it must have been because of the little people who would \"take\" us. that is the term my mother and grandmother used - the would say that the little grey people would take us at night but always brought us back before morning. it was almost like talking about fairies or something magical that was our little secret. it was not something we spoke about to other people - we kept it to ourselves and still do to this day. i still see them sometimes, only inside the house where i sleep now. i see them come in late at night, usually around 3:00 a.M. but for some reason i just fall asleep and don't remember any interaction with them. i don't let anyone sleep on the porch, though. my children and grandchildren have also seen the grey people. we are not so afraid of them anymore, just look at them as being visitors rather than something that will harm us. i don't want any publicity or anyone to know who i am because they'll think i'm nuts, but i'm not. i may be old, but i am strong and take care of myself, and have all my faculties\" ","distance":"20 Feet or

children to the grand teton mountains in wyoming.  while looking through some photos and videos i found things i cannot explain.  i have attached the files in question and wanted an expert opinion.  i have named the videos with the time you can see the anomaly(s). in the second (as i have named the photos as  such) these objects whiz by so fast that even in the same secnd it is there and then gone.  i only noticed the first frame with the moose and then started to look at the videos in 1/4 second time, frame by frame and found these.  i have never seen anything move so fast it makes no sense. i have also attached a photo with something weird in the background.  i literally took a quick shot of both sides of the bridge we were on and didnt even look at it until recently. please let me know if i am going crazy or if there is something behind these photos/videos.  thank you for your time and help.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,
