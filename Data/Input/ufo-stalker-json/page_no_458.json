about 11:45ish we saw lights on the road up ahead and the picture just didn't make sense to us. at first it looked to me like maybe a fire truck up ahead or something but the closer we got the less sense the image we were seeing made. we continued in their direction, and came up on them fast, within seconds. \r\n\r\nthey were in fact closer to us than i thought, maybe a quarter mile from where we first noticed the lights. we had to slow down fast or we would have driven right underneath and past them. boyfriend came to a stop so these things were drifting across the road right in front of us. we were driving south on rt. 11 so they were drifting across the road in a south/west direction, and right over the road in front of us they turned around and drifted back the direction they had been coming from; north/east. because they turned around in front of us we got to see just about every angle of these things except the top, so it was not an optical illusion and we could tell how close they were to each other and to us. we saw them up close, clearly, and in 3d. \r\n\r\nit was dark, but there were street lights and our headlights and they had blinking lights, red and white only, the whole time we saw them. i had turned off the heat and radio as we came upon them, and i immediately stuck my head right out the window for the best angle, and two things struck me right away. first; the silence. they made no noise that i could detect above the noise of our vehicle, which is not loud. second; their proximity to each other. they were so close together i would think they would be bumping into each other. when they turned around i thought we were going to witness a crash, they were only a few feet from each other. and they never split up when they were in our sights, but they moved independently, not like they were attached. \r\n\r\nthe craft were about the size of limousines, lazily floating over the road not far above the telephone polls. they were both triangular, but they were not the same. one was a wider triangle, like you might picture a military drone or something, but the other one was a skinny pointy triangle. both had, i believe, red blinking lights in the front corner on the bottom, and white blinking lights on the side corners on the bottom.\r\n\r\n besides being triangular in shape and the lights, they were completely featureless, at least from the bottom and sides. just perfect triangles, no other angles or patterns at all. just black. like even any drones i look up that belong to any military or even anything out of popular science, nothing i've seen is a perfect triangle like that, they all have some other angles, discernable wings, engines, something. they were both like that, exactly the same except for the shape of the triangle. we were so close that if there was any other detail to notice in their shape, we would have seen it. we should have been able to see detail but it was just their outlines, the lights, and flat matte black. there were stars out and they blocked their light, blocked the lighter color of the horizon behind them. there was no light reflecting off them, and there should have been. there were all these lights like i said, and not one glimmer of a reflection off any part of them. and the lights that came off them were bright but not blinding; there was no glare, even so close. and my eyes have a problem with glare and bright lights. but not these. \r\n\r\nafter they turned around and we just gawked for what seemed like minutes but must have been seconds, a spotlight shown coming from the side of i think the skinny one, right off the tip of the wing or side corner of the triangle. it shown in our direction but i think it shown over us not right on us... and then they were drifting over the trees back in the direction they seemed to have come from. \r\n\r\ni told boyfriend to hurry up and chase them and not to lose them. i kept my eyes on them and could see the lights through the trees, directed boyfriend where to go, but i lost them through the trees. i could see them and then they were just nowhere. \r\n\r\nboyfriend took a route that should have cut them off if they had continued their speed and direction, and we drove around with my head out the moon roof searching and finding hilltops to search the horizons, but nothing, they were gone. then we drove around looking for a cop car but wouldn't you know it when you actually need one they are nowhere to be found. we finally gave up and went home and i think it was close to 1am.\r\n\r\ni was determined to alert authorities. i knew they wouldn't exactly believe us, or do anything about it, but i just wanted it on record, wanted someone to know that happened, and i'm just so curious, and i was hoping that we wouldn't be the only ones! i figured they would get more calls, more reports. i thought with them being right above the ground and apparently in no hurry, someone else around must have noticed something. its a rural area but right smack in between adams and adams center. \r\n\r\ni called the jefferson county police but the state troopers showed up first. the troopers said they would check around with fort drum and stuff and were nice but obviously didn't take it very seriously, which is the best i really expected... i'm just hoping something else turns up... i want some more news... \r\n\r\neven if it isn't extra terrestrial drones or something, it still had to be some sort of secret technology or something that not many people have witnessed, and that's still amazing to me. \r\n\r\ngoing about normal everyday life feels so weird now... like i'm the only one freaking out inside about this... i'm thankful for the experience but i hope someone else out there experiences it too. i'm so glad boyfriend was there to witness it too, but i just can't stop thinking about it and i think he just wants to forget it. i can't and don't want to. i want to know more.

view from my backyard. as i stood there looking at the night sky, i witnessed 3 red orbs coming towards me. they moved from west to north east. they were a solid red glow, no noise of any kind, silent. two of them went over the high school next door to me, and the third came within 20 meters of where i stood watching them. it was about 15 feet off the ground, and maneuvered between the powerlines, trees and apartment buildings. as it moved through the area, it actually maneuvered through the parking lot through the trees and then moved up in the air to continue over the hill on the other side of the road.  i am a sky watcher anyway..., we have a lot of planes come over my apartment complex because we are in a flight path for the st. louis airport just 15 minutes down the highway.  i know what an approaching airplane looks like. these orbs were not planes!  i wasn't sure what these orbs were when i first noticed them coming my way.  i realized i had seen orbs in the sky before, but assumed they were a plane off in the distance, even though they did not move and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nas i stood there watching these three orbs, i just remember thinking it was interesting because as close as the one was to me, there was absolutely no noise, no wind, and it seemed like it was \" on a mission\" for lack of a better reason behind its purpose. i didn't have an fear, only curiosity about them.  after watching them disappear, i assumed maybe it was the police of st charles, or the government using drones to monitor the area.  i did tell my neighbors about them, and my mother. but then just let it be assuming they were drones.\r\n\r\nbut then i had another experience with them on may 3rd 2016 around 1 am. i had awoke from a restless sleep, and decided to go out for a smoke. ( i don't smoke in my residence, therefore..., no matter the hour or weather..., i go outside to smoke) i was standing there and staring at the skies as i so often do.  again, i witnessed 3 red orbs coming towards me. 1 went over the high school, and the other two were lower to the ground (about 15 feet up), as they went by. the two closest to me were about 20 meters away again.  again they were silent, and again the two closet to me maneuvered through the powerlines and then the parking lot trees, and buildings, turning slightly to the left to avoid anything along their path.\r\n\r\nboth times i finally lost sight as they went over the hill across the street from my apartment complex.\r\n\r\nmaybe these were drones? i don't know. i just know i thought it was odd, and especially with no sound coming from them...., and the fact that they could maneuver through things along their path made me question what they could possibly be.  i would be very curious to know. any information you might have on other sighting such as these in my area, would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\ni have not found anyone else in my area who has witnessed what have have seen on this two occasions.\r\n\r\nthank you for giving me the opportunity and a place to share my experience with you. i was feeling rather alone with this! :)","distance":"20 Feet or
