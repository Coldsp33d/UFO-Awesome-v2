at a friends house off poo f kenwood rd in lenwood california. while out front i was taking pictures with my cell camera and faced her house looking northwest when i took the picture of her house. i never saw or noticed anything unusual, but it was like something in my head was telling me to take the picture. so i did... it wasn't until looking back through them on the second or third time that i noticed a strange looking star above her rooftop that i did not see when i took the picture. as i zoomed into it for a closer look i then realised that it wasn't a star at all (being a professional amiture astronomer for 18+ years i know this.) it was a strange multicolored cloud that did not natuaral. i croped the photo to enlarge it and ran it through some photoshop software to find out what the strange cloud might be, after going through the series of photos the only conclusion to what i had photographed was that it was a ufo that had just came through a wormhole. this isn't the first time that i have photographed this strange multicolored cloud, but the second time. the first i photographed it was up in big bear city california so i am thinking that it has been following me. i also believe that i have been abducted at least once, if not twice as i had discovered a few years ago a scoop mark between two of my upper left ribs, my eyes have changed colors (mostly red or red-orange) and at least five different people have noticed before taking pictures. i have also receieved what i believe to be an actual extraterrestrial message on a digital audio recorder that i have almost finished decoding. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in fact moving south at a very high rate of speed compared to a jet.\r\ni immediately grabbed my phone to note the time, it was 2:43am and thought to myself i need to get it on camera and tried but my samsung galaxy s3 couldn't pick it up so all i could do is watch and observe. \r\n\r\nit was small dimmer star like, just like the stars it was around and others in the sky. it traveled south several miles much faster than a jet, then slowed and about 45/60 seconds later a very large bright white flash either came from it or to the east side of it (between it and me), i thought i saw a trail of light coming up to the flash, only the last few hundred feet to the flash, but wasn't sure if it was just my eyes from the flash or not because it was so bright, it then turned west (away from me) and rapidly faded away on a slightly upward angle.\r\n\r\nlight possibly a missile fired at it? who knows, but it sure reminded me of a video i seen looking from space and seeing a ufo traveling around

working about 3pm that day until almost midnight when for unknown reasons i was drawn to the side door.( cell phone was recording from a previous video i made of the shop. the phone was set down on a cluttered work table along with my firearm.) i felt as if i was in a fog. i then woke up on my back on the drive way to my house absent my cell phone and firearm 3 hrs later with my keys separated into both hands and the neck of my jacket pulled down to my elbows limiting my movement.  seeing the stars and the outside garage light i knew where i was and unalarmed yet could not understand how i got there and why i was on my back side. i used my keys to get in the house and noticed light coming from my elderly mothers room and surprised she was awake but groggy with my pittbull in bed with her. i immediately asked her what time it was and she replied 3:20 am and she asked where my phone was (i didn't know) and then asked where my side arm was (again i didn't know)  \r\n at this point i think i freaked out a little and threw my keys from a loss of words and then began to tell her its here it got me its evil and it did something to me ive lost three hours and that my aunt who had just passed away was right. after regaining some composer we both went into the garage where she covered me with her side arm from the garage door so that i could retrieve mine. barn lights were off, door was unlocked, fire arm and cell phone recovered yet battery was depleted. once back inside we took pictures of my back my head and my arm because it hurt to the bone when touching the skin. i had multiple red dots almost the size of a penny on my upper scalp and strange markings on my back. mother had the shape of orions belt and another dot on the back of her right arm.\r\n the next day i charged my phone and noticed i had 2 hours and 29 minute blacked out video including human and non human language as well as sounds of me fighting with something verbally with responses. you can also clearly here my dog deeply barking from inside mothers room yet she does not remember any of it and cant believe she slept through the helicopters that had been circling as well as some ungodly loud deep pulsating hum descend and then ascend twice. we have a boot prints  high on the door of the shop and very strange huge boot prints in the gravel as well as very small feminine prints in front of the shop. \r\ni my self am a military trained combat vet as well as the rest of the males i descend from. i have three hours of missing time and a 2.5 hour recording of some of what happened to me.\r\n someone needs to contact me from your organization with the cell phone number provided i will submit the audio/video and the photos to help me get more answers as something was clearly done without my consent. if it had not been for the recording i would have not known other people and other nonhuman entities were performing a procedure on me. my identity needs to remain anonymous as this was a joint operation not just a close encounter. thank you. jc","distance":"21-100

it continued reflecting the sun on and off for 12 minutes until it disappeared. it's path was gradually to the north east but very slow moving. i think it may have been ascending. it seemed to be metallic, triangular in shape, and kept like rotating and reflecting the sun. was intrigued and ran and grabbed my binoculars for a better look, it was then i noticed like a sting dangling down with something attached to the end of it. my conclusion is that it was some type of balloon, weather balloon most likely, but was extremely high in altitude. eventually it just faded away. i had a witness and am retired airline pilot.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:12:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":76342,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-17.8857984,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZW-05132016-0010","longitude":31.052198,"occurred":1463159100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Harare","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1463141125000,"summary":"Looked up at 1/2 moon and saw to the left a bright light dimming like a reflection from the setting sun, ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Africa/Harare","timeZoneName":"Africa/Harare","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Harare, Harare","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:77910"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Port Edward","country":"South Africa","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Went on holiday. took pictures over splash rock with my phone. did not see or notice anything, but when i later looked at the pictures this is what came up. took the photos on burs mode so it takes like 9 pictures comtinously. the photo before and after this one had nothing on it so it happend in a split second.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":76341,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-31.0509031,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-05132016-0009","longitude":30.2224227,"occurred":1423151280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"KwaZulu-Natal","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1463134754000,"summary":"Got this on holiday at splash rock ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Africa/Johannesburg","timeZoneName":"Africa/Johannesburg","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/76341_submitter_file1__IMG201502051548141.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/76341_submitter_file2__IMG20150205154814.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"4295","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":462,"locationName":"Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:77911"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Itanagar","country":"IN","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had downloaded a song by deadmau5. i was fully engrossed in it, i felt elated jumping on my open rooftop. then something shining caught my eyes. i saw an object hovering in the air quite above the line of sight. i didn't know what to do as i was mesmerized. it changed its colour between red and orange. it was quite afar but i could make out the shape. and believe me, we do not have weather balloon here nor drone. i punched the camera icon on my smartphone which takes a little seconds to launch and that shining thing was gone.\r\ni remember that it was pitch dark, no moon, no stars. it was around 09:22-09-25 pm (ist) and i believe it is too late for evening star to show up. i quickly texted my friends on my whatsapp group. they made fun of me but luckily one fellow corroborated and next day my female friend told me that her brother saw something glowing up in the sky. he said he didn't want to believe what he saw. i didn't want to come out before cause i thought i would be laughed at. i believe in what i saw, whatever it was, it was really beautiful. luckily for me i took the screenshot of my whatsapp chat and the other guy responded.
