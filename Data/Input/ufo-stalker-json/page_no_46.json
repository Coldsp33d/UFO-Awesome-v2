had taken his mom on a trip to china because my daughter had to work. so my son- in- law, me and his mom we’re walking out to his car parked in the back because she was leaving for nyc the same day i was going home too. as he was putting the luggage in the car i happened to hear a jet approaching and looked up because you never know what kind of flyer you will see going over d.C. before i spotted the jet, which i could here clearly, i see the metal crap just hovering above us, pretty high up, not making a sound. i can’t tell what it is because it’s silent and it seemed to be changing or like morphing but it seemed solid. coming in from my right is the jet i heard clearly, even though it was alot higher up than the other craft. i didn’t say anything to my son-in-law or his mom because he would have made me feel like a kook and his mother wouldn’t have a clue. so i start taking as many pictures as i can before i have to get in the car. my son-in-law prid s himself on his knowledge of anything the flies so when i showed him the pictures i took and since he knows his backyard assumed it had to be a helicopter. but if it was where he thought it was, it would had been so loud he would have noticed at the time. in the last picture i took you can see the jet coming into frame and the top far right. you can judge the size when the jet appears. i was hoping you guys could be able to zoom in better than i could to tell what it is. i have had many experiences with ufo’s and it’s usually with people who are the biggest skeptics. i am very close, as the bird flies) to the

sat down, and looked up at the beautiful clear sky. kind of northeast, straight up i saw a golden ball enter line of sight near a star position, falling rapidly with a firry tail, falling toward the northwest at a high rate of speed. i thought it was falling space junk, or a falling star, possibly a meteor. that thought changed quickly when the thing stopped instantly off in the far distant sky just above tree level--toward the northwest. immediately it changed course and shot toward my place in a straight line heading a southeast direction. i am watching intently as it only took a second or two for the thing to arrive directly above me and hover there for fifteen seconds or so. it was huge! a disc shinning bright gold with no other lights on the bottom, and no sound. it had to be near 100 feet in diameter, probably 100 feet above me. i was amazed! then a finger of dread played with my insides as i recalled stories of abduction. i stood, put out the cigarette, and backed into the house keeping my eyes on the object. once i stepped through the doorway, it shot straight up at an unbelievable speed heading back to the point above from where it came. i never believed in ufos!

\"oh look, that must be venus and jupiter\", to which my friend replied, \"yeah i think i read something about them being pretty visible this week.\" they appeared to be brighter than the planets as i have seen them many times before. i said, \"i'm going to get out my binoculars and have a look.\" but i ultimately decided not to get binoculars out because they were still put away. then after observing these two stationary objects for roughly 45 seconds or so, as we were both looking directly at them, the objects shot off in a direction up and away from us, fading away ever so slightly. i immediately had an amazing feeling over my body. i started hyperventilating and eyes watering. i was in shock over what i just saw as i was sure i was looking at two planets. as i analyzed what just

attention. i thought the object was a military aircraft or a normal jet. the object was small, looked weird and had a blue grayish tint to it.It had 3 beams going across it to the front which was circular. its lights then twisted, turned and got brighter as if to focus on something. \r\nit then created a thick white light as the three lights merged at the front. it started to move northeast before abruptly changing direction and strangely seemed  like it was going in one direction before cutting away in another direction, then back to northeast. i was felt confused at first to what was going on. when i seen the ufo move i felt threatened, however i also had another strange feeling. i felt that whatever was in the craft had seen me, or something else and was also scared, trying to make a swift escape.This could explain the various quick movements it was seen making. after seeing the craft i felt weird, like it hadn't really happened. i also felt a connection with the craft and felt like it was not evil. i lost visual contact when it managed to do 5 or 6 quick movements, seemingly defying what direction it had intended to go in, before hovering and vanishing.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

was sitting beside the pool on a hot summer day at a house we were house-sitting. i heard a commercial airliner behind me ( i was facing sw) and observed the plane travel from east to south. i also observed several ibis birds circling very high that were gliding on the warm air currents.\r\n\r\nfurther past the ibis i noticed an orb/ball hovering still in the sky that then started to move from south to north - it occasionally slowed to a stop before starting to move again in a reasonaably straight line. it was traveling very slowly and nothing like the plane i saw a few minutes earlier.\r\n\r\ni asked my wife to keep watch while i went indoors and got my binoculars and digital camera. i took some photos on full optical and digital zoom that are not particularly clear due to the distance and reflection off the object. \r\n\r\nthrough the binoculars however i could see that the object was a solid ball but could not ascertain the size as i had nothing to compare it to. i would guess it was maybe 1 meter or so in diameter as it was definitely not as big as an aircraft but larger than the ibis (they have an average wingspan of 110  - 123cm).\r\n\r\neventually the object moved in a large arc to the west before going behind a cloud. the cloud dissipated and the object was gone - i had been watching the whole time and it did not re-appear from the cloud but just vanished.\r\n\r\ni initially thought it may have been a satellite as i had observed them before but when it changed direction and came to a stand still i ruled that out (though i am no expert on

charles headed from the western portion of st. louis county. as i was driving up the entrance ramp to the highway, we both noticed four very noticeable, but strangely 'dull' circular lights moving in the sky, in a perfectly straight formation. they stayed horizontal for a minute before then moving in every which direction. at one point, around the time my girlfriend began recording the lights, the light at the 'top' of the formation suddenly 'faded' out and then re-appeared at the 'bottom' of the formation within maybe two or three seconds. before i process what just happpened, the same light faded out again and, once more, appeared at the top of the formation.\r\n\r\nfrom there, the lights seemed to move around more freely than before. once i got off the highway, i kept driving instead of heading home. it was then that the lights moved into a triangluar formation for maybe 10-15 seconds before going back to the four-light formation. that was the last we saw of them for the night due to buildings blocking that portion of the night sky.\r\n\r\ni should note the distance between each of the lights could not have been more than a few hundred feet. while this happened, several passenger planes could be seen flying in the distance. the lights and the way they carried themselves were completely and totally different from the four lights we were looking at. there was no constant

approached, at which point, a third light came into view along with the outline of the craft. the sky was clear and cloudless, and the craft was clearly a black equilateral triangle with white lights at the corners and a red light in the center. i would estimate the length of a the a side of the craft to be 25-30 ft. the lights did not blink, nor did the craft make a sound. the craft slowed somewhat at the point where it was almost overhead. as i readied my phone to take a video, it started to accelerate east. i got in my car and gave chase, but the craft was too fast and quickly

thing happened at 10 a m i was in the backyard and i saw object flying in a very strange way it was not that there is time for me to see object like that so i decide to take my phone and record a video so i can analyse the video to understand what was that so many so what's came to my mind in the first place i thought it was an airplane but later recognise how it's very slow like its floating in the air and there is no similar way to be an airplane so maybe i said it was a cylinder shaped objects or a cigar shape taken from the angle i was seeing this object it might be a circular anyway that object was reflecting the lights so it must be made by metallic materials but again i cannot tell what it was i kept recording the video until it disappear when it disappeared i stopped recording and just few minutes later the same objects appeared again or we can say another 1 identical to the previous one so i start recording again it moves from the same route that the previous one was moving on it was a very strange if it was an airplane why is moving again in the same rut oh why there is another one following the same previous one i don't really understand and the speed it was the

my day started.  i started to do some mowing with my motorized walk behind mower.My husband uses our farm tractor to do the larger fields and across the river that runs through our property.  i noted a \"coywolf\" across the river where my husband was mowing and went down to catch his attention so he could observe this \"coywolf\" too.  he saw me and i yelled across the river to tell him what i had seen.  after that i headed up to the upper pasture to do my mowing.As i reached the top and headed for my mower, something \"caught my eye\" on the pasture below and to the right...Again this is where all the taller shubbery is ( we call it japanese bamboo ).  my mind is always \"in tune\" to try and figure out what animal is that? i saw that this figure was greyish white and fairly small.At first i thought i was seeing a canadian lynx.  this was not an animal...It saw me watching and it seemed to arch its back, turned its head to watch me and the ran in a \"hobbly bouncy\" gait... i don't know why i did not run to get my camera( that's not like me at all!) i went back to my mowing and sometime later,i heard ( only in my head!!)  \"she does all the mowing\". later in the night while in our office which is on the lower level of our house i heard in my head again, \"this is where she always sits\"!! this is true our computers are  here and i am very often on the computer.  i moved across the office to our 6 ft. slider to look outside and heard something move on the small stones we have as a natural walkway.We also have a security system and both my husband and a i were wondering, after the fact, why didn't we turn the system back and see if any images were captured that night. the next day, i went back down to the pasture where i had seen this being and noticed the shrubbery close to where he had been was bent down ( probably now about 1-2 feet tall.  the area itself was probably 10 feet by 12 feet. i should also note, that same day while mowing i looked up at the sky and among the clouds was a huge shape that had the appearance of a cloud but was smoother and looked like a huge craft of some kind.Lastly the night before all of this when riding home late at night i saw 2 very bright lights in the sky ahead of us that were flying together and the suddenly separated with one flying left and the other to the right. i have to say i wasn't afraid of all of this but very interested and
