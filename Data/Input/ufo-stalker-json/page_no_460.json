the housing development decided to cut down the woodland at the base of the hill at avondale drive, in avondale heights. i had made plans with a friend who lived about a half mile away from me to stay the night at his house. we decided we needed my n64 to properly veg out which was at my house down the hill then up the main drive. we set out on foot and the sun had been down for some time now. the neighborhood streets were empty aside from us. at the intersection of the two roads we saw what appeared to us as a light shining out from a rectangular object at the ground level at the bottom of the newly cleared clay land that was once woodland. i'd estimate that it was between 1.5 and 2 miles from us at this point. honestly we both initially disregarded it as a construction light left on or a street lamp that had fallen over from all the heavy equipment moving about the area in the daytime. we didn't stop to contemplate this for more than a moment. we began to walk towards my front yard which was on the same side of the street as us some 50yds away. once we reached the edge of my driveway we both just looked up at what i would describe as a dead silent, stationary, very bright light emitting from a rectangular object but did not cause any discomfort to my eyes. i felt like time had stopped in its tracks. it was easily larger than my home at its base and it was close enough to me that i could have thrown a stone and hit it yet i could not make out any detail aside from the white light. we both were completely terrified, more so than either of us had ever been before. we ran for my front door as if our lives depended on it but i don't recall ever opening it or entering my home. neither one of us remembers what happened over the course of the rest of the night. i awoke after sunrise in my bed, feeling comfortable and not abnormal in any way. my friend who was with me at the time also woke up in his own bed a half mile away with no recollection of how he got there. we told everyone we knew immediately and got mixed responses. i'm now 29 and i tell this story to everyone i meet at some point or another. until 2006 it was the only experience i could remember. i was not alone for my second abduction either although it was a different friend. which took place in orlando in 2006 at a busy public place. since then he is also a true believer.","distance":"20 Feet

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\nfirst, i am filing this report some 38 years after my experience because i have never seen or read any other reports that describe the two objects i witnessed. so, i thought the information might be of some value to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?  \r\n\r\nlaredo, tx in spring of 1978. it was late evening (11:30pm-ish) and i was outside talking to my girlfriend on the phone.  because it was late, i carried the phone out to the patio so as not to disturb anyone in the house. i laid down on a lawn chair and was looking up at the clear night sky. weather was warm 75*f, few clouds, no noticeable wind. if i had been sitting up, i would be facing due east.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n\r\nas i was looking up at the sky & talking on the phone, i caught a glimpse of what looked like a ball of light coming out of a nearby street light. it was about 4 inches in diameter, never faded or blinked, & floated west through the yard at about 2 mph, until i lost sight of it some 8-10 seconds later. looking back, i think this is likely a ball of plasma that possibly came out of the street light.  immediately after that, i noticed two rats crawling along a nearby overhead utility wire headed in the same  direction as the plasma ball. i then looked back up & the first object shaped like an isosceles triangle was silently gliding overhead at a speed of about 20mph, appx 300 feet directly above me (give or take 1-2 degrees east).\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\ni had no thought as to what the object was at that moment, i was mesmerized & at the same time trying to process and identify what i was seeing with something familiar and recognizable. though nothing about it was familiar or identifiable to me as would be a balloon, helicopter, plane, rc hobby craft of some sort, a blimp, etc.  \r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n\r\n- there were two objects, triangular object first followed by a rectangular object appx 3/4 mile behind the triangular object. my immediate impression on seeing the second object was the triangular object was \"towing\" it somehow.\r\n- both objects' surface had the color and sheen of pencil lead/graphite with a matte finish.\r\n- both objects had steady, solid green lines of light shining through or imbedded in the surface of the object. there were no spots or specific points of light and no moving, blinking, flashing or dancing lights. no lights of any other color except green. \r\n- both objects were at an altitude of about 300 feet above ground.\r\n- both objects traveled appx 20mph, due north as if they were tracing the path of nearby n bartlett ave.\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n\r\ni was quite literally dumbstricken, riveted, mouth open, eyes fixed on the triangular object, probably not blinking, until my view was blocked by some trees. i then turned my gaze back to looking straight up again & saw the second rectangular object directly overhead. same color on it's surface & lights but shaped as a rectangle. the two objects were each about as long as a railroad freight car, maybe a bit larger. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object.\r\n\r\nboth objects maintained their speed and heading until i lost site of them behind some trees.

were travelling from nj to de for a wedding reception for one of her family members next day. i cannot remember which road we were taking as she was driving but it was one of the main ones as i remember paying toll shortly after. i believe it had 9 in the number so it was on 495 or 295 but i remember it wasn't 95.\r\n\r\nso there she was driving and it was past 2:30 am and i reclined the passenger seat and i was trying to get some sleep. then she pokes me to wake me up saying: \"moose wake up there is a ufo next to the car!\" and she had a nervous laughter to her voice and she said that twice. now my first impression was that she just wanted to wake me up so i can keep her company so i pretended i was fast asleep till the second poke.\r\n\r\ni turn to her (as i was sleeping facing my door) and i ask her ok where is it? now she used to make fun of my belief in ufos so i couldn't have taken anything coming from her about that matter seriously.\r\n\r\nshe points to some lights outside her window that seemed a few miles away at least. they appeared to be a row of round white lights at least 6-7, reminded me of portholes  of a ship with lights shining from inside now that i think about it. any ways these lights were many feet above the ground but it's so hard to tell how far they were, we were going through a flat area with no street lights or houses, possibly fields. i automatically looked for scientific explanation for what we were looking at, i said may be it's a construction tool/crane of some sort or row of lights on a building. \r\n\r\nbut we continued to drive further and we did not leave the lights behind which can only mean they were not stationary and keeping pace with our speed! i asked her how long has it been since she first saw the lights and she said a few minutes! i asked her to stop the car and the lights may have just stopped if they were following us.  so now i see the lights stationary/hovering in the air with absolutely no sound and i had this feeling that something intelligent was looking at me while i was looking at it/them. few seconds after, the row of lights moved together (which confirmed to me that they were attached to the same object and not individual) from being horizontal to being suspended in the air at about 20 degrees! the craziest thing i have seen is as it started to tilt from flat to 20 degrees, it \"wobbled\" like it was in water not in air! reminds me if you have a bathtub of water and gently drop a plate how it will land at the bottom. it was bigger than  plane for sure but i could not confirm what it looked like, i thought i could see a black silhouette of the body which i thought it was flat but i am not 100% sure. it was dark with no lights around but these.\r\n\r\ni had the hairs on my body stand on end and it then hit me that that was not earthly! it immediately reminded me of the phoenix lights which i saw briefly in 1997 on the news with the volume down and never got the whole scoop on it. i cannot explain to you how it just hit me that i am witnessing something out of this world and how different it was between believing and witnessing! i had a 35mm camera behind my feet as we wanted to take pictures next day at the reception and i frantically was looking for it under the mess of the empty fast food wrappers and i was about ready to leave the car to take a snap (i thought i will make history and all) she grabs my left arm and said: \"they will take you with them!\" and until this day i cannot believe what i said in response.. \"i want to go with them!\".\r\nwhomever is reading this, at that particular moment i was ready to leave everything and everyone on earth to experience for myself that we are not alone, even if i couldn't come back ever! any ways i took note of the time on the dashboard which was 2:50 am.\r\n\r\ni get out of the car go around the back, got the camera ready and this thing tilts and wobbles again just like it did before so now it's at 45 degrees suspended in the air with no sound. and then.. nothing! it just disappeared! i thought i may have missed it take off but i am very positive that it just was no longer there! it was like when you turn off the lights in a room kind of effect! so here i am on the side of the highway with a camera loaded with film, mouth wide open and looking at nothing!\r\ni went back to the car and looked at the time and there was none missing, we drove further down hoping to find it again if it has just moved further down but there was nothing! we paid toll and kept on going but there was nothing. \r\n\r\nnext day we told her parents and they kinda chuckled but didn't call us crazy. it's funny that there is a ufo shaped house in de we used to often pass and i wonder what's the story behind that?\r\ni am willing to undergo any kind of test to the truth of my encounter and i was not under the influence of any mind altering substance. i am a doctor by background and i believe in evidence not stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

moving faster than any man made object that i've ever seen in the sky, and were way to bright to be airplanes. then i noticed that they were way closer to me and the ground then i thought. it has been thunder storming here, and the objects were not only below the clouds, but they were over an area known as the buffalo bottoms, where locals have reported strange craft before. the object zipped around a bit, then suddenly the last two lights disappeared and the first light moved closer. then at about what could of been a quarter to a half mile apart each direction the other two lights reappeared. they formed a straight line if you were to draw one between the three. then seconds later they were about 2 miles apart having moved faster than my eye could perceive. during the event my

into the middle of nowhere, or i could find a safe hole to crawl into until i collected myself. i did the latter.

colorado to tama,iowa for the holidays. it was dusk when i looked to the south(over des moines)and noticed a strange light. at first we thought it was one of those huge american flags, because it was not only illuminated, but seems to have movement within.Imagine a large flag moving in the wind from a half mile or more away. as we watched this light it diagonaled n/e moving slightly above the tallest trees. i'm guessing we watched it for about 15-20 minutes for it to reach interstate 80. and by then it was getting too dark to see exactly what it was. what we could see though was a red light on the north end, and a series of white lights flashing in sequence horizontally to the right of it. this is what we thought was a waving flag. the ufo stopped over the interstate, and all of the cars driving slowed down. many had on their dome lights so we could see each other. also there were small groups of cars huddled together for safety i guess. then the ufo lights began to move. the red light remained stationary as the flashing white light slowly moved counter-clockwise. then stopped when they were flashing straight up from the red light. then they moved clockwise back to their original position and continued past the horizontal position until they were flashing straight down from the red light. then back up the original horizontal position. cars on the interstate were mover very slowly now. it moved north across the interstate for maybe a minute and then in the blink of an eye it ascended traveling north. the des moines register had an article the next day, or maybe twos days later, and joked that all the people that had called reporting this ufo, were seeing santa clause.
