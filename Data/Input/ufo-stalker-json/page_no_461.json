completely silent.  i went through a checklist in my head, helicopter-no, balloon- no, kite-no.  they were moving too slow to be an airplane (besides looking nothing like an airplane).  i looked at the other children in the school yard to see if they were also looking at the objects and they weren't.  i watched as they passed over my head and drifted west over the roofs of the houses and i lost sight of them.  i didn't feel scared or anything just curious.  i remember thinking that i was just a kid and no one else was looking at them so there must be an explanation that i just didn't think of, but all these years later i still don't know what i saw.  the other factor that made me dismiss what i saw was that they came from the direction of the airport which is less than 20-30 km south of

what appears to be a star/planet near the horizon at around olive. i'm always looking at the sky so when i saw what i thought was a star or planet i payed attention to it. the further i traveled i could tell it wasn't a star but looked more like a light of a plane coming in for a landing. i was as fixated on this light as much as i could be since i was driving. i could tell it was pretty low and thought maybe it was a helicopter with a spot light on. by time i got close to my hwy 40 west exit, the brightness of the light was faded but still luminated. there were a single light on each corner and a bigger brighter light in the middle of the craft and as i drove nearly underneath it i saw a dimmer light towards the rear on the bottom that i can only describe as a cargo/service light and it appeared that i was actually looking into the craft. after it has passed me and was north of me i could tell it was very flat, no jet engine noise for being that close and it seemed to pick up speed but not overly fast. it was headed towards lambert and i think i remember it veering north west. i had submitted a ufo report on a website that morning but do not remember what site. i did have more details such as the color of the lights on the tips. guessing i think the front was red, the right tip green and the left tip blue.\r\nit was different enough that i didn't want to lose focus of it to get my camera on my phone ready, i doubt with it being so dark it would have captured it or pull over to listen for sound. i purely enjoyed looking and knowing i'm seeing something very

usually have any ufo sightings at all, so my story is hugely mind boggling and unusual. it was mother's day a few days ago on the evening of 8th may 2016 my family was returning home from the day out. i was sitting in the back seat while we were driving along the highway and just 5 mins away from home.  it was still bright out not yet sunset and i was just gazing out my backseat window to the western side up at the sky looking at the thin sliver of the moon as started showing up. \r\nout of nowhere what seemed a short distance away from the moon's location a bright white light just appeared in the sky with a greenish-bluish tint, the size of what seemed to be quarter of a what a typical full moon's size would be, it looked rectangular-ish in shape no sharp edges very soft and it just shot across the sky in a straight line from north to south very quickly,(covered a distance of about 50 feet or so not sure maybe more) it took about 5 seconds in all with no noise, nothing, it just got smaller and circular and totally disappeared!!! at first i started thinking hmmm...Ok omg a really huge shooting star but then i was like what the heck this is somethihng else because it did not fall it was wayyyy bigger and just keep a clean straight line and just zipped across the sky and disappeared just like that!!!! i was totally stoked!!!!I didnt believe it, i doubted myself, nahhhh that's not possible....Then i totally lost it!!!! it really was something unusual!!!!!  my folks got freaked out cause i was like\" omg omg omg oh my goodness you will not believe what i saw, i cant believe i saw something, you all would not believe what i saw\" i kept repeating myself over and over.....My family finally got me to explain myself, mom looked at the time it was 6:41 pm and she opened the sunroof to see if they could spot it also. but we saw nothing else as we pulled up to my house...I quickly ran outside to show everyone what i saw, where i saw it and the details....It was

lights about 20 degrees above the horizon. it caught my attention because these two lights were very bright. typically if it is a helicopter i can hear the blades from the distance that it was at, but i heard nothing. so i watched some more. there are two towers, with red lights to the west and slightly north of my location. this is where the 2 lights lights were hovering. i watched the object move from one tower to the second tower and back to the first tower, while hovering. still all i could see is two bright lights. so i was still thinking helicopter...But there was no sound. then the object moved toward me, to the south west. as i was standing there it became a visible triangle with what i'm assuming are 6  white lights. one in front, middle, and rear of craft. the sides of the craft had smaller lights along the side. this object turned south and headed in a straight line. it was at this point i could hear a sound similar to a jet plane. i did not observe any blinking lights on the craft. i don't know if it could have been an f-35? i don't know of any other jet that hovers, other than a harrier. but what i observed last night looked exactly like the craft reported in st louis recently. 2 large yellow/white lights that hovered the. continued in straight path to reveal its shape, a triangle craft with 6 lights and smaller lights on the side. was cool to see. i didn't go get my phone because i thought it was a helicopter. by the time i realized it was something different it was on its way out of sight. i watched as it disappeared behind the trees to my south

south. i was traveling with three other trucks who also saw this craft.\r\ni first saw a light sweep the sky on the right side of this video frame. one swept across the sky and a second one occurred a few seconds later. after the second light the first thing i thought was someone was shinning deer.\r\na couple more second passed and we saw bright white lights on what i thought was a plane moving from right to left out in the distance going across the highway. maybe 2miles out in front of us, very low to the ground.\r\nit crossed the interstate and climbed in attitude and started to circle heading east and than north, and than south returned to roughly the same place it crossed the interstate and crossed back going west, and than the object and lights disappeared. i kept watching out my passenger window to see if i could spot the lights, but i saw nothing. i turned back to watch the road ahead and talking on the cb with the other driver about the strange way that was flying. there was something odd about the way it maneuvered. i notice lights reflecting in my passenger window and thought it was from the oncoming traffic, and i glanced over to see what it was and saw this craft coming straight at me.\r\ni thought it was going to crash into me at that point. it had three very bright white lights. like large round spotlights across the font edge of the vehicle. when i say edge thats all i could make out as it didn’t look to have body or hight to it. as it approached it slowed and turned and banked almost in place at the same time, and came up over my truck. it made no sound, it had no wings, no marking lights, no fuselage, no tail, no plane, no drone, no helicopter.\r\nwe were traveling about 60 to 63 mph and as you see it was moving just a bit faster than we were going. it may have bee about 50 ft. above us.   \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

camping in the sandy hook area of manitoba in our rv. it was a cool night and he went back inside. i continued to look at the stars as it was a clear night. satellites are often seen whizzing by. i looked again towards the big dipper and noticed a reddish bright light streak slightly within the bowl area of this constellation. it vanished and reappeared then vanished and reappeared in a different location than it should have if it were on a straight path. the light appeared to zigzag in a 'w' patten then disappeared. no planes were visible and no noise could be heard. the light seemed to be a great distance away. i continued to observe the sky and did not see any further lights from this area or surrounding area. i went inside and looked at the clock to get the time knowing i would report this when able. this encounter was yet another oddity i have seen in the night sky. thank you.
