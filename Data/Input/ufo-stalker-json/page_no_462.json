to my car it was about 10:30pm.  i was carrying a lot of stuff at the time.  i always look up at the sky and since we had a new moon, i thought it was strange that the skies would be lit up so bright.  then i noticed that there was this empty space from the cloudy sky that was there, and i thought it was pretty cool.  i always look up at the skies and clouds, i love star gazing.  then from the blank, empty space, i saw a blueish hue in it's place and i thought it was amazing, but kinda weird at the same time.  it made me stop because i was trying to find out where this was coming from.  there was no way this light could be coming from any direction, plus it was a sunday night and nothing happening downtown.  then i noticed another color appearing from just directionally south and east to it, and these colorful circular orbs formed a perfect triangle in the sky.  and even though it was cloudy, i could still see it emitting light.  it was really freaking me out and first, and tried to find a logical explanation as to why i was seeing these lights. then, i noticed these lights were all changing color not pulsating or anything, but just naturally.  it made no noise, and i couldn't believe i was the only one seeing this.  it was in a major traffic area downtown, but above a huge somewhat empty parking lot.  i felt no harm or not even scared.  i've seen ufo before about 10 years ago.  i really didn't even think it was strange until i looked back at the footage, i thought it was something for sure.  also, i was really tired, and it didn't really click.  it definitely looked like a spacecraft and it was trying to make communication, or try to receive some knowledge or whatnot.  but i literally was the only one there to see it, since it was a sunday night. there was traffic to the right of me, and i'm sure they were wondering what i was taking pictures of, but whatever.  i didn't feel anything bad, just peace and a stillness , a little bit of a mystery in the air.  i was looking at it for a good 6-7 minutes.  it didn't do anything, but just stay hovering and stationary.  when i looked first, it started with just one circular colorful light, but then it showed up as three in a trianglular formation.  when i look back at the photos, i see about 2-3 more various light circles within the area of the triangle.  i then took off while it was still lit and went to my car, then i drove to the parking lot to see if i could see the lights again, but they were gone.  but who knows, maybe you had to see them from my angle to see them.  but then, it also took out that it could be emitting from a building or whatnot.  i'm just glad to behold such an amazing experience....!!!!","distance":"21-100

birthday we saw a giant flashing orb come up from the treeline and hover in spot for 2-3 mins and then it went slightly right and back down below the tree line. this was observed on april 29th around 9pm of this year 2016. it was remarkable as if they were celebrating with us. \r\n\r\nnext special event is in this report happened on the night of friday may 6th around 930pm. we were picking up our daughter from a high school play around 915pm. on the road back home going down river road (rt 112) adjacent to the saco river (where we see many of these light ships) i noticed yet again another brilliant brighter than venus light coming up across the river out of the treeline. as we got closer down the road and had an opening meadow we saw it was not 1 but two orbs next to each other. these orbs appeared to be connected to 1 object. above the treeline it stayed stationary long enough for us to get to the next street and turn around and come back up to the open meadow. right past the rays auto garage off of depot. we pulled aside to watch it still in the same position. our excitement grew when we noticed that it was now moving towards us and would possibly cross the street we were on. with our sunroof down and all our windows down we noticed no sound. it just beautifully glided along. as it was around 10 oclock our vehicle the orbs dimmed and we noticed the shape of the object to be very long and more triangular. as it got to around 11 o'clock there were many lights on this object. we all noticed how it seemed to have 6 lights at least  along the side of it and a red light in the middle of the object pulsating too. (in my minds eye i pictured a set of lights also on the other side)\r\nthis event lasted at least 7 mins. we watched it cross the street and slowly glide to the southwest till we could no longer see it past the treeline. \r\n\r\nhad to share this one because it was very unusual and had so many lights along it. all 3 of us in the car confirmed that we believed it was a very large triangular shaped ufo. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":76259,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.6140925,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05092016-0007","longitude":-70.54163919999999,"occurred":1462570200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1462797686000,"summary":"Driving down road noticed giant bright 2 orbs ascending from tree line and it remained in spot for 5 mins. we parked and it hovered no sound towards us.

buzzards as they flew past my home. after i snapped off a few images of one particular bird, they flew off. after they were out of sight i decided to take a quick peek at the panel on my camera (canon rebel t3i) to do a quick edit (ie... delete obvious blurry pics before post processing) ;)\r\nwhen i opened the viewer on my camera and after examining a couple images, i came across this one.  \r\nfacts are this, there was not a single cloud in the sky that morning or any air traffic that i could see or, find any record of. there was no wind that i remember and no debris flying around. the bird itself was not carrying anything as i tracked the same bird for a few minutes and never noticed anything other than the bird and a blue beautiful sky. no sound, nothing, just incredibly calm. the sun was at my back as i was photographing in a west to north west direction. all other frames have nothing in them but the bird i was photographing. i took a total of 8 images and all but this one are a bird and a blue sky. \r\ni am a very seasoned wildlife/landscape photographer and am very good about cleaning my lenses before each use. tbqh, after 16 years behind the lens, i am just really stunned at this object in the frame as i did not see anything other than the bird and a beautiful blue sky in the background. \r\ni have run this image through a series of filters; a standard light monochrome, blue and green filters. separately, each has revealed a great portion of the detail in that object. the object in a monochrome tone reveals a disc like object moving at what seems an incredible speed. i merely say this as my camera shutter was set at 1/250 and i was tracking the bird with my camera, meaning i was following the movement of the bird with my body and camera and there is still a slight streak coming off the side of the object in a direction that indicates it was still traveling faster than my shot. the bird however does not show much sign of streaking which again validates, for me, the two objects, the bird and ufo, are traveling at very different speeds,different dof and directions all together.The only digital manipulation was tone and conversion from raw/to jpeg.\r\nthere are many more things i would love to say about this experience but the highlight would be this. i use to be fairly skeptical around this issue but for the love of life i can't debunk this as a normal object. what makes me a tad nervous is the object was there and gone without a sound. no sonic boom, no wind gushing as it is headed in my direction; just nothing but this elusive image of something that is definitely out of the norm and was not there when i took the picture. even after showing this to as many credible people in fields that pertain to this image and the elements within, leave me and many, stumped.\r\nuntil somebody tells me otherwise and can make a very good case of it, i have no choice but to believe what i see. this image has left me a little frustrated and has definitely changed my life in a few areas. this experience has ultimately left me with one conclusion; the equal sign is still empty on the right side and oddly enough, i can't stop looking up when i go outside.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

years ago myself,my girlfriend and my best friend were sitting in a field near the river elbe and staring to the sky. i heard in tv that a meteorites-rain could be seen in eastern germany and told it to my friends. after it became dark until past midnight we counted 30 glowing meteorites, it was a wonderful clear night and we were enjoying the situation...But then my girlfriend stands up and said: hey guys there are three red lights and they are coming in direction to us...And at this moment my friend and i could also see it...A triangle-formed black thing with three lights that pulsating in the same sequence- and this,,thing'' became bigger and bigger on its way to us.And i remember that i saw this form also in a tv-documentation about the belgium ufo-events! it was very slowly, maybe a speed of 10km/h... or more! at the moment when the ufo was directly in front of us my friend was taking his pocket lamp and turns the light on...The ufo became slowly and its lights changed their colors-red-orange-yellow-green-blue-white...We were overwhelmed...Our feelin was that it saw us now for first time and it was also shocked because of us!Now the ufo was standing still above us! i began to speak: hey i'm peaceful and your friend...I'm ready to come with you...Pleeeeaaaase take me with you...I'm ready my friends! my girlfriend said: please be quiet i have fear...Please! my friend said: can you hear that... no more sounds of any insects or any wind! we could only hear our breath and our voices. now i also became a  bit feared...The lights were away and a dark triangle ufo is above us...We saw the form very clear! and then after a few minutes, two different lights in the middle of the ufo began pulsating in red and white...Like the lights of the airplanes at the horizon... and the ufo was flying away with the same speed like before in direction to a factory.We saw it over the factory at last,before we lost the sighting contact. i was disappointed that they did ignoring me- until today i think this was my last chance to fly into outer space... this event was real and i will never forget what happened at this night for my whole life! we are not alone...We are like insects under watch. i think the ufo  was non-human and it was also surprised about the situation like we were ...\r\n  ","distance":"21-100

the time was in the shower...By time he got out there he did witness two of the objects go by but he thinks they are drones. i called the police dept and reported what i saw. they did come to my house that night there were 4 officers. they looked at the video i had taken, but with the smirks i think they just thought i was crazy. the next morning an officer showed up at my home at 6:30am and wanted to see the video. that is when he advised me that i should make a report to your agency. i didn't know there was an agency for this. i am sorry i do not know how to attach video to this report. its not a great video because half way through i realized that it wasn't recording and started it back up. plus i said a swear word in it...I was pretty shaken up that evening. i know what i saw and i

50 years ago. the place of this incident was dow afb bangor, maine. i had two other incidents which may or may not  be related. on the night of the incident i was stationed as a k-9 sentry guarding b52, alert bombers loaded with nuclear weapons. the site where the bombers were parked was near the 33 end of the runway. it was about 2300 hours, the time for the second shift to start, as the truck pulled up for my relief, i began to muzzle my dog when he broke position and pulled me on the side of the truck facing the runway, an then i saw three pulsating sphere of light, as they came down the runway, they paused. at halfway down the runway. the whole base lit up brighter than daylight , but not a blinding light. i called c.S.C. (central security control)concerning the incident and they said the tower had already reported the sighting. then as i looked up from my radio, the objects. who were three in number and about 30 ft. in diameter each, shot down the runway, toward the 33 end and shot up at a 90 degree angle and turned  many colors , the were gone in a matter of seconds. the flight leader driving the truck and everyone else were terrified and we sped to c.S.C. and were met by osi officers. where they interrogated me for about 45 min. (not sure how long). the strange thing was they kept asking me if i knew who and what they are? they is more to this, that i have remembered over the years. i forgot to mention the 75th. adc squadron stationed a dow a.F.B., sent 2 f-101's after the objects. i was told 6th. air division in pease, new hampshire and 8th. air force hq. in mass. had picked them up on radar. they were seen the next few nights near the nuclear weapons depot, which was about 2 miles from the 33 end of the runway, only years later ,i had the feel for some reason time had stood still.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":76253,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.80702210000001,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05092016-0001","longitude":-68.77370379999999,"occurred":-252376200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1462752571000,"summary":"The three objects came from the 15 end of runway paused at about half way on runway than proceeded to the 33 end of runway and took off at a 90 degree angle.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-1,"maxtempi":30,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":-7,"meantempi":20,"meanvism":18,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":-12,"mintempi":10,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-1,"maxtempi":30,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":-7,"meantempi":20,"meanvism":18,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":-12,"mintempi":10,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":19851,"locationName":"Bangor, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:78083"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Devine","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my backyard in the afternoon clear blue skies and i was getting ready to start a fire in my bbq for a family cookout when i turned up towards the south and saw this bright object coming up over towards me which at first i took for an airliner but quickly became puzzled because the shape was like a cone but angular and had small appendages where the wings should be. it got whiter or brighter as it came over my position. i quickly took three photos of this object with my iphone but didn't think they would come out well enough to see this thing but afterward i saw that it did take some good pictures of it. i felt excited about seeing this but not surprised. it moved on northward until i lost it in the trees didn't take more than a couple of minutes at most for all this to happen.

wasn't doing anything, just sitting there thinking and smiling (mostly thinking about my job). then i looked at the sky and thought 'what a nice weather and how beautiful the sky is'.. looked at the clouds, the skies, thought about what clouds looked like (what objects they resembled) and then noticed bright blue lights.. didn't think much of it at first.. but it just stayed there so i thought what if those are ailiens (thought of it in a comical way because there's just sooooo much info being put out there about ailiens and all kinds of conspiracies, so i kind of smiled at the idea).. didn't bother guessing at what it really is. honestly, didn't care. kept looking at it, thought that maybe it's a trick of light and in about two minutes it started moving. startled me a bit (kinda got freaked out by the idea of it really being the ailiens). it moved in a straight line, i sort of panicked (not really, but my heart was beating fast.. not sure if from excitement or fear).. took out my phone, took a while to open the camera (didn't want to take my eyes off of the object), took a picture. observed the object for a few more minutes (thought of myself as being stupid for overreacting and actually taking a picture (with trembling hands, i might add)). then the weirdest thing happened (the reason for me being on this website, writing this whole story) - the object disintegrated into thin air.. on the spot! ..Lights just faded and that's it.. there was nothing there. if it wasn't for the picture i would've thought that i was just seeing things. i thought about what happened all the way home (which took me an hour).. sent the picture through whatsapp to my friends.. they thought it was incredible (a few thought it was just a trick of light, but i saw it moving!! against the wind! not with the clouds and faster than the clouds). basically, we all came to a conclusion that it was cool (especially if it were the ailiens..Enjoying some nice weather, too :d).. then, when i got home, family stuff got in the way and the next day was pretty busy, so i didn't think about what happens at all.. and now i looked at the picture again..Thought about what happened and decided that i would like to share this experience. googled 'ufo reports', found this website and here i am. \r\nwould be great to hear some suggestions as to what it was that i saw.. i was joking about the ailiens enjoying the weather, but seriously it's kind of freaky.. could it be some kind of military deal? not sure if anyone else saw this, but would've been great if someone did.

glowing orb moving sw towards my location. it was crossing the highway right behind my back yard and at first i thought it was a meteor. however as it got closer it started turning and by the time it passed directly over me it was heading west parallel to the highway. as far as i know meteors don't turn like that and there was no tail and no bright meteor type aura around it. when the object passed over me i could see it did not have running lights, wings, a tail, engines, propellers, rotors, skids, landing gear or any type of identifiable control surfaces as normally seen on aircraft. it also remained orb shaped and it not change in shape as it passed overhead. \r\n\r\nalso as it passed over it was completely silent there was no sound of any kind indicating a jet or turbine engine was it's source of propulsion. it seemed to be moving very fast and appeared to accelerate as it turned. also it did not bank as normal aircraft do it simply turned while staying level to the ground. the motion can only be described as gliding, as if it wasn't actually being propelled by anything other than it's own momentum. it was very smooth and 100% consistent through out it's maneuver, it's acceleration while turning did not look like anything i've ever seen a conventional aircraft do before. the highway was empty at that time so there was no traffic to drown out the sound of an engine. in fact we have aircraft including helos pass over all the time during the day and you can hear them over the sound of traffic easily.\r\n\r\nthe orb was a bright but solid red/orange in color, it did not fade or blink and looked to be dense and solid. it did pulsate but the actual color never changed or faded it remained very intense and consistent.I strongly felt i was watching a mechanical object and not a ball of light. i followed it until it disappeared from view after passing over the nys fairgrounds. when i went back inside the speakers for one of the laptops, despite being turned off and unplugged were emanating a lot static and some other sounds i could not identify. it wasn't until i went back inside that i realized the hair had been standing up on the back of my neck and i was a left feeling a little uneasy by what i just saw. \r\n\r\ni have seen a lot of airplanes, i lived for 4 years right off the runway of hancock airport in syracuse. i've seen passenger jets of all sizes, helo's, drones and fighter jets (f-16's, f-15's and f-18's) and all i can say is i was left with the certainty that this was not any type of normal aircraft. i don't know what it was but deep down inside i feel certain that it was a ufo.

about a minute or two i looked up into the sky to my right and saw what i just assumed was a meteorite or whatever they're called, i've seen them before not the big flashes across the sky but the little dim lights you can hardly see but if you look close enough you can see them sometimes, so i thought it was that cause it was moving just like them, except it was a little brighter than the ones i've seen before, i still assumed it was just that though, then it stopped moving and i kinda got the sense it might be something else, so i watched it for about a half our and it did different things, there were times it moves quick around in the sky, not far distances though, it was partly cloudy so i kept going back and forth between is this something or does it just look like it's moving because of the clouds, sometimes it moved slowly just for a bit, there were times when the clouds were gone and the sky was clear though and then whenever it moved i still kinda was doubting what i was seeing and in the back of my mind i was pretty much telling myself it just looks like its moving, then i went home about a 4 minute walk and could see it from my house too, i got my binoculars thinking maybe i could see it better if it was something, i went to the darkest part of my yard and found it in my binoculars and there was a very dim light beside it that was blinking, i couldn't see that blinking light without the binoculars though, i went back to the park with my binoculars and found it again and it pretty much just sat there in the sky without moving,i was trying to find a place to have my binoculars so they could be steady while i looked but i was keeping an eye on it when all of a sudden started moving across the sky, this time i knew it was moving there was just know doubt, as i was watching it i noticed a faint light ahead of it and it appeared to be moving, finally i looked in the binoculars and could see the original light with the blinking light right beside it and they were both behind and a little to the right of that last fainter light and they were moving together, i kept my eyes on them as long as i could but they disappeared into the clouds. i walked the neighborhood the direction they went but didn't see anything. on my way home i heard what sounded like a jet but i don't know if that's relevant. i tried to get video but i only had my
