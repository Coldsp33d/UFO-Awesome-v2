at 2052 local time (1952 gmt), my wife and i were standing in our back garden enjoying the cooler evening air.  it was twilight; the sun had set but it was still 15 minutes or so until complete darkness.\r\n\r\nwe were looking at our cherry tree in our back garden, and my wife commented on how much it had blossomed in the previous few days.  i remembered that my camera was sitting on the kitchen table nearby, so i decided to take a photograph of the tree.\r\n\r\nthe camera is a kodak fz151, 16 megapixel.  although this is not a new model, it is new to me.  i had bought it a couple of weeks previously at an electronics fair, and had not really had an opportunity to test it out.  so my main reason for taking a photo was to see how well this camera would cope in low light conditions.\r\n\r\nas soon as i took the photo of our blossoming cherry tree, i noticed on the camera's lcd screen that there was a very bright white dot to the left of the tree.  immediately i looked upwards to the corresponding position in the sky but there was nothing visible there... just as there had been nothing visible before i took the photo, either.\r\n\r\ni took another photograph about 5 – 10 seconds later, and then more images during the time left before it got completely dark.  i could not replicate this white light in any of them, so i assume that it could not been a reflection off something static.  the automatic flash went off in all the pictures i took, including the very first one which shows the light in the sky.\r\n\r\nthere were no aircraft visible or audible before or afterwards, and there was a layer of thin high cloud so no stars were visible through it.  there was no sign of any aeroplanes anywhere in the sky.\r\n\r\nthere was barely a breath of wind, so i would be amazed if a small reflective object had been blown in front of the camera then fallen straight to the ground.  to the best of my knowledge there were no unusual weather conditions at the time.  it was just a calm, warm, still evening.\r\n\r\ni did wonder if it was a reflection from a low earth orbiting satellite, or an iridium flare.  the spot of white light looked very small on the lcd screen of my camera.  however i was very surprised when i looked at the photograph on my laptop's screen.  the white dot was considerably bigger than i expected.\r\n\r\nupon zooming in, it appears that the light is shaped like a “v” on its side.  i note that one “leg” of the “v” is not as bright as the other.  i was holding the camera in my hand - it was not sitting on a tripod - so it's likely that i was not holding the camera perfectly still.  so i am wondering if it is a “flat” light and the darker “leg” of the “v” was caused by me moving the camera slightly.\r\n\r\nthe position of the light in the image is virtually due south from my location, which would put it above the english channel.  i cannot begin to estimate accurately the distance away or the elevation of the light (45 degrees or more probably), but clearly it was not hovering low over the neighbours' rooftops!\r\n\r\nmy wife and i did not see, hear, feel, smell, or perceive anything at all before, during, or after i took the photograph.  the only reason at all that we know that something interesting might have happened at that moment is because i took this photograph.\r\n\r\ni do believe that ufos *could* exist, but that doesn't mean that i assume automatically that things like this light must definitely be a ufo.  i genuinely have no idea what i am looking at, in this photo.\r\n\r\nany ideas?\r\n\r\nedmund

game, we were driving west on hwy 40, i was the first to see it. off in the distance (approx 4 or 5 miles away) in the west (sw from our current position) i could see an extremely bright row of lights (4 round very large set of lights side by side). like stadium lighting. i pointed it out to my husband and son. my husband said \"it's just lights on top of a building or crane\", \"no big deal\"... as we got closer to it we realized, there were no buildings or cranes around! all highway and some trees. the lights were straight forward like headlights. it seemed like it was in the same spot from when i first spotted it. we got onto the off ramp from hwy 40 and were going to head south on hwy 270. as soon as we got onto hwy 270 my husband pulled to the shoulder so i could try and get some better pictures of this \"floating light tower\". it seemed like it was less than a quarter of a mile to the right of us at that point. \r\nsince we were stopped and now looking up at this thing we realized it was moving really super slow instead of hanging out in mid air like we originally thought. we could now see it's triangular shape and the lights were not as i described above but rather, two in front toward the outer tip of the wings and two toward the top center. and what looked like rope lighting around the outer perimeter.The lights definitely seemed to dim down as it was passing over us.  my husband said there were a set of colored blinking lights on the under side, but i honestly didn't notice them. \r\nit was bigger than our truck (ext cab silverado) and made absolutely no sound?! the whole time!  that was the most amazing part... how something so big flying through the air could be so quiet? and there wasn't a moment during this amazing experience, where we felt scared or threatened in any way. it stayed a safe distance above us, about as low as a helicopter would fly when doing a traffic report.  \r\nas it was passing over us it picked up a tremendous amount of speed. almost like it noticed us watching it... (i know, let's not get crazy)\r\nthen it took off straight toward st. louis (east) then shot up ward at an angle toward the se. within seconds it was out of sight.\r\neven though it was about 11pm on a tuesday, there was a blues game and cardinal game that just let out... so the highways were far from empty.\r\nsurely we are not the only 3 people in stl to see this thing!! i sent a tweet to fox2now (local news) like i always do when i have something \"odd\" or weather related to share. and i still have not heard a response from them. which is weird. because the minute i tweeted to fox2 about a ball of fire that flew through my subdivision over my house on april 15, 2016 they were all interested in pics because they had numerous reports of the same sightings, which was later reported as a \"meteor\"... hmmm...  well, the pictures are not the greatest, but can clearly tell it's not a plane, nor a drone. \r\nbefore this site, i had posted to another site without pictures. someone replied with... \"sounds like a stealth aircraft\" he said he had a similar experience in 1995, and it was a stealth bomber. but he didn't report it.\r\n","distance":"101-500

minutes from work. in the sky in th\r\ne parking lot i looked up to see a floating object, that looked to be larger than any bird ive ever seen hovering around above my jobs parking lot. the pulse of changing light is what had caught my eye: i saw a grey oval shaped object, with a light affixed to the bottom of the craft. it was a spherical type, with oval round edges to the sides. the light seemed to be centralized and vertical to the bottom of the craft, and it seemed to pulse out the different colors in the same order. over and over. red and then green then blue and then a light blue. i mentioned this to several people standing next to me, and many of the girls stared. one woman stated it was a state trooper police chopper, but me and another woman disagreed and after her comment their was staring in silence from all of us. my grandpa showed up and seeing that i had seen a u.F.O. before and noone was around, i was quick to point out the object in the sky. he got out of the car in his pajamas, to stare at the thing. i told him what the woman said, and he replied their was no way it was a state troopers chopper. i asked him after a few minutes of him standing with the car door open outside the car to get in, so we could go home. i called my grandmother. it was 10:48 pm. i told her to go outside. we chatted on the phone and he said she could see it. i told her we would bge home in a minute, to meet us out in the yard. we drove across the street, into the soup cafe parking lot. we questioned each others opinions, and stated that it could be seen from my job,walmart,and our house. we pulled into the driveway and spoke to grandma. the motion of the craft was not a linear pattern, it moved in a lazed, awkward motion, as if it didn't follow any particular flight plan. i watched it arc from the upper left to a lazy downward right slant, and it seemed to stop and hover for awhile. the craft was a dark gray object that seemed to have an aura around it, almost a light ring of energy. it reminds me of the ring the moon sometimes has around it. but it was much more faint. the color of the lights were extremely vibrant and bright. the souns was faint, far off it sounded like the hum of a small fire cracker hiss, i was amazed. papa called 911, they told him it was a state trooper pilot also. i was flustered. no way, it wasnt possible it was a state trooper. i watched the object and it seemed as if it shifted position, and i saw a orange looking light/spotlight come into view. it was odd, as the the soft orange color was in the shape of an oval, and was up over and to the left of the craft. it wasn't shining down, wasn't scanning the ground. to me that had to prove it was no state trooper. i ws in awe of the object. after standing loutside for awhile, we all vetnured inside around 11:35.Pm. i took my dog for a walk ten minutes later, the objkect was becoming distant and had veered off in the direction of walmart.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

i looked and spotted what at first appeared to be a star but it was the wrong shape appearing much brighter but too small for the moon. i couldn't make it out so i got my husband and he agreed unlike a star. we then got his camera and took many shots and we could see it was shimmering and glowed in different colours. we also spotted several small craft moving all around it in all different directions. the most i saw were 4 at once. this was at about 60 degrees above the horizon and facing west.\r\nwe then notice a different coloured one more gold coloured it was about 70 degree above the horizon and was in a southerly direction. \r\nthe third was much like the first and more silver but it had red, blue, green colour changes. these were not the shape of any star i have ever seen from a distance with the naked eye they appeared slightly cross shaped but when zoomed in they appeared disk shaped so it was an optical illusion. \r\nthis is current they are still there, they are way too big for any satellite and as we saw craft coming and going they do appear huge. depending on distance possible anything from 1000ft diameter to about and 8th the size of our moon. \r\nthe small craft were quick and changed direction very quickly. they appear to be coming and going from the ufo facing west 60 degree. \r\nthis is ongoing we have not seen any aircraft monitoring or helicopters. they maybe still there.\r\n  \r\nyou can see different colours on some of the photos and a few have branches in the way. the red one had branches but to the naked eye it looks gold coloured. the gold photo was a single photo as i found it difficult to hold the camera still with nothing to rest on. one photo shows a what looks like a round centre with even shapes around the craft. two changed colour but the gold one remained the same. some photos show the small craft around the lat ufos. my husband and i both agreed these were ufos. our dogs were restless, we kept them inside. my husband is brave so did not worry. i was was not concerned as i feel no fear of aliens as i am an experiencer and i had a good feeling about these ufos. we watched them for quite sometimes and took photos over a couple of hours. walking outside together to try to take different shots and see if we could spot more huge ufos. we saw the three main ones and if you looked carefully you could see craft flying around and to and from the ufo facing west. this is a significant sighting by size and number.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I hail from the town of ridley park which is 10 miles to the south of philadelphia and about 2 miles from the philadelphia international airport.  back around the 4th of july holiday in 2012 i was having a small pool party with some friends and as the night progressed i had broken off from the main group of friends and was just catching up with 2 buddies of mine.  we will call them bill and jake.  bill is a mechanic at the airport and jake is in the army national guard.  it was roughly 1130pm est as we were talking on my back deck when a light caught my eye in the sky.  i motioned for both of them to glance up and the 3 of us stood there in complete confusion as we watched this amber light moving east to west across the sky.  the altitude would be hard to guess, but i would say it was between 10,000-20,000 feet basing it off typical air traffic living next to the airport.  the amber light moved from west to east and then hooked north directly towards the city of philadelphia as we lost sight of it over the trees.  we immediately muttered some choice words to the effect of what the heck was that as there was no sound and even with planes at typical cruising altitude around here we can still hear them.  as we continued to discuss what we just saw another light appeared from the same direction almost identical altitude (from the best we could tell) and it made the same turn towards the city.  the light itself was solid in color.  no flickering, no blinking or flashing, and no dimming. the amber light held strong in intensity the entire time and the second one did as well which is odd considering given its flight path we would have seen it from the front, the bottom, and then the back. now some back story.  i myself am a house painter by day and an amateur astronomer by night.  i have seen satellites, meteors, the whole nine yards and nothing could compare to what i had just witnessed.  also, this was the first year i was not doing my annual fireworks display up in the mountains so i have seen my share of pyrotechnics and aerial flares.  so to me it was not a plane (as i see them daily at all altitudes and flight patterns which this one did not follow), not anything astronomical by any means, not a helicopter (altitude appeared to be too high and the light did not fit any helicopter i have ever seen military or civilian), and not a chinese lantern as i have witnessed these set off as well.  bill immediately concluded that it was nothing he had ever seen before at the airport or anything that made sense in terms of a civilian or commercial aircraft and jake chimed in with it not being anything military that he had ever seen.  so we sat there stumped and staring at the sky hoping for one more pass by another object, but there was nothing.  i feel the need to mention as well considering i said i was having a party. my only vice is smoking cigarettes (i do not drink or use any other mind altering substances). \r\na few days later i was catching up with my cousin who had told me previously while in a golf outing in the mountains about a ufo sighting he had before.   so i figured i would share my story with him.  he was relieved he wasn’t the only person he knew to had seen something he could not explain.  i described the object in detail just as i have above and he compared his story to mine and the differences between what we saw.  we talked about the only wildcard which we both admittedly knew nothing about being a drone or some type of uav.  if i remember correctly this is around the time when the government started using them stateside a lot more frequently, but still if the idea is for them not to be seen then why have a light on it that is so bright.  fast track to about september 2012 i get a call from my cousin who was in touch with me over the weekend as he was up looking for some dark skies for a photography session in the mountains trying to shoot the milky way (photography is his hobby and he is quite good at it). he was on his way home coming down 76 east (pa turnpike) somewhere between elizabeth town, pa and morgantown, pa when a light caught his eye.  he reached for his nikon dslr and began filming while he was driving.  the light he was filming was moving with him and it fit the same description as i had mentioned above.  at one point while driving the light moved so abruptly it caused him to jerk the camera completely to the side window to keep it in the shot.  he then pulled over to the side of the highway deciding it was better and safer to film from the side of the road than continue to do so while driving.  once he pulled over his memory card was full sadly and he was not able to continue to film the object anymore.  which he regrets because the object was then joined by 3 more lights of the same description and they continued moving in the same direction in what he described as a staggered column until they were out of view.  obviously what is not filmed can be taken with a grain of salt by any investigator or person looking into a video, but to me he has no reason to lie.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

with heat signature around it, flew over the house at about 20 feet above me and hovered across the street on the river levee. it hovered next to a large tree and then tipped up on its side moved parallel to the tree and then moved in front of the tree and a watery ball enveloped it and the black saucer separated into 3 parts, like 3 discs stacked up in the watery ball settled on the levee as it landed and disappeared. i was speaking to my freind on the phone and was describing what i was seeing the whole time.\r\n\r\ni told her i was going down stairs to look out the front door, and i saw a white suv across the street, so i went back upstairs to master bathroom, hung up the phone and brushed my teeth getting ready for bed and the sink vanity started moving up and down and side to side and i had to hold on to the vanity. i thought i was going to fall down or pass out.\r\n\r\nafter that i went into the master bedroom and got my dog clara so we could go downstairs for her potty time and as i approached the top of the stairs, they started separating from the wall and a intense white light was seen coming up from under the stairs and coming through it as it unzipped about 6 feet down from the top of the stairs from the wall. the opening was about 18 to 24 inches wide and both me and clara went down the stairs anyway and the stair sealed back up.\r\n\r\nwe came back upstairs and got in bed and fell asleep. at about 2:20am, heard a sound of a diesel truck air brakes release, looked at my video door bell monitor for the downstairs front door and saw  bright white cloud, so i took several still photos of it. in the morning i turned the brightness contrast down and then seen these pictures of aliens, a panda bear, a insect, and other beings, one image lost was a cacassian long haired man that looked like fabian in a spandex suit and cape.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with
