blinds open. it was dusk and we were chatting. then my daughter said \"what's that?\" and pointed out the window. there was a black triangle hovering in the sky. we didn't take our eyes off it. very slowly it moved to the north. after approximately ten minutes and to the left of it a black orb appeared. there was another object just below and to the right of the orb that looked like a line and seemed to follow the orb.Very slowly the orb changed shape and became another black triangle. we could no longer see the 'line ' and by now the first triangle had moved out of sight as our view was obstructed by a building. the second triangle was stationary to begin with then very slowly moved north as the first one had. eventually we couldn't see it. when it was an orb it seemed to come closer and get bigger before it turned into a triangle. there were no lights. i couldn't hear any noise but my hearing is not as sharp as it used to be and my daughter is adamant there was a humming noise. from the position of the objects it looked as if they were over a nearby motorway. a plane went past at one point, much higher than the triangle and with lights, where what we saw had none. when the object was stationary it was moving very slightly from side to side.\r\nit all lasted approximately one hour. as we watched we spoke to each other about what it could be. it certainly wasn't a plane, helicopter or balloon. we're certain what we saw was nothing manmade or natural. we felt like we didn't want it to leave.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"     shape shifting ufo?  please advise.\r\n\r\n     i am submitting a two-part video that shows one in real time, and one at 12.5 percent speed.  there has been no alteration or faking or hoaxing to this video whatsoever.  this is an actual unedited video i captured late, on the night of april 25, 2016, east of westerville, ohio.  i do not have the exact time that this craft came overhead, which i already know is imperative to the mufon field investigators … sorry.\r\n\r\n     ever since my very close encounter with a large black triangle, last year, i find myself spending many a night scoping the sky for other potential ufos, hoping to secure undeniable evidence that we are not alone.  i am submitting this video for a couple reasons; one … the headlight on this craft is well beyond the typical brightness of other jets i’ve seen or have gotten videos of, in the past.  most jets in the night sky cast a dimmer yellow-white headlight, whereas, this craft, much like the black triangle, had a headlight beam that was virtually pure bright white. two … playback of video displays what appears to be a potential shape shifting event in progress at a distance.\r\n\r\n     ok … i’m not stupid, nor am i rocket scientist, but i am smart enough to know, that there is much out there that none of us know much about.  hence, when i capture some anomaly on video, i ask questions.  the obvious concept to this video, is that, once the craft finally made its way over my head, it absolutely looked and sounded very much like a conventional jet … but was it?  at the time, i was good with that conclusion, until i loaded the video to the computer.  all the questions arise, at the beginning of the video.  so, i spotted a very bright white light off to the west, approaching in my general direction … most likely a jet on approach to the airport.  but, once i saw the video, it appeared that the camera saw more than my naked eyes did.  this craft clearly appears to be transforming.  is it?  i don’t know.  i’ve gotten other videos of jets that do not have this morphing effect going on, but this one appears to be going through multiple transformations before finally presenting itself as an actual jet.  so … is this some atmospheric phenomenon causing this effect, or is this an actual ufo shape shifting right before my eyes?  i know mufon has received other shape shifting ufo reports, in the past.\r\n\r\n     for the record, there were no clouds present that night, nor was this craft behind treetops.  there were zero obstructions between my camera and the craft, altogether.  so, before a quick determination is made, that this is simply, just a jet, because at the end of the video, it does look and sound just like a jet, please explain the complex gaseous cloud this craft appears to be shrouded in at the beginning of the video.  watch very closely, even magnify, as superfluous orbs appear then disappear, and wisps of gaseous clouds form and change repeatedly, into something you’d see out in the universe taken from hubble. at a couple points of time in the video, the craft almost disappears into blackness.  unless, there is a valid scientific explanation for what the camera picked up, that i am unaware of, my money is on a shape shifting ufo.  i swear these aliens hide right in front of us, so as to go about their business, undetected.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings, Other,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am writing because i had what i consider to be a visitation when i was about three or four years old. it is something i have thought about often over the years and have many unanswered questions.  over the course of my adult life these questions have led me to do much research into the subject of ufos and ets. i continue to read about the subject extensively and have watched many shows regarding this phenomena. \r\n\r\nlike most who have had an encounter i have struggled with whether to speak to others about it. i have only shared my story with a handful of close friends and family members (all who just think i'm weird). i have not had hypnotic regression or sought professional means to more clearly recall what transpired that night.  this is my first attempt at reaching out to a larger community of folks who are not only inclined to believe my story, but who can possibly provide information or advice. please understand that though i have little doubt that my experience was in fact real, i still worry about my professional reputation. and so i have remained silent. \r\n\r\nmy story begins when i was 3 or 4 years old. i am currently 36, so i estimate the time frame to be sometime during 1983 or 1984. i have also asked my mother detailed questions about the apartment we were living in at the time. this helped me to confirm the time frame of 1983-1984.  i have always had a very vivid long term memory and can still remember conversations from when i was 3 very clearly, details of where we lived, and people that came around. on the night in question i recall waking up in the middle of the night and looking up at the ceiling. i shared a room with my older brother and we slept in bunk beds, i had the bottom bunk. as i lay there i realized that everyone else must be asleep. looking to the right side of the bed, at the ceiling i received a mental image of the ceiling dissolving and giving way to a starry night sky. i then saw the image of what looked like a pizza (remember i was only 3-4 so i didn't have many reference points to compare the image to other than food items) floating down over the hole where the ceiling had been. the \"pizza\" (disk shaped object) stopped descending and hovered blocking out the starry sky image. i was then suddenly no longer alone in the room. there were three small \"people\" standing around the edges of my bed. the left side of the bed was positioned flush against the wall, leaving only the foot of the bed and the right side accessible to the visitors. all three stood at the right side of the bed, side by side staring at me. i wasn't afraid and was excited that someone was there since everyone in my family was asleep. i looked them over curiously while sitting straight up in my bed. not knowing what to make of them, i asked them out loud who they were and why they were in my room. without answering verbally, one of them telepathically said to me \"we are the gogos.\"  i can't remember what else was said but as i recall they did say a few other things. they were short like grays are often described but they were all wearing uniforms of some sort. where a shirt pocket might appear on a dress shirt, they each had three or four colored \"buttons.\"  i say buttons because as a child i had no better description. the buttons looked like they could be pressed. out of curiosity i reached out and poked one of the \"gogos\" colorful buttons much to his/her dislike. without warning and without being able to understand why, i could feel that they were very upset with this unsolicited physical contact on my part. the being reacted swiftly by swinging it's arm towards my face. it's arm never made contact with my face but i recall being knocked over into my pillows as if i'd been struck. i was totally surprised by this and could tell they were quite offended. they then turned away from me and vanished. as when they arrived, i had a vision of the ceiling dissolving once more. this time their craft appeared to resemble a plum shape as they left.  as the craft ascended, the ceiling slowly reappeared and i immediately fell asleep.  \r\n\r\nthe following morning i kept asking my older brother if he had seen the \"gogos\" who came to our room last night!  he clearly had no idea what i was talking about. unfortunately my brother recently passed away so i cannot ask him if recalls my strange tale. \r\n\r\nmy experience is still very vivid even after all of these years and so is my memory. \r\n\r\ni recently read up on the hudson valley flap which occurred in ny and ct. it happened during that same time period around 1983. this of course has prompted me to think the two are possibly related. \r\n\r\nany info you can share in regards to the hudson flap and similar visitations in this area during that time would be helpful. i would appreciate your opinions and welcome some feedback. especially since i cannot find any references online to an et group that calls themselves the gogos. all that comes up are the 1980s band (how fitting) with that name and a legend from ethiopia. the ethiopians legend refers to a group of criptids known as the ebu-gogo, who steal children at night. the descriptions of the ebu-gogo do not match the beings i met so i've already largely dismissed that possibility.  i am anxious to find out if others were contacted by a group with this name. i am interested in knowing why they came to me that night and why they have never returned. i also would like to find out if maybe they have returned over the years but have used screen memories or blank slating to keep me unaware. \r\n\r\nthe final detail i wish to include is the exact address where i was living and where this occurred. i lived at 33 deming rd, glastonbury ct, 06033. as mentioned above, i cannot provide exact dates or times since this event occurred when i was 3-4 years old.  the date given on your reporting form is only a guess.  based on where i lived i can place this event between 1983-1984. i do not recall the time of year. i also don't know what time of the late evening or early morning hours this event took place. i do recall everyone else was sleeping. \r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\narthur j

our entire crew was maybe 6 to 8 men, engaged in sculpting gravel pits, sources of material from which the dam was constructed. my responsibilities were to ensure all was in accordance with plans and specs. at the end of the shift (4:30 am), i dropped off a report detailing activities, progress etc., at our project office trailer. later, i found that the compound which held our offices and lab had been nike missile site tare which was decomissioned a few years prior. most of the time i worked alone, traveling by pickup truck. i normally drove the few miles from worksite to the office around 1:30 a.M., where i wrote the bulk of my report, then went back to the worksite to observe remaining operations. around 4:15 a.M., i entered final notes and details on my report, then left it at the office, which was on the way out. one night, about 1:45 a.M., while driving to the office to begin my report, all of a sudden everything lit up brighter than daylight. traveling approx 40mph, i began slowing while rolling my window down. i expected to hear an aircraft because the only thing i could think of was that a military aircraft had me spotlighted with a high powered lamp. eilson afb was just a few miles from there. as i opened the window i was surprised to hear no engines. the last thing i recall is thinking that they'd have to be at a high altitude for sound to not reach me. the next i remember is pulling up to the compound gate, opened it, and went into the office where i sat at my desk to begin my report. looking at a clock, i saw it was near 4:00 a.M. at the time, and i'll never understand this, losing 2 hours did not bother me at all. i just thought, i better hurry to write my report and head home, which i then did. i never told anyone about that night until 2004. when i did, every word was a struggle to produce and i ended up on the floor, sobbing. until that day i never thought it was a problem. i've considered doing regressive hypnotherapy but (tentatively) decided against this, after discussions with my son, who is a brain scientist. it is his feeling that this can be unreliable.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":76174,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":64.7568411,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05032016-0019","longitude":-147.3472844,"occurred":303961500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alaska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1462309926000,"summary":"Sudden

planet it was a normal night clear skys and lots of stars and planets visible a perfect night to view the night sky with a telescope i bent over to adjust my telescope using my finder scope at the time i had both eyes open as i put my eye to the scope i caught a glimpse of a roundish dark object moving quite fast across the sky (faster than any plane or helicopter could go) from the left hand side of my position so i immediately started observing the object (not through my telescope) as the object passed underneath the planet i was viewing the object then glowed a really bright white light for roughly about 3 or 4 seconds as the object progressed on its trajectory it then turned back black but as it did it was strange because it seamed to fade from light to dark from front to back (note there where no flood lights or any light at all shining in the sky and also i could not see the moon in the sky) as the object turned black i could see it leaving a very faint trail behind it it looked as if it flew through a thin layer of cloud and left a line through the middle of it (as i said before there are no clouds in the sky at all) as the object got further and further away i began to loose sight of it due to the distance it was traveling and also due to the very dark color of it i instantly ran in to the house to get a note pad and to make a note of the time i then run back out side and write down what i have seen while at the same time checking to the if the object would return (it did not) but as i still look up at the sky i can see the trail the object left it stretched for miles from the left of my position to the right i then told my partner what had happened and she came out with me to have a look and my partner also saw the trail that the object had left i felt a little bit shocked at first because i knew it was a ufo i am quite familiar with aircraft as i am a bit of an enthusiast the object did not have any wings it had no lights (aircraft tend to have a green light a red light one on (each wing tip) and 2 flashing strobe lights one on the belly of the aircraft and one on the top) and the object was quite round i did not see any windows or any markings of any kind so i knew it was not a plane or a helicopter through out the full of the experience the object did not make a single sound it was that quiet that you could hear a pin drop where as a helicopter or a plane makes a very distinctive sound  i know that the object i saw was nothing of this earth \r\n\r\nafter having this experience i had a sort of flash back to when i was roughly about 10 or 11 when i had my first ufo experience when i witnessed an orange egged shaped craft moving silently across the sky but growing up when i told people of what i saw that night just laughed or said i was making it up so i always kept it to myself \r\n\r\n\r\ni am not the sort the sort of person to make something up especialy regarding this matter as i strongly believe after my experiences that there is life beyond earth so naturally i have a keen interest in listening to other peoples experiences over the internet and it infuriates me when people create hoaxes because it makes credible people like myself unbelievable     \r\n\r\n\r\nnote that over the past month the has been a number of aircraft scrambled form raf coningsby and was autherised to brake the sound barrier over land i researched it myself a little and the official report says the on each occasion an aircraft lost communication with air traffic control and each aircraft had to be saftly escorted by the raf jets to an airport to land i do not know if this is related in any way but is seams a bit strange

directly over my house heading in an easterly direction. the sky was cloudless and deep blue and the white vapor trails the boeing made caught my attention and i grabbed the old 60d and snapped a couple of photographs of it. \r\n\r\nwhen i downloaded all the photographs on the memory card two months later and sorted them, i came across the photos i took of the boeing. i then noticed a strange sphere in one of the photographs appearing to be right next to the boeing which i did not see at the time i took the photos looking through the camera viewfinder. at first i thought it was some defect in the lens or a lens flare but when i examined the other three photos i found another photograph with the same sphere but this time at the opposite side of the boeing and very faint. the other two photographs had no sphere in them. i then realized that this could be a ufo photographed by me unknowingly. i was excited about this and showed the photographs to a friend of mine working at a photo lab. he told me that it had nothing to do with lens flare and that i had actually photographed \"something\" and encouraged me to look into it. \r\n\r\ni regret not being able to give more information on the incident as i did not even know about this till more than two months after the event. the only other info i can offer is the exact coordinates (25°28'54.88\"s & 30°57'30.03\"e) as well as the exact time (first photo it appeared on in the series of four taken on saturday, 7 november 2015, 11:06:48am and the second photo it appeared on taken at 11:06:52am, four seconds later). i have looked but could not find anything on the other two photos. i will however include all four photos in this post in the hope that someone with more specialized computer software might pick up something. \r\n\r\nin my opinion, someone on that flight had to have seen this thing as well as it appears to be flying at the same height as the boeing. hopefully it would be possible to get information on that flight and track down the pilots based on the time, direction and coordinates of the boeing.\r\n\r\nps. the first four photographs attached (img_0171, img_0172, img_0173 & img_0174) are uncompressed
