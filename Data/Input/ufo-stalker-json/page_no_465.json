stepped away as i stayed at the window looking up,the object was moving at a high rate of speed for something so oddly shaped traveling in a straight line, we both now we're looking at the object asking each other \"where are the wings!?\" \"what the heck is that!?\" \"there's no wings dude!\" \"dude\"!? as it travelled west it went into the marine layer and it faded away as it went further west,from the time i spotted it with my eyes to the time i called my brother over to look, it was a good 9 seconds of visual contact with this object.","distance":"Over One

creature. they were staggering & falling into the road.. at first i thought this was a very intoxicated human, but when i took a second glance, i discovered otherwise.. i realized that not only was there one of these creatures, but there were 3 of them. they were orange creatures who had huge circle heads.. they were staggering, like i said, so i assume that they may be a crossover between a creature that runs/walks, and crawls.. while driving and seeing them stagger, my initial thought was that they were coming towards my car, so i swerved into the passing lane.  after seeing this, i drove as fast as i could to one of my friends and picked them up... when we got back, the creatures were gone. this sighting really messed with my mind... since then, i've had thoughts of this creature, and i can't help but wonder what these things are. i have not told anyone besides the friend i picked up that night, due to the fact that i know some people would not believe.. it was the

semoran boulevard (between curry ford rd and lake underhill dr). the object had rounded edges and bright white lights at each corner, just before i lost it out of sight there was a fourth white light coming on from the center of the object. it was very low and very close, i would say 50 feet above the ground and no more than 1/4mile from where i was. the trees and 2 story buildings across the

what it appeared to be a \"fireball\" crossing the sky coming from the west, it was straight ahead from me and was about a few miles up from my neighbor's home and our divider tree line and heading east according to my iphone compass. started taking pics with my cell phone, zooming in and out on the ufo as it went by, the sun went over the horizon around 8:40pm when i saw it. it was a crystal clear day and afternoon and sun was reaching the horizon and airplanes were all over the place as usual. within 10 minutes and already dark it crossed the sky again in same fashion, from same origin point and direction/trajectory but i did not see it making a \"u-turn\" the first time so i am guessing there were 2 of these flying in same path. i stayed out super intrigued after the first ufo appeared and had noted the area when it became visible to the eye just above one of the yard's pine trees. i continued looking at the night sky, planes flying by with their beacons, a few stars showing up and then it showed up in the distance, same origin point and within 15 minutes from the first sight. i saw a lit dot except that this time it appeared as if it left something behind or departed from it, something stationary so i continued taking pictures with my cell phone as it went by in the night, same heading as previous ufo. started as a light at a distance flying fast with no sound whatsoever then it somehow transformed itself into a moving fireball/cloud with random whites and reds then it disappeared, it went dark and stealth. i must have taken like 100 pictures, some show things that i cant explain, others are just pics of a clear night sky. whatever this was, it was fast, silent and had the capability to somehow camouflage itself in a cloud form. i did not have a computer which is why i couldn't report it at the time. i used my iphone \"skills\" zooming in and out and using editing options to clear the images. i freaked out a bit when i zoomed-in some of the pics and added a bit of brightness, contrast, and even used the red eye as i was running out of options in the phone, i tried it all several times and it finally revealed itself, whatever it was. you all take a look at the pictures and you tell me what you see. i have witnessed a few ufo's in my past including a not so long ago sight also reported here but i have never seeing a ufo as if it came out of a box, a window-box-like just hanging up there in the sky, this \"box\" resembles the microsoft window in lock-screen in most computers. i could've swear this second ufo came out of the \"window box\" which i didn't notice at first but then pictures revealed it. could this be a portal window/door to enter the earth atmosphere unnoticed? i can only upload 10 pics so. *in the picture where the ufo is surrounded by what it looks like a red transparent set of flower petals (red cloud form) looking like a fireball from a distance, the ufo can be seen to have a double arrow-end body shape with some x's configuration in the middle, i was able to see through the red cloud by using the red eye feature in my iphone. - it resembles the same ufo shape that a tourist recorded from the empire state in nyc in april 2 of 2016, posted in the ufosightingsdaily site.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

what it appeared to be a \"fireball\" crossing the sky coming from the west, it was straight ahead from me and was about a few miles up from my neighbor's home and our divider tree line and heading east according to my iphone compass. started taking pics with my cell phone, zooming in and out on the ufo as it went by, the sun went over the horizon around 8:40pm when i saw it. it was a crystal clear day and afternoon and sun was reaching the horizon and airplanes were all over the place as usual. within 10 minutes and already dark it crossed the sky again in same fashion, from same origin point and direction/trajectory but i did not see it making a \"u-turn\" the first time so i am guessing there were 2 of these flying in same path. i stayed out super intrigued after the first ufo appeared and had noted the area when it became visible to the eye just above one of the yard's pine trees. i continued looking at the night sky, planes flying by with their beacons, a few stars showing up and then it showed up in the distance, same origin point and within 15 minutes from the first sight. i saw a lit dot except that this time it appeared as if it left something behind or departed from it, something stationary so i continued taking pictures with my cell phone as it went by in the night, same heading as previous ufo. started as a light at a distance flying fast with no sound whatsoever then it somehow transformed itself into a moving fireball/cloud with random whites and reds then it disappeared, it went dark and stealth. i must have taken like 100 pictures, some show things that i cant explain, others are just pics of a clear night sky. whatever this was, it was fast, silent and had the capability to somehow camouflage itself in a cloud form. i did not have a computer which is why i couldn't report it at the time. i used my iphone \"skills\" zooming in and out and using editing options to clear the images. i freaked out a bit when i zoomed-in some of the pics and added a bit of brightness, contrast, and even used the red eye as i was running out of options in the phone, i tried it all several times and it finally revealed itself, whatever it was. you all take a look at the pictures and you tell me what you see. i have witnessed a few ufo's in my past including a not so long ago sight also reported here but i have never seeing a ufo as if it came out of a box, a window-box-like just hanging up there in the sky, this \"box\" resembles the microsoft window in lock-screen in most computers. i could've swear this second ufo came out of the \"window box\" which i didn't notice at first but then pictures revealed it. could this be a portal window/door to enter the earth atmosphere unnoticed? i can only upload 10 pics so. *in the picture where the ufo is surrounded by what it looks like a red transparent set of flower petals (red cloud form) looking like a fireball from a distance, the ufo can be seen to have a double arrow-end body shape with some x's configuration in the middle, i was able to see through the red cloud by using the red eye feature in my iphone. - it resembles the same ufo shape that a tourist recorded from the empire state in nyc in april 2 of 2016, posted in the ufosightingsdaily site.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

fast walkers and anything out of the normal. we've seen many strange things in the past but i've seen more than she has. i told her about an indecent before where i saw two \"worm hole\" looking clouds above my old house near the beach where i couldn't see any objects creating the ever lengthening formations that had the ends expanding. the night last week we were watching proved i wasn't crazy. i watched the same formation streak slowly across the night sky around 2200 hours moving from an orbital enter position to a linear south east direction. i pointed it out and shouted \"that's the thing i saw before!\" and she ran inside to grab binoculars because there was no visible object in the front of the \"cloud\". upon tracking the black cloud i was able to observe the object which she found also. it was moving slowly in a straight line and began to slow down. the streak it was leaving began to retract slightly like it was leaving and while we watched the object we both lost sight of it suddenly. after regaining sight of it we had noticed it had drastically changed direction and was headed more south but in an upward direction. i've posted things before to mufon in the past describing my abduction case when i was really young in which i was left with an implant in my lip but o never heard anything back, but after this incident last week i just noticed that the object in my lip has suddenly vanished leaving that part of my lip feeling slightly... hollow?? i don't know how to say it. but now, since the last sighting i've suffered from nightmares and a headache that won't go away no matter what i do!! i'm not afraid of our intergalactic brothers, i just want someone to believe me! they've been with me since i was young   and was always ok with everything but this last time something has left me in pain. did a new species get ahold of me? something more malicious? and why won't mufon investigate? i was contacted once and the investigator vanished? what's going on? why am i afraid now? i loved my friends from before but now... something is different. that worm hole brought in something else. i'm sure of it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

about 8 pm i stepped out onto my backyard patio to enjoy the clear night sky. i noticed a spotlight shining into the sky towards the west. i figured it was at the red rock casino to mark its anniversary. as i looked at the spotlight moving through the sky i noticed a very bright reflection of something in the sky also towards the west. it was about 45 degrees up from the horizon. at first my thoughts were that it was an airplane, but there were no navigation lights at all. then i thought it could be a satellite, but it was moving way too slow and the reflection emitted was tremendously bright, square in shape, very large in size, and appeared to be caused by rotation of the object. i then thought it could be the space station, but i have seen that many times and it never appeared to look like the light i was seeing. definitely not a planet, nor the moon either. the object was moving in a straight line from west to east and very, very slowly. at times the reflection would be intensely bright for a couple of seconds then dim to darkness and many seconds later be intensely bright again. this pattern repeated itself for the entire time i watched as it slowly traveled to the east where i lost sight of it behind my neighbors tree line.The size of the reflection was that of a bb or pellet held at arms length. the reflection seemed to be very high in altitude. there were airliners in night sky and they moved quickly in and out of view. the light i saw was visible to me for about 15 minutes. i was totally mesmerized by what i saw. i suppose i can explain it away as the spotlight shining on something traveling high in the atmosphere, but i would like to know if other people saw this as well. i have never seen anything move that slowly through the sky and exhibit such a bright light whether emitted or reflected. its been in my thoughts ever since. thnx for any info u may be able to provide regarding my

from the north, that i had seen just a few nights prior, and i had no camera with me!  the craft entered my frame of vision from the west (skimming tree tops), turned 90 degrees (on a dime), and the craft was moving directly at me.  the navigational lights were that of a jet, but the headlight was 10x brighter than a typical jet headlight.  i had just taken my camera in from my night of sky gazing, took the dog out, took her back in, and started to lock up the door for the night when i got a ‘psychic’ message to return outside and to stand by a particular tree, which i did.  very strange!  sure as the devil, that’s when i spotted the craft approaching from the west and just north of me.  i backed away from the tree and boldly stood as the craft centered directly between my eyes and came overhead at an est. 15 – 20 mph. or less.  it presented what appeared to be a full display of lights, including a ring of brilliant red individual lights, dead center in the belly of the craft.  it was lit like ‘times square’ and utterly silent.  another triangle, but this time, just over my head!  this time, left light red and right, green; different from prior, higher slightly higher altitude sightings of 2 triangles together, with red and white lights, only, from days earlier.  the head-beam was brighter than the moon, and cast for a couple miles forward, at least, and came over at an est. 100 feet – 125 feet at best.  it was very low and slow.  i know i said 15 – 20 mph. but in reality it may have moving at 5 mph. for all i know.  i was hypnotized by the green light and a feeling of peace and love came over me.  again … very strange!  ‘they’ (whoever or whatever they are) allowed me to see the entire craft.  i was in absolute awe! and … i wasn’t the least bit frightened!  i know the light mesmerized me as i stood smiling at the craft approaching me!  if it were any lower, i could have hit it with a rock.  as it passed overhead, i was dead center with the brilliant red belly lights.  if they wanted to abduct me, they would have!  as it was about to exit our property, the only sound it made was a low crackling sound.  the back edge was trimmed with yellow-orange oblong ports.  i got a great look at the craft, but missed a sensational photo op!  this struck me as a total anti-gravity craft, as the giant equilateral triangle barely moved through the air, with no wind or air disturbance being generated whatsoever.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with

was completely dark, and after a few minutes my eye was drawn to an usually bright star-like object outside my bedroom window. it is not usual to see a few dim stars outside my window (the city lights drown out most of them) but this one was unusually vibrant. \r\n \r\nafter watching the star for less than a minute, the object seemed to move westward very quickly, only to stop and hover again. i began to watch it more closely, and it seemed to actively move fluidly back and forth across the sky, two or three times a minute. each time it would stop and hover once again. it was a cloudless night, and although i regularly see planes and helicopters in my neighbourhood, this made no sound and had no navigation lights.\r\n\r\ni immediately grabbed my phone (the only camera within reach), and managed to take photos and take a short video. while doing both, i made sure to rest my hands on the window ledge, and brace my arms to reduce any hand movement. in the video the object can be seen repeatedly moving. in the photos, the object seems to routinely change shape, beginning as a glowing orb, then seeming to 'burst', with a clear hole in the middle, and reforming into a circular orb again. it was incredibly unusual. \r\n\r\nthe object made me feel both curious and unnerved, as although it was star-like, it didn't seem natural somehow. the object behaved oddly. although i didn't feel unsafe, i was unnerved, and eventually wanted to stop watching the object. after about 20 minutes, i stopped observing it, although it was still in the sky, but far further west than when i had started watching.\r\n\r\nany insight you could give would be greatly appreciated. although i'm aware it very likely could be a natural phenomenon, it seemed unnatural and was unnerving enough that i thought i should report it. thank you!","distance":"Over One

watching netflix on my phone. i was looking upward watching an episode of south park. it caught my eye because it was bright orange and red. i couldn't understand what it was. i kept thinking it had to be a hot air balloon or something. i was seeing it from underneath. it was a bright red circle that looked like fire, due to the way it flickered. that circle was the center of a much larger circle that was a bright orange red. it looked like the center was the fire and the rest of the object was illuminated it. \r\n\r\ni realized it couldnt be a hot air balloon because the basket would hide the fire. i wondered if it could be some weird paper floating fire art, like what you might see in japan, but enormous. there wasn't any noise, which really stuck out to me. i am used to the sound of planes and helicopters. this was not high and climbing altitude like a plane which are noisy. it was lower like a helicopter might be, but without sound and it was enormous by comparison. \r\n\r\ni tried to get out of my netflix and get to my camera on my phone. i stood up and tried to get a better look at it. i never felt like i could get a different view of it. it was moving too slowly, not a dead hover but really slow like a hot air balloon. but it always looked like i was seeing it from underneath. when it moved from over my neighbors house, north, maybe 2 city clocks really slowly, i watched it and there wasn't a side view , it still looked like a glowing orange circle with a bright red circle on the bottom underside.So, disc shaped i suppose because it didn't seem deep from the side but was 3 dimensional and pie shaped.\r\n\r\ni couldn't get my phone to work, but did not attribute it to the ship. i was just learning to use the new smart phone. it had to be fairly fast. but it seemed like it lasted to maybe 8 minutes. i gave up on the phone and just wanted to watch it, because it was unlike anything i had ever seen. i really never was in to ufo stuff. i still wish i knew what it was. i kept my eye on it. it moved north a few blocks and then it just disappeared.
