same direction came a flying object of some sort with very bright flashing and pulsing lights. it was how much brighter the lights were compared to plane that drew my attention.  as it passed over head in a southbound direction it appeared to be a purple pulsing glowing orb with some kind of reactions occurring within.  you could see the trail of energy, but no sound.  at this point it flew higher toward the south and hovered and moved irratically.  i snapped a few pictures with my phone, which came out, but my first attempt at video was 3 sec of the sidewalk and didnt record.  i went in the house to tell my girlfriend what  had saw, she grabbed her phone and came outside.  i saw the ufo high in the sky, i was able to record about a minute and a half of footage that came out pretty good (i attached below) and i zoomed in while recording.  i recorded until my phone died, at which point my girlfriend took over videoing with her phone.  i also had binoculars.  i observed more continued erratic floating and flight patterns and the colors seemed to change from red to blue-green- to yellowish-white and purple.  even when i lost sight of it i seemed to be able to find it again through the clouds (was a clear night for the most part).  i thought i saw tiny spec objects following it but i did not see on the footage yet, so i cannot confirm that.  the \"orb\" continued to change directions move up down left and right and hover in place.  at times upon zooming in, it appeared as though it became 2 balls of energy rapidly swirling around each other as it moved. the orb eventually continued to head north until it was out of my sight about 45 min later.  there were multiple planes that had flown through the area over the 45 min i had watched the orb.  i don't know if they were aware of its presence or not.  there were a few other people in the parking lot coming or going but none that seemed to notice us recording and watching the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

my car and to the swimming pool of my urbanization.\r\nit was the end of the day and it was clear. i have seen, just in front of me 2 objects with the appearance of comet (asteroid). on following the other one at a real high speed but without noise.\r\nthe head was green and the tail was white. \r\nthe 2 objects just fly in direction of the clouds, disappear, reappear after the clouds and disappear again. \r\nvery fast and no sound (the place i live is really quite). the shape and the lights are not normal to be a plane. i asked to a pilot from the army base of manta if they are using drones like this or any kind of plane, and he told me not.\r\ni immediately talk to people i know and check internet if i was alone or not to see this. it was the case until one week after.\r\non the 16th of april, my city(manta-ecuador) had a big earthquake, destroying most part of the city and killing so many people. this day, people in different part of ecuador said that they have seen the same objects in the sky. one week after my observation. the object look like the video you can find in youtube typing \"luz verde de argentina\". it seems that it's not the first time that something happend before an earthquake (or during). i didn't know before my observation. \r\ni join some drawing i did for the french organism geipan who told me to send to mufon my observations, because it

big while the escorts were blocking traffic so truck could go down road heading towards our local subbase.He saw all this at same time i saw the lights over about where the subbase is.He told me this the next day and then i told him what i saw at same time.He wasnt sure what he saw till after he described it to me i showed him some video that was on the web of what he described and it freaked him

Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:78993"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Churchill","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i was a kid, for two years from 1959 to 1961 my family lived in churchill, manitoba, canada. it may have been around mid-october 1959 – later in the year, but before snowfall that i was on my way to cub scouts when i saw something unusual. to get to the cub shack, i would cut through a number of buildings, generally trying to avoid walking outside too much because of the risk of encountering polar bears. \r\n\r\nhowever, the last leg of the walk to the shack was down a dirt road isolated from other buildings. to provide some perspective, the hudson bay was to my right across an expanse of rocks as i walked towards the cub shack. suddenly, another kid on his way to cubs up the road ahead of me said, ‘look at that,’ or words to that effect. looking up, i saw a perfect circle profiled against the already dark sky. \r\n\r\nthe circumference of the circle was clearly defined, but the interior looked like a rolling cloud or plasma about as bright as neon (as i would think later when i saw neon signs in regina), though there was no lighting effect on the ground. i don’t recall the colour when i first saw it, but of those i can recall, it would transition through red, green, yellow, a dark colour that made it look like it had disappeared, and white. \r\n\r\nthe colour changes accompanied a rolling appearance in the cloud or plasma towards the center. that rolling motion can be visualized by imagining the effect of tossing a stone in a pond and watching the waves ripple out from the point that the stone hit the water, but in reverse, such that the rolling, wave motion moved from the periphery of the circle inwards, towards the center. \r\n\r\nas soon as the rolling “wave” hit the center, the entire colour changed, and the sequence repeated. it was quite spectacular. thinking that it was the northern lights, i thought that i should try to remember the sequence of colour changes so that i could tell my parents and they would know i really saw the northern lights. but, whenever i thought i had the sequence nailed, either it changed or i was uncharacteristically confused. \r\n\r\nafter a couple or more minutes of this, the other kid further up the road said, we’d better hurry, or we’d be late, and i went on to cubs. oddly, perhaps, i always thought of what i saw as the northern lights, and even when i saw pictures of the northern lights later i would just think that the one i saw was better. at about seventeen, when i told the story of my northern lights to someone i knew who was studying television repair at algonquin college, he said that what i saw was a ufo, so i got some books and read up on ufos and concluded that he was probably right. \r\n\r\nif it was a ufo, it was either very large or very low because i was looking straight upward at it the whole time and it virtually filled my field of vision. unfortunately, though, i neither saw it come nor go, it was just there when i looked up, and it never occurred to me to look back when i left. i have been lucky enough to see a few ufos since that time, but it has always seemed strange to me that they have always been different, one from the other, and that in reading reports i’ve never come across one described quite like that one in churchill. the dates are my best guess. i put this story online once a couple of years ago in the hope that one of the other kids who must have seen it would come forward, or that someone who saw something like this anywhere else would say so. no luch so far.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":76104,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":58.7684112,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-04292016-0014","longitude":-94.16496400000001,"occurred":-322290000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Manitoba","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1461938137000,"summary":"Possibly
