pinwheel galaxy approximately 30 days after it was discovered.I was looking at the stars and saw movement in my peripheral vision causing me to look due west where i saw a single solid moving object  that passed directly over head and continued east at a constant speed and heading, so much that it stood out. i have seen a ufo or anything paranormal, so it was a shock.So when i first see it up to the point of passing over me my thoughts are wtf is that. i see 4 cubes in a straight line but moving as one they appear to be connected, there is a 5 th cube attached to the left side of the second cube.Now as the first part of this thing passes over head i see detail and it scared me, and i don't mean for my own safety, just in general as i was realizing that i'm witnessing something life changing, and i have a neural override where your brain shuts down non essential functions and doubles your visual audio and other sensory information uptake in an attempt at self preservation. it feels like the world around you is in slow motion. so from this point on the amount of detail i observed is sort of disturbing and 5 years later i can see it like it just happened. the detail,i type slow and i'm getting tired so i will condense but try to get every thing. it was non reflective and dark in color. the surface had some smooth areas the rest had raised and sunken lines with a lot of 90 deg turnes. my impression was conduit channels but they covered most if the surface like looking at a circuit board with light behind it, that dense and close together. the cubes turned out to be half as tall but square front to back and side to side. there was no lights or windows or obvious doors. it's movement was just forward but i have never seen anything move like it.The best i can describe it, absolute flawless.The bottom center of every square had a highly reflective circle that was about 1/3 the size of the square and as it moved overhead amber lights would move from the outside then cross the center to the far side of the circle but the light slowed way down as it crossed the center. i realized i was seeing amber street lights reflecting off black mirrored half spheres that were convex or concave. one would make light move fast across center the other slow. this was slow. i really would like to know if anyone has ever seen any thing like this. i would love to have somebody draw a pic of this, i've tried  but can't draw for sh you know what.My feelings were overwhelming i immediately tried to  debunk what i saw  as balloons or giant inflatable objects swamp gas. i started writing down details and tried to draw it.I didn't tell any one for  a long time not even my wife. if you want more detail you have my number text first so i will answer unknown

brillantly white, maybe glowed.\r\n\r\ni remember the day very well because the day before we had an awful accident occur in our community, the blue angels number 6 plane had crashed on april 21 2007. on april 22 2007, the blue angels team performed again even after the crash had occurred. they performed as a salute to number 6. \r\n\r\nit was not long after the air show, i was in my bedroom and i heard jets flying around, i live very close maybe 2-3 miles from the beaufort marine corps air station, i thought maybe the blue angels were leaving, so i leaned out of my window and looked toward the direction i thought the jet was traveling.\r\n\r\nthat's when i seen the object. it was very thin and long, it looked like it come to a point at either end. it was very white or the thing its self was made of light, it was very bright against the brilliantly blue sky. \r\n\r\nmy first reaction was to go outside and get a proper view, instead of having my upper body out the window, so i pulled myself out the window, and went outside, which took about 45 seconds and it was gone nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\ni thought it was very odd at first my father, sister, and boyfriend assumed that it was some sort of blimp by my description, but i know it was not a blimp it had no wings, no anything on it. it almost looked like a really thick line but pointed at either end. i have never seen anything like it before.\r\n\r\ni was a seventeen year old girl at the time, i have always lived in a military town, i'm used to seeing aircraft off all sorts jets, the b52 stealth, helicopters, all different types just by living here i grew up watching the blue angels, they come every few years and perform. i have never seen a crash or that object before but neither were enjoyable. i am now twenty

40 ft long. the other dangling bell appeared dark, almost burnt, and actually looked like a square close to being 15 - 25 ft cube.\r\n\r\nthe area over gavilan mtn is not an area for parachuters and, although temecula often has balloonist, we have seen the balloonists much further off in the distance. i’m an engineer and i’ve worked for navy and i know this was not anything we have or will ever have.\r\n\r\nyesterday i read mufon  case 74282. when i saw the cgi they have created representing what these men saw, i felt immediately that this is the same craft i saw several weeks earlier. i have included a jpg which i've cropped from the mufon file. the only difference i can immediately see from what i saw and the cgi is the dark edges in the cgi. however, when i viewed the object i saw it from an angle that made the darker edges unremarkable and one of the \"bells\" was black and square.\r\n\r\ni’m an engineer and worked for the navy on several military aircraft. i've seen enough to know this wasn't any aircraft, swamp gas or anything normal. this was in broad daylight, close and large enough for me to identify, and high up enough in the sky for me to know that it should have still been there when i turned around.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s), Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":76093,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.40242053980584,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04292016-0003","longitude":-117.24410826427986,"occurred":1455926400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1461895459000,"summary":"Barbell ufo drifting down through clouds","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":69,"maxvism":11,"maxvisi":7,"meantempm":12,"meantempi":53,"meanvism":9,"meanvisi":6,"mintempm":3,"mintempi":37,"minvism":2,"minvisi":2,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":69,"maxvism":11,"maxvisi":7,"meantempm":12,"meantempi":53,"meanvism":9,"meanvisi":6,"mintempm":3,"mintempi":37,"minvism":2,"minvisi":2,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"92028","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":69,"locationName":"Fallbrook, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:79693"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Mesquite","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have terrible insomnia and got up to go outside on our patio (we live in an upstairs apartment, with a small covered patio on the south side) to smoke a cigarette. the patio is located outside my husbands office. the closer i got to the door, the more i felt like something was wrong. i shrugged it off and turned the handle. the feeling of something is not right swept over me and i hesitated. i finally went outside and was so creeped out that instead of sitting i leaned against the door to smoke. i realized that i couldn't hear anything , it was absolutely quiet except for a strange bird making noise. there is a very busy highway that is north east of us that you can hear the cars etc. at all times. there was nothing, not a single car could be heard. on top of that , there was no wind. it was dead still and silent. i was so creeped out that i noticed something coming overhead and at first i thought it was a walmart shopping bag, then realized that was impossible. i stared at the thing until i couldn't see it anymore. our apartment buildings are so close that by the time i ran in to grab my phone (which was all the way in the bedroom on the other side of the apartment) it would have been gone. about a minute after this thing passed, i could hear the cars on the highway again and even a small breeze. the object went at a slow speed overhead and seeemed to change shape almost unnoticeabely. it wasn't very bright and i'm not sure if the light was emitted or was reflected. before it dissapeared it looked as if it had black surrounding it but the center was still a yellowish color.

even brighter. then, the weirdest thing happened; something entered the light-ray to the east, and moved in front of the center, all the while, the light in the center was obscured like a passing

relaxing drive.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden i see a whitish grey oval object seem to be following the plane contrail just below the contrail and maybe a few miles behind the actual plane. i assumed it was another plane but about a minute later the object seemed to slow down and from my viewpoint clearly looked oval in shape as i watched it periodically while driving. it was clearly an oval disk type shaped object which now had really got my attention. i pulled off to the side of the road while keeping an eye on the object.\r\n\r\ni put the car in park and from the time it took me to get out of the car to look at the object where i had seen it, it had vanished. maybe 3 to 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe interesting part of this sighting is that there was a break in the plane contrail roughly where i had seen the object last. it was as if the object stopped and punched upward through the plane contrail and disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nvery cool experience. who knows what it was but i do believe in this type of phenomenon and what i had witnessed was truly astonishing.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading. keep looking up!\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

clusters of black circles, the three turned into five and were moving in a direct line path across the sky in a north to south direction. i could see the sky in between the circles, yet they seemed connected. they changed from a circle pattern to an arc like pattern, almost like some one threw a switch, and instantly they were changed. i did not see them move. then the pattern changed into a vee shape, or open triangle, then a wing shape, and then back to the circle. it never changed direction, kept a straight line path while it was changing, and moved consistently, never speeding up or slowing down. i could see no lights or hear any sound. i estimate the distance from the ground at 15,000 feet in the sky.\r\nthe wind was from the southwest, the temperature was 85 degrees, humidity was at 85%. a storm had just passed and the object was flying into the storm.\r\nthere is a airport near by, but i only see the airplanes take off and land.\r\ni am very familiar with aircraft, and
