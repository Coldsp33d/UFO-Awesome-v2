bright red light through another window, which seemed to be rectangular-shaped but was far, like a big star in the sky, but there was a little white/blue (not sure of the colour) beam down, like when

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is a story from someone who wishes to stay anonymous. i read this story and spent some time locating this person to try and obtain an interview.\r\nafter promising several times i would not tell who he was, he allowed me to interview him. this is a brief rundown of his story. the interview will follow.\r\n\r\ni will try to cut most details out and get to the main story. it was 1988. i usually would be asleep by 8 p.M. nightly. i had to be at work by 5:30 a.M. every morning so i made sure to get my sleep. anyway. one night i was awoken by a bunch of dogs barking loudly.\r\n\r\ni was very confused when i woke up because i wasn't in my bed. i was actually in the middle of my street walking. i found out the dogs were barking at me.\r\n\r\nat this time i realized that i had no control of myself all i could move were my eyes. the next thing i remember was i was walking to this wooded bike trail area. i knelt down on one knee. with two hands on my bent knee i peeked threw some trees and bushes and saw a craft of some type. it was ball-shaped, no lights and landed under these huge power lines. i never saw the craft from the outside fly. as i looked at the craft an opening opened up and two smaller beings than me came out of the craft.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i remember was that i was boarding the craft. as i walked onto the craft the two beings followed me in the craft. the craft was kind of cramped and dark. it was dark but you could see like a neon kind of darkness. i then bent down and asked the being where we are going.\r\n\r\nthey answered me and said they are taking me behind the moon. i then asked why?\r\n\r\nthey said they couldn't be detected on earth’s radar from there. i said ok, then we took off. i looked out of some kind of window type thing and saw us leaving the earth. we passed the moon then made a u-turn type of turn back. this took less than 10 seconds. for some reason i wasn't scared at all.\r\n\r\ni actually acted like i knew them. the next thing i recall was the only time i was really scared. i woke up again, this time naked in a funnel shaped pool filled with a greenish black gel type liquid. the pool had to be 20 yards wide all around. and pretty deep.\r\n\r\nthe pool was made of some kind of shiny metal. with the gel it made the surface very slippery and you would slip under the gel if you tried to get out. i then realized something very odd at that time. i wasn't alone.\r\n\r\nthere were at least 15 other humans with me. all of them screaming and panicking. this is what scared me. i didn't know what they were screaming about. i thought they knew something i didn't, so i got scared. some were under the gel moving around i could see. most were trying to escape.\r\n\r\none man kept climbing half way out. the closer he got to the top he would get hit by some sort of beam then he'd slid back into the pool. i thought this guy was insane, if he did get out where would he go? (i thought) i didn't see who was telling me but they where telling me not to be scared.\r\n\r\nthey told me i would be fine and that i could breath the gel. they said i could eat it and digest it. i couldn't drown in it. we could live in the gel. it also recycled human waste back into the gel.\r\n\r\ni believed some of the humans were in the pool for years by the way they were acting. i figured a way to be under the gel and still breath air. that way they wouldn't hit me with the beam and make me slide under. i blacked out after that.\r\n\r\nthe next things i remember are some pretty vivid memories. i must let you know that i am deathly frightened of frogs. i know it sounds crazy but it's my one phobia. it's their skin. back to the story. i was rudely awaken by a being armpit high holding my hand taking me somewhere. i remember the touch of their hands it's woke me up from what ever i was under.\r\n\r\ni tugged away and started to threaten them. i clinched my fist like i was going to fight. i said get away from me and if they touched me again i was going to hit them. he told me if i would do that i would change the world, as we know it. i knew if i hit them in the head my fist would go right threw them.\r\n\r\ni didn't like the feel of their skin and i thought i sure wouldn't want its brains all over me.\r\n\r\nso i was kind of stuck in defending myself or making a huge nasty mess all over me. that's when i realized that i was communicating to them with out my mouth. i knew what they were thinking and they knew what i was thinking.\r\n\r\nit made things difficult for me at first. that's when the smaller beings brought over this taller being, a little taller than me. as the taller being approached me he told the smaller being that this is a (the) prophet. i looked at his face for maybe half a second. his face grossed me out so i never looked at him again.\r\n\r\nif i looked at him again then he'd know how i felt about his appearance. i didn't want to offend him because i like this one he made me feel comfortable.\r\n\r\nhe explained that they wanted to do some medical examinations on me and if i would cooperated. i made a deal with him if they didn't touch me, hurt me or scare me then i would do it. he promised then i aloud them to do what they wanted. he also said he would answer all my questions that asked.\r\n\r\nhe walked me around as we talked. i looked at the ground the entire time so not to look at him. the next thing i remember was the medical examination.\r\n\r\nfirst thing that i remember was coming out of a black out lying on a table. i was not scared what so ever. i trusted them.\r\n\r\nand by being able to read their minds i know they weren't lying to me. as i remember they took some skin from my right arm. it was like the thinnest layer possible. unviable to my eyes, but all they needed.\r\n\r\nnext they took semen from me. i didn't understand this. again i wont go into to much details simply because this story would be about nine-hundred pages long.\r\n\r\ni asked about this procedure later. the last thing they did to me was the strangest of all. they took my right eye out of my head. i actually saw the back of my eyeball and a cord or veins connected to it. i instantly ask about this.\r\n\r\nnext they put a babe like metal ball in my eye socket; about the size of a broken piece of rice. i asked, \"what's that for?\" they said so they can monitor me from space. i thought it was so they could see everything that i can see, like a video camera or something. then they put my eye back in then that was that?\r\n\r\nmy next memories were the taller being talking and i. this was the best part; because he answered my questions and showed me things in my head.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\ni don't know the exact order of my questions but i did ask away. i must inform you that they communicated to me like an adult would talk to a five-year-old child. with simple words; stuff like that. i thought it was funny.\r\nanyway, the first question was about my semen. why? he told me so they can make baby humans in space. i simply said, \"oh.\"\r\n\r\nbut then as i asked him questions he put visions in my head and showed me in an instant how they do it. as we were walking and talking about the humans in space he walked into this doorway that you can't even see until you look in it.\r\n\r\njust as we were talking about humans in space these two kids about thirteen to fifteen years old one male one female turned to look at us. both human. full blooded perfect human beings.\r\n\r\nthey were both sitting down facing away from us. they turned around looked in my eyes. he sort of introduced us i guess. then they turned around and continued to do what they were doing.\r\n\r\nbelieve it or not they were either controlling, driving or operating the craft or building were in. they were in control of operating something. i was tripping of this because they knew what they were doing and just little kids. they totally trusted them. crazy stuff.\r\n\r\nand being that you can read minds in this situation i knew the kids won't scared or uncomfortable. they were programmed to master their job. there is much more to this topic also but that will scratch the surface of it. as we left i noticed he was taking me somewhere else.\r\n\r\nthis was kind of confusing to me also. this time it's like the room just appeared. we were just instantly in it. i think it's there doorways. they are unexplainable.\r\n\r\nnext thing i see is a dead cow hanging i believe head up butt down. nothing to my eyes was holding it up. i was baffled. i know cows can weigh tons but it was just hanging. next thing they did was dip it into some kind of gel in a box-shaped pool just big enough for the cow to fit in. strangely enough the gel didn't overflow when they put the cow in.\r\n\r\nthe pool was filled up. next they lifted the cow out and it was cut, dead and i was starting to get scared. i thought i was next. but then he showed me why they do this. it all related to the humans in space. he said what do humans eat as a child or infant.\r\n\r\ni said milk. he said exactly. what do adult humans eat? i said hamburgers, steaks and food.\r\n\r\nagain he said exactly. then he put a vision again in my head and explained it all. they can't just take earth cows in space. they do just like they told me; he said we make our own cows in space. germ free no fleas no illnesses pure cows. just like the space humans perfect specimens.\r\n\r\nlike i said i have much more information on that topic also. then i asked about monitoring me behind my eye. they said humans do it all the time. he explained like this. how does a tiger explain to itself when it hears a helicopter coming out of the skies in the jungle? a big metal load scary object.\r\n\r\nthey all of a sudden they feel a pain in their hip and lose all control of everything except there eyes. then creatures come out of the object and start doing things to it. like tagging it's ear. like even taking teeth. they even take semen to preserve the species from extinction some times. basically scaring the crap out of the tiger for it's own good in a way.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

look at the object when 2 more were observed and they all shared the same characteristics. they were in a triangle type pattern but there was a great distance apart. they appeared to be traveling from the north heading southeasterly. intrigued by what i was seeing, i got 2 other co-workers to look at these objects.\r\n\r\nas we all watched, i noticed another one following and this one appeared to be closer to me because its reflective qualities were far more evident. it followed the same type of flight path.   another two which appeared to possibly be attached came into view the same distance up as the first three. this group of orbs also had the same characteristics as the others but, the one underneath slowly went clockwise around the one it was traveling with and then came back down counterclockwise. i continued to watch all of them until such time as they were no longer visible to me. \r\n\r\ncommercial airlines were in the sky and all of which left vapor trails behind. the objects didn't appear to be traveling very fast as i was trying to use the jets as basis for speed. it should also be noted that i was very close to new orleans international airport. \r\n\r\ni came

sped off straight upward so fast that it was just gone. i did get a few pictures of it tho. they are pretty neat when i zoom in on them it's defentialy proof! i'm going to send them to the news cast. can't wait for everyone to see what i did, it was amazing. and the pictures i was able to take are absolutely amazing. i lost line of site on the craft because it went up really really fast like a bullet it was gone.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

flashlight (small) and my dogs leash. i had just passed one of my neighbors trees when i heard a sudden angry hiss come from it. this startled me and i originally thought it was a cat but there are only dogs in my neighborhood. (my cat was the last cat here before he passed away) i backed away from the tree and from the corner of my eye i saw movement, turning to my left which was facing se i saw a bright blue light rapidly climb into the air from it's position that i first saw it. then it came towards me, it was small so i knew i had some time to run back to my house. i turned around and started to shout/say \"nope, nope. no way! i am going inside, nope!\" mainly as a way to get myself to move faster and because this was the second time i witnessed the object. i didn't turn around because the moment you look back is when s*** goes down. i was scared and excited but mainly not wanting to deal with the object, i didn't want to have any confrontation with it and was more interested in heading back in.\r\n\r\nmy house is close to the corral, no more than maybe a distance of 30-50 feet away from the house. right next to the corral is a storeroom that has lights, a ceiling fan and flood lights on the outside. they use to be motion sensitive but were replaced with a simple switch to bring down the cost. after returning to the house i went to my parents room and informed my mother that the light was back. i had told her about the first time i had seen the light and hoped to show it to her. i figured it was safer if someone was with me than simply going back out there on my own. once back outside which took a while, mainly because she wanted to wait for a commercial break in her soap opera we were outside. this took about five to eight minutes at the most. outside the neighbors to my right, which was the area the light was coming from, were no longer outside. their lights were off and their blinds shut tight. i don't know but i think that they saw it coming as well.  \r\n\r\nit is very note worthy for me to say that at the time of this incident and the previous one that my neighbors were outside with the lights on, then after i went back outside with my mother the lights were completely off. the first time i had seen it i did go back outside but by myself and noticed that the lights were promptly shut off and they were inside with the blinds closed. this is rather strange because they usually don't bother to close the blinds because we live out in the desert and no one bothers us. \r\n\r\ni know that the light is a craft, the origin i do not know. i have seen different crafts before this but none had ever come towards me and there was an incident when i was a child that makes me feel that there is more to the world than what we see everyday. i really hope that it doesn't come back but at the same time i want it to come back so i can take a picture or record it. for all i know this could be fine and nothing will happen to me.

could not sleep due to the effects of the full moon, so i got up and thought ok since i cannot sleep i will go look to see if the full moon is out. i walked to the rear of our house to the back patio double doors. \r\n\r\ni saw the full moon bright and nicely nestled in-between our trees and fetched my husbands camera which i am not too familiar with but i opened the patio doors briefly to take some photos of the moon, it was cold. i was rather pleased with the photos as they turned out well. some would't focus because of the the light levels but some did. i do not know how to alter his cannon camera. \r\n\r\ni was just heading back to bed when i had an odd feeling, i thought i will just look once more at the beautiful full moon. as i did i saw an orange ufo appear from the east. for a second i watched it, then i thought, grab the camera. i turned it on and tried to focus it but it wouldn't focus as the light was too dim. all the time the craft was moving across the night sky. it appeared oval but it could have been saucer  shaped, the angle did not allow me to see if it were actually a saucer. it was travelling from the east to south west which would take it over lake erie. it was travelling at an angle about 40 to 45 degrees. it had a orange glow which gave it an outline and fuzzy lighter orange pulsating glow around it. i struggled with the camera as it would not pic up the ufo on the little screen. i decided to just aim and take photos in the hope it might catch something. i was really excited about the siting. while i followed the ufo i did try to remote view it and i did receive an image of the occupants, obviously as you know remote viewing is not an exact science as any real remote viewer would agree. i did however receive an image of a form of grey alien not with huge eyes but medium size eyes bigger in proportion than human eyes. these were tall and rather elegant aliens not the weak looking greys we normally see in the media. they were very intelligent and appeared to have some form of high collared gown or cape on.  they knew i was remote viewing them and told me they could not stop they were busy (on a schedule) i sent them a message of love and greetings to them, no fear at all. the ufo then disappear over my house and i moved to the front of the house but could no longer see it. \r\n\r\non reviewing my photos i just caught an image by a fraction the bottom of the image is the refraction of my patio doors. i will attached the original and the one i blew up. i have not in any way altered the image just enlarged it. it is unfortunately not a wonderful photo and it really annoyed me i could not get the camera to focus and take a better photo or even film but at least i just managed to catch an image.  \r\n\r\ni would like to add i am familiar with aircraft as i served in the royal air force as a aircraft mechanic propulsion (aircraft engines). so i am aware of weather balloons, helicopters, aircraft etc.. this was a ufo!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional
