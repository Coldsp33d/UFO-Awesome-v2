called me , my family and my girlfriend outside. he pointed out a bizarre looking star like object above an apartment conplex. he asked if that looked strange to us . realizing that we have binoculars i quickly ran back inside and got them. through binoculars of 20/80 we could clearly see that this object was flashing colors at a rapid pace. i watched it long enough to memorize the lightime order as white, red, blue, green,yellow. me and my little brother ran to the other side of the complex it was above to try and get a better look, there wasn't much of a difference in what we could see from our new spot. however when we turned to walk back to our apartment my little brother pointed and said \"is that another one?\" i looked through the binoculars and to my amazement there hovering above our complex was another object just like the first. we  called our dad over to look at our discovery. at the same time my girlfriend said to me \"that right there is a plane right ?\" my little brother answerved quickly \"no a plane doesn't fly without lights\" we sat there bewildered as a triangular object raced across the sky where it flew to the object over our complex and dissappeared. before we all went back inside we counted 4 orbs in the night sky all like the first. all changing colors and hovering silently. i went back out about 20 minutes later to see if they were still there, i saw what i thought was a plane at first racing back from over our complex towards the original orb we spotted. through binoculars i saw from what i believe to be a side view of the craft at first.  it was triangular in shape with a red light in the back, a blue in front, and two white lights in between. it flew right over me and on the underside where three white lights. one on each point. my

gather to celebrate those servicemen and women lost at war. this event takes place just before dawn. today i was standing listening to the speeches when looking up to the horizon a very bright flashing light caught my eye.It was like a tripple strobing before it went out. after about 8-10 seconds it lit up once more only this time it wasn't as bright and it looked like a lighthouse light. gaining in intensity then dulling. the crowd around me heard me telling my two daughters and their school friends and then also began to follow its path. it was an extremely solem occasion so the environment was very quiet,the object gave no sound. we could see a dark sphere when the light was off and it moved slowly across the sky in a northwest direction. at one stage it gave out another bright burst of light before we lost sight of it. it was very high up. i'm not entirely sure of it's exact altitude but it was at a similar height of a commercial aircraft if not slightly lower and moving very slowly. when i first saw the light i knew it wasn't an aircraft because there were no navigation lights visible, there was no sound at all. i also have never seen a satellite this low and that emitted any light other than that of the suns reflection. we should've seen the sun reflecting off it at this time as the sun was rising behind it. even though we could see the dawns light on the horizon, given the objects altitude it would have been within the suns line of sight making it brighter. i'm not entirely sure on how many people witnessed this event? but i know the packed crowd around me had many looking up and pointing in bewilderment. i didn't get any photos of this event. but all i can say is that it looked like a black/charcoal sphere that seemed to fully light up before going dark again.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

the thunderbird ave. onramp.  this was at approximately 9:28pm arizona time on saturday april 23, 2016.\r\n\r\nquickly after entering the freeway i had noticed what looked like helicopter lights and the helicopter was hovering.  it looked rather high in the sky and it was of course a dark night so i was unable to classify the craft, other than observing the lights at this point, and its unusually high position in the sky over the n, nw sky of phoenix.\r\n\r\nnext i observed (of course this is all while i'm driving on the freeway) a very dim green light descend from this craft.  as in falling from the hovering craft.  it appeared to fall more than 100 ft.  then the green light stopped in mid fall.  and appeared to hover below the original craft.  i could tell the craft above was moving westward because the two no longer seemed to line up in a straight line.  after about 20 seconds, that's when things became interesting.  the green light that had been hovering after falling instantly turned into a much larger object that i only could describe as a bloated double stuff oreo cookie.  it was impossible to see the top and bottom of this craft as it was black against the night sky.  the remarkable (and visual part of this siting) was the pale white center of the craft.  it did not emit light but rather looked like light was reflecting off of it.  pale white, not too terribly bright.  it appeared right from the green light that had fallen and hovered from the original craft (bright lights, strobing, moving).\r\n\r\nkeeping in mind, i was able to see this \"bloated oreo double stuff shaped\" craft for what seemed like a minute or two while driving.  i wished i had pulled over, but again i was on the freeway.  i was hoping there would be many other sightings and we could figure out what this was.  it indeed was a ufo, if it was a hoax it was superb!\r\n\r\nif you have any information which might clarify this siting, please do not hesitate to contact me at my

knocking on my neighbors back door in the house behind us. as this is not normal, i looked out the window from my second story bedroom. i didn't see anyone in my neighbors yard so i was about to go back to bed when i saw what appeared to be a plane or helicopter in the distance traveling toward my house moving from the se to the nw. it just looked like a bright headlight from a plane. a little lower in the sky and brighter than what you'd normally see in the skies above my house but nothing alarming. however, after a few seconds of watching the light come toward my direction, it stopped and remained in one place. so, i thought it must be a helicopter. the light seemed pretty bright though and it did not have any flashing directional lights so i watched it for a while. it remained stationary for about a solid minute then started to move to the right. as it did, i saw a flash of red light which made me think i was watching a helicopter all this time. but the red flash was pretty bright and only red, no green flash followed as would be expected for a traditional aircraft. suddenly the entire light became completely red and remained a solid, glowing red color. it appeared to be a red oval shaped glowing light. it continued to move slowly to the right for a couple of seconds then made an abrupt 90 degree turn back in the direction from which it came and moved rapidly across the sky until i could no longer see it due to distance and trees in the foreground blocking the view. this most certainly was not a plane or helicopter. it made movements they are not capable of making and the speed at which this accelerated from a dead stop was pretty fast. i would appreciate if mufon or any other reporting agency can tell me if anyone else saw this. it is pretty frustrating when you are the only one that saw something so remarkable and you know for certain it was real but nobody else was there to corroborate your story. this is the second time i have seen something in the skies over brentwood and was alone when it occurred. please please please tell me if anyone else reported a similar sighting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
