ready to head to work.  the sky was crystal clear and the moon was nearly full and about as bright as it can be.  i looked up at it and noticed that there was a nice contrail growing in the sky, just past the moon.  it stood out as almost glowing because of the moon, and it was very wide as compared to most visible contrails.  i followed the contrail to the right to see if i could make out what was making it. i then noticed that leading the contrail was a perfect triangle, blacker than the sky, with an amber / yellow constant light on the each corner.  i watched for a few seconds then decided to take a photo of it.  it was minus zero, so by the time i threw my gloves off and dug my phone out, i really only got one shot.\r\n\r\ni didn’t hear any typical jet noises, but my impression was that the object was a lot lower than a typical jet leaving contrails, because the amber lights were so clearly noticeable.  \r\n\r\nlater i got to work and looked at the photo and all i really saw on my phone was a blurry shot of the moon and another bright spot which i assume is venus.  but, i sent the photo to my work computer, and opened it up on my large screen.  if you look to the right of the blurry moon, you will see the contrail.  follow the contrail to its origin, and you see a three pointed blurry image.  very disappointing.  however, if you zoom in a little, and follow the contrail back about half ways, you will see two distinct triangle pattern of lights, which appear to be following the lead object.I was not aware of these additional object when i was observing it in real time.\r\n\r\nas i stated, i didn’t hear any noises at all, and i was not aware of the two smaller light patterns following the main triangle. the contrail was just lit up so bright by the moon behind it, that is what caught my attention initially. it was so wide, that i wanted to see what was making it.  the contrail seemed to be one single wide element, and i wanted to see what would make it. the craft was completely black, and stood out against the dark night sky. the yellowish light on each corner was fairly large compared to the size of the triangle, and was inset a little on each corner, it was not incorporated into the corner itself, it appeared that they were attached to the bottom.  there were no red or green blinking navigation lights. the craft was about half the diameter of the moon, and appeared about the same size as you would view a low flying cessna plane. based upon the visiblity of the outline of the triangle and the apperance of the lights, i would say that the craft was either very large, or fairly low, but i have never seen a low aircraft make a contrail.\r\n\r\ni believe that the general direction of travel for the objects were south to north or a little more southeast to northwest.  maybe i caught something heading back to wright-patt afb in dayton?\r\n\r\ni will attach the photo.  the triangle is blurry, but the two other triangle light formations are pretty clear.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the front yard to take the dog out before bed. i was looking toward an east, south easterly direction and observed an orangish light approaching from the east. i live in a heavily traveled aircraft area due to being near the charlotte douglas airport which lies about 15 miles southwest of my home. the airport is a multi runway international airport that is very busy and depending on flight patterns, arriving or departing planes can be seen throughout the day and night. i am very accustomed to seeing landing lights and varied size aircraft from single engine private planes through commercial boeing and airbus airliners. also stationed at charlotte douglas is a air national guard unit. c-130 and c-141 aircraft is not uncommon in the area. in addition, police helicopters patrol this area as well. apache, cobra, huey, and blackhawk helicopters refuel at clt also. concord airport lies to the north east and a small private airport to the south. \r\n  i am a former police officer and a student pilot. what i observed was not an ordinary aircraft. although it did not perform any extraordinary maneuvers etc, it’s appearance was not in line with conventional planes or helicopters. the object was traveling from the east, made a turn and continued on a path from southeast to northwest. in the dark it is hard to tell about size and distance etc. from my position it looked to be at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon, and i estimate the size to be about the same as a private jet (30-50’). altitude i guess was about 1500 - 2000 ft at a distance of 2 miles or so. again, depending on perspective of the object, i would estimate speed to be around 150 to 200 kts.\r\n it’s appearance was a yellowish, gold to reddish orange bright glow. it appeared to have a foggy “field like” aura about it that flashed and pulsed, almost fire like. however, it had a solid appearance within the light. it had no strobes that i could see and no navigational lighting or beacon. the object continued on a northwesterly path until it simply disappeared. in the video attached you casn see the object pass behind trees, however i turned the camera off changed positions in my yard and continued watching an additional 15 -30 seconds after the video ended and the object simply flickered and disappeared. the whole event was about 2 minutes approximately. \r\n in my opinion it was too big to be a drone and the altitude was too high and the track too long. it was not a balloon or chinese lantern because it made a precise turn and the speed was far too fast and stable for something directed by air currents. it could have been an aircraft designed to hoax a ufo sighting, or it could be a non conventional military craft. alternatively, it could be something non terrestrial. i do know it was not a “normal” aircraft.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

trailer of some kind.  the object did not move at  all. there was no sound., no movement of any kind, no change in the lights.  she states “i felt fearful”. “i knew it didn’t belong there”. this is across the street from us, an elderly lady lives there, and the neighbor has been staying with her sister taking care of her, so she was not home, and the object was in her yard. my sister takes in her mail and watches the house for her while she’s gone. my sister took the pictures and when she realized what she thought it was stopped taking pictures and came back into the kitchen, she did not show me the pictures until later.  when she gets really scared she keeps things to herself for a little while till she can talk about it.  this was a saturday, i don’t think she showed me the pictures till sunday or monday night.  she did not want to see what it did, just didn’t want to see it anymore, so we have no idea how it left..  in the beginning she couldn’t even say that she thought it was a space ship, just said it was a “vehicle” and that it wasn’t “ordinary”. i agreed that it looked space ship like, and suggested we send it to u, to help us identify what it really is.  thank you for

at night very often, and she likes to show them to me.  the more she took pictures the more “stuff” i saw in the pictures.  lots of orbs, different colors, and one night what i think of as a drone(?).  anyway, i had started to look at the sky myself to see where she is getting all this, and i see what looks like stars that flash blue, red, green, and they move,  i  would take a picture of something moving that looked like a drone but the picture would just look like an orb. i moved in here in september and more and more seemed to be happening as time went by.  i get up for work at 0400 and she usually gets up as well, and occasionally she would go out at that time to take pictures, however, this day she was in the house, noticed the light and just began taking a series of pics as she walked to the front window.(it seems that way with the pics as  they move a little closer in each time.  this scared her, and she told me nothing about  it for a few days which would be her usual, and then just showed me the pictures, didn’t really want to talk about it.  she is agreeable that i send these pictures to u. she would like some one to verify what it could be.  this happened  january

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On march 17, 2016, while at home, i opened an app that i had downloaded on my ipad called iss hd live.  it’s an app that allows the viewer to see a live feed broadcast from the international space station, and i enjoy the app as background entertainment while i do work online.  this day i opened the app and instead of the usual view of earth from orbit, i was greeted by two views of the sun, apparently being observed from the iss.  it was a split screen, on the left side was a filtered view of the sun and on the right side was a zoomed in view of the same scene.  they were labeled “macro view” on the left and “micro view” on the right.\r\n\r\nto my astonishment i observed two very bright objects, like plasma or something, appear from the far right of the screen and move to the left toward the surface of the sun.  i watched them move to the sun and seem to land on it.  very quickly they began to swell to large balloon like objects as they seemingly drew plasma from the surface of the sun.  more lights appeared while this was happening and in the midst of them was a very distinct dark colored object that suddenly appeared near the sun and began to release blobs of plasma that followed the same behavior as the previous ones.  i began to take screen shots because i’m pretty familiar with sun activity and this didn’t seem like anything anyone has seen before. \r\n\r\nat first, i thought maybe this was a solar flare.  it resembles a flare in some ways, however, solar flares begin on the sun and these plasma like balls of light appeared from the right side of the screen and moved to the sun!  they also began as balls of light but grew to enormous proportions while apparently attached to the sun in groups that are arranged symmetrically, as you can see in the attached photos.  that isn’t a solar flare, so i thought maybe meteors.  i am pretty sure however that meteors do not hover.  also, the “plasma balloons” that were attached to the sun seemed to have an outline of some sort, dark like some sort of container, or force that was keeping the plasma together in an elongated sphere.\r\n\r\nthe biggest problem here with this being natural phenomena is the dark object seemingly controlling these plasma things.  the object is clearly visible in the attached photos.  one screen grab actually defines edges to this object, making it appear as a very large rectangle stood up on end.  for it to be as visible as it was, it must have been larger than the earth itself, based on its scale to the sun.  i was stunned at what i was seeing and i took 8 screenshots throughout this event.  only 8 because i was arguing logic with myself and in denial of what was happening, and happening live all over the world, at least to those watching the feed at that time.  i can not be the only one to witness this though i may be the only one who thought to screen grab it, i do not know.\r\n\r\nthe most dramatic event took place at the end of this event.  these plasma things attached to the sun blinked out all at once, and appeared again way less than a second later and had merged into one very bright and extremely large barred circle of i guess plasma.  it has to be many times bigger than the entire earth.  this is also visible in the attached photos.  the feed ended at this point and went to a blue screen.  this was a live video feed, so it’s likley that the iss has a copy of this footage somewhere.\r\n\r\ni sat on these photos for over a year because i simply had no idea what to do with them.  and i was sure i would find a natural explanation for all this.  i’ve found none.  i didn’t want to put these out there and find out they are explainable, i’d feel silly!  so i’ve tried and tried to find out what this could be, and really there is no known phenomena that takes the characteristics described above.  so now i’ll give them to you guys.  please at some point if possible at all, get in touch with me via email address i provided and tell me this  is a natural phenomena or something so i can rest my mind on this!  but i don’t think it’s natural at all.\r\n\r\nthank you for considering this report,\r\npaul meyers ","distance":"Over One

Queensland","country":"Australia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"   the event happened while i was living in a small converted garage with a friend. i was backpacking around australia. there was no glazing in the property (tropical climate), only mosquito screens on window openings throughout. the main entrance was an existing garage door, therefore large and facing the road which was about 20m away. this opening was netted also and had a wooden frame with a normal door size opening to enter,within it. opposite this opening, against the far wall, was my single bed. it had a window (netted) over the bedhead facing the other direction. behind the house was forested swampland with no properties. \r\n   on the other side of the road was a forested mountain; mount mackay national park and as such there were also no properties in the view from the entrance. this mountain was regarded by me as somewhere between a hill and a mountain. it is completely undeveloped with dense and tropical rainforest cover. \r\n   on the evening in question, i got into bed to go to sleep. it was probably around 9pm to 10pm and dark as sunset was around 6pm. my friend had also retired for the evening. all lights were off and it was totally dark. there were no streetlights or any man made lighting to be seen in this location at the time (quite remote). i remember it being a clear evening, no wind and in the mid 20's degrees celsius, i estimate. \r\n   normally i sleep without problems of any sort but after what must have been an hour of tossing and turning in bed, i found myself asking the question, \"what's wrong?\" it soon dawned on me that the reason i could not fall asleep was because i was afraid! i remember distinctly feeling that this realisation startled me into full alertness. i realised that i had the distinct feeling of being watched!\r\n   i immediately sat up in bed and peered through the mosquito mesh through the window behind me. as it is low lying wooded swampland in that direction, i couldn't see a thing, there was nothing but total blackness. after reassuring myself that i was being \"silly\" i turned back and as i was lying down again looked out of the entrance/ garage door opening opposite and i could clearly see mount mackay, silhouetted against the night sky. it was really rather bright in this direction. i saw a lone star above the mountain and to the right and thought, \"wow, that's a bright star!\" then it dawned on me that it was way too bright to be a star. it was illuminating the hillside forest and i estimate that it had a similar intensity to a full moon. it was however smaller than a full moon. looking back, its actual size was difficult to gauge. as i said, it was like a very bright and very large star. it was close to the ground, a few hundred meters maybe, again it's hard to give a good estimate for something without features or sound. \r\n   then i remember that i said to myself, \"that's not a star, that's a u.F...\" to my astonishment, and before i could finish the sentence, the object immediately moved to the left and down, in the path that i would describe like if you roll a coin off of a table, a parabolic arched path maybe?!It did not seem to accelerate but moved from a standstill and kept a constant speed. the timing of my realisation and its starting to move out of sight was the most alarming thing about it. to this day i am convinced this was not a coincidence, but rather it had been monitoring me and my thoughts. that may sound like paranoia. regardless, i genuinely believe this fact, and given the very real fear i had experienced beforehand, point logically to the possibility of this.\r\nthe object disappeared behind the ridge of the mountain which i estimate to be 1 or 2 km away. i took about 1 second to move from a standstill to being out of sight. i looked for just a few seconds waiting for it to reappear but it didn't. i then went to sleep, without any problem, the feeling of being watched had gone! \r\nlooking back, i am surprised i did not question it; wait longer for it to reappear; search its possible landing site the next day, etc.\r\n   later that year, while picking grapes as seasonal work, i went to the library and found a book on ufo sightings in australia. i read it and it discussed finding swamp-weed cicles (like crop circles) in the swamps around the tully area! tully, queensland was approx 5km from the location of this incident. it may have been the book; alien honeycomb: the first solid evidence of ufos by john pinkney and leonard ryzman as i read this book around that time in australia, though not 100% certain. i remember this passing explanation in the book for reasons obvious.\r\n   this is not the only ufo sighting i have had, but i think it was an encounter of the \"second kind\" and as such, felt it worth documenting for research purposes. i hope it is of some use. i have attempted to  make a photo-montage rendering using google earth showing the exact location, and it is attached. this is a very close approximation of what i experienced showing the objects position before it moved.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\nds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,
