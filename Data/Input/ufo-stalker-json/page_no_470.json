then dissappeared. then that disc after 15 minutes, came shooting across the sky just above the buildings in a north east direction. the first disc continued to move south east disappearing and re-appearing as planes went by. afterwards both just vanished from the sky. i felt a strange feeling as i watched the disc, almost as if it knew i was watching. i felt calm, even when the second disc shot across above the buildings. i did not think it was a ufo at first, but as i stared i could see the disc spinning as it hovered. it was a bright and clear day.","distance":"101-500

thought it was a helicopter but it was too quiet and too high up in the sky. there was no noise what so ever. no flashing lights, just a bright light. small as a star per-say. this thing or object was small like a star and bright. it was noticeable for me too see without my glasses on, and it moved slow, and was by its self. it kept a constant speed for quite some time. then while i was watching it, my eyes kind of shifted and i couldn't find it anymore. when i couldn't find it, i felt weird, not sure on what i saw in the night sky. i was outside for about 5 minuets or so, just feeling

and i was afraid. i started to yell something. i think i was yelling something about the plane about to hit the trees. i thought it was going to hit my poplar trees. they are about 80 feet high. but before it hit it abruptly slowed down and maneuvered away from the trees with perfect agility. and then ascended back up into the sky. it was very quiet. the wind that day had been louder than the \"plane\" then about 20 minutes later i wanted to go out and see if there were anymore low flying planes. then not more than 1 or 2 minutes past and another plane quietly and slowly flew by me at like 25 mph and was about 15 feet off the ground i think i could have touched it if i were directly under it. and it made a strange sound like air being compressed and released.  then this one too flew back up over the trees and back into the sky .They both looked like a cigar shape. they had two wings on either side with what looked to be turbine type engines underneath, one on each side. i saw no windows. it was about 50 to 60 feet in length much larger than our average crop dusting plane and much quieter as well. they were both a dull grey with no writing anywhere. my first reaction was very upset i thought military guys were messing around my house. i called my husband home from work i was so upset. he told me it was impossible for them to be so quiet and move the way i was describing and i realized i may have seen a ufo. i have been looking on the internet for a similar \"plane\" and cannot find one. i hope you may be able to help me understand what i saw. thank
