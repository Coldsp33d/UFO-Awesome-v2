States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At the time of this event , i lived in an apartment building which is perched on a hill in the northwestern portion of the bronx along the hudson river. i was laying in a bunkbed, so to view the window i would have to look slightly down. i don't remember what woke me up or why. i do remember seeing a light pass by my window. being very curious i got up thinking it would be a helicopter, some of which have flown through my area with searchlights or merely in passing on their way up the hudson river. my window faces east. from my vantage point it is possible to see most of the bronx, and as far as long island and queens. it is important to note that my apartment gives excellent views of flight paths from both jfk and laguardia airports, as well as views of planes going north onto connecticut or boston, or southwest toward newark and teterboro. but at this particular time of day, about 2:30am, there weren't any other aircraft that were visible. \r\n\r\nit was slightly overcast, with some wind. clouds were at a high altitude. \r\n\r\nafter i leave my bed to see what was the source of the light coming through my blinds, i see the object at just about at the same altitude of my 10th floor window, or approximately 150 - 200 feet off the ground to account for being on top of a hill. it was not moving very quickly.  at first the object appeared to be round but as it continued its oval flight path and came toward my window it had the appearance of a slightly stretched egg on its side being slightly thicker on the leading edge. i would not call it a teardrop because it did not taper into a point. it was clearly rounded. by my estimations it appeared to be about 15 - 20  feet long, definitely shorter than some single engine propeller planes that i have seen. the object must have been approximately 200 - 300ft from my window at its closest. it appeared to be solid as it maintained a rigid shape the entire time i viewed it. however i could not see what material it was made of because the whole object was glowing a fluorescent white. i would not say it was radiating light because later when it descended it did not reflect off the surrounding trees or buildings. there were no external lights and no distinct markings or structural shapes that i could discern. it was also completely silent as far as i could tell. \r\n\r\nthe object was north-northeast of me when i first saw it. it was moving counter clockwise. the diameter of its oval path when i first saw it must've been about 1 miles north to south and about half a mile from east to west., with the center axis being slightly north of my viewing angle. i watch the object make 2 full rotations along this path. its movements were steady, it did not seem to bobble or sway in anyway.  its rate of speed was also pretty constant during the whole siting but was noticeably slower by the last rotation. each rotation took less than 10 minutes to complete. it appeared to me that each rotations was becoming more rounded and smaller in diameter.  it also appeared as though the center of rotation had moved slightly more east. since it was not radiating light, the light that i saw through my window might have been the object passing by very closely. the area the object was flying over is all residential homes and small businesses. i considered it a very boring neighborhood. there are a few schools in the area. there's a shopping center directly down the hill from me on a pretty major street. that was pretty much it. i think this is important to note: toward the most southernly point of the object's oval path are the official residences of un russian diplomats. i am not pointing out a connection but simply mentioning the coincidence. \r\n\r\ni am watching the object on its 3rd time around, if i'm using its furthest north position as a reference, it stops about 3/4th of the way through without decelerating or adjusting its hover. it had stopped pretty much directly east of me. the area it stopped over is the western portion of van cortlandt park in an area that is near or behind a baseball field i used to frequent. it is just under a mile away from where i live. after about 20 seconds of hovering it descends at a constant rate of speed until it is out of sight, probably hidden by trees. again, the light was not reflecting off any nearby objects. there are buildings within a few yards of where i saw the object descend. \r\n\r\nthe shape and path of the object had me convinced it was not a helicopter, but when i saw it land was when it really alarmed me. this is post-9/11 new york city. there are strict air traffic rules. aircraft do not land anywhere but airports and helipads. this is the moment i started questioning what this object was. \r\n\r\nit remains on the ground for about 5 minutes at which point i see it ascend to a slightly higher altitude and then changing direction towards the north east, still ascending as it is moving away. i lose sight of it probably about 5 miles away through the clouds as it was heading toward mount vernon. i can see it move through the clouds as it begins to disappear. \r\n\r\nthe whole siting lasted just over half an hour. \r\n\r\ni remained awake for another hour to see if it will return. i regret not having gone to find the site it landed in immediately after the siting. i've been to the area since but have not seen anything out of the ordinary except a few deer. it took me quite a while to conclude that what i saw might have been extraterrestrial. until then i didn't even really know that much about the ufo phenomena. it was a life changing experience that has expanded my perception of reality and its possibilities. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path

shinning chrome object descend into a weird cloud formation about 4 times right before it completely vanished. each time it started from the same higher elevation and then descended downward right. at first glance it seemed just triangular. however, further focusing made me realize the shape was triangular on top and circular on botton. the encounter itself lasted about 30-45 minutes. after it ended i began to divert my attention elsewhere when i realized that the formation of the clouds were astonishing as well. the cloud formation at the time had me puzzled. unfortunately i had no camera so i drew it out. there were two clouds that had me trying to connect the dots. the first was a simple outline of a bird sitting. maybe a dove? the shape was perfect. the second was even more puzzling. it seemed to be the shape of an arrow with a flame shaped base or the shape of a modern day rocketship. as an amateur stargazer, i am always gazing up night or day as the sky has a story to tell. it is also known that the planet neburu (the apprrent planet that will be earth's fate) that is behind the sun should now be visible as of 4/17/2016. is it coincidence that i encounter this phenomenon the day after? is it also related to the orange light that faded and the white light that faded in the night sky both about a week ago? this was both astonishing and intriguing to me. my thesis: i believe all are related and it is a message that the beginning of whatever is coming (good or bad) has started or it has already begun for some time now. whatever the answer, the beauty of the universe (night or day) will always catch my eye and take my breath away. as most will become frightended, i will remain the \"intrigued stargazer\" continually searching for answers and i look forward to what lies ahead. if anyone saw what i did, any explainations?","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia","flightPath":"Hovering

the color it was very white with a very slight hint of amber to it. which could easily be atmospheric conditions or a little color aberration to the binoculars lens looking at a bright object. i watched it move from the west to the east as if to glide as it crossed the salt lake valley. so i seen part of the front and the side the whole time and the rear of it as it left? this to me sounds funny to say because this thing is round. it went southeast as far as celestial north and south is measured. disappearing from view as it went over the mountains east of draper city. it was high enough to clear the mountain range by 2 to 3 thousand feet? it was round and well lit, moved a little slower than the jets heading towards the salt lake international airport. it moved slow and steady, glide like, straight line, same constant altitude. the light of it never wavered, a steady same brightness to it. bright as jupiter is in the night sky and larger in appearance. i heard no sound from it, to be fair, it was not that close. yet i would say if it were a conventional aircraft i would normally hear one at that distance. time was exactly 8:47 pm as it was over half way across

paranormal, but did some reading and realised the second was definitely an unidentified flying object of some kind.\r\nmy late husband and i went to our favorite beauty spot on the cliffs at botallack, nr st just in cornwall, uk. it was dinner time and we had bought fish and chips to eat in our old mg car out on the cliffs. i believe it was 23rd october 1992/93 at about 6pm. it was a beautiful evening and we were the only people parked there. as we looked out at the view of the cliffs, old tin mines and the atlantic ocean crashing in, we suddenly noticed somebody walking up the cliff path..... i have to say we both were a bit confused as walking up the cliffs was an olden times smuggler from the 1700/1800's period. (the best way to describe this is if you google 'poldark', that is the era.) what we could see was a man, in a black tri-star hat, long black old smuggler type coat, a long wooden staff in his left hand and a small barrel/ keg under his right arm. we both looked at each other and then back to him walking up the coast path. both confused at what we were looking at, i said to my husband, \"maybe there is a party somewhere?\" if you knew the location you would know that was at the best a long shot! we continued to watch this 'person' walk up the path as he reached the adjoining path he was suddenly gone! into thin air! we did not lose sight of him at any time..... and then he was gone! all i can tell you is that what we saw was as solid, as solid as you and i, although neither of us remember seeing features on a face, or to be honest, even a face. we knew that what we had just seen was unexplainable and couldn't get our minds around it.... it wasn't until we were driving home that i said, \"did we just see a ghost?\" now i aren't saying that is what we saw, but we have no explanation. i tell you this, as i believe that it must have some kind of connection to the following event.\r\nabout a week later, there was a big storm blowing with really strong gale force 'inland' winds. the sea was crashing in and the wind was too strong to get out of the car as you couldn't stand. we were sat in our car when we noticed behind us a white ball, approx 7 to 8 inches. you could see it was spinning furiously but it was not causing it to move in the slightest. it was approx 15 feet away from us and 6 feet off of the ground. the strangest thing was, that the gale force inland wind was not making it move at all, yet we couldn't even stand up in it! the 'ball'didn't move for about 2 minutes, then it slowly moved directly upwards by about 4 feet, again it hovered on the spot for several minutes before moving directly down again by 3 of 4 feet where again it hovered for a time. it then rose in to the air by approx 8 feet, again directly in a straight line and totally uneffected by the wind. it hovered for about 3 minutes before shooting inland at a 90 degree angle and out of sight. to be honest, we were shocked and just sat silently in the car. i think after what had happened the previous week, we thought it must be 'ghost' connected?......  for years the memory of what happened has never left us and i can still see the events in detail. i've tried to look for answers but can't find any. i only realised recently that 'the ball' was an unidentified flying object of some sort. so i have decided to record this with yourselves.\r\nthe whole of cornwall is built on granite and so is extremely quartz rich. i often questioned myself as to if there could have been some kind of portal open up? i hope that this piece of my jigsaw might fit somewhere in all the other events out there. thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":75940,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.12448699999999,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-04192016-0012","longitude":-5.679195,"occurred":751401000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1461076963000,"summary":"Fast spinning, intelligent like sphere.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8213,"locationName":"Saint Just, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:80289"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82750,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":471}
