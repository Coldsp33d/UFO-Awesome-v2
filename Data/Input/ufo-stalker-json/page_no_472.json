down the stairs to the driveway i looked up at the night sky to view the stars as i usually do by habit. \r\n\r\nimmediately i take notice of a intensely glowing white object in the sky to the west / south west and right away there after i see an airplane higher in altitude travelling due north with it's signal lights blinking. \r\n\r\nas quickly as i could (perhaps 10-12 seconds) i took out my cell phone and began videoing the sighting. granted it took me a moment to keep a steady hand and capture as much as i could before i lost the angle to view it as it passed to the east behind my neighbors roof top where i no longer could view it.  \r\n\r\nthe stars were visible yet not even close to the brightness illuminating from this object as it traveled at a faster rate of speed compared to the two airplanes that flew at higher altitude in proximity. the stars would faint in the background, as were the airplanes.\r\n\r\nthere was no blinking of lights, nor sound as it traveled by. i would estimate the object was 2-3 miles in the sky with the airplanes being just above around 3-4 miles and possibly climbing. \r\n\r\neven with jupiter and another star clearly visible in the direction of the moon, this object was as bright as the moon itself on a much smaller scale of size. \r\n\r\nlastly, the object tended to appear \"blurry\" at times, coming in and out of focus of my own eyes. i was wearing my glasses at the time, yet still was hard to focus on. i wear a light prescription.\r\n\r\nthe video is 2 min 20 secs in length. i believe the entire viewing took place in well under 3 minutes. this version posted is a lower quality due to converting it in order to upload to the site. the original video is 286 mb. compared to the 21 mb version i'm submitting.

november 25 2015, i returned home from work and thought i would head out back on my property for a quick hunt for doves. i live in the country so i have access to adjacent farm land. the time i headed out was about 3:30 pm. i walked the fence line and about 10 min. later i was able to shoot a dove from the tree top and it fell into some shrubs. when i tried to fine it all i could hear was the shrieking of a wounded bird until it went silent. i dont give up easily on downed game but it was apperent that it was going to be difficult to find since it fell wounded. time was short so i headed north along the tree lined fence about 15 more min. until i shot another dove, but this one dropped in a puff of feathers and thought it should be easy to find. i then searched the ground for about 15 more min., untill i was able to find it. i new that i had to find it because there was no more time for another i did not want to lose another bird. thats when a normal day was about to change for me. at about 4:50 pm i was walking south again in the same direction in which i came but about 25 yards west of the same tree lined fence. i spotted a large black triangle emediately above the trees moving towards me at a slow rate of speed. my first reaction was that this was an ultralight aircraft. then i thought that since it was getting late he is probably using the fence line for navagation referance and is running very late. the weather was very good for this time of year and may have been why he was out, so i thought. with almost no wind and about 16c. since it was heading almost straight for me and just above the tree tops i decided not to walk directly under its path since i may scare the person with me holding a shotgun in complete comoflauge clothing. i would instead stay put untill it passes by. as it began to peer through the trees and getting near i was amazed that it was not emmiting that loud roar of a small engine. it also was not revealling any type of wing span. the sky was still clear although the sun was setting quickly. the object had no lights and that was my next thought. where was this thing heading and what the heck is it. i was still thinking that someone was at the controls in either a crouch position or a ski position and i was in complete disbelief when it finnaly broke out from the trees. it apearred to be a human from a distance but then i saw no shoulders a elongated head that had the shape of a street light, it was about 6 ft. tall and very slender. the entire body was black but i could not make out any facial features accept that the face colour was grey. it almost appeared like a sordsman suit in the fenncing sport inand  black with a grey mask. as soon as i saw that this was not a human form i reached for my cell phone to take a picture but this took more than a couple of seconds since i carry it in my sunglass  pouch and had my gun in my hand. when i took my phone out i turned it on at the same time i was watching the object when the figure on top vanished completly. i yelled wtf.And turned on the camera function, taking my eye off it for a second it appeared to rotate then back again still travelling at the same speed and direction staight as an arrow with no wobble whatsoever. when i brought my phone up i could see that it now had an l shape to it and i had only a breif chance to at least get a glimps of it but all i got was the trees and  sunset, i moved my phone in a frenzy but it was frozen and would not respond to any function the image was not present in the screen and i just ran to the fence about 20 yards and watched it traval north untill it faded into the dark forest to the north. sunset made it dificult to see and i then looked down at my phone to see if it was working and took 2 pictures of my feet so it apeared to be fine at this point. i walked blackwards for about 20 yards not knowing what to think accept that whatever it was it did not want to be photograghed, thats just what i believed anyway. then i walked home through the open field and at a great distance to the east i saw a sharp beam of light shoot sraight down through the cloud cover to the ground and i could only wonder if was just a coicidence. i am 54 years old\r\n and have been hunting most of my life and for many years on my property and have never seen anything like this before.","distance":"21-100

dropped down out of the pass and started across the small valley we noticed something stretched across the road. as we came within about half a mile from the object we discussed what we each thought it looked like. i said \"it looks like a big piece of plastic or a parachute because the edges of the object were kind of fluttering around on the edges, but it can't be because it's standing about 20 feet high off the road.\" it also had a white light that was either coming from behind or from inside of the object. i didn't see any direct light, it seemed to be all indirect. we continued to drive toward the object. when we reached a distance of about 100 yards my friend slowed down and stopped the car. just as we opened the doors, the object changed shape! it quickly changed into a cone shape the white light brightened and then streaked straight up with a popping sound scattering dirt and rocks out from the area. the craft left our sight almost instantly and didn't return. both of my

what satellites look like and also very familiar with what planes and helicopters look like in the night sky, what their flight patterns are and at what general altitude they fly at. i was outside sometime around 10pm having a smoke. i was looking up at the sky when i saw a satellite. i watched it float over my house traveling quickly south to north. i took another couple pulls on my pipe, was about to head in when i looked up to the sky one more time and saw a bright light, traveling slower than the satellite, about half the speed, going from north west to the south east. i noticed it had no blinking lights and no sound. it looked almost just like a satellite but roughly 6 times larger and brighter. almost as if you were watching the star sirius fly over. i wasn't making too much of it but it was peculiar enough i stayed outside and watched it fly over. as it got further away, the neighbors tree started to obstruct my view so i walked over to the other side of my lawn. as i was

Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My friend likes to smoke cigarettes and i don't so i just stand with him outside when he does. just an ordinary night and we like to look up in the sky especially after dark and talk about space/observe the visible planets/moons. tonight less than an hour ago starting about 2:30 am we both witnessed a upside down diamond shaped craft we both could not explain. we are both aircraft enthusiast and pondered for over an hour on what the craft could be. i even had time to go inside and get my binoculars so we could get a better view. this thing was amazing, it appear in the west out over the ocean with 4 spotlights pointing down under the craft that had an aura like glow to them while it blinked a plasma or laser like green. we could immediately distinguish this craft from the many airplanes that take off from the local airport and fly out over the ocean because this one blinked a bright green light almost like a laser, then a softer brighter white then normal planes, then a deep red laser type red. this thing just hovered for over 20 minutes in place! i ran inside, got my binoculars and we were just observing it when it started hovering very slowly up and down the coast almost searching. at first we thought it could be a spy plane, or advanced drone or craft our military could be testing. we still have no evidence to prove it wasn't, it might be but at this moment i cannot make any assumptions. it seemed to fade out and what i mean by this is when we saw it first, it was small. about double the size of a 747 at 10,000 feet. it then traveled north up the coast and disappeared, reappearing about 10 minutes later from when it had initially started moving. this time it was the same distance out over the ocean from us but it had grown 3-4 times the size. it was as if the first one was a drone and this second encounter was the drone command vessel or carrier type craft it was enormous! it then ascended and descended many times in a weird pattern before sinking to a hover right above the treeline. there was no sound for the first encounter and no sound for the second encounter until after it had went up and down and sank to a hover that's when a really weird jet type hum was heard at a super low frequency. right when i heard it i asked my friend if he had heard it to, as it continued for about 15 seconds. he did and said he had never heard any type of aircraft make that sound before. it then slowly at almost a crawl speed hovered as it made its way down the coast, this is where the fading in and out came into play. this thing went from enormous to the size of the first encounter within seconds! a circle in the middle of the craft immediately became black and everything outside of that circle just faded in transparency until it was no longer observable, it did this a couple of times then returned back to its original huge visible form. after traveling south down the coast it disappeared behind some trees but within 20 minutes it had returned slowly floating back up the coast again to its original spot where we first encountered it. it was amazing because in the amount of time it was there about 3-5 planes flew in the general vicinity of this craft almost as if they were looking for it or didn't even see it and it just slowly sank to a hover barely above the treeline and went the opposite direction of the planes. the first two planes that we observed almost chasing it were the size and shape of a concord jet, these planes we very fast and flew north to south twice one by one. eventually the craft just disappeared, but that wasn't it. in the same place where the craft appeared there was now a bright star shaped object that was glowing yellow and even through binoculars we could only see a yellow ball shaped object glowing a plasma yellow color. this object remained in the sky almost the same size for only a couple minutes then was gone. a little higher in the sky above these encounters, about a half hour later was a bright light blue/white object that looked almost like a star. when it appeared it was a very deep almost teal blue and eventually turned into a light blue then into a white/blue flicker. this disappeared around 3:15 in the morning. we observed these things for over an hour and went over every possible plane or craft that it could of been/every celestial object/or weird phenomena we have heard about our entire lives. i have never witnessed anything like this, i was not scared but excited. my friend was deeply scared but not admitting it besides the constant reference to the world being ended by lasers or bombs and how they could possibly go to war with us. in the end we both agreed it was nothing we had ever heard about besides in science fiction or the x files and the technology demonstrated was beyond anything either of us had seen any military use. we really are not alone and before tonight i only had this theory based on my vast knowledge and love for science/space time. i have physically seen and heard the evidence and will even testify in court as will my friend who witnessed it with me. you can lie detector me, you can claim my accounts were false, you can make me look crazy, or even go so far as to ruin my life. just know that till the day that i die i am a man of my word and i have witnessed something i could only explain based on my knowledge of science fiction. we have very advanced technology in use around our planet and in this solar system, i don't know where they are from. i don't know who or what they are. i don't even know if its a military black ops project. all i know is i saw a craft i had never seen before, it displayed advanced hovering and speed maneuvers, it was pulsing and blinking lights i had never seen a aircraft use, it could fade transparency of huge parts of its ship making it go partly invisible or even entirely invisible, the planes flying around it seemed to not know of its existence flying directly in its path, and i'm pretty sure it exited the atmosphere in a yellow plasma glow when it left and then turned into the color or a degenerate dwarf star(blue) as it traveled wherever it was going before it faded from visibility. whatever it was it was way more advanced than me or my friend had ever seen, we are aircraft enthusiast and this blew our minds. i apologize for not getting a picture but it was really dark and i can not afford a good enough night vision or inferred camera to capture the images. i would have loved to see if thermal energy could be picked up on this craft though! when i get a good enough camera i will post pictures but until then i can only upload pictures of crafts with the same shape. i am not considering the craft i post pictures of to be real or fake, i don't know and i didn't see them i am only posting the pictures for reference of the exact type shape of what i truly saw tonight. again we will testify in court if we are asked to, as to what we have see tonight i can only describe to help understand what exactly was hovering up and down the southern california coast at approximately 3 am 04/18/2016. until i have encountered something else or have documented photographs i will not be posting anything to leave space for other actual encounters, i hope everybody else takes the caution and respect i do to this site so we can better understand what is truly happening in our skies. don't be afraid to look up, educate yourself and stay up to date on current propulsion technology so you are credible. if you can afford or save up to buy a decent infrared or night vision camera do it, every night while we sleep things are happening above us and it might be a threat but how are we suppose to even find out what these things are so we can assess them if the true accounts are buried or discredited. if this was a government black ops project, please release this to the public! this technology will save millions possibly even billions of lives and place our species among the stars where we truly belong. you are only hurting yourself and holding your species down if you are hiding whatever it was we observed tonight. divided we will fall, but together we will rise!
