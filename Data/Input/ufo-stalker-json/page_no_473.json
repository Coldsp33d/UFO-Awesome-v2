behind a cloud. next it came out of the cloud with another white/bright line/cigar shaped object. both objects where heading south. the second object changed from cigar-shaped to circular. then another object appeared as a fireball or asteroid shaped object with a trail of flames. in an instant it stopped its path. at the same time the first object seemed to change into an oval shape. now all three objects appeared oval shaped. they stopped as if to communicate and the first and third object headed north/northwest. the second traveled south/southeast as it changed back into a

i assumed it was simply a satellite especially since it was exhibiting a constant flashing sequence, unlike other stars. i ruled out it being a plane because of its speed relative to the apparent distance of the object from the ground, much too slow for a plane, very plausible for a satellite. moreover, while it was flashing, as planes do, there were no indications of red light that characterizes plane flashing and it was flashing at a much faster frequency than a plane, which flashes ever few seconds. this object seemed to be flashing constantly, with no intervals between flashes. now at some point, the star was about to cross over the sky above my neighbour's house across the street and over the street to its right side. at that point, it stopped. what had appeared to be a satellite flying at extremely fast speeds simply stopped mid-air with absolutely no slowing of speed beforehand. it remained this way for about five seconds and then proceeded to start moving in the opposite direction from where it came from, in a northwesterly direction. throughout this entire time, my family had been slowly and reluctantly getting out of the car after having fallen asleep in it. my mom was arguing with my whiny ten year old brother for him to get out. my heart rate at this point had no doubt started to climb, and i alerted my mom, telling her that this star had just changed direction and asking her if it was a satellite. however, she was preoccupied with my brother. she finally managed to get him out of the car and went inside the house with him and the rest of my family, leaving me alone standing in my driveway at that point. i continued to observe the star as it crossed the sky under the moon. as it crossed under the moon, which was above the left side neighbour of the house across the street i have mentioned (i will include a picture of this setting below) i became once more conscious of how bright the object was, as it was now crossing sky above a part of my neighbourhood with street lamps where most stars are drowned out. i even considered the possibility of it being a small meteor for a bit, however that seemed unreasonable; nothing could explain the hovering and direction shift. at this point i was feeling intense emotion, overwhelmed and the tightness in one's chest during tense moments. i heard my mom call out my name from the front door, asking me if i was coming in because she wanted to lock the door and yelling out that it's not a ufo. i mumbled some incoherent response, not really answering her question seeing as the object was now entering the sky behind the pine tree in my right side neighbour's front yard and not wanting to lose track of it. i noticed at this point that it must've been getting farther and farther away seeing that its brightness was slowly diminishing and it was slowly reduced to the size of a regular star, all the while, however, still flashing. i saw that it was to reach the tree line soon and was also nearing the neighbour's house. it was reduced to a flicker as it crept behind the house and i lost sight of it at last. i was feeling wide awake and alert, so i tried going through the gate to my backyard to see whether it would reappear on the other side of the house but i knew it was no use and resigned myself to going inside. this ended my experience and i began wondering how on earth i was supposed to go to sleep after that. the photos i will include below do not all include the object in question. i will include a photo i took 5 minutes after the one including the star (which was bright enough to be actually visible to my iphone camera contrary to most stars). the photo shows the setting i have described in detail here, with the house across the street, the house next to it on it's right, and the moon. the star visible in this photo is not the star in question but simply another bright star. the other photo i will include is directly to my right, above the street that separates the two houses across the street and the neighbour with the pine tree and where the object disappeared behind. the star is visible yet faint, so i have circled it out.

car in the late afternoon and had not set yet. i remember saying something like it was neat at which my mother got mad at me an said there was nothing neat about it. she said she had told my father to get off the highway and go to a police station. my father stated that he had no plans to pull over and stop at a police station. if he did what would he say. they would think i was drunk of out of my mind. i asked how long has it been following us. my mother said too long but my sister said about 15 minutes. i said wow and was told to shut up by both my parents. as i looked out at the disc it seemed smaller. at that point it did not go higher, it just pulled away. about 10 seconds later it was gone. no one talked about the rest of the way home.\r\nthe next morning at breakfast i said i could not wait for show and tell at school to tell everyone what happened. to my surprise my parents told me i should not talk about it and as far as they were concerned it was just some new type of airplane.  even at almost 7 years old i was already into planes ( i eventually became a pilot) and was putting together model planes. this object had no wings no propeller or jet engine. well i told my story at school and was laughed at and my teacher told me i had a good imagination. \r\nas i said this was my first siting with more as the years went by.","distance":"101-500

that i would go outside and look up in the usual place in the sky.  at first i saw a green meteor like object zipping in a south-west direction.  this led my eyes to what looked like a triangular constellation.  the three star-like points of light then rotated around a second or two, but keeping the original triangular shape.  after that, they left formation, one flew closer to the other, but then all 3 went off in different directions. \r\n\r\ni see ufos at least on a monthly basis and often weekly, or twice a week, and the other most recent sighting was of an object that was not more than 500ft above the ground and spinning off what i guess to be plasma, which arced away from the craft like a solar flare; this sighting was about a week ago.  i also get telepathic communications with humans and ets very frequently. you can tell for sure when they're for-sure humans when they're very rude, while the ets are polite and friendly. often, i will be asked before seeing a ufo if i would like to see one outside, usually very late at night.  please note that the image i uploaded was from one of my first ufo sightings, not this most recent one, and was taken with an older digital camera... this picture was taken around about the time that i got interested in reading about cold fusion, and trying to spread the word about it.\r\n\r\nif you would like, you might be able to set up instruments to see what you can find out about them.  i definitely have an implant for telepathic communications, and there are some childhood memories of mine that might point to alien contact when i was young.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

garage and faced to the west- i used my phone app and saw that the object was approximately 250 degrees west in the sky. once i located it with my binoculars i could see that it was flashing red, blue, and green lights inside an area of white light. it basically hovered- i saw a red light from a plane pass nearby and it helped to show that the object must have been large but how large i don't know. decided to go and get my son's telescope and after having a little difficulty locating it, i had a good view of a sphere shaped object that was flashing red , blue , and green on the inside. i watched it for about an hour and then it vanished from my sight about 11:00pm. i took a picture and a video with my iphone, but they didn't show what i actually saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
