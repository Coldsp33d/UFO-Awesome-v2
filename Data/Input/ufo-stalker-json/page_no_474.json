wasn't growing like even if i just couldn't see the planes reflection and there was a plane. it would have had to be hovering there. it was like a cigar shaped white chemtrial not growing without a

the stance sight but i could clearly see the planes reflection in front of its chemtrail wi h was growing and obviously was a plane leaving a trail in the sky. totally different than the object to the

electric on the car would move, when i tried to start it the battery was dead this is why call the tow truck i spotted the  ufo soon after  the tow truck arrived. i had seen ufos since i was a teenager so the first thing i thought was here is another ufo  the object was moonlight white once it started to move to the west there seem to be a blackness at the very top blacker than black put me in mind of a black hole  i called out to the tow truck driver \"hey dude look as i pointed to the sky it's a ufo he look upwards but by the time he looked up the ufo had gone behind a cloud ... three seconds later 2f-16 fighter jets came buzzing pass following the same trajectory as the ufo it passed right by  the ufo but  it was behind the cloud i must also note the cloud that the ufo  was hiding behind was the only cloud in the sky i didn't see the ufo anymore it never came from behind the clouds but it was apparent the f-16s was searching for the craft that i had just observed while the tow truck driver didn't see the ufo  he commented that the hair on his arm was standing up because i had just pointed and motion with my finger the path the ufo had taken when the f-16  almost simultaneously followed a trajectory that mimic the motion i was making with my finger.\r\n something happened the night before i had watch the movie starman i know that seen the movie before but for some reason it made a heavy impact that time\r\n while i was in the shower that morning i was singing a song about the star man i don't believe in coincidence i feel in my soul that the two events are connected somehow and i was meant to be in that parking lot that morning because there was no reason for my call to behave the way it did\r\ni  think it's important that i note the mechanics report about my car the battery was completely drained for a unexplainable reason the mechanic said that he'd never seen anything like that with a new battery  and the battery was new the car was new electronically the car has not been the same sense  it would turn off after i would start the car and a countdown would come on the display three minutes and when it reached zero i could start the car

a ride on rt. 460 on a sunny and warm day, leaving richmond and traveling west. after an hour or so, we began to return to richmond on the same highway, now traveling east. i was in passenger seat and we chatted as my friend drove. i noticed the sun through the windshield - it was up fairly high, almost touching/being framed by the top edge of the windshield on my side of the car. as we chatted, i noticed the sun seemed to be growing larger - gradually. we continued chatting while i took a glance at the sun every once in a while. it was definitely growing larger. my friend noticed also and we stopped chatting as our attention was now riveted on the sun. very gradually - maybe as long as 15 - 30 minutes it grew in size until it almost filled the top portion of our view through the windshield. the color changed from yellow (like the sun) to orange. the shape changed from round to oval - a very elongated oval. there was no sound and the object hovered in the sky. it was bright and gently glowing. there were no details of any kind on the shape - it was uniformly orange and softly glowing throughout. i said to my friend, \"what is that?\" and she responded \"i don't know\" we were mesmerized. i felt apprehension but not fear. the strangeness of it was compelling. there is missing time and missing memories because the next thing that i can recall is that the orb was gone and we were still in the car, driving, but almost back in richmond.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then
