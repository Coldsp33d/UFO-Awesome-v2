outside onto my back deck to look at the temperature gauge on my new bbq grill (i had just seasoned the grates) and closed up all of the vents on it before going to bed. the evening was clear of clouds and it was a mild 66 degrees (f). i turned and looked up at the night sky and the half-moon that seemed to be resting directly above my position, when i noticed coming from the southwest over top of my roof, along the same position as the moon directly overhead, was a multicolored light (i could distinctly see white, blue, red, yellow, and green sequences) much larger than a star or airplane light. the light appeared to be approximately 500 to 700 feet altitude and completely silent. the light remained lit and moved very slowly toward the moon’s position, so i believed that soon i would be seeing a silhouette of its body as it passed. instead, it moved just to the north of the moon’s position in the sky, and began to slow down, at times remaining completely still and at other times slowly moving along its course. then, as it moved along a steady pace, it began to blink out, turning on and off completely, as i was unable to fully see its presence at times. i pulled out my flashlight (i used a flashlight to see my temperature gauge so as not to draw bugs to my back deck light) and began flashing it on and off in the direction of the light—and it began to flash back at me! at times it flashed its light (soft light, but definitely multiple colored wavelengths) so brightly that it appeared as big as the bobbed head of a sewing-pin and perfectly round in shape—and much larger and brighter than venus or jupiter. it began to move slowly around until it had changed direction from 104º moving east to 124º southeast. \r\nafraid to lose sight of the light, i called for my boys to come witness what i was seeing (my wife was in bed asleep and i did not tell them what they were about to see). my youngest was in the shower, but my oldest son (15) came outside onto the deck and i demonstrated what direction i wanted him to look in. instantly he noticed the light and how it appeared to be flashing us back every time i flashed it with my flashlight. he, too, noticed that it was the color of the “rainbow” and that it was “bright and big.” then while we were watching the first blinking light, another light at equal altitude as the first came up from behind the first object, traveling 346º north at a speed somewhat faster and smoother than a small cessna plane. only this second object was completely white (soft white light, almost a vanilla color), silent, and as large as the first object (about the size of a sewing-pin head). it remained lit the entire time that we observed it (about a minute and a half) and had no other lights (flashing or otherwise) on it. while the second seemed to disappear to the north over some trees, we continued to observe the first flashing light and continued to flash my flashlight at its direction; insofar as it, too, continued to flash its light back at us the entire time, sometimes remaining off for a minute, only to burst with intensity as it flashed back at us. at times the light scintillated slowly and at other times very quickly. it, too, then began to continue on its course until it became difficult to see because of trees, due mostly to its distance from our position at that point (about a mile or so). the entire duration of time watching the flashing light (along with the interruption of the white light) lasted from 8:35 pm to 8:55 pm—a total of 20 minutes! \r\nmy second son (13) came to the back deck, and we all waited to see if anything else was going to take place. we waited for about 20 minutes, when suddenly the second lighted object returned from the north at 9:20 pm, traveling 116º southeast at approximately the same rate of speed as before. it remained an intense soft white color and had no flashing characteristics whatsoever. maintaining its speed, the light appeared to slowly change course directly over our position, traveling 90º east, where after about 4 seconds it instantly disappeared or “cloaked” as my oldest stated. i had witnessed the same soft white lighted object—same size, color, speed, and altitude—on april 7, 2016, at about 8:45 pm cst. and like this evening [april 14], it was traveling due north, but when two small-bodied airplanes approached its position from the southwest, it made an abrupt 90 degree angled turn east toward the capitol, only to disappear entirely after a few seconds. both of these lights, the flashing multicolored light in particular, gave the impression to me and my oldest son to have intelligence. my youngest, too, believed that the entire second event seemed “strange.”       \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at first contact\r\n-location:  north carolina i-40 east (estimated to be.                    between exit 355 and 364)\r\n\r\n•saw two flying objects in sky\r\n- [object 1] appeared to be a helicopter because of the lack of illumination from lights\r\n- [object 2] was close behing it and had brighter lights and a noticeable blinking light like a normal plane.\r\n\r\n•as i got closer i noticed object 1 didn't have a blinking light like most aircrafts do and had a red light on top where i thought was the tail of the helicopter.\r\n\r\n•object 2 was still identifiable as a fixed wing aircraft\r\n\r\n•i got closer underneath the two objects and noticed object 2 silhouette matched what i first anticipated it would be, a fixed wing aircraft. it's lights were located at the nose and both wing tips and we're very bright. presumed to be military as their aren't any commercial airports nearby for it to be so low to the ground. \r\n\r\n•object 2 was unidentifiable. it wasn't what i thought it was, that being a helicopter. it wasn't even identifiable as a privately owned aircraft like a propeller plane. the silhouette appeared to be triangular. from underneath, it had a bright light at its frontal point and two dimmer lights at the remaining rear points. all three lights much dimmer compared to object 2. the front light seemed to reflect the underside of the aircraft which emphasized its triangular shape. the red light was no longer visible, possibly being located on the top of the aircraft. \r\n\r\n•the objects were about as close as a closed fist held at arms length.\r\n\r\n•object 1 appeared as large as my finger tip if my arm was extended before me. object 2 was of similar size which surprised me as it appeared small due to dimness of lights.\r\n\r\n•lost sight of the aircrafts as they passed to the left-rear side of my vehicle. last seen moving in a northeastern direction.\r\n\r\ni was first intrigued by the event because i don't usually see aircraft in the night sky in this area. especially so low to the ground where i could see silhouettes. and what also intrigues me was the proximity of them. at first glance one was definitely escorting the other but i realized one was following the other ( object 2 following object 1). after that realization and with everything detailed above in addition to the fact that ft bragg army base (which has an airfield)  was relatively close, i figured that this was a ufo being tailed by a military aircraft or it could be just a new aircraft. maybe i'm just crazy.

in the car cause we thought it was gonna hit the car. it had more then our attention. we lived on the street we just turned to, so right away i got my camera on my cell phone. then it happened. 2-3 more came flying at us. i didn't aim the camera, i just hit the button to snap pictures.. in a few minutes, it was all over. \r\n   what we thought was a glowing ball, was that. you can see it in the

pavement, so it did get fairly close to the ground..It flew so fast towards the ground, i still don't know how it could possibly not of crashed. i mean this thing was flying at a speed you couldn't

from me, it made no noise, it had no windows or doors or wings or legs etc-- it was just hanging there, i then thought that it maybe a balloon or so, so i then walked towards it to see it up closer but then it start to move towards my left and kept the same distance, so then i started to run to it and it kept the same distance, then a barbed wire came up but it went up and over and came down to the same about 3 ft above the ground as i kept to follow it there came a row of pine trees like 50 ft or more high so i think that it maybe will get stuck there, by that time it was about 150 ft in

to the south west in the distance right above the tree line. it caught my attention because it was pretty bright for a star and it was flickering pretty rapidly between white, blue, red, and green. i figured it was just a star or planet. about a half hour i went back out and saw it was in the same spot decided to see if i could find out what it was with my sky view app that shows everything in the sky but no planets were there and went back inside. i had my dad come out and look at it but he didn't think anything of it. later i went back out after 11 pm and it was gone. i didn't know what to think and went back in and after 20 minutes i decided put on my shoes and decided to walk to the my back yard on top of a hill. i was looking where were it was before for a couple of minutes and then suddenly it reappeared in the same spot like it was. it then turned to a white light and started moving west and the light transformed into a red blinking light, then a clear flashing light. it then changed direction and went north turning back into a white ball of light. while traveling north along the hill line it stopped for a moment, then continued to travel north until it was out of sight. i lost sight of it around 11:45 pm. i would say it was only a couple of miles away from me at first until it started moving. i live right by a small airport so i've seen a lot of planes in this area and this was no plane. i contacted a friend who lives about ten miles away to see if he noticed anything in the sky also and he said he saw the same thing moving around 9:45 pm while driving home.

grandmother were staring up at something.  following their gazes i looked south from her back yard and just above the treeline i saw a large triangle shaped object with a singular light on each corner and one bright light in the center. it was very typical of the triangle craft that are so often reported. the craft moved from east to west at a very slow speed and low altitude.  it made no sound that i can recall.  \r\n\r\nas we watched the craft for several minutes my grandmother asked my father what it was and we all had a conversation about whether it was an airplane or not.  it was clear

after the second picture, i went back and looked at the pictures more closely to make sure they came out just right, and noticed a white star like object in front of the clouds. i looked up and could not see the object. so i took another picture of the same area. the white object appeared in the third photograph, slightly to upper right of its previous location. it was moving. again, i looked up, and wasn't able to see the object. since i couldn't see the object, and it only appeared on photograph, i just took random pictures of that area, trying to track the movement.\r\n\r\nafter 6 random pictures, the object must have disappeared to the south east high above the horizon. my educated guess is it noticed i was taking pictures, and moved into the clouds to conceal itself.\r\n\r\ni left

 as i was looking up, i noticed something out of the corner of my right eye.  it seemed like the stars were vanishing.  i turned and looked in that direction (n/nnw) and i could clearly see a very large triangular (delta) shaped \"craft\" of some sorts, moving across the sky in a s/sse direction, directly overhead.\r\n\r\nthis craft had no lights and emmited no sound either, but, i could hear it moving through the air above me.  this craft was very large....300' - 500' approximate guestimation.  as far as i could tell, it had to have been between 500' - 1000' above ground, but as it was the middle of the night, it was hard to judge that accurately.  but it was close enough that i heard it \"move\" through the air overhead.  it was moving at a good clip too.\r\n\r\ni froze in disbelief and just followed it as it moved silently across the sky, covering up and then uncovering stars as it moved.  hairs stood up on my body.  came to the crashing conclusion that i had witnessed an unidentified flying object sail over my head.\r\n\r\ni kept it quiet for almost two years until a friend of mine told me his story of seeing the exact same craft i had seen.  everything was identical.  \r\n\r\nit has taken me 10 years since i spoke to that friend about it, to work up the courage to report this to your group.\r\n\r\ni'm most definately not crazy, lol....And have always been of sound mind and body.  i know what i saw, and there's nothing that could explain what i saw.\r\n\r\nanyways, that's about all i can tell you.  haven't experienced anything similar since...But i'm always watching!\r\n\r\ncheers!\r\n\r\nmichael collins","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":75817,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.93096714315574,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-04142016-0014","longitude":-80.10182078325872,"occurred":1083283200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1460654659000,"summary":"Orangeville, ontario, canada ufo moving overhead in the night sky.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4367,"locationName":"Orangeville, Ontario","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:80531"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Merrill","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was walking my dog around the block like i do almost ten times a day, on a very overcast day. i heard what i thought was a regular passenger jet, and i looked up expecting to see a normal 737 looking plane. instead, i saw what appeared to be much longer than a 737 and it had two very distinct pairs of parallel wings, in addition to the small blur of the tail wings i could make out. the plane wasn't going particularly fast, and it was low like it might be coming in for a landing several miles away. \r\n\r\ni tried to make sense of what i saw before taking my phone out, and bringing up the camera. i thought it could possibly be a plane carrying a glider, but it looked all one piece - both in person and in the picture/video. i also considered that it might be a drone, but like i said, i looked up because i heard what i thought were the engines of an airliner not the buzzing of a drone. i believe this object is definitely man-made, but i think it's either an experimental aircraft or some new kind of cloud seeder. i tried to look up pictures of anything similar, both in drones and planes, but couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\ni also think that it was flown on an overcast day on purpose, to try and conceal it better. i haven't seen anything like this on a clear or cloudy day before, or at all for that matter. the picture i got shows the wings better than video, but the video (while it looks like a cylinder) shows it's longer than a normal aircraft. i tried to zoomout a little to add height perspective, but it's still a pretty bad vid.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know what this was?
