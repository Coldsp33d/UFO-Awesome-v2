 i realized that i in fact did have lost time after the sighting i was left alone with the camping gear. i remember gathering wood for the fire but not starting it. my next memory is looking at the fire from a seat on a large log\r\nit is now pitch dark and a party is going on around me. it was daylight when i began gathering wood 7:30-8:00 pm. about 11:30pm.\r\n\r\n  i have begun having fragmented memories within the past year and a picture has begun to emerge. i remember hearing a voice telling me that he is the pilot responsible for ferrying the guys at the top of the food chain in this case edward teller from wright patterson afb to this facility for research projects and experiments. this place is one of the first and still most secret no one has even guessed that there is something like this here.\r\n\r\n  the next thing i remember is the  same voice saying that they have been flying the same path so the tree tops should glow at night all along the path ha ha just kidding , but the annular grow ring of the trees should show signs of high radiation all along the path like bread crumbs right to the front door and down the rabbit hole. i can tell you all this because you will never remember haha ha ha have fun .\r\n\r\n  that is strange i realize but that is what i am remembering. everything i try to visualize is blurred vision of people the voice sounds like we are in a fairly large area inside. there are other words and phrases i can hear being said but none of it makes any sense. \r\n\r\n  i would have skipped sending this except that the name edward teller made me think that it could lead to discovering a dumb in the vicinity western pa or wv that was one of the first in the country built at the time that the nuclear power station was built. the words research facility are said several times.  \r\n\r\n thanks for the time contact me if you think it would be worth it. \r\ni am considering having a regressive session to see if i can

from me car and notice a few people pointing to the sky. i walked to see what it was, the object ( black in color) shaped like a boomerang but not a complete open ended triangle. like a grub worm stretched out. it was due west at 70 plus degree altitude heading south or so it seemed. i ran inside to get a phone to take pictures and make a calls to whomever that could confirm the ufo. i talked to the other persons outside watching it along with me. some side it was a blimp i replied, it's way to hi for that to be a blimp. then the comments of its a plane. i replied, no wings on it or vapor trail, plus it isn't moving!  at this point the others lost interest and went on with their day. i continued to call to confirm the ufo. about ten minuets into viewing the ufo, it changed colors from black to whitest gray in a rolling fashion. the color changed in a movement like how a alligator rolls when drowning its pray, but much slower and it happened in a sequence of one. after changing color it then seemed to move due south just enough to change location. the moment was slow, this is what helped me distinguish how large and hi the ufo was.  a commercial airliner flying south in the direction of the ufo was coming to pass. the plan is getting closer to the ufo, and is now flying under it. i can now see that the ufo is two to three time the size of the plan in flight.  no doter or deviation in flight course happened with ether of the crafts. it was as if the plan didn't see the ufo while flying under it. the trails of the airliner are no being used by my hand to measure with. the plan and ufo was about four fingers apart (arm fully extended). i would say the given the plans altitude with the white vapor tails.  the ufo was somewhere of double the plans height or lower orbit. i was still trying to contact somebody who could conform this sighting. finally at 12 pm, i am now speaking with a person of authority in washington d.C. i am then told to contact some of the same persons, i had already talk with previously.  i explained that i already went through those channels trying to do this correctly. as i am talking to this person. the ufo changed color again back to white then hovered over my location heading southeast.  it now changed back to black. while trying to keep the sun out of my eyes. the ufo ascended up into space into the sun at a steady speed to the point i can no longer see it. as all this was happening, he then gave me a contact that would know how to help me. i called the # given and did reach the person of authority, but was told that she had not been over seeing any communications of that nature for many years.  i was instructed to meet up for a interview and exchange information for filing and follow ups if needed.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Location:  northeastern spalding county, georgia\r\ntime frame:  22:42 hours to 22:51 hours\r\n\r\non 13 april, 2016, i was following my regular route to work; highway 155 north in spalding county, georgia bound for mcdonough, georgia.  as i was approaching the county line about to cross into henry county, i noticed a light off to the northeast, roughly over frog road and the community of luella.  i was travelling at approximately 55-60 mph, the sky was overcast, with prevailing winds coming out of the northeast, air temperature 57o.  a slight and intermittent rain was present in patchy areas but barely detectable.  the cloud deck was high but solid.  at first glance, i presumed the object was a helicopter, perhaps a med-flight bound for spalding regional hospital in griffin, georgia.  as i watched it, however, it became apparent that it was not a helicopter.  my first instinct as a retired emergency communications officer (911/police/fire radio operator and supervisor, critical incident response commander) was that since the object was relative to the high-tension power lines that cross the highway, i was seeing a power line on fire.  i passed under the power lines and made a u-turn to double check.  as i approached the power lines (heading south), i looked for signs for signs of fire, but the lines were clear. \r\n \r\nas i passed the power lines and crossed back into spalding county, the object crossed the highway from left to right and was then concealed by a tree line to my right approximately 600 yards from my position.  i cleared the tree line, and the object was no longer visible.  i decided to pull into a dirt road (johnson road extension) to turn around and abandon any further attempt to view the object.  as i pulled onto 155 and headed north, i spotted the object again almost in the exact same position i was in when i first sighted it, except it was then off to the northwest (left), and relatively stationary.  i stopped the truck and watched it as it appeared to descend roughly over the cole reservoir.  there is a large golf community (heron bay) located where the object appeared to descend.  i had no other witnesses, and, unusually, there were no other vehicles travelling on 155 in either direction when this occurred.  \r\n\r\ni cannot quite find a technical description to articulate the object i saw.  i was unable to determine a shape at all.  the light was variable in magnitude; at its brightest, it was about as intense as a street light and amber/orange in color (when the illumination intensified, the spectral range was nearly in the white, but generally dark to amber/orange).  its movement was generally horizontal, with some vertical movement; much like a plastic bag that has been caught by the wind.  the consistency of the color and magnitude of its luminescence was similar to the manner in which an ember emanates light as it rises from a fire.  its speed was also variable, and i would estimate it moving at its fastest during the sighting as no more than 100 mph, and as slow as stationary.  \r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this.  we live in an area that has historically been free from light pollution, use a telescope for stargazing regularly, and see satellites and high altitude aircraft regularly.  i took one or two flight lessons while in high school, and grew up near hartsfield-jackson international airport, so i am no stranger to aircraft and flight patterns (at the time of the sighting, hartsfield had outbound traffic at approximately 10,000 feet, northeast to southwest, roughly 2 minutes between aircraft).  this object gave the impression that it was closer than it appeared.  the illumination was not configured; it was apparently “random” lighting, as though it moved all about the surface of the object, but concentrated primarily at a ventral, abaxial angle from my point of view.  \r\n\r\nthe best rough coordinates i can provide are as follows:\r\nfirst sighting:  33o 20’01.81” n x 84o09’58.2” w (moving)\r\nsecond sighting: 33o 19’14.65” n x 84o 10’56.66” w (moving)\r\nthird sighting:  33o 19’59.51” n x 84o 11’52.30” w (stationary/descending)\r\n\r\n(note: the first and third coordinate readings are roughly parallel, minus about a thousand horizontal compass feet, i think.)\r\n\r\nas a retired emergency communications officer, my professional reputation does not compel me to report such things, but my instincts tell me i saw something odd.  i am not familiar with drones, but would not rule out the possibility of someone with an illuminated drone playing around.  i researched footage for any relevant similarities and they were somewhat, but not entirely consistent with what i saw.  i was unable to take a picture as my cellphone will not zoom and the picture would therefore not have been of any use.  i just thought that since this was the first time i’d ever seen any such thing i might report it to somebody on the outside chance any similar sightings in the area or time frame were reported, or may be reported.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ufo shows from 2014-15.Just wanting to see if anything like this was seen in oakland or other places?\r\ni was a kid of 6-7 years old at the time - grandpa had a 20 acre farm in oakland somewhere since 1955 ish when he retired - so i was like 6 years old in 1964. my mum and dad and myself had gone over to visit grandma and grandpa for the day from san fran. - we got over to their place and grandpa wanted to go to the store and do some grocery shopping - anyway - mum and dad went with him to the store and i staid at the house with grandma. so i was in the house for a bit with grandma then went out the back door to the back yard area to play or explore or whatever and ran around the side of the house and i saw this white polar bear standing there near a tree - bushy pine trees were around the back yard - not too tall trees - maybe 20-30 ft high - but big backyard area bordering the farm area. anyway - this white polar bear was standing there on it's back hind legs just looking at me or watching me and or the area. i stopped dead in my tracks and just stood there looking at it myself for maybe 1-2-3 minutes - not sure how long but not more than a couple of minutes or even one minute watching it. the \"bear\" was a good 8-9-10 ft high standing up  - but i was a small kid but it wasn't making any noises or anything - i think i remember it having one arm and paw up in the air straight - then maybe brought it down - but it was just standing there near a bushy pine tree on the back side of the house - i was maybe 20-30 ft away from it. it just stood there and was either looking at me or away but facing me slightly angled from me - not standing straight on. it was n't coming at me or anything - just standing there and i remember very still - not moving at all really.\r\nso i didn't feel held in place or anything - and do not think i was getting any mind telepathy either -  just that i stared at it for a minute or two - then i ran back inside to tell my grandma that there was a white bear in the back yard area and to come out and have a look. well grandma said maybe i saw a fox or something... i said no way it was a fox - it was this big white bear... so after a minute or two of talking to her she agreed to come outside and have a look - i think she grabbed a stick or broom or something and we go outside to check - and of course the bear was gone... anyway - she looked around a bit and brought me back inside and told me not to imagine things or tell fibs about things i see... so anyway that was my white polar bear experience at 6-7 years old in oakland ca. supposedly the farm is now condominiums - but was not way out in the countryside...At the time it would have been not too far out - maybe a suburb area now. \r\njust wanted to put the story on file with mufon for the record...Pretty sure no polar bear had escaped from the zoo but who knows... it sure was not a fox i saw like grandma thought.\r\n\r\nanyway - keep up the good work - thought i had to impart the story - am 57 years old and have told the story a couple of times... if it was not an escaped bear from the zoo then it was something else - looked like a full grown big white polar bear standing on it's hind legs and not making any noises or anything. i just googled it and do not see anything about a polar bear escaping. definetely had an effect on me at 6 years old and to this day i still wonder what it was if not a real white bear escaped from the zoo - which i still do not think it was.\r\n\r\nanyway - just a kid and put in the back of the mind but it is still there and i thought i should tell mufon about it anyway.\r\n\r\nthanks for all the ufo info and really liked the history channel shows! am american but living and working in thailand now for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or
