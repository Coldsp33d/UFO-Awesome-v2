i don't know. notice the lack of alien spacecraft speculation, as i only  what to identify the anomaly. only alien spacecraft are alien spacecraft, and all ufo's are ufo's, until proven otherwise with compelling evidence, and then, might be something else. but, i have never seen this type of object and its actions before, and therefore, is a ufo.\r\n\r\ni will try to send a map of the path of the \" black dot\" later.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":75781,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.55381405105059,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-04122016-0014","longitude":-52.87887502103371,"occurred":1460478600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Newfoundland and Lab","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1460494153000,"summary":"Watching helicopter saw a black dot to it's left and followed dot until it blinked suddenly out of sight","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/St_Johns","timeZoneName":"America/St_Johns","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"A1L 3J7","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Paradise, Newfoundland and Lab","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:80626"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Johnstone","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was out in my back garden for an hour before it happened,as i was watching the meteor showers,a meteor passed over my roof it was very low it had a smoky firey tail and i heard a whooshing sound as it fell.I actually thought that the meteor had landed in my neighbours backgarden wich is 7 doors down from were my house is situated.I then looked back up to the sky and saw what i thought was a cloud but it seemed out of place as the sky was clear and it seemed to low down to be a cloud i then noticed the shape of it and it was like a giant stingray flying(swimming )in the sky about 100 or so feet away from me above my home.It was white then it seemed to go tranclucent i could see that it was also pulscating as its wings for want of a were effortley propelling it along..I watched it for about 30 seconds then it started to fade ,dissapate then it dissappeared.When i saw this i didnt feel any fear or sense of forboding,i felt so calm and serene even,i then went into my house and emailed lon stickler of my exsperience.I dont know if it was just my imagination but i felt so calm i went to bed and practically fell into a peacefull sleep it felt like i had taken a sleeping pill ..Falling asleep like that is out of the ordinary for me as i am a bit of an insomniac..When i woke up next morning i woke up feeling very sad as if i had lost someone,for the rest of the day i felt very whistfull.

era estudante e me preparava para o vestibular. meu horarario de aula era de 18:30 as 22:00. sai uns 10 minutos antes da aula para que podesse evitar o tumulto da saida da cidade do crato pelos onibus universitarios. passei na casa onde minha prima estava e peguei ela, o pai dela e a mae dela. saimos por volta das 22:15 da cidade rumo a nossa casa que fica na cidade de mauriti-ce\r\n\r\n2 quando chegamos em uma parte do percurso, proximo a cidade de misso velha, avistamos uma luz branca se destacava facilmente das outras no desenho da cidade. quando mais iamos chegando perto da cidade viamos que na verdade esse ponto de luz ficava cada vez mais forte e que na verdade ele se localisava fora da cidade.\r\n\r\ndd3 naquela epoca foi a epoca da explosão das torres de telefonia gsm, praticamente todo dia tinha uma torre nova onde antes n havia nada. qua do vi delonge, achei que era a luz de sinalização. depois concluir que não,  porque  esses luzes sao vermelhas e aquela era de um branco cegante.\r\n\r\n4 depois de mais ou menos 1 km da zona urbana da cidade, no sentido da cidade de milagres-ce, nos deparamos com um enorme luz branca cegante a uns 3 metros fora da pista e a uns  6 metros de altura. ficamos com o carro parado bem embaixo dessa luz, desligamos o veiculo e saimos do carro os 4e ficamos bem embaixo  desse corpo iluminado. estava tao baixo que quase dava p pegar com os dedos se pulasse. me abaixei e peguei uma pedrinhas p ver o que acontecia se eu acertasse. mas nao joguei, alguma  coisa não  me deixou. ficamos la parados por varios minutos. curioso é que essa rodovia é super movimentada, mas nesse periodo mais ninguem passou. meu tio, pai da menina que estava levando, nos balancou pelos ombros, quase que tirando a nos de um transe. entramos dentro do carro e saimos ainda pasmos e sem entender o que seria aquilo\r\n\r\n5 quando chegamos meu sentimentos era de se perguntar se eu nao estava sonhando, perguntei aos outro que estavam  no carro se eles estavam  vendo o mesmo que eu. quando sai e fiquei embaixo dele coberto pela luz , que de tao forte mudou a cor da nossa pele, a sencacao  era de estrema paz e socego. n sentia quase nada do pescoço  pra baixo. so depois de alguns minutos, quando fui balançando pelo meu tio foi que voltei a me sentir e novamente senti os pe  no chao.\r\n\r\n6 somente perdemos o obijeto de vista porque meu tio, que ficou meio apavorado com aquilo tudo, praticamente botou todos dentro do carro aos empurrões.  depois de uns 100 metros pegamos uma ladeira e perdemos o objeto de vista.\r\n\r\nps. peco que venha a nossa regiao e investigue esse e outros muitos casos que estao sendo ignorados pelo nosso governo, pelo simples fato de n ter a quem se reportar. somos do interior do ceara, um estado pequeno e pobro do brasil. se a mufon tem problemas em grandes cetros com radar, equipamentos, verbas e todas as facilidades que vcs tem. imagine nos aqui. nas comunidades mais isoladas da minha cidade, contos, historias de luz, pousos,mascas no solo, circulos nas plantacoes e muitas outras. por favor s3jam a nossa voz para o mundo saber que isso acontece com muita frequencia aqui tambem. espero que possam de alguma forma nos ajudar quanto a isso.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned

zig zaging and turning abruptly,heading back the other way,then bouncing and speeding around as if it was playing as if in joy.It continued this activity as i tried to gauge it's size and height in the sky.I sat up and at that point i was exactly in the window,my bed being right against the window.I made a move to go off the bed and the object stopped it's zig zaging and turned at a high rate of speed into the direction i first observed it to come.The 2nd time i saw this ball, it flew right straight over the tops of the trees and disappeared into a corner over the trees.It was 3x's the size of a basket ball,was solid flew straight (no rolling)and had a slight rosy glow reflecting the sun.I was sitting in a lawn chair with the trees on my right,and i saw it out of the corner of my eye then clearly in front of my face as it swept over the trees.The first sighting the object seemed to be an aware and self directing object as i have said it seemed to be playing in the sky,and i felt it saw that i had seen it through the window and sped away as i got up from the bed to go out side to get a closer look.It was higher up in the sky the first sighting,but i was able to gauge it's size better the second sighting.I hope to spot this amazing thing again!What ever could this be?","distance":"20 Feet or

identification.\r\n\r\nrecently, when viewing videos of similar occurrances within a similar frame of time in year and distance of reported sightings only reinforced what i and about 10 others who

does my roomate. i can't eat, i'm shakin still. the energy from that craft was evil. i'm not feelin clear minded or even like i'm in the right body. i'm sober and don't so drugs or drink and i know

bright red object through the trees.  i got up and walked approximately 10 feet to get a better view and the object looked as large as the house below it and looked so bright red that it appeared like a ball of fire.  the sphere shaped object was hovering around the tree tops right behind power lines.  within seconds, it backed up slowly and then took off backwards very fast and instantly disappeared.  i have never seen any type of object before in my 45 years on this earth and up to this sighting, not sure if i really believed in other people's sighting.  the night before this happened, we were all going to sleep, and the whole house started swaying back and forth. it feeler like tremors.  the house is built off the ground on stilts because it is next to water and is a flood zone. it moved enough that it shook our beds.  this went on in intervals of about 3 minutes, repeating over and over for approximately 20 minutes.  four days after the sighting, my sister said she heard what sounded like a roaring sound.  she heard birds chirping uncontrollably and she went outside and the floor of the screen porch felt like it was vibrating.  she never saw anything, but she wouldn't leave the porch area.  this lasted approximately 20 minutes.  however, the birds continued to chirp for hours.  this happened approximately 11:30pm.","distance":"21-100

discription is reason to believe it was trying to cloak itself.The third was just down the road while i was walking west ,it was a massive object with two arches illuminated by the sunlight as if they were chrome.This object as i remember evaded my picture taking by ducking behind a cloud after making a spiral shaped movement. the last was in the same place a few weeks later but just a week ago. i was already taking photos when i noticed what appeared to be a helicopter.But when i caught it in zoom appeared nothing of the kind. of course i managed to get a picture and last thursday a sound caught on video.People explained to me this was the sound of the tornado alarm testing.It clearly is not and i do swear a bit in the video as i had just stepped outside to investigate the insanely
