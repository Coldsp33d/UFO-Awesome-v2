hundred feet above trees,(guessing), when all just went away, or stopped reflecting. nothing else was seen.\r\n\r\nobserver described a very weird feeling and was uneasy the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nobserver called me to describe the even the next day and asked if i had any weird stuff happen the night before.\r\n\r\nthe only odd occurrence was as i was taking my medications the next morning i suddenly noticed my nose was bleeding all over my chest and running down my stomach, through my moustache and beard. a fairly heavy bleed. then a few minutes later my daughter came down from her room and had a tissue in her nose and informed me she woke up with a nose bleed too. same nostril too.\r\n\r\nfirst time in over a year we had any nose bleeds around here! \r\n\r\nperson who saw this thing has had several odd occurrences on his security cams outside his house this fall and winter. one had a light coming from above the house somewhere very brightly lighting his parking area and front porch. one had some weird light appendages moving around the porch area almost inquisitively. he swears he saw the face of a alien outside his window once that resembled the insect type with the big black eyes taking up half it's head, last fall but swears he will not admit that to anyone but me, his father.\r\n\r\nwe have made reports before of smaller objects and such, we continue to watch the sky when we can and have seen a lot of small sightings like lights that resemble satellites but turn and move in different directions. we have seen ,(until now), nothing like the big ship that came up in the north horizon and then flew overhead and straight south into space not following the horizon down again two years or so ago.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

einer sommernacht passiert war. ich weiß das es schon länger her ist aber damals war ich noch nicht mit den internet bzw. ich wusste da auch noch nichts von mufon. was ich jetzt hier schreibe hat sich genauso zugetan und bitte glauben sie mir. ich war damals mit mein auto zu besuch bei einem freund und kam erst spät abends um ca. 02:50 uhr nach hause. ich fuhr das auto auf unser grundstück und stieg dann aus. dann schloß ich die auto tür zu und dann sah ich es. zwei orang rot leuchtende kugeln schwebten über ein nahbarhaus. es war schwer einzuschätzen wie weit weg die objekte waren. eine kugel schien mir näher als die andere, weil sie größer war. die andete kugel war kleiner und etwas höher. die kugeln selber schien von einer feurigen aura umgeben zu sein. ähnlich wie eine übergroße orange, die mit feuer überzogen ist. vom einschätzen der kugeln, erschienen sie mir ziemlich groß. geräusche waren überhaupt keine zu hören. zu dieser zeit, gab es eine discothek (kraftwerk),in unserer nähe. draussen hatten sie ein licht strahler der muster in den himmel projizierte. ich vermute, wahrscheinlich wurde es davon angezogen. dies ganze ereignis ging ungefähr 2-3 minuten. dann waren die kugeln weg. einfach weg. kein wegfliegen oder sonst was. ich schreibe dies hier in der hoffnung, das wenigstens sie mir glauben. damals hatte ich angst dort hinzugehen, weil ich nicht wusste

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"These events happened when i was 14 years old, and it included myself and my cousin.  the day wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  during the summertime minnesota can get pretty hot, and we were in the middle of a hot summer that year.  all through the day of wandering through the local parks, swimming in the local lake, and then hanging out at my cousin's house at night we didn't experience anything out of the ordinary.  at that age we would always attempt to stay awake as long as we could and squeeze what time we could get out of the summer.\r\n\r\nwhen we finally decided that we were going to go to bed, we both found ourselves uncomfortably hot.  wandering down stairs, we looked around the kitchen trying to get something to make us cold again.  fans, cold water douses, or soaked towels.  we couldn't get cool.  we weren't to the point of sickness about it, we just couldn't take the sticky heat.  and so we decided to fill a couple spray bottles normally used for fending off cats from plants, and use them to mist our faces.\r\n\r\nwe both ended up in the living room connected to the kitchen.  all the lights were off and we both were laying on the floor.  talking, laughing, complaining about how hot it was.  the living room had a wall of three windows all facing a slight rise in the ground that led upwards towards the next property.  this \"divider\" also had many trees planted giving it the look like a wooded area.  of course the length from just outside the window to the lawn of the next person up the hill was probably around 50-60ft.  the windows were probably around 3-4ft off the ground from their base.  and the window that was important, was the middle window.\r\n\r\nmy cousin and i talked for quite a while, trying to pass the time until exhaustion would overtake our annoyance about the heat.  very suddenly my cousin stopped talking and in the midst of misting my face, i called for him by name.  when i didn't receive a response, i looked over at him.  previously he had been laying flat on his back on the floor, spraying his face every now and again.  now when i looked over at him, he was slightly propped up on his arms and staring intently at the middle window.  a few more times i called his name, each time becoming a little bit more worried about what was going on.  of course then i decided to see what he was looking at.  when i looked over towards the middle window, i saw what he was looking at.  no limbs, no body, just the head of a creature just poking above the bottom of the window.  shape of it's head was like an upside down tear-drop, the same head that has been reported by so many people.  two very slightly slanted black eyes, and not very many other discernible facial features.  there was a direct connection, from the creature's posture i could tell that this thing and my cousin were locked onto each other.  i watched in horror for around 20 seconds before this thing turned to looked at me.  i would say we only locked gazes for about five seconds before this thing disappeared.  but it didn't just \"vanish\", i could see it had moved to it's left and to my right at an unbelievable speed.\r\n\r\ni can remember so vividly that day.  i can remember getting a pizza from a certain local gas station and enjoying it with my cousin, uncle, and aunt.  i remember how it progressed into that night, playing video games until we tried to sleep.  i remember how hot it was, how heavy the air felt.  i can remember laughing about our predicament together while laying in that living room.  i don't know if i missed time, or if it was the heat, but i dont remember what happened after seeing that thing.  the next day, we were sleeping up in his room on the top floor of the house.  we both remembered seeing that thing, still to this day we could tell the story identically.  but neither of us remember how we got back to bed that day.  it was the first and only time i have seen one of these things, but it is not the first time that i have suspected something.","distance":"20 Feet or

several objects that were all shaped exactly the same. the 4 objects were not in a group but spaced out across the sky of west bradenton florida.  we originally thought the objects were stars but the objects began to move across the sky-- we then figured they had to be planes even though they looked nothing like any planes we ever saw-- we just chalked it up to the sky playing tricks on our eyes. \r\n the objects that look like 4 separate strings of pulsating beads moved in slightly different direction but all 4 headed toward the same westerly general area , what appeared to be a planned direction or location . 2 of the objects changed directions as we watched.  \r\n they objects also seemed to gain altitude as they were moving , after about an hour 15 mins the objects stopped dead in the sky in 4 different locations. as i type this report they are currently hanging in the sky on the extreme west of bradenton .  the pulsating of the lights seems to have increased especially in 2 of the objects. the lights appear to be white, red and blue/green but are pulsating in unison not separately.   \r\n the scary and worrisome part of this whole thing is it feels to me as if they traveled and then stopped in what i only can describe as a pattern that makes me feel unsafe. like they are stationed there to observe something or be ready to initiate some type maneuver. i just walked back outside and all objects are still there clear as day but 2 have moved very slightly from there original parked position of about an hour ago . \r\n to be honest my wife is freaked out --- what comes to my mind is a few days ago nasa launched a rocket that basically flys right over bradenton , it just seems like this situation is related in some way to the rocket launch . --it's 23:30 currently

neighborhood.\r\n\r\nwhen i looked to the west past the end of our col-de-dac i noticed 3 lights in triangular formation. so i decided to take a picture of them when i returned from the walk. our walk took about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\ni went into my back yard and took the pictures and a couple in the front yard. since the formation of lights were unusual i downloaded the pictures to the computer to analyze them. \r\n\r\nnow i did not see this think take off but it was not there the next day.\r\n\r\nwhen i magnified the pictures on the computer i found some very interesting\r\ndata.\r\n\r\n1st. the magnification showed a tree in the background. the problem is that the tree in the picture was behind me. there is no big tree to the west of me in the picture nor does my neighbor to the west of me have any trees.\r\n\r\n2nd. the magnification from the pictures taken in the front of the house\r\nwhen magnified show a physical object of unusual type with lights on .It\r\n\r\ncomparing the
