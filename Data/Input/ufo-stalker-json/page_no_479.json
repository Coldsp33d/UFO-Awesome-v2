beams kind of reflected off of it as they would off of fog. however, this shape had very definite sides. i could not tell where the top of it was, because i could not see anything beyond how high my headlights went. i first caught sight of it as it was in the oncoming traffic lane. i thought it might be a shadow, but there were no other cars on the road, and no other sources of light out of the ordinary. i realized the shape was moving across the street in front of me. i lifted off the gas, to make sure i would not intercept it. the shape did not vary in size or form as it moved to the right. the width and speed remained consistent. i had chills come across my body as i watched it travel, and realized i had no idea what it was. it reached the right side of the road when i was probably no more than eight feet away from it. at that point it was leaving the range of my headlights, and was no longer visible.  for the past week and a half, i've been focusing on that portion of the road, to see if i could find any other explanation, but can't come up with anything. i'm basically just reaching out here to see if anyone has any ideas, and if anyone else has ever encountered

were at the stoplight headed north east. it was a little after 10 pm when we first encountered the object in the sky. as i observed it more i noticed the shape was not like a normal airplane or aircraft i have ever seen. it was in the shape of a triangle with two even sides and one side longer than the other two. on each corner of the object were extremely bright white lights. in between each of the white lights were a set of reddish orange lights. i tried to capture a photo but my girlfriends phone was oddly too low to capture one. as we came off the light we studied it harder and noticed as we passed it it stayed above us and didn't seem to be moving at all. we were very confused but also curious to know what it was exactly. we wondered are we the only ones seeing this for it was in a open sky over a park and very low. no lower than about 300 to 500 feet. about a quarter mile down the bend we lost sight of it but ended up coming across another one on our right side going south east at this time. this object was the exact same as the one we just seen not even a mile apart from each other. no two planes would be that close to each other in the sky. this object seemed to be moving slowly like a helicopter but simply by the shape could not be one. we didn't hear the chopper rotors so we knew it simply wasn't. we hit a patch of trees coming around a bend as we came up to the light. once we hit the clearing i noticed it vanished from the sky. i looked as far i can see in the direction it was going but there was nothing to be seen. just gone like that. whatever it was had to be a very fast moving object to lose my sight like that. as i write this i still wonder what it could of been and wish to have been able to know. it was a very exciting experience

 it was the diameter of at least 100 yard across! \r\n\r\ni was driving my minivan across the san mateo bridge heading east on the night of april 11, 2015. time was 11:55 pm. the bridge traffic was completely stopped due to only a single lane of traffic being directed through heavy construction with jack hammers making repairs on middle lanes. this was at the highest arch point of the bridge. it took me about 40 minutes to drive about 1 mile to finally clear all the construction crews and bright work lights. i had a single male passenger, about 35 years old in the back of my van who was from ukraine and he did not speak english. we could not communicate with a single word that he understood. he had his head buried in his texting while i was driving.\r\n\r\nas soon as the traffic bottle neck cleared, i tromped on the accelerator and started speeding on the downhill side of the bridge, about 3 miles from the east shore of hayward. i had just picked up speed to about 70 miles an hour when the interior of my entire van was blasted with a nearly blinding green light! it came directly from the ride side of my van. my first impulse was to get mad at the work crews for using more lights that made driving unsafe. but in the split second that this light hit, i had to hit the brakes and hope no one was close behind me. then, i looked out my window into the black void of the night sky (above the san francisco bay) and that's when i saw the ufo saucer traveling parallel with me at the same exact speed. it was gigantic and it had tilted it's bottom side towards me where i could see an incredible amount of detail. it was moving east along with me for about another 4 seconds, and then it slipped into a hard edge of a black slot in the night sky where it completely disappeared!\r\nit did not dissolve, nor get misty and fade away. it looked exactly like it slipped into a time portal slot that had a vertical hard edge. \r\n\r\nwhen this was happening, i yelled out loud to my passenger in the back, (wow! look at this!). but after the glowing green space craft was gone, i turned around and looked at my passenger and tried to ask him if he saw the ufo. he couldn't figure out what i was saying. i had to wait until the next morning to call his girlfriend to tell her what had happened. but he never saw a thing since he was busy texting at the time. \r\n\r\nthis experience was so amazing that it actually made me feel great that i had just witnessed a very real ufo, but with more detail than i have ever heard anyone describe before. i was excited, but scared at the same time.\r\ni am a former abductee on two occasions, and my first thoughts were that maybe i would be getting another visit in the near future. i tried telling people that i know and trust, but they all looked at me like i was nuts.\r\nso, i have kept this a secret for the entire past year. about 3 months after this encounter, i entered a key word search on the internet for \"green ufo san francisco bay april 11, 2015\". i found a hit from another website that originates out of florida. there was a report entered by another resident from union city (near hayward) who had seen a large green ufo on that same day, but early in the morning as he drove to work. it was located above the sf bay, exactly where i saw it late that same night! i am an artist and i immediately made a photoshop drawing of exactly what i witnessed - including all the minute details. (note: i am a 65 year-old homicide detective and i am trained to soak in a lot of details and info in a short span of time. over the years i have developed a skill at taking a \"snapshot photo\" of actual events that include many details. the photo composite i have created is an identical facsimile of exactly what i saw.  i have been inspired to finally report this sighting after one full year because april 11th is coming up in just 4 days and i plan on camping out along the shore of the san francisco bay where i will set up video and digital cameras in the longshot chance that history might repeat exactly one year later!\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s), Other","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":75702,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.670060500000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04082016-0021","longitude":-122.0762064,"occurred":1428191700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1460141974000,"summary":"While driving over a bridge, a huge flying saucer glowed bright green and then slid into a black portal door while i watched!","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":16,"maxtempi":61,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":12,"meantempi":54,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":8,"mintempi":47,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":16,"maxtempi":61,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":12,"meantempi":54,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":8,"mintempi":47,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":369,"locationName":"Hayward, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:80758"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"San Ignacio Río Muerto","country":"Mexico","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"One of farm tractors got stuck so we brought other tractors to get it out and sky was partly cloudy and i have seen a lot ufo's during the day so i got some other footage of a ship just a little higher than the cloud cover but i had to go back to my truck a i could feel the presence of something i couldn't see and started taking pictures and i know somethings will come up and it did!!

just happened to see the beautiful halo around the moon.  i don't recall the exact time but it was around 9 - 9:45pm. i decided to try taking a picture using my iphone 6 plus with the flash disabled. i snapped several pictures and noticed a ball of light directly below the moon and it appeared as if it came out of or around the moon. as i snapped photos fairly rapidly the object dropped down, moved to the left of the moon slightly ( all of this from my perspective ), then slowly moved down and to the right and after a minute or less it moved upwards and to the right of the moon. if using a clock to demonstrate.....The object appeared at 6 o'clock, moved to the 8 o'clock position and after changing course counter clockwise finished its movement around 3 o'clock. the only movement after it arrived at the 3 o'clock position was it moved away from the moon slightly, stopped and we observed it in that position for a period of time, i don't know how long, it was difficult for either of us to look away from the direction of the moon. we sometime later, i don't know how long exactly, went back inside our house. i came back out an hour or so later and the object was gone.\r\n\r\nthe first photos i took only show the halo. all subsequent pictures show the object in different positions. none of the photos were altered in anyway, except one which i tried to zoom in on the

girls and 3 guys went to the beach for a few drinks and a good time.\r\n\r\n2.) my friend brandon quickly got my attention to an unusual anomaly in the sky moving rapidly from south-southeast to north-northeast.\r\n\r\n3.) we regularly visited this beach day and night and theres an air force base aross the bay\r\nas well as aircraft of large and small size flying into pinellas county airport as well as tampa international airport. i'm the son of a pilot and im familiar with typical rare of speed on private/commercial/military craft. this bared no resemblance to what we (as a group watched). once my buddy brandon noticed the craft coming rapidly from the south, it crossed the whole sky in front of us in a matter or seconds at what appeared to be between 20,000-35,000ft elevation doing at least mach 3 or 4, silently. the craft was a vertical row of 3 glowing orbs/dots. it looks like a division sign (÷) in which the middle orb/dot circled the center of the exterior or bounced back and forth horizontally like a game of pong. \r\n\r\n4.) the duration of the event lasted only 7 seconds at most, maybe as short  as 3-4 seconds.\r\nit moved slower then a meteor and didnt enter our atmosphere and burn up, it moved from south to north thru the sky as far as the eye can see. the craft vanished before it should have been out of vision. it seemed as though every time the middle light would pulse the whole craft would fade then glow. as though the center pulsing light was the source of its electromagnetic energy. eventually fading into the clear night sky.\r\n\r\n5.) it made me think outside the box after witnessing it with a group of friends and we all saw it. i didn't think much about it until i became a amateur ufologist and did my research. i believe this technology to be of extraterrestrial. but the craft i believe is back  engineered and was being tested by black budget industrial military corporation. \r\n\r\n6.) as the object passed about 10-15 miles out over the gulf, while clearly watching the anomaly it vanished from sight before it should have. by that i mean it vanished after passing right over me. anything moving that fast , in formation of 2 still orbs and the middle moving front to back, or it was one vessel. the shape is hard to determine, if it was one craft then it could of been an oval, cigar, or diamond shape. heres a simple diagram of the anomaly:\r\n\r\n                               •\r\n south -->       <---- • ---->         --> north\r\n                               •","distance":"Over One
