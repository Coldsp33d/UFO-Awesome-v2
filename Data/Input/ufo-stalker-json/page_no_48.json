led lights in a field close to the campground,making people in the campground think it was a ufo..Then a couple minutes into my flight i seen a light come down out of the clouds to the west of me at least a couple kms away, and then it started to come in my direction.I thought it was a small plane comming to see what my plane was as that has happend before but the closer it came i could see it was a red pulsing orb of light.It came to a couple hundred feet away and then turned to the south and almost stoped. then i noticed 2 more that seemed to come out of know where.I was having a hard time to keep my plane in the air and watch them too and i was getting very scared by then so i landed it as fast as i could.These things changed direction and altitude at free will.. i started to run across the field as fast as i could back to the car and as i did 2 of them slowly followed me right to the car maybe 100 to 200 feet above me.I seen aprox 8 to 12 of them,i was pretty shaken up.I drove back through the campground to our cabin.I ran into the cabin to tell my friend what i seen,she then told me she was videoing me and got 3 of them on video.I went back outside with her and a few more flew right over the cabin.She took another short video of one she was able to focus on.I then took a couple pictures of them that seem to only be a couple hundred feet above me at most.In the video and looking at them they look like red orbs but when you zoom in on my pictures you can clearly see they are two different shapes and they don't even look red.One was almost tube shape and the other was kind of round with almost what looks like a tail. they were following me for sure..Some flew back up into the sky and some seemed to go to the south east before going out of sight..I was pretty scared and in shock of what just happened.I have both videos on youtube but my pictures i have show different shapes that you could'nt see by the naked eye or in video. i also seen 1 red orb in fort sask,alberta just last two years ago while flying at night again but it was only one but it never came as close,,it seen my plane and then flew off in the same direction it came.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

care facility in a somewhat rural area. at around 10:00 pm i stepped out back for a smoke break. i had the handset to the facility landline in my front pocket, and was talking on my cell phone when i exited the building. i noticed right away that the night sky was unusually black, as if the stars had been blotted out. the night was clear and cool. i looked up in time to see what i believe were three rocket burners light up almost simultaneously. the object having these red-orangish fiery \"lights\" ascended, it did not climb, it went straight up high in the sky, then it zig-zagged across the sky toward the north, and was out of sight. i stood there stunned, my heart was pounding, i must have held my breath because i had to gasp for air! i didn't believe in ufos or any such thing, now i'm not so sure. i realized that my cell phone stopped working when i tried to find the words to tell what i had just seen.\r\njust then my step father and administrator of the care home arrived in the parking lot, concerned because he couldn't reach me by either of the phones.This is when i discovered my cell phone, an lg shine at&t, was toast. \r\n when i told my step father i had just seen a ufo, two jets tore across the sky. he said yeah there go the military planes. i laughed, the planes were so slow, for one. second, they were going the wrong direction. one question i see almost every time i'm considering reporting this event is, \"were there any fighter jets/military planes in the vicinity at that time?\". if those planes i saw that night had any connection to the object i saw, i can think of none. but i mention it here  in case such detail is relevant. if the pair of jets was supposed to escort the triangle, or chase it...That's just comical. \r\n\r\nthis thing was not a

students house when i noticed how clear the stars were in the sky. and i noticed something which i had also noticed in the u.K. a few years back. there was a bright moon and in the distance  on the horizon were two airliners and the way i know this is because aircraft have a green strobe light on the right wing and a red strobe light on the left wing i could make out the red and they were headed towards the left of the horizon which is the normal colour to see. conventional aircraft also have a strobe light which is used to warn other aircraft of their presence. so i have a little bit of history recognizing aircraft. the two white lights which could easily be mistaken as bright stars were at a high altitude with no strobes. they could easily be confused with the iss too if it here had been only one however two bright lights similar to the brightest stars moved together. the right slightly infront and the left slightly behind at their altitude i would estimate around 100 - 150 meters between them both and the distance remained unchanged throughout my observation which suggested that the objects traveled at the same speeds. in formation. i first noticed them because when i looked up as i was walking and i felt slightly dizzy because the points of light were heading in a direction unlike the stars remaining in a fixed position. they headed towards the right of the moon away from my position and besides me my student watched and speculated also noticing the aircraft and their strobe lights in the distance. we compared them and the left light started to dim until it had completely faded then the right followed suit exactly the same. i have observed a similar event but the light was lower and it was early morning in the u.K. newcastle upon tyne when i noticed a single light high but not as high travel from west to east a few years back. it had no trail like a conventional aircraft. i believe these things exist but it terrifies me as well. i think maybe it's

like the predator in the predator movies, but if he was standing in front of a blue sky with the sun about 15-20 degrees off of him and behind. you could see the outline, but other than the two parallel bar shapes in the point facing me there wasn’t much that was more than a strong shimmer. like light being bent around something roughly triangular. the “bars” i had first seen looked like panels on the underside, or at least panel-shaped zones of reflection.\r\n\r\nafter a few seconds of it being still i reached into my glove box for my binoculars and tried to get it into the frame. but the angle of the sun was too close and the sky was way too bright. i quickly pulled them back down and the thing flashed brightly and was gone. the bright flash appeared to come from the base of the two bars near the center of the thing, not from the end of the bars where i could see the most detail.\r\n\r\nthe thing was about the width of two fingers held 1.5 inches apart at arms length. it was between two clouds so i couldn’t tell if it was in front of them or behind. it appeared to be completely stationary, despite the rapid movement of the clouds that day.  i looked for a long time after it vanished, but as cloudy as it was it could have still been there and not visible. i think i only saw it because of the gap in the clouds and the angle of the sun which was kind of behind it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":89776,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.53232465976668,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01242018-0010","longitude":-97.52778337266696,"occurred":1516629600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1516812341000,"summary":"Shimmering

downtown augusta, georgia and taking doug barnard parkway (southbound) to our residence in augusta. directly ahead of us and slightly to the right (southwest sky) we had seen a large and bright white (almost shimmering) light in the sky. the light was very much in the open night sky and well above the treetops. the light then disappeared and reappeared slightly up and to the left from the original light we had seen. it was at this point i pulled my vehicle to a stop onto the shoulder of the road. then, the second light disappeared and reappeared where the original light was seen. in perfect rhythm, the light would disappear and reappear slightly lower and to the right from it's previous location (almost as if it were slowly descending) until after roughly 6-8 times, it simply had vanished. given it's current rate of motion and speed at the time, it would have been able to be seen again, but it never showed up. the last light was nowhere close to the tops of the treeline. my mobile phone was unfortunately unable to take picture/video at the time due to its low charge, and by the time my significant other had gotten the video recorder up on her mobile phone, the lights had disappeared entirely. now, it is worth mentioning at this point, i have seen this phenomenon once before from my own residence in augusta, ga (located approximately five minutes s-sw from this sighting) on february 10, 2015. at that time, the lights had appeared very similar to what i have described in this encounter, but had reappeared in a totally different area of the sky and moved in a completely opposite pattern. hoping the lights would reappear again (much like the first encounter almost 3 years previous), we waited by the roadside, but the lights had not returned. i continued scanning the sky in all directions for the following five minutes and for the remainder of my drive home, but saw nothing further. \r\n\r\na few caveats with this experience:\r\n- this was not my first time seeing almost this same exact scenario in almost the same location almost 3 years apart\r\n- nor is this my first time with an experience concerning a possible ufo\r\n- i would consider myself an amateur stargazer with a decent amount of knowledge concerning basic astronomy and constellation mapping\r\n- having work experience at an international airport for several years and being a veteran service member of the usaf, i know how an aircraft is resembled in day and night skies and i know how they should be flying\r\n\r\nyes, both of these experiences have been near the augusta regional airport (ags), and yes, i know there have been occasional training flights coming in from warner robbins afb. i can say without a doubt, this was not a conventional aircraft. the first sighting three years ago i had my doubts considering the location i was standing in when i first sighted the lights. originally, i was astounded, but started to have draw it up to a few possible solutions: a piloted drone, lights from more elevated locations in relation to my position, light from the several industrial plants in the area. given the direction, speed, and intensity of these lights, i cannot begin to even fathom what it could have been. one could say it was simply the fuselage light from a passing aircraft, but this would not explain the directional change or its sudden disappearance. or, someone could be flying extremely dangerously and illegally in a high traffic airspace. this latest experience took place in broad open sky. \r\n\r\nas stated previously, i unfortunately do not have picture/video for this most recent sighting. however, i have attached a digital video recording of the first sighting i had on 10feb2015 (almost exactly three years to date). i had caught the very tail end of this one (after the directional change), but you can clearly saw the left most lights going out before the last one drops off. only the first 20 or so seconds of the video contain any of the content.(caution: slight inappropriate language in beginning of film, apologies).

park i unknowingly filmed 50+ ufos traveling overhead. the objects seemed to be timed with the music in my headphones which leads me to believe that they were actually flying overhead with the sole intention of being in the video. at the time of the events i was blissfully unaware that anything had taken place only to later discover in the footage that i had filmed an unsettling amount of traffic. it was lightly snowing throughout the day which gives the benefit of the doubt that they may be snowflakes. that being said it was not windy and the objects were traveling at an alarming rate. despite how the video may appear i was not alone on top of the ridgeline, however i dont believe anyone noticed because of the incredible speed. \r\n\r\nto further my point about them complying with my music video, i have included an image that shows one object literally splitting a light on the end of my hair. the object was seemingly aware of the camera position, as the line up and timing would be literally impossible otherwise. \r\n\r\nthe compiled footage that i have is truly the most substantial abundance of ufos that i have ever seen. when i first reviewed the footage i was so taken back that i nearly threw up.  \r\n\r\nbecause of the nature of the song i was filming and reviewing the footage, it has led me to believe that this may actually be intellegant water. i know that sounds outlandish but i have also included a clip that shows a snowflake hit directly in my back, and then a water object seemingly shoot from my face towards the camera lens. \r\n\r\ni have only included select footage, as i have mentioned, there were literally over 50 to 100. it was so busy that i actually had to edit ufos out of my video. thats craziness. who would edit out ufos.\r\n\r\nhere is a link you can copy paste to my completed video. in almost every clip you can find objects. the most obvious to the naked eye is at 1:55. you can see how they coordinate with my motions.  \r\n\r\nnot featured in the video is a break neck turn made by one of the objects. all of the footage is unbelievable. i should note that they did not make a sound. also by the lake when i appear to be looking at them, i was actually looking at a mountain peak, basically not sure what kind of action i should have been doing.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.Be/6ttfucirlkw\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"04:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

with my story but, the gentleman who interviewed me was deaf or very hard of hearing. so unfortunately there were many details that were not right in the news paper article. so here is my sighting from my mouth.\r\n   around 10:30 or so in mid december 2003. my wife and i were driving home to a town called frederic from visiting some friends in grantsburg. traveling south on hwy 87 just before our turn onto hwy 48 to head east toward frederic we observed a stationary orange light off to the south west over the trees. it looked like the light of a tower but bigger. my wife and i both noticed it at about the same time and had been watching it for a minute or so without saying anything to each other. as we came up to our turn we both looked at each other and asked if the other sees that light. we aknowledged we did and she asked me if there was a tower in that area. growing up in grantsburg i was very familiar with the area and i said \"no there is no tower over there.\" so i said keep driving (she was driving). so we continued past our turn onto 48 and followed 87 south to go and try to see what this light was.\r\n   i think it's important to mention that we were the only car on the road at this time.\r\n   so we continued south and lost sight of the light behind the trees because it is open field until the trees come right up to the side of road just after you pass 48. so we continued to drive and contimplated taking our next right onto cty rd o in order to head the direction the light was over the trees. we decided against it knowing there was a small clearing just after o on the right side maybe we could get a look at what it was from there. as soon as the trees cleared on the right there it was! hovering in the clearing and moving towards us. a large orange rectangular light. it was at this point i noticed that we were in a line of cars. some in front of us and some behind, almost bumper to bumper and all traveling the same speed. the object flew right over the top of us just high enough to clear the trees. it continued until it got to the east or left side of the road and then paralleled us above the trees. as we came up to a clearing on the left side of the road in front of the wood lake bible camp. the lights started to change. not all of them tho. the large rectangular orange light on the back of the craft was made up of small rows of lights each contained in their own large rectangle running horizontally along the back of the entire craft. the lights in the rectangle left of center started turning blue one horizontal row at a time and continuing down row by row. as the second row lit up blue, the rectangle of rows of lights to the right of it did the same thing but turning red this time. as this was happening the craft started to decend down into the clearing along side of the road lower than the trees. at this time we came up along side of it and got a look at the craft itself. the craft was black and shiny. i was looking at the craft for about 10 seconds and then it turned invisible or see through. i could see the trees behind the craft but it was like looking through water at them. at this moment a large white light flashed blindingly bright from the front of the object and 1 to 2 seconds later did it again flashing that blinding white light from the front and the next thing i know it was gone. i looked in front and behind us because i wanted to see if any of the other vehicles were stopped cause i wanted to talk with them about what just happened but there was no other vehicles on the road with us. they had just disappeared. we were all alone on the road again.
