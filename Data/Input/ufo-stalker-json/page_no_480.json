while still following the fast moving orb. that is to say the flashing orb was not on a straight path. the fast orb was solid the whole time, while the white larger pulsating orb, would hover for 10 seconds, then in a huge flash of light, would disappear for 10 seconds, then reappear in a huge white flash of light in a sporadic position, and hover again for another ten seconds. all the while a helicopter was speeding through the sky, chasing after the speeding solid orb. i watched this for about 15 minutes, until they were completely out of my view. the lights were seen traveling from south over tor bay, heading eastward. the pulsating orb was easily 4 times bigger than an airplane light, at its brightest it was the size the moon appears to us. while the solid orb was about the size of a star in the sky. witnessing this was quite shocking honestly, ive never seen anything like it before. i am positive, the crafts were not of known origin.","distance":"Over One

the spot my other friend jumped out the car screaming what is that what is that. he began chasing whatever he saw and later described it as a fireball that just came out overhill directly next to us.

taking a 20 second exposures of an area in the southeastern sky.  when i decided to end the session, i brought the camera inside and went to sleep (it was past 4:30 am at this time).  the next day i went through the images to find those with meteors in the image.  while looking for meteors, i noticed something moving in successive frames.  as i looked further, i saw the object in 118 consecutive images.  it appears as an approximate 7th magnitude dot and moves from the southeast towards the eastern horizon.  as it approaches the final frame, the object appears to speed up.  the final frame shows the object when it is approximately 35-40 degrees above the horizon.  when the object is first seen, it is a small dot, but as the frames progress, the object's tracking length (light trail it left) appears to increase.  after noticing the object, i check the near earth object database to see if there was an asteroid passage near the time i was shooting and did not find anything for that date and time frame which in any way corresponded to the time i was made the images.  not finding anything to identify the object, i sent a description of the what i photographed which included the times, number of images and offered the images to the neo office if they wanted them.  i have not received an reply to this date.  i have also shown the images (i made a small mp4 of the images - small is a misnomer...It is about 5 meg in size and reduced in resolution) to friends of mine who are amateur astronomers and they have no idea of what it is. i am attaching the small video, but be warned, the object is difficult to see, but can be seen.  although the real time movement of the object took about 45 minutes, the video compresses that movement to slightly more than 30 seconds. i have marked the area it first appears with a red arrow.  the object is very difficult to see in the final 20 or so images, but it is there and can be seen better in the original files.  each of the original files is approximately 5.9 meg in size with a resolution of 5184x3456 pixels.  the total size of the 118 files is approximately 1.9 gigs.  if you are interested in the original files, contact me and we will discuss how your can get them.  i really would like to know what it was in the images.  i know it wasn't a meteor, nor was it a satellite.  i am hoping your organization might be able to identify the object.  if it is unknown, maybe it can further someone's research.

object impacting planet jupiter about a week ago i thought it was time to share it.\r\n \r\na little more than three years ago, i was taking long exposures photos of the night sky (15 secs) testing my canon powershot elph. i took around 4 maybe 5 exposures. constellations auriga and parts of taurus, orion and gemini as well as planet jupiter are in the picture. looking at the pictures a couple of days later i noticed what seems to be an object on the west side of jupiter. i'm not sure if it was right next to jupiter or much closer to earth or maybe it is from planet earth but it looks like something that was far away. unfortunately i wasn't looking at the sky on that moment so i don't know how long it lasted. i compare it to an exposure that i took a minute later and the object isn't there. i checked for reflections or trails left due to camera movement during the exposure but couldn't find anything. i also can't understand how this object didn't leave a trail of itself across the sky considering that the picture is a 15 seconds exposure. that means that it was stationary and also rules out the possibility of being a satellite, meteorite or airplane. it's also way too bright to be one of jupiters moons. \r\ni had shown the picture to astrophotographers and friends with basic knowledge of long exposure imaging and they can't understand how the object didn't leave a trail, how is so bright or how was generated.  i even made a side by side picture comparison with the exposure i took a minute later (1 minute and 30 seconds apart to be exact). i rotated the pictures so that up is north-east and enhance them to better show the object shape and how many pixel it covered. the only difference between the two is that the camera was moved a little. the object is tiny but some shape can be appreciated.\r\nmy intention is to give the picture to a professional so that it can be analyzed and determine if this is really an ufo, terrestrial object or if it was caused by something else. \r\ni would like to have an answer and take this out of my head.\r\n\r\nthanks for your

courtyard of the house to go through to garage to retrieve newspaper on the driveway.As i was walking i happened to glance towards the house next door over the fence- eastward and i clearly recognized this craft slowly emerging from a low thick cloud. the craft was elliptically shaped and reflecting the sun tremendously. it was like it was made out of mirror. as i watched  it seemed to recognise my attention towards it as it would slowly retreat back into the cloud then emerge halfway out again a few seconds later. it did this repeatedly. it was a partly cloudy day\r\nand there were patchy thick clouds sparsely spread out through the sky. when i first saw it my reaction was deep terror momentarily as this was not my first interaction with this. my childhood was turned upside down by this phenomena. however, it had been decades since my last conscious interaction, only dreams in between then and now. when i gained my bearings back i rushed back into the house to get binoculars. when i returned it was either gone or never re-emerged from the cloud again. i waited and watched for some time. i know it was 8:30am because i remember looking at the clock on the oven as i ran through the kitchen after the binoculars.I have studied them since childhood starting with library books about the subject. i have come to my own conclusions about them now which i will not discuss here in this type forum. thanks for this outlet.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

night sky of minneapolis, minnesota via a webcam in that city which can be found online at a website called, \"allskycam\". as i watched the night sky via the webcam, i saw that the webcam picked up the very strange image of a cirle of \"dashes\" that glowed white as it hung in the sky. the object was located between the positions of south & west on the webcam and the info registered above the webcam at that particular moment was: \"last upload was : 2016/04/03 02:58  utc.\" \r\n\r\n   again, my first impression of the object was that it was very odd & looked completely out of context, as it was an object consisting of  white, glowing, circular dashes simply hanging there in the sky. i quickly opened up another window on my pc & immediately searched for \"youtube\" videos of \"ufos in minneapolis, minnesota\".\r\n\r\n   to my total shock & absolute amazement, i came across a video entitled, \"the x files of minnesota_ over 100 reported ufo sightings in minnesota each year\". the video lasts 3:07 min.S, but at its introduction at 0:29-0:37 sec.S, a picture of a ufo that had been seen in the minnesota night sky was shown. it was a picture of an object that had the appearance of a circle of glowing, white \"dashes\"! needless to say, it was the exact same object i myself had seen appear on the minneapolis, minnesota webcam & which is probably easily accessible for re-viewing again within the webcam's archives by contacting the owners of the webcam.
