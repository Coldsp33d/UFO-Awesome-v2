i happened to look up and seen this pretty good\r\nsized object falling from our atmosphere. first i thought space shuttle \r\ncause of the size...Maybe the size of an aleve pill. the weird part about this all is that the cloud trail wrapped around the whole object unlike planes with cloud trails coming from the wings. the cloud trail was about thick as a #2 pencil lead and only left a trail 1 1/2 inch long. now when i \r\nthe object was about an aleve pill i mean that was the space the cloud trail wrapped around. i pulled my camera out to try and zoom in to take a pic  ut that was pretty difficult to do cause i was driving and had no place to pull of quickly with an 18wheeler. but from what i could see from my camera was that there was no object inside this cloud trail. what got me to notice this o ject not cause of the size but how it was falling....Falling straight down. it fell for a good 5secs then you could see it level off and was traveling the same direction i was. i say it flew in that direction till it looked like a pimple then took a hard 90° towards the north. then i lost sight of

of us we saw three very bright objects that were in the formation of a triangle.    we knew they were definitely not stars,  so we continue to observe as they hovered above.   that's when we noticed there were numerous black helicopters all around them.    we were not sure what was going on, but it was spectacular so we drove approximately 2 miles and parked.  we videotaped while we were driving and we videotaped when we stopped.   we were focused on the bright lights in the helicopters that were surrounding them.  just before the lights disappeared, my son said he saw lightning.   i did not notice this.   but when we review the videos, the last 5 to 10 seconds of footage went completely white and the sound got knocked out.   after this occurred, all that was left in the sky where the black helicopters who then began to fly away.  \r\n\r\n the first thing we then after arriving home, was watch the videos.    at this point, we still knew something was going on but we were not sure what it was.   much to our surprise, the videos picked up a significant amount more, than what we saw with our eyes.  not only were there the bright lights,  but there were objects pretty much everywhere.   probably the thing that shocked me the most, was when i noticed that there seem to be the bottom of an in normas object moving slowly over our heads.   at several points during the video,  you can see what appeared to be the lights on the bottom of an object.   the lights were blue and they were in the shape of a parallelogram.    i was astonished at the amount of objects that

he sleeps in our bedroom with us in a large doggie bed on the floor.\r\n\r\nour bedroom door was open but all the lights were out and shades were down and curtains drawn.  we were laying there talking, about half an hour into our conversation there was a bright flash of white light which lit up the entire room.  we both immediately got up.  we were trying to figure out what it was.   i asked my boyfriend, did that come from inside or outside?  he said he thought from outside.  if it had come from outside it had to have been pretty bright as it lit up the entire bedroom, and as i have stated our blinds were down and curtains shut, and we have the room darkening curtains.\r\n\r\nwhen we got up out of bed to \"investigate\", our dog who normally stays in his bed was lying half inside the room and half out in the middle of the door way.  i walked out of the bedroom and into the living room, which is just off the bedroom to the front door, tank the dog followed me.  i went outside to see if there were any clouds, perhaps it had been lightening, although we never heard any thunder, but there were stars out, and a clear night sky was observed.\r\n\r\nwe, my boyfriend and i both sat on the couch in living room, trying to figure out what it could have been.  it was so very bright!  after about fifteen minutes my boyfriend went back into the bedroom, i stayed sitting on the loveseat in the living room, which faces our bedroom.  to the left of the bedroom door is a lamp on a table, that we had turned on.  he went into the bedroom, leaving the door open.  i was facing the bedroom when at approximately 1 am another flash occured, this flash was more of a blue white, while the first flash as white light. lighting up just the bedroom.  so i called out to him from the love seat, did you see that?  he said yes, i saw another flash.  i then said it seems to be only in that room.\r\n\r\nhe got up turned on the light in the bedroom for the second time and looked all around, even under our bed.  lol.\r\n\r\ni finally got up the nerve to go back into the bedroom around 2 am and soon fell asleep.  however, our dog who is normally our shadow at all times refused to come back into the bedroom and slept out in the living room all night.  today he really has not gone into the room, unless one of us is with him.\r\n\r\nalso, we live off a very busy road, it is normally well traveled at all times of the day and night.  close to us are two factories.  when we saw the flashes both times, we both observed that there was no traffic at all outside for at least ten mins. before and after.  which is strange.  for instance when i went outside to look at the sky the first time, i told my boyfriend, isn't that strange?  where are all the cars?  it looks deserted out there.\r\n\r\nbecause we live in the town, on a busy road i just need to know did anyone else close to us observe anything like this very early this morning?","distance":"Unknown,

he could watch over my bedroom. which indicates he feels that there's something that could be in my room that i would need protection from. i no longer have a period at 39 and they may have been

valley, nevada near the eureka/lander cournty line.  the night in question we were hauling gravel from a pit in the valley floor.  one time when i arrived at the pit to get a load of gravel the loader operator was standing on the deck of the loader and pointed a light out to me.  it was obivously outside the earth'a atmosphere, or at least several miles above the earth's surface.  the light would travel diagonally down and to the right, then horizonally to the left, back down and to the right, then horizonally to the left, and kept prepeating that pattern several times.  finaly after a final movement down and to the right, it would go up and slightly left so as to arrive at the point of beginning.  it seemed to pause for a second or two at each change in diection.  it would then repeat the manuever, which we watched numerous times before going back to work.  the movements were smooth and at a steady speed, without either acceleration at the beginning of each directional change or deceleration at the end thereof.  considering that the object had to have been in space and the degree of movement, i believe it was covering a considerable distance in a mater of 2 or 3 seconds.  it was dark outside at the time of this observation and i believe it was summer time.  it was in the mid 1980s.\r\n\r\ni have often thought about and wondered what we observed that night.  i have considered the possiblity that it was a satelite, but it is my understanding they do not move that fast.  an aircraft could not make directional changes like that, nor would it be able to make the directional changes without accelerating and decelerating.
