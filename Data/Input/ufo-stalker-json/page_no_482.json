States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My two best friends and i (and my friend's six year old son) went winter camping in our usual spot at handcart campground in pike national forest two nights ago. i will call my friends b & c for sake of anonymity. b & c and i stayed up until about ten p.M. watching the campfire while b's son had gone to bed in the giant tent we were all sharing. we were drinking a few beers and passing around a whiskey flask, but none of us were drunk...Not by a longshot. the sky was absolutely clear with probably the best view of the stars i've ever seen. the three of us put out the fire, climbed into the tent, and went to bed. the wind really picked up shortly after we went to bed. i had a lot of trouble falling asleep, much more than usual when i'm in the woods, but i did eventually doze off. i'm an experienced camper and not generally afraid of the wilderness, but i had a feeling of unease in my gut. it was odd but i chalked it up to the solitude of being at high elevation in the off-season, in an area four miles from the nearest houses and up a road we had to do a lot of rugged four-wheeling to get to.\r\n\r\naround eleven thirty i woke up and had to urinate. my phone said it was 11:30 p.M. i still felt uneasy, just something in the air, i guess, so i threw on my boots and took my 10mm pistol with me. it was very cold so i made it quick. i got out of the tent, did my business, looked around for a moment and climbed back inside. something did not feel right out there. words cannot describe it, but i was not at ease. also, the wind was incredibly loud, which made falling back to sleep impossible. i lay there, restless, for about an hour, until the event happened.\r\n\r\nan especially brutal blast of wind hit the tent and the rainfly battered the top of the structure. that's what made me open my eyes. and that was when i witnessed what appeared to be camera flashes going off just above our tent. just as the wind hit its peak velocity, those lights went off at the same time and lasted for about seven to ten seconds, covering a specific side of the dome's top in an area visible to me of about three feet by two feet. at first, i thought it was lightning accompanying the wind, but i knew there were no (and i mean zero) clouds in the sky that night. i blinked a few times and whispered to my friend c, who was sleeping beside me. there was a muffled response and i asked him if he'd seen that light. i said i thought it might be lightning. there was no further response and i didn't believe anyone else in the tent had either witnessed the lights or even been awake to see them (in the morning i found this was not the case.) for the next ten minutes i stared at the roof of the tent, watching, terrified. my heart was racing, and try as i did, i could not get it to slow down. i exercise regularly and my heart rate was so fast it felt as if i'd just gotten done with a three-mile run. and it would not slow down. i tried to close my eyes and will it to slow, but it was impossible. i am not an overreacting kind of person but i was fairly certain i was at risk of having a heart attack as i lay there. my left arm even tingled off and on. i remember checking the clock on my phone but i cannot recall now what time it read. as the wind battered the tent i heard my buddies shuffle in their sleeping bags and i tried to talk to them again, but again i got no response. so i dug out my hip flask and took a few swigs of whiskey, trying desperately to calm my nerves. it was then i remembered the earplugs that were still in my coat pocket from when we'd gone out down the hillside to shoot rifles earlier that day. i dug them out and put them in my ears to block the sound of the wind and the tent skin flapping against itself. then i could really hear my heart and it scared the hell out of me. at that point, i closed my eyes and tried to breathe as slow and deep as i could. i felt like i was calming, but my pulse still raced and i was wide awake. after what i can only guess was about fifteen minutes since the first pulse of light, another giant blast of wind caught the tent, the worst of the whole night, and i opened my eyes again to see another round of lights, this time green and situated at the opposite side of the tent's top, flashing like paparazzi cameras for about five seconds. it was absolutely terrifying and i didn't know what to think.\r\n\r\nafter that i called out to my friends, not in a whisper, and again i received no response. i could make out their forms in the dark tent so i knew they were there but they didn't respond. i gripped my pistol inside my sleeping bag and felt my shotgun resting right beside the bag. but neither of them brought me comfort.\r\n\r\nafter that second round of lights the wind died down some. not completely, but a fair amount. my heart still pounded and i put the foam earplugs back in, trying to drive out all other input but my own thoughts. i don't know how long i lay there, but it felt like probably an hour passed as i tried, unsuccessfully to calm my pulse. the next thing i knew i was waking up to early morning light. i had managed to fall asleep at some point and was eternally grateful to see the sunlight playing at the edges of our tent through the trees.\r\n\r\nmy friends all woke up relatively soon after that, and i asked them was if they'd seen the lights. my friend b's face said everything. and the first thing he said was he thought he was going to have a heart attack. he repeated an experience that was identical to mine above, including the inability to slow his heart and having pain in his left shoulder associated with it until he finally passed out. the exception to his story being he also heard a series of shrill mechanical beeps just before the second round of lights (something i decided i must have missed due to the earplugs). he also said he heard me ask about lightning after the first flashes but never heard anything else from me, possibly because of the noise of the wind. our friend c did not witness any of the lights or sounds but said he did not sleep well at all, partly because of the wind, but also partly because he didn't feel right. the child slept fine and didn't wake up once, despite the wind.\r\n\r\nwe made it back down the mountain and home yesterday morning. we didn't even stick around to make breakfast, which we traditionally always do. i looked around in the snow in the area surrounding our tent but didn't find any tracks, but to be honest, i didn't attempt to look too hard. we broke camp, packed up, and got the hell out of there. i slept much better in my own bed last night, though thinking of the event still makes me shudder. i'm still processing it. it terrified me. and as a lover of camping and the outdoors, it pains me to say that i have no desire to go camping again anytime soon.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

sighting with you that happened in morrilton ar back in 2010. my band was setting up for a weekend gig at a club named joses at around 9pm and on a return trip to get a load out of our trailer i noticed lights moving north to south almost driectly above us at approx the height single engine planes usually fly (1-2000 ft?) they were brightly lit spherical objects - white upper half / red bottom half like a fishing bobber; slowly moving individually in tight yet seemingly random formations and they never got closer or further away from each other or deviated in altitude. they were not connected to each other either- we could see stars between them as the passed us. as they passed our position they would fade out rather quickly. the craziest thing about it was that we saw wave after wave of these objects go by; 12 to 15 object waves at a time and actually had to quit watching them so we could continue setting up our band equipment. each wave was separated by approx. 1000 ft. i got on top of the club in attempt to see better (looking for a plane or something dropping flares) but only saw more and more coming towards us. one of the club owners was on the ground and hollered out \"i'm up to 50 now\" as he was counting them. major wtf moment.\r\n\r\nthere were 7 of us that saw these things and unfortunately cell phones weren't good enough to get video of them, although we tried. they were not flares....I've looked at lots of flare videos. i'm not saying we saw alien ships\r\nbut don't have a clue what they were. and for the record-we had just arrived at the club and no smoking or drinking had taken place yet! i would say i personally saw well over a hundred pass over. the long trail of them had to be crossing over i-40 which was directly north of our location. we were all pretty amazed and excited but felt no fear about seeing them. we are all willing to talk about it in a public forum if desired. thanks for what you (peter) and others do. i wish i had the

in a direct linear flight path.  at the time, the sky was clear of cloud cover and my friend and i were standing by his truck drinking a couple beers.  we starting talking about other odd occurrences and tried to interpret them.  my friend refers to ufo's as travelers.  no sooner than he said that, i just happened to look up and saw what i thought to be a star, but it was moving.  it was moving in a straight line from the north to the south.  i immediately got my friend's attention and pointed at the object.  i tried to record the light with my phone, but the light was too dim to be seen on the camera phone even after i zoomed in.\r\n\r\ni put my phone up and looked at the sky again.  amazingly, their was another light that i had thought was a star, but a lot brighter.  it was hovering in the sky like a star before it started its flight path.  this second light was not only brighter, but followed the same flight path to the south.  this time, i got to record it.  this was not a shooting star.  i have seen them and this was not it.  no sound was heard and the objects were flying at a high rate of speed.  shortly after the second light, i saw was appeared to be a jet following the same flight path.  judging by the sound of the afterburner, i believe it may have been an f/a-18.  after being in the military for several years, i am pretty sure of that.  the only thing that would be close to that sound would be a harrier jet or an f-22 raptor.  we watched the whole thing until we could no longer see them.\r\n\r\nthis is the fourth encounter i have seen in the same

continued down the trail for approximately 1 minute to find a better view. i observed the object for another minute before losing sight of it below the horizon. it was twilight and visibility was too low to observe a landing site. at the approximate distance of 2 miles, i estimated its height to be between 30-50 feet. this flight path looked to be within 2 miles of sky harbor airport in phoenix and i thought it was unusual for any hot-air balloon or leisure craft to be so close to a major airport. i can't think of an explanation for this object. it looked like a deflated hot-air balloon, but it was moving too slow to be a crash-landing balloon. there was no movement from the upper portion, like a deflated balloon might have. the body of the object looked solid and well formed with definite edges. and the angled appendage from the bottom was very unusual. i took a 15 second video during the first minute observation and a single picture. no media from the 2nd viewing location. i

wasn't stationary but was moving. i recorded the movement, which was all over the place and changing direction rapidly. up, down, left, right, kitty corner. it did seem to dim once or twice and eventually just seemed to disappear. it was there and then it wasn't. the object i seen was larger and brighter than it appears in the video. i cannot explain what i saw. i have no idea what it was.

sure got a lot of pictures.  here are the details of our event.\r\n  the date was october 23, 2015.  our location was in south/east hemet, california.  i was driving my truck, heading west with shane, my passenger.  the sun was going down.  \r\n  i had such a very strong urge to get pictures of the sunset.  i mentioned it to shane several times while driving down the mountain from idyllwild.  \r\n  we were at a red light on e. florida ave, waiting to turn left onto fairview.  i informed shane that i was soon going to pull over somewhere, so we could photograph the sunset.  with that, shane pulled out his cell phone and took some quick pictures. the light turned green, i turned left and drove about a mile before making a right onto stetson ave.\r\n   now we were in the orange groves, where i pulled over onto the dirt, facing west as the sun was going down.\r\n  it was pretty uneventful, as we made small talk while snapping off random pictures of the sunset with our phones.  we were mellow; just enjoying the moment.  after about 10 minutes, i started the truck, and took shane home.  \r\n  sorry, but that's it.  nothing happened; we certainly didn't see any ufo's or even think of them.  in fact, we didn't see any kind of aircraft as we sat in that orange grove. \r\n  i didn't even take the time to look at my pictures till about a month later, when i exported them to my computer.  \r\n  i have studied these pictures almost every day for the last five months, and i have many opinions as well as questions.  i would like you to come to your own conclusions; and i would appreciate any opinions or insight.    \r\n  thank you for your time and consideration; i am happy to have discovered your website.\r\n\r\n  \r\n               ","distance":"20 Feet or

p.M. to approximately 12:00 a.M. the next da: witnessed 12+ ufo's from a range of 200 - 3000 feet from my position. i was able to observe the underside of a thin boomerang shaped craft 200 to 300 feet from my position, with a wingspan of 50 to 80 feet. it's underside was comprised of many intricate plates with deep black borders, and smooth corners. the center and edges were comprised of simpler patterns. this craft had no surface color but the 7 small, rectangular white lights aligned close to the anterior. it moved silently at about 10 mph in a straight path for 5 out of the 7 seconds i was able to observe it, before taking a sharp right turn in front of my garage of which i stood behind. i couldn't believe what i had just witnessed, realizing that i should have chased after it instead of standing still trying to process the thoughts running through my head. i took steps back, frantically looking around to see if i saw it again. my aunt later pulled into the drive way, and i rushed towards her trying to explain what i saw, only to have her sarcastically say she believed me. i stayed outside while she went inside, and not even 5 minutes later i saw another ufo: 600 to 800 feet from my position, this object was a bright yellow mist in the shape of an arrowhead , with its anterior corners separated, moving silently at about 30 mph. it's wingspan was 100 to 150 feet across. the corners instantly merged into the center of the craft as if they were non-solid after about 5 seconds of observing it, to then zoom into the distance at speeds of at least 200 mph(faster than anything i have ever seen before). i was shocked, my heart racing. i thought i was hallucinating. 10 minutes after running around my house staring into the clear night sky, i decided to stand in front of my house for a wider, clearer view. looking upwards down the street, i see a \"letter t\" light formation descending from 600 to 800 feet high, estimated to be 400 feet high when it moved just above me down the street at 40 to 60 mph. as it descended i couldn't help but focus on the front lights, as it was made of 4 pure white ovals of 2 distinct sizes: both on each end were around 80 feet long while the 2 middle ovals were around 50 feet long. the tail was comprised of pure, white circles with radii of about 70 feet. i say pure, because i observed identical lights create a wide-angled boomerang formation only 100 to 200 feet above my house while the entire formation rotated counter clockwise, yet i couldn't see any depth or physical structures surrounding these lights.(i'll come back to this sighting). as it passed above me, my eyes retracted to yet another ufo. once again, only fainter: a yellow arrowhead of mist passing under the \"letter t\" formation at 40 to 60 mph. only this time its corners were not separated, and again: this craft did not seem to be solid as it looked like a triangular yellow cloud of dust moving into the distance above the rest of the neighborhood. i looked back that the \"letter t\" formation as it descended near ground 700+ ft away past the treeline and above yet another neighborhood. words came out of my mouth naturally, as i attempted to record these things with my phone. not even 10 minutes later, yet another one of these \"letter t\" formations appeared roughly at the same altitude i initially spotted the previous \"letter t\" formation. the circles comprising the tails were never in a symmetrrical pattern, and i observed 5 to 6, and 3 of which i can remember accurately. this second formation i witnessed only had 4 circles forming the tail, but what i was more observant of was the formation of lights making the front part of these ufo's. they seemed faint from afar, but as the object descended, i could see the same exact shape and size as the previous \"letter t\" formation. from all the \"letter t\" formations i could observe, these 4 lights seemed to be elevated in comparison to the lights forming the tail. i assume that because the tail is comprised of individual ufo's, that some structure must extend above them coming from the front part of the craft. assuming this is correct, the lights forming the tail must be emanating from crafts of a height that is relative to the difference in elevation of the lights forming the front and the lights forming the tail. this difference in elevation was about 40 to 60 feet. but what is strange is that i was never able to observe anything else but the lights coming from these  light formations including the other 5+ boomerang/triangular formations of identical circular lights. (the first boomerang shaped light formation i mentioned was the only symmetrrical light formation i witnessed during this 3 hour event). keep in mind that i did attempt to record many of these ufo's with my cellphone in 4k, however after reviewing all the videos it seemed the camera was unable to capture the light from any these objects. after witnessing the third \"letter t\" formation, i witnessed a unique ufo in the distance at 1000 to 3000 feet from my position: blue light in the shape of a triangle with extensions protruding from each corner continuing into the center. this craft rotated counter-clockwise and moved at speeds of at least 100 mph at an altitude of 200 to 400 ft. the center had a pattern too blurry for me to clearly observe, as i was only able to observe this ufo for a little less than 7 seconds before it faded into the distance. not long after that i witnessed one of the last \"letter t\" formations i remember. this one stood out to me as there were many lights aligned along the right side of the last 4 or 5 lights, and as usual it followed roughly the same straight path as the previous \"letter t\" formations. these \"letter t\" formations appeared between 5 - 15 minute intervals. shortly after seeing these, things didn't get any less stranger. i began to witness fast moving asymetrical formations of the same circular lights. they tilted like giant winged animals as they took wide turns over the neighborhood towards the direction of the second ufo sighting i mentioned(southwest). this was the case with all of the remaining ufo's i witnessed. i cannot remember the exact order in which i saw these formations, however i can accurately remember the appearance of 3 out of the 5 or 6, all from a range of 100 to 800 feet when nearest to my position. in no particular order, here is how they appeared and behaved: \r\n1. an approximately 140° wide boomerang formation of pure white, perfectly flat, circles, rotated counter-clockwise as a whole while moving at about 30 mph, 100 to 200 feet above me and my house as 3 of these circle aligned themselves (individually) at the left end to form a symmetrrical pattern, to then tilt almost 90° and take a wide left turn over a small school near my home as i chased after it. it had gained significant speed after moving about 200 feet after forming into a symmetrrical formation(100+ mph). i decided to use flash whilst recording some of these formations in hope that it would attract attention(may seem unbelievable), however nothing happened as a consequence of that action. this formation was made of 17 to 19 circular white lights.\r\n2. similar to formation #1, only it had another 2 circles to the left of the last 2 circles at the right end. this formation remained tilted the entire time it was observed 500 to 800 feet when nearest to my position and 300 to 600 feet high, moving at speeds of 100+ mph.\r\n3. at first glance, it seemed like i was watching the big dipper moving at speeds of 200+ mph, however it was a symmetrrical, triangular formation making the front, while the back was made of 5 - 6 lights on the right end and 2 on the left end. the right end formed a trapezoidal formation. also remained tilted the entire time observed roughly at the same distance as formation #2. all of these formations tilted just under 90° leftward. \r\nthese were the last of the ufo's witnessed at around 12 a.M the next day. the only people who i saw outside were the few drivers who may have seen me running up and down the streets looking up into the sky. to my disappointment, it seemed as though nobody else witnessed any ufo's that night as i decided to report this to mufon, only to have them dismiss my case and deemed to be \"unbelievable\". after much thought, i have come up with several explanations as to what i saw with these points in mind:\r\n1. all ufo's observed were near ground level, under 800 feet in altitude when initially spotted, with some as low as 100 - 200 feet as observed.\r\n2. all were silent, even from close proximity.\r\n3. cloaking technology was observed in first ufo sighting, signifying the need for stealth.\r\n4. the flat, white, circles never had differences in elevation to one another even when in the process of alignment.\r\n5. no solid structures were observed other than the first ufo sighting.\r\n6. all circular and oval lights could not be determined as emanating from structures who came in physical contact with one another. \r\n7. the need to separate and realign may signify the need to transfer physical material from one craft to another.\r\n8. as some of these objects were clearly unresponsive to light signals from the ground,that may suggest that they are not designed to observe terrestrial objects.\r\n9. the boomerang shaped craft i was able to observe was no more than 8 feet from bottom to (observable)top, at its thickest part(center). this may suggest that these crafts are merely for stealthily abducting subjects and transporting them from one place to another, unless the space inside is somehow larger than outside of the craft itself. \r\n10. as all of the formations of circular lights tilted, the lights became flat, and  almost invisible as they moved into the distance. also, these lights were fainter when viewing their top side than when viewing their bottom side, may be because i was not able to observe their top side for long as they moved fast when tilted. \r\n11. if these indivivual crafts forming these light formations were able to tilt at 90°, does that not effect an anyway what goes on within these individual crafts? \r\n12. all letter t formations remained perfectly flat as they descended. i was never able to observe any directional changes in their paths.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

watching television in the family room). from the southwest, 4 bright, orange-red objects came in from over a kilometer away. my sister came outside during our commotion and was also witness to it. the lights followed each other, single-filed in a path, in a zig-zagging path. the lights continued moving east/northeast and took <30 seconds for them to approach from the southwest to disappear from our sight in the eastern horizon. groups of up to (at least) 6 would come at a time. time varied between each \"fleet\" of orbs, ranging up to a minute. i counted 16, but my mother, who witnessed it first, possibly saw more. the total time of the encounter was around 10 minutes. after it stopped, we went inside as we thought there were no more. residential traffic was normal in our area, but we didn't speak to any of our neighbors about it.\r\n\r\n  we originally thought the lights were sky lanterns, in celebration for a wedding or other events, the single-file pattern of the lights, the speed at which they were moving (less than 30 seconds to come from the southwest to exit in the east, as a weather spotter, i know no wind at an altitude of around 500 feet would be able to carry an object that fast), and the erratic zig-zag and swerving motions would make this very, very unlikely. also, as the akron-canton airport is less than 20 minutes from our house, along with state restrictions on who can light sky lanterns and other recreational pyrotechnics in urban areas, this also debunks the possibility of sky lanterns.\r\n\r\n one passenger jet was observed 20 minutes before the sighting.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

minutes, these lights that were hovering above a skyscraper caught my eye. the lights of the skyscraper case a shadow of the oval object with red and green lights. at first i thought it was a helicopter because it seemed liked it was about to land above the building. but it started to move up and down at random periods of time and that wasn't normal. that is when i realized it wasn't a helicopter. i ran inside to tell my family about it and they came out as well to see what i saw. after we kept observing it it kept hovering up and then it suddenly started to move towards the east
