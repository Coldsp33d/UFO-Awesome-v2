States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a weeknight, wednesday i believe was the day, about 1:20am in the morning, we are retired and at the time lived in a 24 apartment complex in augusta kentucky, most people there are retired or disabled in some way, so many sit up late and in warm weather as it was that night were up late and we usually like to sit outside, my wife and i were watching tv, when we heard activity in the hallway, we went out and 1 neighbor said they were watching a large lighted object rising up from the river, but you could not see the river, only over the tops of the houses in town, then you knew where the river was, they said it had risin up as they were sitting out front, about 8 neighbors, men, women, ages varied from 23 to 55, i went out with them and we all saw what appeared to be a large object with lights, just hovering what appeared to be the river in the same spot, they said they saw it rise up from, it was about 4 miles or so at most from our building to the river, but you could tell it was a large object on a clear night.\r\ni ran back to my apartment and told my wife and that i was going to get in the van and drive down to check it out, she was not dressed for a ride, so she stayed home, i told the other neighbors i was heading down there and to keep an eye on it.\r\ni drove down to 2nd street about 4 1/2 blocks down, the street directly across from our apartment driveway entrance, the next street over is river drive the main road that goes by the river, before i got to that next block right at 2nd street, this huge object flew over the trees between those 2 streets and i stopped, it was going straight in the direction i had just come from and coming from the river, it was moving very slowly, i turned right and began moving up 2nd street, it was just barely above the trees, i turned to my left onto 2nd street and followed it, i got directly under it.\r\ni had my head out the window as i drove with 1 hand, watching it all the way down 2nd street, at least 4 or 5 blocks, i don't remember my speed, but i was barely moving, as it was just slowly moving, i got to the 4-way stop in augusta at the intersection of 2nd & main street.\r\ni stopped at the stop sign, and the object stopped above the 4 corner intersect, just barely above the buildings, i think it stopped 1st then i stopped at the stop sign, to my right is a 2 story building that is an old antique store, to the left is a 20 car or so parking lot, across from that lot and to the far left corner from me is a 2 story old style old time bank, us bank, it'a a good sized old style bank, to the far right corner is a very small park with a few trees and bench, then down each side of the street are rows or stores and buildings, all about 2 story.\r\n\r\nthis object was just above the builds, i was 52 at the time, if i had had a baseball, i probably could have just above thrown it high enough to hit the object, i looked all over for anyone, usually this down dies down by 9pm on a weeknight as nothing remains open, and only on weekends at certain days is a police officer on duty that time of night, i saw no one, i wanted to yell to get their attention if i had, this object just sat stationary above me, of course it seemed like awhile, but i would say less than 2 minutes, or maybe even 1 minute, i got out of my van and stood directly under it and i could see it as clearly as any of the buildings, the town has lights and they did not hinder my view of the object.\r\n\r\nthe size was bigger than all 4 corners and the bank, the parking lot, the store on the other corner and the park, it probably extended down another 2 or more buildings down in size.\r\n\r\nthe shape was triangle, but all 3 corner, were flat not pointed, the flat corners were long flat ends, definitely several feet in length, just on these 3 flat ends of the triangle.\r\n\r\nit had a row of lights all the way around it, spread out, not on the edge, but just a little bit inside the edge, it had no markings, no windows i could see, nothing that looked like a door, but it had ridges all over it, it appeared to be like some type of metal, it looked dark, it had a solid heavy build look to it, the ridges looked like thick steel structure or some type of metal, i have always been a military plane person, i love models and books and history on them, and also naval ships, warships from the civil war on up, and the thing that reminded me most of the outside look of this thing, was an old civil war ironclad, that sort of very thick looking old type of metal with a lot of ridges spaced out around it, it was nowhere near a smooth structure like any military or space rocket or anything i had ever previously scene, i describe it best as a huge iron looking triangle shape with lights, just solid and heavy looking, i could not get a good view of the height as i was directly under it.\r\n\r\ni yelled at it, i think i said, who are you, is anyway inside, can you hear me., after a minute or 2 at most if that, it turned left and headed up main street, it started from the ohio river direction, which was noth of my position, when it went down 2nd street that was heading west, when turned and headed up main street that was south.\r\n\r\nthe entire time, i never heard a sound, it was a quiet, non windy night, i could have heard a pin drop, other than myself and my van, even as it moved and as it sat stationary, it never made 1 single sound, it never emitted anything, no gas, no stream,nothing, that amazed me at the time besides the fact of what i was seeing.\r\n\r\ni followed up main street to 4the street where you must turn left or right, or vear to the right and go up that short street to the main road on route 8, which comes out at the local gas station with a store init, it was closed.\r\n\r\nas it got closer to 4th street it picked up speed, on the other side of route 8, just behind the gas station and all down that side of route 8 is a big set of hills/mountains, not huge but good sized, as it reached 4th street it was picking up speed and i could not keep up, and it was also lifting in height at the same time, by the time it hit route 8 and crossed it, it was lifting to a height that sent it up and over the hills and it was moving much faster and disappeared over the hills quickly and it was gone.\r\n\r\ni went back to the apartments and my wife and everyone were still out watching, they had been watching it the whole time and could see it, and everything i told them, they all said they could see the object doing just what i had described, they could not fully tell what it was, as just appeared like a huge darker object with lights around it to them, from that distance they could not make out anywhere near the details i did.\r\n\r\ni was glad they observed the whole thing, it confirmed to me, that i was not going crazy and that i really did see what i know that i saw, for some reason, i just did not seem to get the feeling it was any type of alien spacecraft, growing up i had always had an interest in ufo's, but the shape of this, and the look and surface of it, was nothing like any ufo i had ever read or see photos of or seen in a movie or anything, i was more use to seeing a saucer or cigar shape or something along those lines, and something with more of a smoother surface, maybe for that reason, i thought this might be man made.\r\n\r\nbut i have never seen or heard or read about anything we have like this.\r\n\r\ni was also never scared of it and never got any scared or bad feelings the whole time, i was excited and slightly nervous as i had no idea what it was or who was driving this thing, i thought for a moment if it were alien, i could be in trouble, and then if it were military, i still could be in trouble. but mostly i just concentrated on the object, i have always been a very calm person, always the one to go to in an emergency as i am always, calm, cool an collected, that's what has made me a good security person and a good baseball umpire and a sports coach in high school, i am always calm in any situation, and always observing and being aware of what and who is around me.\r\n\r\nmy final thoughts, and what struck me most, it was just above the trees initially and then the buildings, which were all about the same height, it was huge, again looked thick and solid built, no sound at all, it could move slow enough if i had been walking i could have kept up, yet it hovered stationary with no sound at all, and then it could pick up enough speed and height to quickly disappear of the nearby hills again without making a single sound of any kind, it was clearly the most amazing thing i had ever seen, and since it was so close to me, i made no mistake about exactly and 100% what i described above was what i had seen.\r\n\r\nmy background is, i graduated hs, went 2 years to a vocational school for law enforcement to be a police officer, got married had 4 kids, lived in cincinnati, ohio most of my life, got a job at the post office and worked for nearly 20 years there, before retiring early, and went into security, where i was loss prevention director at a marriot hotel in cincinnati for 3 years before getting injured on the job by 2 thugs that broke in and assaulted and injured me, i've been reitred here in augusta since, we have since moved up and over the line of hills i described here, and we live on a road near the top of these hills now, for 3 years, since that incident.\r\n\r\ni was the only witness to be that close to it, but at least 8 others including my wife were back in the apartment parking lot watching it from there the whole time.\r\n\r\nat that time, i had the old style flip phone and nothing to take a photo with.\r\n\r\ni have made no attachments to this record, but if needed i can send at anytime my drawing of the object, but i think i gave a pretty good descriptin\r\n\r\nthank you\r\nrob spencer","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

car with the parents of our close neighbors, along with their 4 children.  we were headed home after going to downtown anchorage to the movies.  at this time of year it was very dark and the area at that time was lightly populated.  there was a house on the west side of jewel lake road one block further south than 84th avenue, which was owned by a well-known ham radio operator. he had multiple, very high antennas, with blinking red lights. as we crested the hill at sand lake elementary school, all of us, and nd i mean all 7 of us observed a grey/bright flying sauce-like, domed object hovering over the ham radio operator's house.  we drove towards it for several minutes, with the adults gasping and crying out \"it's a ufo\".  we turned east onto 84th avenue, the street where both mine and their houses were located.  the object never moved, just hovered and it just got bigger as we approached then veered away to go home. my family remain friends with this family and the father

might as well tell you my story before i get too old. i am 50 years old and this happened to me in 1973, when i was 8 years old. it was in july, mid afternoon, blue sky andn i was playing outside with a few friends on a gravel lot near my home. the cicadas were cranking up the volume, announcing the heatwave that day. in one instant, everything changed. no more cicada sounds, no birds sounds, insects, nothing. the air around us fell dead silent. what followed immediately after was a tremedous electrical sound, like static filling the air and our bodies. it was so loud that i covered my ears while staring up in the air to find the culprit of this deafening noise....And i did. staring at 45 degrees up, over my friends house, the sky just..Opened. i say opened because what i saw were metal discs appearing in the cloudless sky, one after the other in a triangle formation. i will never be sure of the exact amount of discs that appeared but it was either 3 or 5 of them and in a triangle formation. they were solid, shiny silver discs, maybe 30 feet in diameter. they were about 50 feet up in the air, just a little above tall tree level and they were very slowly coming right above my head. the only adult that i know saw them was the mother of 2 friends that were with me. she came out of her house screaming at the top of her lungs to get her kids in the house. me? i just stood there, frozen. i cannot remember being scared, but i do remember my body feeling numb from the static noise all around me. as they were approaching me, i could see the reflection of the street on the bottom of the discs. sadly, this is all i can remember of this event. i have no recollection of ever speaking of this to anyone that day. my mind is still blank. this was 1 of 3 major similar events that happened to me that summer. to this day, only one person knows my story. at the age of 49 ( last year), what i thought were 3 distinct , separate events, all meshed into 1 singular event, but that is another story. weird the first word that comes to mind while writing this, but i do think that writing my story is the right thing to do. thank you","distance":"21-100
