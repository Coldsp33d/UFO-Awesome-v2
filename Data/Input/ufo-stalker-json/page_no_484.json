that she was sat up in bed just relaxing when the room suddenly went cold..She says that a figure appeared at the door,she couldn't make out any features on the being but explained it as having an orange glow,she felt paralysed too,only able to move her eyes..The figure slowly glided over to her,bent down and kissed her on her chest..It then glided back to the door where it disappeared.The room warmed up immediately and she was no longer paralysed..This is how she told the story to me..She died of lung cancer in feb 1985..I had no idea what to make of this story until i saw one of your programmes and got a chill down my spine when i heard somebody else describe a very similar experience...I've also had missing time in my twenties..During an evening drive home from weymouth to gillingham in dorset england, i had made this journey on numerous occaisions..But this particular time i have no recollection of the journey except when i came to as i was approaching a t-junction, it felt as tho i'd been asleep and had just woken up.I was alone in the car and had no idea how i came to be where i was..I almost crashed the car...About 5 years after this event i was asleep in bed and woke up with what felt like some broken ribs on my right side..I put my hand on the affected area and felt three large lumps that had broken the skin and scabbed over..I had assumed that i'd been bitten but nothing i know could leave three wart sized lumps or give the impression of broken ribs..Furthermore i stripped the bed and found nothing that could have inflicted these wounds on me...I now feel that its important to share this information..Thank you..","distance":"20 Feet or

light to the east. i thought it was too far up to be from a tower. when i went inside to go to bed i realized i had not gotten the mail. i got my keys and went back outside. the lights in the east were gone and then i noticed a large diamond shaped object going overhead. it had a white light on each point and a flashing red light. i had my phone in my pocket so i snapped a bunch of pictures while it passed over me. it continued on a straight course to the west and out of sight. i got my mail and went inside to look at the pictures. at first they looked like blank frames, but on one i noticed a pinprick of white. i zoomed in and cropped the image. i had to do this to all of the pictures to see the object. the whole time the object appeared to me as a diamond shape, but the pictures have different appearances. i have only lived out in the country for about five months. three times i've seen what at first looked like a star in the east that then began moving  in a north to south direction and then made a sharp right turn and continued moving west. the object i saw last night seemed large and quite low, much lower than an aircraft of that size would normally be traveling. pictures taken on my phone appear smaller and farther away than in person. hope the fact that i zoomed in and cropped them doesn't mess up what you need to see.

appeared at first to be a multi-colored star. while outside gazing at the few stars, which i do periodically on a clear night, i felt it was located at about 1,000-2,000 feet agl across the willamette river west of downtown salem near or above west salem. that is w-sw of my home.\r\n\r\nas i watched it and noted its bigger size compared to other stars, i saw many colors changing on its surface. i had seen one stationary star/planet hundreds times over many years with that appearance, but now i could see that this one moved slowly in short smooth motions in various directions. that motion gave it away. i thought something may be skewing my line of site as i lost sight of it once, so i moved a little to ensure my view wasn't being blocked. it wasn't. the object was slowly moving around, but not like a hovering helicopter or an aircraft.\r\n\r\ni got my binoculars from inside the house and saw the object had moved a little more but was acting in a similar fashion. i brought the binoculars to my eyes to improve my view and it moved slowly up to the right. i pulled the binoculars down and then it slowly went dark with no quick movements in any direction. there were no clouds in the sky.\r\n\r\nhaving never reported a ufo, this time i felt it was important to report it.  previously i'd seen something like this a few times over the years and dismissed it. \r\n\r\nmy question is has anyone else in this area reported what i saw tonight?\r\n\r\ni feel we're not the only inhabited planet in any universe, and that too much evidence exists to in downplay or deny that earth has been visited by ufos for decades if not hundreds of years.  as a retired air force/air national guard officer (non-flyer) i have 2 former military colleagues who have each seen a ufo... on and near the ground in england (1980) and airborne over redmond, oregon (1958 or 59). both sightings have been previously documented. neither man would confirm what they saw but didn't deny that something

it was dark. at about 6.30pm off in the distance in a paddock to my left front (south side) i saw what i thought was a ring of fire in a paddock. i didnt think much of it at the time as i thought it could be  a farmer burning off.  it initially looked like individual flames set a distance apart in a large circle. they were orange and red in colour and appear to be pulsating.  as i got closer i slowed my vehicle down for a better look. my vehicle was now travelling at walking speed. i could not see the hull of the craft. i could only see pulsating red and orange lights that were rotating around the craft in a clockwise direction. it appeared to be about 30m in diameter and was in a stationary position in the paddock like it had landed. i was both shocked and excited at this time. i then thought to myself ill get my phone out of my top shirt pocket and take a picture so i could examine it later and make sure it was not my imagination. as soon as i thought of the camera and looked down to get it out of my pocket the light/craft disappeared?  i could not stop and investigate it any further as i was on my way to work.

downtown seattle, right next to space needle, with 4 friends, preparing for dinner. mostly clear skies (a few clouds toward horizon, nothing above), just about/after sunset, sky still bluish but fading (getting dark).\r\n\r\nas i looked toward space needle, saw what first seemed like a fast jet coming from the east, heading due west (toward puget sound), slightly to the north of us. not a sound (throughout sighting). had 2 white blinking lights  (pulsating in unison at approximately 1 hz), as if each wing (l/r) had big white light covering most of wing surface, but could not discern forward fuselage or tail, hence looked like it was a flying straight wing. still thought it could be airplane despite unusual white lights pattern (am familiar with airplanes; am engineer working in aerospace) and soundless (thought it might be much higher than it seemed); for instance despite white lights flashing, thought they could still be landing lights.\r\n\r\nobject flew in straight line while displaying white pulsating lights, very fast but at perceived constant linear speed, as it subtended an angle of approximately 45 degrees from my viewpoint and initial spotting. covered this angle in not more than 10 seconds. given estimated altitude of twice the height of the space needle or more, that would still be very fast for a soundless flight; much too fast for a small drone, or for a helicopter if higher in altitude (yet could not be high enough to be soundless, which would have meant extremely fast).\r\n\r\nmentioned helicopter because object came to a complete stop in less than one second, almost right after passing past space needle which occulted it for 3-4 seconds. remained stationary for about 5 seconds, then made in about 2 seconds a lateral translation equivalent to about 1.5 times angle subtended by top circular portion of space needle, at 90 degrees from original flightpath, i.E. toward south; stopped again. very fast acceleration & deceleration in all moves. then started displaying characteristic red/green position lights pattern and proceeded east in somewhat arced trajectory until losthe from sight within 10-15 seconds. happened too fast to get colleagues to also witness sightning, when i brought it to their attention colleague nearest to me didn't succeed in spotting it despite my pointing toward it, as it quickly became difficult evendors for me to track. complete loss of sight by the time it had covered another approximately 30 degrees in direction of puget sound.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
