time. my wife and i were watching the \"blood moon” together. a short time passed when i started to look at the mostly clear night sky around the moon for constellations, single stars, high-flyers and satellites. after a few minutes of looking, i saw what i thought was a satellite. it was traveling normally, satellite-like, from ssw to the nne at a steady rate of speed. it passed under the full lunar eclipse event which was occurring ese at approximately 50 to 60 degrees above the se horizon. suddenly the object curved in a fairly large arc to the right and began going east at a very high rate of speed till it disappeared. my wife's eye sight is not very good and the object was too dim for her to see but i was able to describe to her what was going on. satellites don't turn or curve so my first impression was that it was an extremely high-flyer, likely to be a military jet too far away to hear. the next day i told one of my co-workers what i had seen, telling him that it was unlike anything i had seen before as an adult.\r\n\r\non march 27th, last easter night around 9:10 pm, that september 27th 2015 sighting was no longer a \"one of\" event. my wife and i had just returned home from spending easter sunday with our daughter and grandson. i had just finished unloading the mini-van and i looked up to enjoy the clear sky and the many stars. the moon had not risen yet, so the brightest object was one of the planets. i think it is jupiter situated about 55 to 60 degrees above the western horizon in the sw part of the sky. both orion and the big dipper were also prominent in their proper locations. i was looking nearly due south about 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon. in this location there are 3 stars proximal to each other that form a slightly tilted triangle or pyramid. the star at the top of the triangle is slightly brighter than the other two. calling straight up from that star 12 o’clock, jupiter is in about 2:30 position and maybe another 20 degrees higher. i noticed a faint object above the star at the top of the triangle in about the 12:30 position and nearly equal distant from the top star as the other stars forming the triangle. at first it appeared to be stationary, then it shot south southeast at a very high rate of speed. initially it looked like a falling star because it trailed light behind it, but then it slowed and started to maneuver curving first to the left then to the right as it moved southerly till it faded out of sight. i knew instantly it was similar to the object i had seen september 27th of 2015; however, this is where it became different. in the same location that i first saw the phenomenon above the top star, after a minute or so, i saw another dim white lighted object appear. it also looked like a dim stationary star, but while looking at it for a second or two, it too shot off. this time the object moved to the northwest passing under jupiter at a very high rate of speed. it faded out of sight at about the 5:30 position relative to jupiter. at this point i ran to the house opened the front door and told my wife that the object from last september was back. her reaction to this was what i expected, so i shut the door and went back into the front yard and started watching the sky above the triangle of stars to the south. always from the same spot in the night sky, these objects appeared to be “born.” i watched maybe as many as twenty of these objects take off from the same location. they went in different directions, some appeared to maneuver and go in circles before shooting off at extremely fast rates of speed. others moved off slowly fading out of view in fairly straight trajectories. a high flying jet flew under one of the objects while i was watching it maneuver which convinced me that what i was witnessing was taking place in the upper atmosphere, if not higher.\r\nwhen my next door neighbor came out of his house and called him over to me. i asked him how his eye sight was. i then explained to him what was happening and where to look. it didn’t take long for him to see one of these objects appear in the same location. fortunately it didn’t travel in a straight line and it too shot off at a high rate of speed to fade out of sight. now i had a fellow witness who just happens to be a fireman in our city of jenks. we watched several more of this phenomenon together. by now it was near 10:00 pm. his wife came out and after telling her what we were doing, she watched with us for a minute or two during which time nothing happened so they both went into their home. i watched another couple of minutes and saw one more of these things be born and shoot off. i went in doors and told my wife our neighbor paul wayne has seen several of these objects too, proving i wasn’t imaging things.\r\n\r\ntoday, monday morning, march 29, 2016 at about 5:50 am, before getting into the mini-van to come to work, i scanned the sky looking for more of these objects.  the sky was clear, lots of stars and the moon over half-full was about where jupiter was the night before. i scanned the sky in the south where the birth place of these objects had been last evening and after looking for two or three minutes i saw nothing there. it was about this time i saw a satellite. it appeared over our house in the north and traveled to the south southwest at a steady rate of speed. it was very bright so i thought maybe it might have been the international space station. before it faded out of sight, i looked almost straight up and i saw one of the dim objects pop into view. it appeared stationary for an instant before it shot off to the south as fast as any falling star i had ever seen. the birthing location of these things had moved to almost directly over our house. i watched two more appear. one moved slowly off in a large arc to the southwest where it faded out of sight. the last one i saw before i had to leave for work stayed stationary for a moment then went extremely fast to the east and faded out of view.\r\n\r\nto whom it may concern: \r\nthese sightings are by definition a re-occurring phenomenon. i expect to be able to see these objects again as some point in the near future, maybe even tonight provided the skies are clear. my next door neighbor saw some of these objects too, so i am no longer the only one to have seen them. unfortunately i did not have binoculars or telescope to see the objects better, but i saw them well enough with my naked eyes to be able to post this sighting with confidence.\r\ni have no clue as to what it was that my neighbor and i saw. i am hoping that mufon may have heard of something similar and could tell me what it was we were looking at. it would likely take special lenses and recording equipment to capture the birth and take-off of one of these objects on video. to a certainty, these objects are not falling stars or meteors because they can speed up, slow down and change direction. please advise me as to what i should do if when i witness one of these events in the future. \r\ndale alyea ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

sort of aura of colour around a brighter core, as i was leaving a friend's house and getting into another friend's car with them. i noticed the object because just as i was about to turn the corner out of the driveway to the curb where we were parked, i felt a sort of 'pull' inside my head to look in the direction of the object, and saw the written words \"look over there\" 'in the front' of my mind (that's the best way i can describe it).\r\n\r\nmy friend noticed that i was looking at the object, but we didn't talk about it - ufos are not a subject that, at present, i feel i can discuss with them so easily, and i imagine that they probably thought it was just a plane. at the time, the object was simply hovering in the sky, but as we got into the car i continued to watch it, and it began to 'drift' (it was more like sliding, like an air hockey puck) to the right, from my perspective. its light remained constant as it did so.\r\n\r\nas we turned onto the main road out of the residential area we were in, the orange object began to softly, gently pulsate, like a throbbing 'dimmer' then 'brighter' then 'dimmer', etc., and started to turn gradually paler in colour.\r\n\r\nas we drove on our route back from east wittering to chichester, the object stopped moving again. about 3-4 minutes after my sighting of it had started, it had become white in colour and dimmer. it also flashed a few times, like the way lights flash on the bottom of planes. when it stopped flashing, a second object just like it, with the same dimness, and also white, faded into view 'beneath' it and to its right(from my perspective). it drifted slowly to the right the way the other one had before. about a minute later it had stopped moving and both objects were hovering in the sky, at a constant height and in one place.\r\n\r\nmy last sighting of the two objects was after we went round a bend in the road. i noticed that they were getting closer, and then our car passed them by (they were to the right of us). then my line of sight of them became blocked by trees. by that point, the second object had become red in colour, and the first was starting to turn back to its original orange colour.\r\n\r\nthis is not the first time that i've seen ufos of this type - i've also seen ufos of other types before as well, both in england and in new zealand, many times in the company of other eyewitnesses.\r\n\r\nat the time of the sighting, particularly as we approached chichester, a few planes were visible in the sky, with their typical light configurations. i've seen countless planes, helicopters, sattelites, chinese lanterns, stars, planets, etc. in my lifetime, and they're very easy to distinguish from anomalous aerial phenomena such as the two objects i witnessed tonight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then

on a foam roller on my back with my head toward a large window. i heard a plane outside whose engine was whining/growling like it was doing some kind of acrobatic maneuvers. it sounded like a small personal aircraft. i listened to it for a few minutes before i leaned my head back over the foam roller and looked out the window upside down. i did not see the plane but noticed what i thought were two white birds the size of hawks chasing each other in the sky to the wnw just over a hill here in town. as i watched i noticed that they were orb shaped and either reflecting light or giving off light. one moment that looked dull, then they appeared to shine or illuminate. \r\n\r\ni jumped up onto my feet and ran out to the backyard. the sky was crystal clear. at first it took me a moment to find them again. this is when i noticed the small plane moving toward them to the w. they appeared to move from sw to ne like they were chasing each other dropping and gaining altitude quickly and doing loops. this is when i also noticed it seemed like they changed shape for a moment. again i thought that maybe they were just birds but they didn't look right.\r\n\r\nthis is when they seemed to pick up speed and chase each other off out of my line (behind the trees in my yard) of sight to the ne. i ran inside to grab my phone in hopes that i would see them again but nothing. the small plane did not give chase and seemed to act like the objects weren't there. it too continued to make groaning sounds from whatever maneuvers it was doing (out of sight) for a few more minutes then headed off

swamp to the rear of the residence and had been so located for approximately one-half hour.  witness (a) further related that the object had been observed to rise to an altitude of approximately 500 feet and then to return to the ground.  witness (a) stated that lights were observed upon the object and that the lighting turned from a blue-green to a brilliant red to yellow in coloring.  object had appeared to be having difficulty in getting off the ground.\r\n\twitness (a) and his son, witness (b), had watched the object for some time and then proceeded into the wood and swamps in an attempt to locate the object and to see what it was.  both witnesses were in the swamp when the deputies arrived.  the deputies, in company with witness (a), proceeded along dexter-pinckney rd to territorial rd, and then turned onto quigley rd, where a vantage point was obtained, being in direct line with the house (which no longer exists) and the area of the objects observation.  at this point the patrol vehicle was secured and the afore mentioned proceeded into the woods in an attempt to locate the swamp edge and the object.\r\nwhile in the woods a brilliant light was observed from the far edge of the woods, upon approaching, the light dimmed in brilliance.  as the afore mentioned approached the upper ridge and the edge of the woods, the brilliant light again appeared and then disappeared.  a continued search of the area was conducted through the swamp and high grass with negative results.\r\n\tupon returning to the patrol vehicle they were met by others who had gathered to observe and the undersigned officers were informed that one of the objects had been hovering directly over the area where flashlight beams had been seen, and then departed in a west direction of flight at high rate of speed.  the deputies and witness (a) returned to the residence where further interviews were conducted.  \r\n\tduring the subsequent interview, witness (a) stated that he had observed the lights coming from the swamp and had awakened his son, witness (b).  both witnesses then proceeded into the swamps in an attempt to find the object which was producing the light.  upon entering the lower edge of the swamp the son stated “what is that thing” and witness (a) looked in the direction indicated, the object was observed.  at the instant of observation the small lights went out, and in just an instant, reappeared across the swamp, a distance of about 500 yards.  at this time the object became illuminated from a brilliant source of light which flowed horizontal between the two (2) small lights.  after watching the object for a couple of minutes the rays of light from two flashlights were observed from the ridge above the object  the light from the object intensified then went out, and a whistle similar to the sound of a rifle bullet ricochet was heard, then the object passed directly over the witnesses in just an instant.\r\npolice disposition:

personally because last august i was walking my dog at about 10 pm and when i came around the corner of my house saw an object with the same lights about 2 miles back into the mountains. my house sits at about 9,000 feet backed up to truchas peaks. it was in the truchas peak region that i observed the craft that was identical to the one on the allskycam. it was awesome to be able to show my husband

took place the night of march 30th and early morning of march 31st.\r\n\r\ni went to bed as usual and fell asleep quickly. it felt like a short time (but could have been longer), before i found myself awake in an area that wasn't my room. \r\n\r\ndescription of the room: the room was well lit, despite no obvious light sources. i noted that the walls and floor had a matte grey-blue colour, with some areas that were a white-grey. there was a counter in front of me with some black rod-like tools and needles, and some storage compartments in the walls (sort of resembling cabinets). i was sitting on a bed-like bench that was fused to the floor. the last thing about the room i noticed were these mechanical looking arm-like tools coming out of the ceiling of the room. i could not discern any entrance/exit-way from my vantage point.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nafter i awoke i felt incredibly groggy and hazy, like i was dealing with a sedative. i looked up from where i was sitting to see a young man. he was facing away from me preparing something on the counter. he wore a skin-tight blue jumpsuit with a black belt around the waist, and he wore black boots. he had short light blonde hair.\r\n\r\ni called out to him saying \"hello there\", which got his attention. he turned from what he was doing and said \"hello\", i wasn't surprised that he could speak english. i introduced myself to him, afterwards he responded saying that i already knew him, but it was ok if i didn't remember. i noticed his eyes as he drew closer to talk to me, they were a light grey-blue with vertical slit pupils. i wasn't bothered by his eyes, i was honestly quite intrigued with them. for some reason i decided to ask about him. i asked him where he was from, and he responded \"around the area of antares\". after conversing with him, he told me that he had to do some work on me, and that what he would do will sting a bit, but he would try his best not to make it hurt.\r\n\r\nhe returned to the counter and grabbed a small white sheet with many holes in it, and placed it on my exposed back. it stuck there, between my right shoulder and my spine. after placing the sheet on my back he grabbed this device with several small needles that matched up with the holes in the device and poked my back through the sheet. it stung when the device was inserted, but the procedure was quick. he returned to the counter and observed the sheet as certain areas changed to a certain colour, and left it on the counter for later.\r\n\r\nhe came up to me and told me that what he will do next may hurt but is necessary for me. he grabbed a mechanical arm from the ceiling and brought it towards where i was seated. he gently took my left hand with his and held it so my index finger and thumb were spread. grabbing the mechanical arm, the black head of it changed shape to form two long needles, about 1cm apart. he told me once again that he was sorry if this will hurt, and that it will sting. i watched as the two needles entered the space between my index finger and thumb. seconds after the device being in my hand, i felt something similar to an electric shock after it was removed from my hand. two reddish pink bumps rose from my hand where the needles were inserted. he released my hand and left me to go back to the counter. just as i was about to ask what the needle in my hand was for, my grogginess got the best of me and i blacked out.\r\n\r\ni awoke in my bed feeling very heavy and with a slight headache. i was surprised to see the two raised bumps on my left hand after waking. they were numb to the touch and stung. they stayed on my hand for 2 weeks before disappearing.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":75490,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.451716000000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03292016-0010","longitude":-123.500836,"occurred":1364601600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British
