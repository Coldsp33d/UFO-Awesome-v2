Unknown","city":"Cloneygowan","country":"IE","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my partners house which is in cloneygowan (a small village in co. offaly), me and my partner were outside stargazing, the village is in the middle of nowhere so there is practically no light pollution there, you can clearly see stars, planes, planets and such and clearly distinguish between them. my partner lives in a pretty large bungalo, we were outside the front door.\r\n\r\nmy partner noticed the object and pointed it out to me, we looked at it for about 5 minutes trying to figure out if it was moving, we came to a conclusion that the object is either stationary or moving towards us at an extremely slow pace.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed the object we thought it was a plane.\r\n\r\nafter looking at its movement (or lack of movement) for about 5 minutes we came to a conclusion it is bigger than a plane, it was stationary or moving towards us extremely slow and that it was triangular in shape if you focused on it and squinted a little, it was obvious this object is very far away from us therefore the triangular shape is not apparent at first. the object was flashing 3 different colours: red, blue and green, the pattern of them is not very apparent but i wouldn't call it random. \r\n\r\ni had a sudden feeling of dread, i realised this could be something important, i never thought i would see something like this in my life, i have always been open to the idea that ufos and life on other planets exist yet i treat videos and such with a rational point of view trying not to have a biased view on them. i have no doubt what i saw was not a plane / star / planet. \r\n\r\ni took out my iphone, which was at around 20% battery at this time and started recording a video, i tried to get the object in focus but the object is too small to be properly visible on the screen, i walk towards it and as soon as i get the object on screen, several blue lines varying in thickness appeared on the screen, about 2 seconds after this my phone turned off as if the battery ran out (iphone users should be familiar with the spinning white \"buffering\" or loading cirlce that appears when an iphone switches off).\r\n\r\nwe ran inside the house and i immediately plugged my iphone into my laptop, i know that when my phone is out of battery and gets plugged into a charger, there appears an empty battery on the screen showing that the battery is not charged enough for the phone to turn on, this usually lasts for 7 minutes before the apple logo appears (my phone is very slow as it is the iphone 4. i have recorded many videos with my phone, the last one before my recording of the object was 2 weeks ago, there have never been problems with the video before), this time my phone showed the apple logo instantly after being plugged in and it took only around 30 seconds for the phone to turn on. the battery was 14% exactly. i copied the video onto my desktop and watched it, the blue lines appear in the video and the audio cuts off as soon as they appear. the video is attached in this report.\r\n\r\nthis experience terrified me, i have heard of ufos being able to interfere with electronics and emit electromagnetic waves, i instantly panicked as i felt i could be in danger. maybe it knows i was watching? so many thoughts rushed into my head.\r\n\r\nafter running back into the house, we tried to calm down a little by trying to figure out what this object could have been. my partner has had a fear of aliens, ufos and abductions since a very young age so i was trying to make sure they do not have a panic attack. we decided that going outside to check again was the only way to really know what this was, we grabbed binoculars and prepared to go investigate, i started recording again yet this video has my partner in it and she does not wish to be shown. the video does not contain any real evidence in my opinion, the object is not visible it is only me explaining what just happened.\r\n\r\nwe stepped outside and stood there watching for around 10 minutes, we heard a shriek which reminded me of a monkey or some kind of bird, immediately after this noise we heard something which sounded like a dog being killed or severely injured, it was a mix of a whine and a sort of scream almost, this noise terrified me and i said to my partner \"lets go back inside\" trying not to scare them. this experience is haunting and terrifying to recall, the emotions i experienced during this made me feel like i was in danger. i did not tick the \"animal mutilation\" tag on this as to not be misleading, i can only assume the strange noise was an animal being mutilated, but i really do not know as i did not see anything happen.\r\n\r\ni do not know exactly the altitude of the object or anything like that, it was too far away. the best description of its altitude would be that of a plane.\r\n\r\ni am attaching the video which features the interference and the object.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

how much time had past before i realised that i was just sat their in complete shock as soon as i snapped out of the daze i was in i instantly called my mum and told her i could see a ufo hovering over a house  and that i was going to call the police as i didn't k ow what too do she told me took stop being rediculess and to just go home but at this point i could still see the ufo it was very dark black with a while light like really white whiter than any light i ever saw before in each point of the triangle a circle light and a circle of green light in the center the green light oin the middle was a little larger than the others it started to move surprisingly slow so i decided to try and follow it for about quarter of a mile towards the country lanes then it shot of in the blink of an eye over the corn fields i always tried to put the incident to the back of my mind and tell my self i imagined it but the feeling i felt of shock and complete state of daze was unlike any other i had ever felt and i know it happend i can still hear the noise that it made it was u like any noise i had ever heard the closest thing i could describe it too is an extremely high pitched dog whistle

light but something felt like it was telling me to look out the window. when i looked out i didnt see anything at first. then i had the feeling again. so i got up looked out and saw a strange lights outside. so i left my bedroom to go out back to see what it was but when i got outside it was in a different part of the sky and i could then see 3 lights. top light was red middle was green bottom was blue it was in a straight line hovering over a neighbor house for 1 to 2 mins then moved to the next spot in the sky and hovered there for a 1 or 2 then moved back to where i first saw it over another neighbor house for 1 or 2 and it keep going back and forth, it would go for the 3 spot to the 2 spot to the 1 then back to 2 to the 3 spot. at one point i went into the house to get my cell phone to take a picture but when i came back out it was in a different spot of the sky i tried to take a picture but it looked like a dot so i didnt keep it and i took my phone back in and before i could go back out it shine a bright white light that lit up the whole house and my eyes started to feel like they was burn itching only last for a few seconds then it went out and i looked at the stove and it was 1:30am. i went back outside and i didnt see it in the sky. i could tell at one point the lights move a little and i could tell it had a cylinder shape but mostly stayed in a straight line. the lights would look far off then close up back and froth. the whole time i felt clam and at peace.\r\n\r\nthe next night around the same time. something else happen but it was not in the sky. i was in my bed trying to sleep but couldnt my mind started to race really fast and hurting. then it felt like the hallway started to get warm and very warm and my body couldnt move, i couldnt moved my head and then i could hear a voice say come here come here. after hearing the voice the warm went away and i could move again.\r\n\r\nfrom then after those two nights i have had bad dreams very bad sometime waking up freaking out, sweating, or couldnt move feeling. my mind has race every since then. and i dont think thats the first time i have had a alien existence. i had one when i was 17.

observed this very faint object in the sky move very slowly with it flashing this spot light every so often. there wasn't a set number of seconds between flashes, it happened randomly. i called my son outside so he can also see it, which he did. it did this for around 3 to 4 minutes before it moved in an easterly direction appearing to be a very faint star. lost track of the object as it became way too faint to observe.\r\nthis is not the first time we have witnessed peculiar objects and lights in the sky. many other times we have seen orange football shaped objects hovering behind our woods (july 4th, 2011 to be exact), we have seen glowing orbs floating in the sky, military jets appearing to attempt to intercept some objects, and many other  anomalies that we simply cannot explain. i myself have also witnessed incredible sized (best way to describe it) ship silently going over me with about 50 smaller objects appearing shortly after doing what appeared to be aerobatics. not sure

this was the first thing which went through my head when i saw them - this because the \"string\" looked straight and level relative to the horizon and looked like a picture i had once seen of that phenomena (note: these objects in this sighting were much closer to one another and there were many more). this was the closest the formation was to me, thereafter it became smaller as it moved north easterly towards pretoria.\r\n\r\nthe \"string\" on the westerly side moved erratically, many simultaneously moving rapidly and overtaking one another, then dropping back. the same movement happened on the easterly side of the formation but not to the same extent. the shape remained a \"v\" regardless of the movements of the individual objects. the formation was moving between orion and sirius. \r\n\r\nthe closest comparable motion i can think of is a flock of birds flying in a v-formation in very turbulent weather and then the speed of the movements similar to footage of the same speeded up considerably. the changing of relative positions was almost \"playful\" but always kept the same distance between the individual objects. \r\n\r\nas they moved over, the v-shape became more pronounced and less \"flat\" - i could not count them properly but i estimate there were over 20 individual objects, those on the easterly side being marginally brighter than those in the west). these were individual objects and not part of a single larger object.\r\n\r\nthe colour was slightly darker than the orange of the star betelgeuse, and luminosity around 20% of that star on the night\r\n\r\ni called my wife to see the formation, but by the time she was outside, the formation was much fainter than when i had first seen it and was just about to disappear behind the tops of the trees in the north west. at this time the easterly side of the formation went straight again but the westerly side continued to move erratically. she witnessed a shooting star off to the side of where the formation was. \r\n\r\nduring this time - of only around 10 to 15 seconds at most - i only took my eyes off the formation once when i tried to see if my wife was looking in the right direction. \r\n\r\nin relation to the airplane mentioned earlier, the formation was moving much faster and seemed much higher in the sky. to put the speed in perspective, the sighting covered about 3/4 of the sky and was over in the time mentioned earlier. this reminded me of the speed of a low flying fighter jet. there was no sound from the formation, and i did not hear engine noise from the airplane either. by the end of the sighting the airplane had disappeared but admittedly was not the focus of my attention. \r\n\r\ni expect the only reason why the objects were even visible was because of the position and luminosity of the rising moon - reflecting off the lower surfaces of the objects - much as the sun does off satellites in the early evening. they did not emit any light themselves - ruling out the typical chinese lantern misidentification. i immediately sketched the sky and the path / formation on my smartphone (attached).\r\n\r\ni am familiar with aircraft (as we have multiple airport in the vicinity) and have been interested in aircraft since an early age. these objects and their speed, proximity to one another and movements do not fit any aircraft i am aware of. their movements would have been extremely risky - if impossible - for any formation of aircraft to attempt without colliding. the acceleration and deceleration of the objects also did not seem physically possible for a object with any weight. \r\n\r\ni hope this will support any other similar sightings of the 27 march 2016.\r\n\r\nplease do not hesitate to contact me for additional detail and i will supply where i am able to.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":75463,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-25.9876839,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-03282016-0004","longitude":28.094725,"occurred":1459114140000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Gauteng","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1459136889000,"summary":"20 -
