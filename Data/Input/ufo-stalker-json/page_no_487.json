i am walking up the path on the rail road tracks because i don't feel like climbing over the gate that night. i walk the quarter mile walk up the track to the field that is really nicely secluded from hospital road.  i arrive on the field, and must have been in shock to see it on the ground.  i saw it behind the pegboard. there is a pegboard that holds frequency numbers when people fly it went up and over, a beam came down, and then felt another beam come down on me. i started lifting up, and then you know there is trouble. i was met inside by two small grey aliens who rushed me to another room where i was met by another being with a long neck.  in hypnosis, i was able to get a name. i then that night had an encounter with an mib in a tailgating dark ford crown vic.  my dad believes tailgating viciously.  since hypnosis, i have discovered a scoop mark on my back left shoulder, and had an octagon shape bruise on my arm. that is not natural.  i also receive telepathic messages. we hear electronic beeping noises we have nothing in the house that makes that noise. please, mufon, i need your help. please contact me so i can find a good support group to help people with this. i really feel like a best comparrison would be the guy from close encounters that went nuts in the movie and it is not a good feeling.  thank you.\r\n ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":75452,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.2076042,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03272016-0013","longitude":-71.3334921,"occurred":1281461400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1459096894000,"summary":"Abduction at r/c flying field hospital road, medfield mass, 08/10/2010 17:30","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":80,"meanvism":12,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":80,"meanvism":12,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"02052","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2055,"locationName":"Medfield, Massachusetts","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:82267"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Longmont","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i had just parked on the side parking lot of our apartment when we noticed orbs ascending into the sky.  we ran to the main parking lot to get a better view and that is when my wife started recording with her iphone.  we first noticed the orbs in the sky when my wife pointed at one and asked if it was a chinese lantern.  that's what we both assumed it was, but it was moving too fast to be a chinese lantern, and it wasn't even the chinese new year.  \r\n\r\norb after orb kept ascending into the sky in a pattern and we couldn't tell where they were ascending from.  \r\n\r\nwe both freaked out but were in awe because we had never seen anything like that before.  i grabbed our downstairs neighbor to see the orbs and he was freaking out as well.\r\n\r\neventually, the orbs stopped ascending from wherever they were ascending from.  \r\n\r\nwhen we sent the video to my father, he watched it in slow motion and noticed a flying saucer towards the beginning of the video that we didn't notice until he pointed it out.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":75451,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.22595899500777,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03272016-0012","longitude":-105.13747317232873,"occurred":1456096500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1459093752000,"summary":"Didn't see disc until father pointed it out (beginning of video); red orbs ascended in the sky.  two different ufos in the video.

above us flying perpendicular to our direction. i could not estimate how far above us it was nor the speed. we were still in oregon but approaching the columbia river in the distance near the dalles oregon. there were two distinct con trails but one was dramatically different than the other so i snapped off 4 quick photos of it as we continued on. i watched as long as i could but at these speeds it only lasted a brief time. as i sat and looked at my photos and enlarged them it became more interesting as the the con trail in question had a very strange shape. as i looked more i noticed a bluish green orb with lights down in the lower left hand portion of my photo as well as other oddities. i have seen numerous photos of these strange orbs but never actually seen one myself. i have no idea what this was but it was strange. you can find other anomolies in these photos but they could be a product of the window as the sun was very bright shining from the west. as i said we were flying

they are very clever to plant images, so they can control you. i then started to walk into the kitchen when i came face to face with a 4 foot tall white colored entity, and a 5 foot tall grey. i poked the white entity, and stated \"what did you do to my dog\". then when i realized i poked (him) my finger nail went into his skin, i then drew my finger back looked at my nail, and stated \"i'm sorry i didn't mean to hurt you!","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":75437,"landingOccurred":true,"latitude":45.04833195012386,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03262016-0015","longitude":-84.65787284144542,"occurred":1415933580000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1459028704000,"summary":"Observed a 30 disc with under carage facing me/it was turned on its side, which was to back of house landed just above house in front, red, greenish lights flashing thru the frosted glass front door, husban was abducted,       above our home, in the front","tags":["lights","flash","disc"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-2,"maxtempi":28,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":-6,"meantempi":22,"meanvism":8,"meanvisi":5,"mintempm":-9,"mintempi":16,"minvism":0,"minvisi":0,"rain":false,"snow":true,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-2,"maxtempi":28,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":-6,"meantempi":22,"meanvism":8,"meanvisi":5,"mintempm":-9,"mintempi":16,"minvism":0,"minvisi":0,"rain":false,"snow":true,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"49735","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":498,"locationName":"Gaylord, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Landing","$$hashKey":"object:82282"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Plainfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was traveling home from a friends house late friday night march 25, 2016 on highway us-40 from plainfield, indiana to indianapolis, about a 12 minute drive. halfway through the drive i noticed high in the sky a bright redish-orange object freefalling towards the ground at a rapid rate of speed. it fell into an empty field just to my left. it almost looked like a flare but with a brigther intensity. i know the indianapolis international airport is in this area but it was no airplane...The only thing it could be described similar to is a flare. it got my attention at first because of how bright it was and how fast it was freefalling almost in a tail spin to the ground..I would say it almost started out at airplane level. i was startled at first and wish i would have had my phone out in time to take a picture or video but everything happened so fast. i decided to keep driving home instead of checking what was in the field but i regretted not stopping and looking the whole way home.

plane from a distance, as it slowly moved. then, it clearly changed direction. as i watched closer i actually noticed that the object was hovering, yet moving back and forth, up and down, in very
