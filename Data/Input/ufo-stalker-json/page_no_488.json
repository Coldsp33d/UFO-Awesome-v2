just prior to the cambodian operation. we were on the yfu-79 on another ammo resupply run to dong ha and were making circles just off the mouth of the song cua viet awaiting dawn so that we could safely clear the sandbars at the entrance to the river. our position was approximately 16 deg & 55 min n lat and 107 deg 15 min e long. it was a clear night with a light wind. there were 4 of us on the duty watch. i was the helmsman and the boat's radioman. we had a deck seaman for our lookout, an engineman who was on the bridge with us, and the quartermaster was our petty officer of the deck. we had done a couple of circles off-shore and when we came around on a heading back to the north-west, we suddenly saw this tubular object hovering over the dmz close to the coast and south of the song ben hai which is the river that splits the dmz. the object did not appear to have any wings, a tail section or rotors. it was essentially a large tube-like object with red and white lights that could be seen along it's side. there was no engine noise that we could hear from it. the elevation was between 2,000 and 3,000 feet and we were perhaps 8 clicks south-east of the object. abruptly, the object accelerated to the west at a very high speed and then just as suddenly came to a dead stop. my guess is that the object was now due north of the base at dong ha. it then slowly returned to the east, hovered near the coast for 2 or 3 minutes and then proceeded slowly on a north-easterly course out over the south china sea where it disappeared from view. red and white lights could be seen on the side of the object that we could observe. they didn't alternate colors but there were 2 or 3 reds and then a white light and gave the impression of being windows or some sort of aperture in the object through which the light came. the four of us on watch debated about whether we should enter the incident into the boat's log book but opted not to since we figured that we'd either be sent off to see psychologists or brought up on drug charges. we were very familiar with all types of aircraft and helicopters that operated over the dmz. this object did not look nor behave like any aircraft we were familiar with at the time nor since.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

past 2 years i have been consistently seeing things at night, random flashing/multi-colored lights, lights moving in the night sky with the ability to change direction and speed with ease that does not resemble anything like any of the aircraft i've seen or know of. i first noticed the light before my friend (army vet). because of my previous experiences i'm constantly staring at the sky at night. i first saw it slowly, from a dim to extremely bright light, just once. so i take a drag of my cigarette as i'm staring up where i saw the flash, and after the \"cherry\" of my cigarette lit up and dimmed from my drag the light flashed again. i pondered the thought of what i could be seeing and the possibility that it could be communication of some sort. after 4-5 more randomly taking drags of my cigarette while staring up at the and seeing the same flash immediately after my friend finally noticed the look on my face and decided to look up as well. the second he looked up and in the direction i said i was seeing this thing it flashed. he was in total disbelief after our 10 minute sighting. we watched this \"flash\" not only continue on slowly in the sky, but it also stopped, changed colors, but most importantly we observed it change direction which indicated to us it wasn't a satellite, airplane, or anything explainable.  we were feeling almost in a daze after and \"off\" after or sighting as we sat in my living discussing what we just witnessed minutes before. as we sat and tried to come to terms with what just happened, my home felt different, i don't know how to explain it and we both noticed the change in atmosphere. the second we noticed the change a broom in my coat closet under my stair, which was leaned against the back wall of the closet, lift up off the ground and slam against the door of the closet which was ajar/open about 10-12 inches. although both events, while amazing and mind boggling, cant be explained. we believe the broom in the closet was them letting us know, that they knew we saw them, and that they saw us as well.\r\n\r\ni did attempt to video the object but was unable to get it in frame as there were no reference points for me to judge where in the sky i was pointing the camera. so its basically an audio recording of the event unfortunately.

clouds moving in, shortly after alerts of a violent storm approaching.  i took a picture of the shore line, clearly showing a brick building with a white roof. i looked away from the camera and noticed a hovering dot at about 60 degrees off the horizon, north west of the previous picture.  i aimed the camera at the object. i was using a 70-300mm lens. i zoomed all the way in.  i still could only see a dot, so i snapped the picture. all a sudden before i could take another, it disappeared out of my lens view moving at a high rate of speed in a south westerly direction. since i could not see it, i swung the camera down and began clicking along the shore line, capturing as much sky as i could, but actually saw nothing with my naked eye through the lens.  \r\n\r\nwhen i went inside, i used the camera to zoom in on the dot of light.  to our surprise, it looked like a boat in the sky.  i asked my friend if i could take the card home and copy the pictures i took. \r\n\r\nwhen i got the images on a full screen pc, to my surprise, there were tiny dots of light around the \"boat\" object in some sort of a 45 degree angled line.  i believe i found 6 dots of light.\r\n\r\nthe major surprise came when i looked at the blindly snapped picture after that. it revealed a hovering object over the brick building. in addition there is a couple of dots. one is a white dot, and the other appears, when blown up to be a gray oval shape with a black dot (dome?).\r\n\r\ni have shown these image to jim & jack weiner, abductees the allagash incident. i'm good friends with them. i do not want to turn over the rights to these images. i'm good with examining them for authenticity, but will not assign exclusive rights to my images.  i trust mufon and the weiners and i believe these to be interesting enough for analysis.  i also think that jim said he would be sending the images to ray fowler.  if you feel you would like to investigate this, please have the local mufon investigator

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I've decided to post this story online, and so am copying and pasting most of the article here to report it (to save having to write it twice):\r\n----------\r\n\r\ni've had a story to tell about the phoenix lights, but it wasn't in arizona, and it wasn't on the same day of the arizona incident. i have already told this story to several people through the years, but never in an article format, where anybody can find it online and read it. finally, with several people marking the phoenix lights anniversary online, i think it's a good time to type it up, to add to the public discussion.\r\n\r\nwhen i first heard about phoenix lights, it was long after my own sighting had occurred -- maybe months, maybe years. yet other witness' accounts reminded me of a sighting i'd had around the same time, also in the southwest, and so i sat down and figured out how my sighting fit into the timeline. i calculated that my sighting was just before the phoenix lights. maybe the previous week, maybe a few days prior, but most likely the previous weekend.\r\n\r\nbasically i was in a suburb of las vegas, nevada, either in boulder city or somewhere between boulder city and las vegas. all i can say is that i was on a highway -- the \"main drag\" that goes from boulder city to las vegas -- going toward las vegas after dark, and i wasn't in a downtown area. it was more of a rural desert area.\r\n\r\nat that time in my life, i was still working in los angeles, california and occasionally going to las vegas, nevada for a much-needed weekend break from the stress of the job and the l.A. metro area. it wasn't uncommon for me to find a smaller hotel in boulder city and then drive to las vegas for sightseeing, which went on 24 hours a day.\r\n\r\nwhile on the highway, driving at a low rate of speed, suddenly six lights came on directly overhead. this was without warning and without noise. i looked up, and saw what looked like gymnasium lights from my childhood, and very bright. they were in a v-shape that was large enough to be 6 helicopters flying in formation, which at the time i assumed they were. the reddish sky was visible in between the lights, giving me the initial impression that the lights weren't attached to the same craft. they were also very low to the ground, and although i'm not very good at estimating heights, my best guess is somewhere between 20 and 30 feet from the ground to the lights. they also weren't entirely stationary. they were traveling in a forward motion, toward the city like my car, but very slowly.\r\n\r\nbecause of what was happening in my life at the time, i was both angry and terrified when i first saw the lights. i was being stalked by a woman who was wealthy enough and mean enough to use any means possible to terrorize me. \r\n\r\n...And so i knew that while unlikely, there was a possibility that those helicopters worked for the stalker. i immediately drove ahead to the next side street and took a left, then turned around and watched the lights from the stop sign there. thankfully, the lights continued directly over the main road going straight ahead, past my position and toward the city of las vegas. again, i'm not good at estimating speeds from the side of the road, but it was going very slowly -- i'd guess about 20-25 m.P.H. i don't remember when i stopped watching, but knowing evasive behavior that i frequently used to escape the stalker at the time, i probably drove to what i'd consider to be a safer spot to wait it out.\r\n\r\nwhen i finally heard about the phoenix lights, i remembered that incident, and started googling information on different ufos. that's when i came across a few pages on the \"big black delta,\" a triangular-shaped craft with lights on the bottom that were in the same formation that i saw that night. yet the special thing about the big black delta was the screen on the bottom of its wings -- supposedly the aircraft had a camera that took a real-time shot of the sky above, and projected that picture onto a screen at the bottom of the plane, making people below think that they were seeing the sky in between its lights. at the time of the sighting, i didn't know that such technology existed, and so i wasn't looking for the edges of any screen as i was looking up. all i saw were the lights and the \"sky\" in between (which was reddish from light pollution but not very bright).\r\n\r\nto me, the \"big black delta\" describes what i saw perfectly, and i've assumed that's what i saw that night in boulder city ever since. i also suspect it's a possibility for the phoenix lights (same craft, different location, different day), although i'll leave it to witnesses in arizona to decide whether it fits their memories or not.\r\n\r\n...I have had other ufo \"sightings.\" one was in the california desert, along the interstate between los angeles and las vegas, just over some mountains set back from the north side of the highway. it occurred on a sunny, clear day. basically an aircraft that looked like a stealth bomber was suspended in air with a metallic-colored parachute above it, which appeared to be attached to the plane with thick metal cables. although i no longer remember the year of this one, for some reason i'm under the impression that it was in 1996. and it wasn't much of a sighting, but again it was \"unidentified.\" i've since wondered if whatever propulsion gas coming out of the back of the bomber was being caught by the parachute, and that's what was suspending it, although the thing appeared to be motionless and i'd expect some movement from a crude technology like that. i've described this sighting to other people, and some think that what i saw was a hologram and not an actual aircraft, obviously there's no way for me to know for sure what was happening in the sky that day.\r\n\r\nanother \"sighting\" is much more complex, starting with my mother's obsession one day to travel to horicon marsh in wisconsin, then my seeing what appeared to be a disc shadow pass in front of us on the road in the area,and then crop circles near that same marsh on a later date. this started a number of events that led me to a sick girl who needed some information that i had, and eventually i saw what some would call a \"gray.\" that story is very long and i'm also concerned for the privacy of the humans involved and the \"gray,\" but i was impressed with the compassion of whoever put that into motion, alien or human. maybe someday i'll be able to walk readers through the story.\r\n\r\nfor now, i'll report the old \"big black delta\" sighting to mufon and leave the rest of it for another time. i am interested in whether any witnesses of the phoenix lights incident think that it's similar enough to be the same aircraft.","distance":"21-100

sunny day and that was the only very dark cloud on site. i stopped to take a picture with my phone.. while focusing and taking the first picture, noticed what appeared to be a glowing sphere with some

illuminated the entire area around our house. i was in the basement and my mother and stepfather were upstairs. \r\n\r\nwe all went to the front door and noticed an orange orb hovering over a tree line, to the south. i am not sure of the distance, but my best guess is around a half-mile. the object appeared several times the size of a star. it appeared to glow slightly, but the shape was a solid sphere. the orb hovered in the same spot for about 20 minutes. the orb then slowly descended below the tree line until what must have been close to ground level, then ascended back to the original elevation. this took approximately 30 seconds. the orb then traveled east at a speed similar to an airplane. after traveling for about ten seconds, the object reversed direction instantly, without any change in speed. the object arrived back at the original location and disappeared. \r\n\r\nat the same moment the orb disappeared, a circle of 8-10 large, bright lights flashed one at a time directly over the field to the south/southwest of our yard. i would say it was no more than 500 feet from our front door, and 250 feet above ground. there was no sound. i would estimate that the width of the object/lights was 75-100 feet. once the last light went out, there were no more sightings. \r\n\r\nwe continued to look around, all of us a little \"freaked out\" now. after a couple of minutes, military jets flew over. i thought it sounded like they were flying to the northeast, but i couldn't be certain.\r\n\r\ni phoned the stevens point municipal airport and reported what i saw. i was told they hadn't seen anything. i then phoned the stevens point journal newspaper. they told me that they had received multiple reports of 2 f-16s \"chasing a ufo.\" \r\n\r\nthe november 9 1995 stevens point journal has a front page article with a quote from a lt. col. saying that it was the 115th fighter wing of traux field in madison, wisconsin \"practicing night flying.\" the article concludes with \"the only thing they were chasing after were themselves.\" (i still have this newspaper if the full article is needed)","distance":"501 Feet - 1
