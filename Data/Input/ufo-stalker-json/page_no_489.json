he's friends for a coffee. there were a few people there including the dad of my friends friend. somehow the topic of conversation went onto the subject of our universe and my friend mentioned that i was into ufo's. immediately, the dad of my friends friend stood up and said \"hey, i saw something weird in the sky on the way to work last week whilst crawling in traffic. i had my phone on the dashboard and i picked it up and took one pic of it. i looked at it for about 20-30 seconds and it just stood there. i have never seen anything like it. it was not a plane or a hot air balloon or a friggin helicopter. i dont know what it was but i thought it was weird and took a pic of it. then the traffic started moving and i forgot about it and concentrated on driving.\"\r\n\r\nthat is what he roughly said. i tried interrogating him but he was one of those live for today types who believes in nothing and has hardly any educational background, a working class van driver basically. he just kept going off the subject and didn't want to entertain me on my ufo thoughts. but from his mannerism and the enthusiasm in the way he described the event, it led me to believe he was not lying. and when he showed me the photo, i was gob smacked.\r\n\r\nnow, to get the photo, i had to go round his sons house the next day and he pulled it off his dads facebook page, where he uploaded it to. i say this because the original may be better quality but i cannot be certain, just laying down the facts for your scrutiny. but i'm sure the original i saw on the phone was a lot clearer and detailed, but that also could be because of a smaller phone screen.\r\n\r\nanyways, hope this is a valid ufo, looking at it closely, i believe it is.....

love to take over exposed and slow shutter speed shots at night. i liked the fact that there were relatively a lot of people on the beach for an evening. so i took a few shots on manual settings to capture the glow effect i like. my first shot i thought i saw something in my view finder. i took the shot and looked in the sky to find what i thought i saw. it was yet another of the amber orbs this area seems to attract. i took another shot without putting my eye to the view finder and let the camera focus by feel. when i heard the focus audio signal, a short beep, i snap a second shot. as i watched it the object moved from west to east over the beach. i zoomed in with what little i could as i only had a 18-55mm lens on my camera. but when i looked for it in the view finder, i couldn't see it anymore. when i pulled my eye away from the camera to look at it again, it was gone. \r\n\r\nplease note again, i was on manual controls. so when i took the 2nd shot, the result was what looks like an elongated cigar shaped ufo. but from the ground eye perspective, it remained an orb. the cigar shape is an illusion from the camera settings. but luckily i did have it on manual controls. because in the first shot, you can clearly see the ambient light of the object interact with the foreground as it emerges around a storm cloud.\r\n\r\nhave seen several of the amber lights while living in the area over the years. this is the first time i actually caught one with a camera. have seen them much bigger and much closer. years ago over tiger point when i was delivering pizza in college, i came to a cul de sac and every one was out of there houses. i thought it was a block party. but when i walked up to the customer she said \"look\". i looked up and there was a more rose colored than amber light that seemed to be the size of a swimming pool about 2x tree top level, maybe 100 feet. just as i looked at it, it split into 2, then 4, then 8, then 16, and on and on into smaller fractals. then all the small parts reformed in another location as the large orb. i saw swimming pool in part because, yes it was about 30' in diameter. but also because the light coming from it had that glow you get from underwater lights. \r\n\r\njust listened to your recent show with kyle from ufo proof. and i have been feeling these orbs were some sort of advanced form of life we do not yet have a grasp of yet. perhaps they are a life form that has somehow transcended the need for a physical body. all i can say, is that when i saw the film kpax, i immediately thought of the weird plasma shapes that are so common in the are. \r\n\r\ngoing to try to get more video of these and post them to my own youtube channel, ufo experience. i really appreciate what you do. you have an excellent channel. also appreciate you called out third phase of moon. i'm pretty good with 3d studio max and after effect. and, i could have sold out and made fake ufo videos for a long time now. but the subject is too interesting to me. and i'd rather get authentic images. been seeing them since i was a 7 year old kid, and only now got two shots. jeeze! just two shots! you'd think by now i'd get invited onto a real flying saucer and get an interview with the pilot!\r\n\r\nattached are the two original pics i took on 8-30-15. and i've also included some zooms i did in photoshop.

meteorology classes under my belt. i have been fascinated by the weather ever since i was a child. i am a middle aged person who has never seen a u.F.O. in person. i own a canon rebel t5i 18 megapixel camera which takes 1920x1080 high definition video. i take photos and videos of special weather evens like blizzards, tropical storms, hurricanes, lightning, etc... on march 18, 2016 approximately 1 p.M., i was in my backyard shooting video of some swirling clouds due to convectional heating of the ground combined with a straight-line wind ahead of an approaching nor'easter which gave us snow on the first day of spring. i was viewing the clouds through the small color lcd display on the back of my camera. while i was shooting the video, i did not notice anything out of the ordinary. when i was done shooting the videos, i came into the house and uploaded the videos onto my macbook pro with a 15 inch retina display. \r\n\r\nwhat comes next shocked me to the core. in one of the videos, i watched an unidentified flying object shoot across the screen from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. the object did not fly in a perfectly straight line. the flight path turned slightly. at first, i had to logically rule out everything manmade or natural or a malfunction with my equipment.\r\nnote: i have taken hundreds of videos of weather events. i can say without question the camera and lens are both in perfect working order and i have never seen any artifacts on any of the videos i have taken with this camera and lens.  \r\ni watched the video over and over and over again. i watched it in normal speed, slow motion, forward and in reverse, and frame by frame and even zoomed into the object by taking snapshots of the frames with the object in it. first, the object was flying a hypersonic speed. how do i know this? at the height the object was and how short the time was for the object to go from the top to the bottom of the screen was extraordinarily fast. faster then anything i have ver seen in my life. normally, anything flying at even supersonic speed creates a sonic boom and loud engine sound. this object did not make a sound. if i were to make an educated guess of the speed the object was traveling at, i would say it was traveling at least a thousand times faster then a passenger jet. second, the object was shinny silver in color. how do i know this? while the object flew under a cloud, it was dark grey in color. when the object emerged from beneath the cloud and was under a blue sky the object was white. the object turned white because it was reflecting the direct sunlight. this makes the object shinny silver. while i was recording the video with the object in it, i did not see it with the tiny lcd display on the back of my camera. so, obviously i could not track the object or zoom into the object because i did not even know it was there. if i were looking into the sky with my naked eyes, i would have seen the object fly across the sky.\r\nnow, i consider myself to be a rational, logical person with a lot of skywatching experience due to my fascination and hobby with weather.  with my experience, i can safely say what it was not. it was not ball lightning, a meteor, a shooting star, a weather ballon, a plane or jet, a bird or insect, a piece of paper or a ballon, and it was not an artifact from my camera. that being said, after watching the video and the snapshots of the frames with the object in it, i am positive the object is a true u.F.O. once i realized this, i was extremely excited that i may actually have for the first time in my life, raw video of a real unidentified flying object. i need to have this video examined by people who really know how to evaluate what i caught on video and that is why i submitted this to mufon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

Point","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am writing at the suggestion of my wife to find out if anyone else contacted you about strange lights visible on a warm wisconsin night in early march.  i am a retired teacher/school administrator so i guess i don’t have to worry about folks thinking i am hallucinating. \r\non the evening of march 7, 2016 i was driving my 1994 chevy van, hauling blood south from stevens point, wisconsin to madison, wisconsin for the red cross.  i left stevens point at about 7:30 pm cst traveling on interstate 39/51 on a first warm evening of the spring, about 56 degrees at the time.  \r\ntraffic was light with gaps of one to two miles between cars.  about fourteen miles south of stevens point, a set of three lights turned on in the sky above the highway that looked like three lights from a vanity mirror.  i recall no color in the lights, but i was struck by the fact that there was no glare emanating from the lights. the lights seemed stationary and after about 5 to 8 seconds, the lights swirled on a horizontal plane, one following the other, like circling a drain, or like a computer icon spinning when a program is loading, then disappeared into itself.  \r\n(i live 15 miles from the dane county airport, east of madison wisconsin on a farm.  i see planes coming from milwaukee’s mitchell field heading west over our farm at all times of day or night on a daily basis. the plane lights appear to have a glare to my eyes, and there is always a strobe flashing.)\r\nthe three lights were not flashing and they appeared to be about the same altitude as the jets that come over our farm 15 miles prior to their landing at dane county airport.  the lights could have been a half mile to 5 miles away, not sure.  my initial reaction to the lights is that of a jet on a path to the central wisconsin airport about 20 miles north of stevens point, but with no strobe, and no appearance of moving toward or away from my location, i posited other explanations.  i guessed that maybe i had some configuration of interior lighting inside the van that might be reflecting up in the windshield , so i moved my head close to the windshield and around the cab but there was no effect.\r\ni picked up my cell and called my brother since he is a technology guy that maintains police and government communication equipment for a local county.  i left a message with him to check on flights going to central wisconsin airport, just in case my eyes were lying to me.  as i was completing my message, about 4 miles down the highway, the three lights again appeared, but now they were to the east (on my left) and i was viewing them through the driver door window glass.  they again appeared stationary and once again, the lights seemed to circle into themselves and disappear.\r\nas i think about other explanations, i know that this area south of stevens point is a flat sandy soiled potato growing area.  there are planes that crop dust and apply fertilizers, but being march 7 with the snow just having disappeared and the frost not quite yet gone, i doubted i was seeing lights from a crop duster in the dark.  \r\nthen i thought, hmmm, winter ending, first warm night, maybe someone is flying a drone that hovers and has cool lights.  and… it is a drone they can control over four miles.\r\noh well.  just wondering if anyone else reported it.

\"why was i in the kitchen?\" i didn't have food or anything in my hands. on the way down the hall to the bathroom i passed my bedroom door and as i walked past i looked in the room (as i always do passing doors) took 2 more steps, then stepped backward and looked in the room again, there it was standing in front of my patio door almost as tall as the door. i froze and my jaw dropped.\r\nit

tried to recall walking to my kitchen or what i had been doing this whole time but couldn't remember anything except a strange bracelet. i felt compelled to draw the creature and the bracelet in hopes to clear my mind and get some sleep.\r\ni told my husband about this in the morning, thats when we noticed the furniture i have my heavy jewelry box on had been pushed away from the wall right where
