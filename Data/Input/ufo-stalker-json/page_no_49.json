brighter then flash an amber light cone at the other object. it did this a couple times. this light was going out in a cone shaped wave and bright across hundreds of miles of skyline. then it beamed the light in my general direction... illuminating the beach and building to the north of me in a bright amber-orange light. i started filming on my phone. the southmost object did this light \"charge\" a couple more times but didn't shoot the beams out that i could see. they then started flying opposite directions simultaneously. in about 10-15 seconds they covered about 25-30 miles distance each... that is roughly 2-2.5mps or 7200-9000mph! then they just vanished... like slowly faded out, dimmed their lights, or cloaked themselves. they must have been huge also... roughly

pretty low for such a big plane. i'm a retired fire captain from the san francisco bay area. it caught my attention because a commercial passenger plane would not be in this area so low unless it was in some kind of trouble. i saw two solid white lights and one white light blinking. my wife then looked over and said it's not a plane it's just hovering. as i looked back over i could now see the solid black triangle hovering about 2-300 ft to my left and about 300 ft in the air.The two solid lights were on the outside edges of the triangle with the leading light blinking. since i was driving my wife continued to watch it and said it had turned and was now above us. she had opened the moon roof and i could see it clearly. when i had first seen it , it was pointed to the west and now was pointed south/west. i pulled off the nearest off ramp and got back on the freeway heading west to continue watching. by the time i had got turned around it had disappeared in the steam cloud produced by the hydro electric company. we then pulled off the freeway again and positioned our self's below the steam cloud waiting for it to reappear. we waited several minuets and was unable to see it again. \r\n    when i first made it out to be a triangle i was slightly excited cause i've belonged to mufon in the past and was just looking ate some old mufon magazines last night. i said to my wife

took the opportunity to casually glance around and observe my surroundings, including the sky.  the day had quite hot temperature, with very little breeze out of an unremembered direction.  the sky over the whole visible region was sparsely cloudy at high altitude, and the sun was at a position of approx. 45-50 degrees off of the horizon to the south.  the skies over the region were noticed to be filled with many high altitude aircraft con-trails, as well as a few aircraft in the active process of adding new trails.  while in the process of observing how lightly any high altitude winds were having dispersal effects on the various vapor trails, my attention was caught by one particular trail that was unusual, compared to the rest.  the unusual trail was located far to the south, and was estimated as being approx. over the metro-area of denver, with an east-to-west placement that was estimated over the general course of i-70.  the contrail was unusual, as besides the standard, normal-looking aircraft vapor trail, evenly spaced along its entire visible length the con-trail was \"surrounded\" by large, ring/donut-shaped \"puffs\".  the trail ran from as far as the eye could see to the east, and was lost to view eventually to the west, from blocking mountain terrain, with the aircraft responsible for the trail already gone from the area, before notice of the con-trail.  wind dispersal was light enough, that had the trail under observation for approx. 45 minutes, until resumption of work activities.  sketch available.","distance":"Over One

was located approx. 1/4 mile to the west of the intersection area of i-25 and co st. hwy. 119, just to the north of hwy. 119, near the little community of del camino, co.  had been working the job for a couple of weeks, which would put the sighting date around the middle of that month.  was in the site's \"wash plant\" area, where smaller particulate materials are processed (sand/small gravel), and was engaged in the activity of greasing conveyor belt return-roller zirks.  was in the process of attempting to attach the grease gun's fitting to the zirk of a conveyor return-roller that was situated a little above my head level, causing me to look almost directly upwards at the moment, while facing east.  while looking upwards, i noticed movement of an object passing through the air at moderately high altitude, as it entered my field of vision being used for the overhead work activity.  because of the object's color pattern, had initially thought it was some kind of gull/pelican/stork avian passing over the area, of a type more along a greyish coloration, than the more common white.  the displayed speed of the object rapidly ruled out an avian, so i stopped my activities and brought the object under intense observation.  atmospheric and weather conditions at the time were hot & balmy (close proximity of water sources, raised humidity levels), with mild breeze out of the sw, cloudless sky with light, high-altitude atmospheric haze, and the sun was at an approx. 45-50 degrees off of the horizon to the sse.  the object appeared as a large, basically triangular material construct that was longer in its fore-to-aft area, than in its side-to-side \"wings\" area.  the object appeared to be approx. 60-80 ft. in length x 40-60 ft. in width, and deviated from true triangular shape with a centralized, slight, angular extension to its shape in the aft area, giving it the appearance of actually possessing 4 angles and sides.  the object was of an overall light coloration, which allowed it to blend in quite well with the surrounding sky coloring prevalent at the time (normal light-blue, with slight greyish ting from haze).  a dark-colored \"stripe\" was noticed upon each of its \"wings\", running the length of the wing from fore-to-aft, and seemingly positioned onto the wing more heavily towards the wingtips, than the object's centerline.  object's altitude appeared to be noticeably below normal high-altitude cruising levels used by commercial airliners, and was estimated at approx. 20,000 ft., which the object did not appear to deviate from.  object was travelling on a south-to-north linear trajectory, seemingly as if above and following the course of i-25, which was maintained throughout the observation period.  the object displayed a consistent, rapid speed throughout the sighting, that i estimated to be approx. 3x the pace of a cruising high-altitude commercial airliner, or in excess of full-throttle speeds of most fighter jets.  as i watched the object pass overhead, i noticed that its passage was through a light layer of atmospheric haze, and that it was leaving a \"wake-wash\" turbulence effect in the haze behind its progress, although the object did not produce any kind of con-trail at that altitude.  safety ear-plugs were being worn at the time, and ambient noise levels of the area prevented any detection of associated sound.  object was observed for approx. 1.25 minutes on the northward trajectory, until lost to eyesight in the distance.  sketch available.

assumed were two military jets in formation flying from north to south just past the lakes and at the western side of the north/south valley.\r\nthe objects i say were apparently above 500 feet over ground and estimate their speed between 300-400 mph. as i watched them, became immediately aware they had no observable flight surfaces (no wings or rear empennage).\r\nthey transited from my left 9 o'clock position to roughly my 2 o'clock, disappearing behind a mt. ridge after an approximate 20-40 seconds of view.\r\nit was an extremely quiet late afternoon. i detected no sounds whatsoever from the objects. any and all aircraft i'd seen is similiar flight paths over the valley were easily heard, jet noise echoing off the mts. surrounding june lake. very puzzling sighting. the two objects

waterway), a few miles south of the chamberlain bridge. we were the only people camping that week in the area according to the park ranger who left us all alone. we set up camp at the high bank campsite. at 11:30pm, we made a fire and were looking up at the sky. it was the clearest night sky i've ever seen. we saw a light moving a couple of miles up, but we knew there were no airports anywhere around. looking through binoculars, we noticed it moving in a straight line from right to left, looking like it was moving at the speed an airplane would move. all of sudden, the object came to a stop and then darted to the right to a stationary spot in the sky. we freaked out but still followed it with binoculars. lastly, the object either turned dark or it sped off away from the earth because it completely disappeared. there was nothing else moving in the sky at this point. we panicked and quickly put out our fire in a hurry. we ran into our tent, zipped it up and huddled in the corner. i've never felt so afraid in my life.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

clear night sky way up, but not directly overhead. there were no stars out and no air traffic. i couldn't see blinking lights on it like on planes or helicopters. and it wasn't moving close or leaving. i stood watching it about 2 mins trying to figure out what it was. i stopped looking to go to my apt and let my hubby know i was home. about five minutes later i got curious to see if it was still there and went outside. it was there, still rectangular. i went to get my phone and took a picture, which was not as clear as what i could actually see. then there was a sort of mist coming off it and a cylinder shape grew behind it. i photographed that too. i was like, \"what the heck!\" i stood there watching a few more minutes and then got unnerved being outside in the dark and alone, so i went back in the apt and didn't go back out at all. i also have a picture of it that includes my apt complex and the empty, dark night sky, but i couldn't access it from my photo gallery. i was able to include these two shots because they were enlarged previously in photoshop and easy to access.
