it only went about 2 seconds and about 15% of my windshield in this opposite direction before it disappeared completely. i don't mean left at great speed away. i mean vanished on the spot like it teleported. there was no clouds. it was far away but it was not the kind of far away that things aren't visible anymore if they move farther away. i could clearly see behind it for some distance. when i first noticed it, i was aware it was unusual in shape, size, speed, and brightness. i was thrilled because i knew i was looking at a craft and i knew it couldn't have been anything on record. the change in direction and color made my heart race, because it became the most out of place real thing i've ever seen. afterward, i wondered all day how any possible occupant could have survived the turn it made at the speed it did. i imaged myself as a puddle on the wall inside it. i had seen unusual things in the sky, but i'm now an unwavering believer in advanced flight technology and i know more is possible than current physics allows for. this all happened less than 2.5 miles from bluegrass airport in lexington, ky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":75356,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0496537,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03222016-0014","longitude":-84.5003364,"occurred":1441855020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1458671711000,"summary":"Fast, bright, solid shaped craft changed color and direction on a dime","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":29,"maxtempi":84,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":11,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":29,"maxtempi":84,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":11,"meanvisi":7,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":194,"locationName":"Lexington, Kentucky","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:82452"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Zelenograd","country":"Russia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I saw it. it was moving. black and auful. firstly i tghought it was baloon, but it was really hihgher!

well when i looked at it, it took me a second to realize there was no possible way for it to be a plane or helicopter. it had around 4-6 lights around it and was a disc or saucer like shape from the distance we were at. the lights weren't all the same color and they flashed or pulsated. some of the lights looked like a normal light and some had a blueish white tint to them. the craft went straight up leaving behind a hazey smokey like trail up towards where the moon was at in the sky. after going up it went straight and started gaining speed very quickly until we could no longer see it. we watched it all the way home until we pulled in the driveway then got out and seen it for maybe another minute before it disappeared from view from going so quickly across the sky. it couldn't have been just something we imagined. the sky was completely clear and the moon was bright and stars were out. it was clear as day that, that thing was no everyday spacecraft whether it's

lit by a few lights.  after some time, i told my gf, that we needed to pull off the highway to take a look, because i had to know what it was.  we did.  the thing flew over us, it was large and silently blotted out the stars above us.  we guessed it had to be a large blimp or something, but it doesn't make sense.  i think we would have heard a blimp.  we eventually got back in the truck and got going.  the thing was gone.  \r\n\r\ni am familiar with aircraft- it was not a plane, it was moving too slowly.  it may have been a blimp at night, but did not make a sound and the lights seemed

had the flu so i decided to sleep in my eldest daughters bed so as not to get my partner sick. i had the blinds open to let the moonlight in and had noticed at about 11:15pm what i thought was an airplane flashing through the sky through the branches of a tree in our yard. it was a very clear night so i watched it for about a minute and thought it was flashing strangely but that i was probably just seeing it weirdly through the branches. i rolled over to go to sleep but after about 30mins i couldn't sleep so i rolled back over. the bright flashing light was still there and i knew that if it was an airplane or a satellite it would have moved to another position in the sky or passed out of view by now.\r\n\r\ni got out of bed and grabbed my phone which was charging. i started to film. you can see the street light in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, then i zoom in on the light. i steadied the phone on the window sill and once i zoomed in on the light it began to move around until my phone suddenly died. i bent down to plug my phone in to continue charging but when i looked back up the light was gone.\r\n\r\ni have seen this exact light once before in my life when i was a girl, back in the late 90's my mum, dad, sister & i were watching a huge meteor shower in our backyard in st. george, on and when the meteor shower drew to a close a light exactly like this hovered high above our house and did the exact same movements.\r\n\r\nthe night i filmed these lights my eldest daughter and her best friend saw several bright balls of light in their bedroom at my mother's house.\r\n\r\nnone of us felt scared or reacted in any way other than wonder. we aren't into paranormal stuff and don't know a ton of stuff about ufo's. we just know that we see weird lights and weird stuff happens around us sometimes. we haven't felt well lately. both my daughters are on wait lists for ent's (ear nose & throat specialists) at mc master hospital. i am on a wait list for an allergist. we all have upper respiratory infections and chronic sinusitis, my eldest daughter has nosebleeds and has woken up with bruising and blood on the palate of her mouth. my youngest daughter has a weird triangular mark on her shoulder and i have a weird scar on my right calf. there are other odd health things too but that's probably enough for now. i can provide medical documentation and

immediately noticed a very bright green light in the south western sky. it was led bright and steady, it looked as if it may have had a diamond shape. at this point the storm was getting closer and the winds picked up. this object in the sky was obviously having a difficult time maintaining altitude, it was a lot closer to the squall then i was. this sighting lasted approx 25 seconds, enough time for me another witness to talk about what we were seeing. \"look at that\" \"do you see that\" \"what's it doing\" \"that's not an airplane\"  the light was having a difficult time with the storm. it zigged and zagged momentarily and struggled for altitude. at one point the light \"yawed\" heavily and the green ultra bright led like light turned to a dull white light, with maybe a hint or red/pink, this lasted less than a second. as the light rotated back so the green light was facing us, it maintained altitude for an instant before it dropped like a rock out view. it fell from about 30 degrees to below the tree line/roof line in less than a second. that was the last we saw of it. i initially thought this was an airplane, but the light only moved up and down with varied zig zag motion. as an aircraft mechanic/pilot i know that a starboard wing has a green nav light. i would expect the white light on every aircraft's tail to be equally bright, as well as the port side red light. this was not the case, if  you need to change one nav light bulb.. you change all of them. plus, no pilot in his right mind would purposely fly into an approaching storm of that magnitude.
