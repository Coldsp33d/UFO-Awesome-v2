stunning. there is an astronomical observatory in those mountains but when i contacted them to find out if they had seen something, there was no response. this light was much more intense and huger in

seeing aircraft was normal...Even for the middle of the night. however, these were not military aircraft. at least, none that i've ever seen before. the other two witnesses wish to remain anonymous, and wish to not be bothered about the sighting ever again.\r\n\r\nit was the last summer my friends and i had together; i was leaving to the army in september. so, we decided to have one last 'adventure' together. my parents would always tell horror stories about hauntings in pere cheney, and we thought we were the bravest punks around, so we decided that would be the ideal place to camp for 3 days. once we arrived at our site- a place off in the middle of the woods not too far from the cemetery of pere cheney (one of the only pieces left of the abandoned settlement)- we immediately began our investigation of the area surrounding and set up camp. the first day went fine, but come the first night, strange things started happening. \r\n\r\nwe woke to a flash in the sky- a very quick one. the other two went back to sleep, but out of curiosity i remained awake, fearing that a storm was coming on. to my relief, there was no thunder. i had just started to doze off when i heard some branches cracking around the tent, and i began to remember my parents horror stories about \"dogman\" and barewalk\"- old native american tales. fearing the worst, i curled into my sleeping bag and closed my eyes. eventually, the movement stopped. another flash of light occurred. sleep eventually found me, the next thing i knew i was waking up to the sun light. \r\n\r\nthe next day, my other two friends seemed to have no recollection of the light, nor did they remember hearing anything moving about. because such things seemed crazy, i wrote it off as an \"all in my head\" situation. \r\n\r\nwe decided to explore a little that day; the previous day one of my friends had discovered a small marsh-like area. after a few moments of snooping around the area my other friend called our attention to something in the tall grass. it was a deer, but it had its throat slit as if by a surgical tool, and it had no guts. there was no blood around the carcass, and it didn't smell decomposed at all. now unsettled, we returned to our camp to finish the second day- we spent the rest of it playing guitar around the campfire and just in general having a good time; we had forgotten all about the deer, and i had almost forgotten the light. \r\n\r\nlater that night, at about 2:30 am, i want to say, a light, cool breeze blew through the forest, and the fire dimmed to a low glow. at that moment, we got our cell phones out to check the time- and realized we didn't have signal like we had before. i raised my phone to the sky to try and find signal...And that's when i realized that some of the stars in the sky had started to fall- multiple, between 5 and 7 (i never counted them) started descending,glowing and pulsating, but still quite a ways away. i thought they were flares, but they stopped descending, and began to pulsate. at this instance we were very weary, confused, and frightened. the \"stars\" began to float over toward us, slowly moving directly over our heads without making a sound. then they ascended after passing the camp for a moment- very quickly, though...Not slowly, almost like they teleported. they hovered over a field not too far from the small opening we had made our camp in. the lights came closer, producing a light green aura in a circle. from the forest came three low glowing blue orbs, at that instance is when a low humming could be heard, and they came together and sat still. then they ascended in between the \"stars\", which had now come together in a solid object, and they ascended even more; slowly at first, but then began to speed up, ascending at an angle. \r\n\r\nabout half a minute later two military jets passed over, very rapidly. the rest of our night was quiet, and awe filled. the next day, instead of sticking around to find out what might happen the next night, we decided to bail. we weren't the tough little punks we thought we were.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

i-25 from colorado springs to denver. the sighting happened somewhere between co 470 and yale ave on i-25 north. \r\n\r\nwhat made us notice the two objects is they were bigger than other commercial aircraft flying over the interstate and they stopped, hovered, changed color and then disappeared. we saw two flat, white discs (or more likely could have been white cigar shaped, we were looking at them edge on - definitely not saucer or domed shaped or triangle, etc.). \r\n\r\nthey seemed to be moving at the same low altitude, speed and direction as commercial airliners flying out of dia over downtown denver - but they had no wings and were at least about twice the size of a commercial airliner. one was a good 2 to 5 miles ahead of us to the north and the second one was probably another 5 miles north of that one. they were moving and then suddenly stopped over i-25, to the nw of us, hovered in place for about 30 seconds and then began to turn a reddish orange color, slowly becoming more and more transparent with the blue sky - and then poof! gone! they disappeared! my mileage distance is a big guess, i'm not in aeronautics and am not a good judge of aerial distances. \r\n\r\nthe feeling initially was \"oh, that's a strange plane, looks bigger than the others..\" to \"oh my! two of them stopped! those are not planes!\" my wife doesn't really buy into the ufo thing and it made her so uncomfortable she didn't want to discuss it with me. i kept trying to talk about it and discuss it, but the shock of it all was very obvious and unsettling to her. \r\n\r\nit all happened in under a minute and we were driving at 80 mph, so unfortunately we didn't get any pictures or video of it. i know anyone else driving with us on i-25 going northbound saw it if they looked up into the

cloudy sky with sunglasses. i first noticed 2 airplanes, then i noticed a smaller disk like object going south east bound when it took a sharp turn into/behind a cloud. i regret not stopping where i was walking to see what would happen when the cloud dissipated, although i continued walking and not completely staring at the cloud the ufo took cover in.I then started recording the cloud and my experience with my cell phone. i should have stopped walking and see what would happen to the ufo once the cloud in the sky dissipated, none the less i know what i saw and it was real...I am fully convinced that ufo's are real. this is my 2nd ufo sighting in a 6 year span.\r\n\r\n3. i knew right away it could have not have been a drone (it was too high in the air.)it was not an airplane because it was way smaller and didn't even resemble an airplane at all. it had turned away from its flight path abruptly and took cover in/behind a cloud.\r\n\r\n4. turned/changed its flight path in a very fast manner.\r\n\r\n5. i was flabbergasted when i noticed this ufo. i didn't have my phone in my hand at the time so i could not have recorded it, but i did record the cloud it went behind and shared my experience. when i got home i knew that ufo's are real. i was completely convinced. \r\n\r\n5. how i lost sight of the ufo: i continued to walk my way home with tree's interrupting my point of view of the sky. i fully regret not stopping to see what would happen once the cloud disappeared, but at the same time i was fully convinced that this was real. i had sunglasses on and the sky was very clear to see. ufo's are real and i no one will convince me that they're not. never.\r\n\r\nsadly i am finding trouble on how to transfer the video i took from my phone onto a windows computer, although there is no ufo sighting at all in the video.\r\n\r\nalso i appreciate mufon for taking the time to review my encounter. seeing is believing. i saw and i believe. thank you","distance":"Over

we noticed unusual cloud formations moving in. directly above us there were clouds swirling in a cyclone shape and it looked so unusual that i asked him to take some pictures. neither of us noticed the lights, we were both focused on a very small patch of clouds. when we viewed the pictures the next day, i noticed the odd lights. we took five photos. in one photo, you can see two very bright lights. if you zoom in, they are very yellow. the next picture in the series was taken a few second later and shows a set of two bright lights in the top right, but if you look closely, there is another set in the top left. i thought perhaps they were landing gear lights, but there is no third set of lights. landing gear lights are also not usually that color (at least in my experience). the shape of the lights is also not anything that i recognize from any aircraft. it seems off. there is also a halo around the lights and what looks like shadow behind them. in one picture, it is a lot closer to us than in the other, to me that indicates travel at consideral speed. i felt very peaceful when we were watching the clouds, and a little awestruck at the size of.The storm front moving in. it was a huge wall of clouds and there was a massive demarcation between the clear sky and where the storm was moving in. i had also never seen clouds move that way before. \r\n\r\nin viewing the

oriented, this continued for about a minute or two. then the object started moving directly over my house, it was too dark and high for me to get a good look at it but i could see that it was moving in a slow circular pattern, and it was clearly a perfect triangle. it was completely silent. i live beside a military communication base, i believe that could have something to do with it.

moscow, id, for more details on these weird \"aircraft.\" there are still these bizarre cylinder objects with strange lights on them that hover at times, or move across the sky. i still have no idea what these are, but i still see them almost anytime i commute at night. i have seen some during the day as well, but they're harder to spot. sometimes i'll go to the grocery store, and they'll be hovering in the sky when i exit. i still have hours of video to sift through and edit on my camrecorder that i'll get around to one of these days. the attached videos are taken from my cellphone. if anyone has any ideas as to what these are, please let me know. they're interesting, but super creepy at this point.
