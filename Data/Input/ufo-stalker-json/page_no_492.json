seem to be everywhere i go. i have seen cigar shaped, saucer shaped, round, and one that looked like the sun, changing shape and glowing like the sun but it was only about 200 feet from the ground with no sound. the last one i observed was just about a week ago. i was on my balcony looking at the stars which i do every night, and saw a very bright red light that seemed to be pulsating around it. i knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter because it was hovering at first, then moved very slowly with no other lights such as white or green, and no sound. i went to get my camera which only took about a minuite and it was nowhere to be seen. i'm use to seeing these things and no one wants to believe me, of course, which really frustrates me to no end. thanks for reading this i now feel i'm not so alone now.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

planes go by as we are in the flight path to our airport. i noticed an odd looking plane that was not in the flight path. it was moving east slow so i watched it for a few minutes. it looked like a space shuttle but odd. it was one dimensional. it looked like a paper cut out. i could barely see the edges. it was white and a bit darker around where the real shuttle would  be black.   \r\n\r\ni called my husband out to see it. i asked him what it was. he said a plane at first, then looked longer and changed his mind. he decided it was somebody's drone. that had crossed my mind also, but at that point we had been watching it for well over 10 minutes and wouldn't the drone's batteries have died? i was about to say that when all of a sudden the object changed direction and changed shape and color all in about one second, changed back into the shuttle shape and kept moving on west now slightly faster. we both cursed loudly and stood in shock watching it, and decided it was not a drone. \r\n\r\nit is hard to describe the transformation the object performed as our brains are wired to believe was we witnessed it not possible.  the \"shuttle\" had just suddenly paused for a slight split second, and then it looked to have imploded and then ballooned out into a red glowing blob with a bright intense halo of wavering light around it. the light grew to bright and when it left it was the shuttle again. \r\n\r\nwe watched it for about 5 more minutes when it became obscured by distant trees. my husband went back inside. i kept watching. about 8 minuted later i saw it again many miles further headed north-east this time at a higher elevation and it soon got lost in the clouds.\r\n\r\nwe have 3 major military aircraft bases close to us, so we are now thinking it is some bizarre experimental thing from hurlburt, even though we both believe in extra-terrestrial life. so later that day we are at my grandparents and we tell them the whole story. i end with my theory about it being military.   my grandfather surprised me and said it was more than likely extra-terrestrial. he has never been a person to talk about such things. he is a stoic and militant man. he was a cryptographer in military intelligence and that suggests he knows things. he would not discuss it any further are answer any questions other than that one, but 'that one' shook me up!

mon fils ã  l'ã©cole, ã  deux coins de rue de chez moi j'ai vu dans le ciel au sud une lumiã¨re mã©tallique ultra brillante dans le ciel parfaitement dã©gagã©. (fond de nuages ã  environ 10 km.\r\n2: j'ai remarquã© la lumiã¨re hyper lumineuse en premier, comme une ã©toile que l'on voit de jour, mais 1000 fois plus brillantes.  j'ai alors arrãªtã© mon vã©hicule pour voir l'objet plus prã©cisã©ment, c'est lã  que j'ai vu qu'il avanã§ait ã  l'horizontal en direction ouest ã  environ 60km/h. l'objet aprã¨s quelque secondes s'est retournã©e et la luminositã© a presque totalement cessã©. c'est alors que j'ai vu l'objet solide de couleur or-beige qui faisait des manoeuvres pour ensuite changer de direction. il es't mis ã  monter et ã  cause de mon angle de vision avec les arbres et les maisons, j'ai du avancer mon vã©hicule. c'est alors que 3 ã  4 secondes plus tard alors que j'avais une vue parfaite du ciel sur des km ã  la ronde l'objet n'y ã©tait plus!  plusieurs personnes m'on dit avoir vu qqchose aussi ã  la mãªme heure. mãªme le plus rapide des avions n'aurait pu s'ã©clipser comme cela! plus rien! cela me faisait penser a un phã©nomã¨ne similaire vu de nuit par moi-mãªme environ 2 mois avant de nuit. l'objet s'ã©tait envolã©  ã  toute vitesse ã  un angle de 45 degrã©s vers les ã©toiles pour enfin disparaã®tre totalement! le premier ã©vã¨nement a ã©tã© vu par plusieurs personnes en mãªme temps. ce matin un ami a moi m'a dit qu'il s'est fait approchã© par des boules bleues alors qu'il faisait de la motoneige... c'est dans le mãªme secteur.\r\n\r\nce n'est pas la premiã¨re fois que je suis tã©moin de tel phã©nomã¨ne par ici. il y a environ 3 ans j'ai ã©tã© survolã© par un disque alors que j'arrivait ã  longue-pointe-de-mingan alors que je me dirigeait en direction ouest en voiture. l'objet est arrivã© au dessus de la sime des arbres ã  une vitesse d'environ 150km\\h pour s'arrãªter totalement  en vol stationnaire ã  ma droite (2h). l'objet en arrãªtant s'est inclinã© vers l'arriã¨re de sorte que j'ai vu le dessous de la soucoupe d'environ 30 m. de diamã¨tre. le dessus ã©tait hyper lumineux comme celui dã©crit plus haut (couleur mã©tallique blanche et bleutã© ã  la fois. le dessous ã©tait de couleur noir, mais pas un noir normal, comme une lumiã¨re nã©gative, noir absolu. l'objet a restã© environ 2 secondes sur place pour ensuite repartir vers mes (1h) ã  un angle d'environ 5 degrã©s vers le haut pour franchir une distance d'environ 15km en environ 1,5 secondes max. pas un son perã§u, malgrã© que j'ã©tais en voiture! j'ai vraiment trouvã© cela cool, du fait que je crois ã  200% aux extraterrestres et que ce n'est pas la premiã¨re fois que je vois de tels phã©nomã¨nes de mes yeux.\r\n\r\nquelques annã©es avant en 2002  alors que je descendait de 7iles vers havre-saint-pierre par une nuit d'hiver hyper ã©toilã©e, pas de lune, j'ai aperã§u des lumiã¨res de couleur rouge et bleu avec une lumiã¨re blanche qui ã©tait au loin. mon premier rã©flex a ã©tã© de me dire que c'ã©tait une tour de tã©lã©com, mais je savais qu'ã  mon souvenir il n'y avait pas de tour dans ce secteur et que cela ã©tait la cã´te (bord de mer). plus je m'en venais en direction est, plus le lumiã¨re semblait ne pas ãªtre fixe et avancer tranquillement vers ma trajectoire de route. 3 ou 4 minutes plus tard, j'ai bien vu que cela n'ã©tait pas normal. j'ai donc arrãªtã© mon vã©hicule et l'objet ã©tait environ ã  100' du sol au dessus des arbres et faisait un son ã  double frã©quence comme un vrombissement. les lumiã¨res de l'objet ã©tait disposã©e en triangle avec une lumiã¨re blanche au centre. l'objet devait faire environ 15m de long par 10m de large. il est passã© devant moi ã  environ 400' pour ensuite changer de direction et continuer sa route au dessus des arbres en direction ouest. je j'ai perdu au dessus des arbres. je me suis dit que si l'objet ã©tait pour me faire du mal il aurait eu l'occasion et rien ne me servait de me sauver en voiture! je n'ai pas eut peur.En fait j'aurai bien aimã© que l'objet se pose et avoir un contact avec le ou les  occupants . j'ai vu le mãªme objet il y a quelques annã©e entre lã©vis et montmagnie sur l'autoroute 20 ã  environ 1km de hauteur en vol stationnaire avec ma conjointe.\r\n\r\nj'ai vu aussi il y a quelques annã©es ce qui ressemble ã¨ une sonde qui faisait du vol stationnaire devant chez ma mã¨re, cylindre vertical de couleur blanc cassã© avec une coupole de type champignon de couleur noir. je me souvient de l'avoir vu et aprã¨s je ne me souvient plus de rien! ã‰trange!\r\n\r\nsur la route il y a 2 ans juste au dessus de la riviã¨re chaloupe sur la cã´te-nord (est de 7iles) j'ai vu un nuage par un ciel parfaitement bleu. le nuage ã©tait juste au dessus de la route et semblait ãªtre hyper changã© ã©lectriquement. il ã©tait de couleur brun jaune orangã©. il avait environ 3m de large pour 1m de haut. alors que je tournais un croche sur la 138, j'ai perdu le nuage de vu pour 3 ou 4 secondes. lorsque je suis arrivã© ã  passer au point ou l'objet ã©tait, le nuage avait changã© de forme, il ã©tait ã©tirã© vers le nord (droite) comme si un objet ã©tait ã  l'intã©rieur et avait dã©chirã© le nuage en partant!  je n'avais pas d'appareil photo avec moi!!! le nuage a restã© sur place quelques secondes avant de se dã©faire par le vent.\r\n\r\nalors que j'arrivait du sud au dessus de la caroline (usa) alors que je me dirigait aux toilettes dans l'avion j'ai regardã© dans un hublot ã  ma droite et j'ai vu  une boule bleu arriver de l'est ã  une vitesse que j'estime ã  mac 15. l'objet a passã© ã  environ 1km sous notre avion et j'ai juste eu le temps e tourner la tãªte pour voir la mãªme boule bleu filer horizontalement  et de maniã¨re linã©aire toujours ã  la mãªme vitesse. j'ai vu l'objet pendant un total d'environ 3 secondes le temps de le perdre de vu. c'ã©tait comme si notre avion ã©tait arrãªtã© tellement il allait rapidement!... \r\n\r\nã  l'ã¢ge de 13 ou 14 ans j'ai vu prã¨s de longue-pointe-de-mingan un vaisseau en forme de diamant de couleur dorã©e radiant d'environ 100 ã  150m de hauteur. il semblait avoir en son centre une sã©rie de fenãªtres. l'objet faisait du stationnaire au dessus d'une tour de tã©lã©communication  ã  environ 2km du village....\r\nje pourrait continuer

a 'star' was moving slightly in relation to the other 'fixed' stars. i watched it weave it's way down as if it were responding to my attention. i turned north onto winchester and it was getting really close!It had lots of lights, red and blue ones, and i thought it seemed like too many for a piece of equipment. i turned east onto scenic and south onto the next street and pulled over and jumped out. standing there, between an rv park (of course!) and a dirt lot, underneath the telephone poles and wires,i could hear a slight buzzing or whirring and i thought \"is that a drone?.. well, this is either my first drone sighting or just about my twenty first ufo encounter.\" i looked around and noticed other aerial craft moving about with their regular blinking lights but could not determine the sound source.\r\n i watched in awe as this thing moved directly overhead, then slid to a stop and went back in the direction it came from (n/e). wow! i got back in and started to awkwardly turn the rv around but the thing was moving north at a nice clip. i pondered those lights: is it red lights in a blue glow or blue lights in a red glow? i lost track of it as i head east on scenic rd. i turned north on tomahawk rd and as i drove a little up the way i noticed all of a sudden this thing was just off my left side pacing me as i traveled. it was just above the houses and the trees, which are low in this neighborhood! i pointed out the window and said: \" who are you? what are you? cops? military? frickin' aliens?\" i chuckled. the thing did something strange: from in between all the lights that were already switched on, emerged a whole other grouping of lights as if to say: \"how's this? i bet this just blows your mind, don't it?\" i held my arm out the window grasping at the air like a baby that wants a cookie and when i got to the corner of superstition rd i pulled onto the dirt lot there, jumped out again and made my contact signal: one hand to my heart and one open palm offering a space here on the ground. by this time, the \"thingy\" simply went back to the southwest, cruising easily over the neighborhoods toward gilbert, chandler, queen creek, something like that. \r\na few days later i got to see a couple of guys fly their toy drones around, i thought that was a good synchronicity. those were expensive pieces of junk.\r\n if this weird object was one of 'ours'

really paying attention), went for a run on my neighborhood road which allows for unobstructed northbound vision and travel (no big trees in line of sight) for about 300 hundred yards. there were no clouds or dust at all in the sky and it was as clear as could be. as i was jogging, straight ahead of me in the sky i saw a floating egg shaped object. it was white, and you could tell the shape of it easily. it was not shiny and reflected no light, so it was easy to make out the shape and outline and some details of it. it was clear and crisp against the blue sky. there was almost a light shadow or light gray curve centered at the front of it (referring to orientation toward me), being either some insignia or just the profile of the object catching the sun from the east. if you cut the object into 4 segments, this mark \")\" was centered on the object. the object was a few hundred yards away from me, and a few hundred yards in the air. i am facing north with the santa catalina mountains behind the object. the object was above the mountain range and was against blue sky. the skies were empty apart from the egg. the area the egg was over has some homes scattered through it and it is inhabited, but the higher percentage is desert or more open. it's not the middle of town, it's on the outskirts, close to the base of mt. lemmon.\r\n\r\ni had sunglasses on and headphones in and was listening to the radio on my music device.  2 minutes into my run i saw it, stopped, took of my glasses and looked at this object, just being perfectly still in the sky. i looked around for a second to make sure i wasn't seeing something and it was still there. i stood there for at least 5 minutes looking at it. i have an accurate time reference as at least 3 songs played on the radio in my earplugs which i still had in during this time. i thought, \"ok, better keep running.\" (don't get much time to exercise and i'm a fitness nut so it's my priority) i am out of road heading north at this time so i turned east. there are decent sized mesquite trees close to the road now on the north side of me in between me and the object. i ran about 50 yards and was still curious about the object so i looked for it again once the trees ended. it wasn't there. i kept looking and panning side to side and i had found it was more to the east now. but only by about 50-100 yards. i ran back to my original position of sight to make sure it wasn't just my point of view, and the object had actually moved to the east, in the direction i was running. i never saw any movement after about 30 seconds to a minute. so i turned back and kept running. i ran to tanque verde highway and kept heading east, and it was still in the same spot. if there was any slow movement, i couldn't perceive it as i was running while looking at it, but it did seem to stay on the same course with me, now that i think about it. i had moved a long distance east now and the point of vision in reference to my body was still the same. (didn't have to look back behind me for it). kept running and didn't think about the egg for a while. about 10 minutes later i looked for it again and it was much further north now, closer to the mountains, but at the same elevation. maybe about twice as far away from me as it had been before. still above the mountain range in reference to my vision but because of the extended distance now, i could tell it was the same object, but could not see perfectly crisp outlines of the edges anymore.\r\n\r\nnow i saw a plane come into view flying from east to west. the plane was further away than the egg. but you could still make out the \"t\" shape of the plane. there were light gray or whitish smoke/chem-trails coming off the plane from a single point on the plane. but only for 50 yards behind it (about 5 times longer than the plane's body length at that viewing distance). none of the long \"stripes\" you see in the sky that hang around forever. the plane was closer to the santa catalina mountains and appeared just above the mountains. i stopped running to watch and see if anything would happen and to get a reference to how close to each other these two objects were. because of the plane's further distance beyond the egg, it appeared as the plane passed below the egg but the plane was still against blue sky. the egg didn't move, and once the body of the plane was past the egg to the point where the chem-trails were still about half below the egg i turned away and kept running east. total time i stopped and watched this time was about 3 minutes, based on hearing one and a half songs on the radio.  i ran for about 5 more minutes before turning back to the direction i came. i looked in the same spot i had seen the egg and i couldn't see it anymore, or the airplane anywhere in the sky. \r\n\r\nevery time i had seen the object it was perfectly still. remaining absolutely motionless and remaining in the same spot in the sky with no jet or engine noise. i live by and worked on davis monthan air force base for a number of years. i have seen and been around the helicopters up close and far away, and i'm even familiar enough to hear the difference between a10, f16 or f35 engine sounds a lot of the time. i can even hear jets pass over the house while i'm inside on many days. i have played sports outside all my life. i hunt. i professionally shoot rifle and pistol competitively, where we have to judge distance for shots and we use a timer to judge our time for competitions. and with that experience, i understand when most people say \"i sat there for like 5 minutes\", they really mean about 30 seconds to a minute. saying that, these are my best estimates for time (based off of music played on the radio which averages about 2.5-3 minutes per song) and distance based on mental yardage markers i use in competition and hunting to identify distance.","distance":"501 Feet -

very bright and not easy to miss.  it was like one big whirl of colors of the rainbow but not in the shape of your arc type rainbow.  i know these are called rainbow clouds but i have only seen one once before and that one i reported to mufon too, last year i believe it was.\r\n\r\nwhen i had my first sighting of a rainbow cloud last year i noticed two ufos seemingly to come between two vertical short rainbow clouds when i held up my binoculars - couldn't see the ufos til i used the binoculars - so this time when i saw another rainbow cloud (different shape than the first though) i knew to look further with the binoculars again.\r\n\r\nprior to remaining solidly rainbow colored the cloud swirl formation had a more whitish color to it and when i looked through the binoculars there was what looked like a tunnel tube like shape that was quite long and on the outside of it it had ridges.  it appeared to be like a tunnel is the only way i can describe it, i almost expected something to come out of the end of it that was well formed and perfectly round and looked like a giant hole.  nothing did come out of it unless when the dark clouds came over later something came out but i couldn't see at that point.  the tunnel sort of faded in form off and on as the colors of the rainbow intensified.\r\nwhen i spotted the ufo i will tell you about next in the rainbow cloud the tunnel had almost totally gone.\r\n\r\nat first the colors of the cloud were just moving around a little and changing in depth of color and i didn't see anything else but i persevered and sure enough about half way through the viewing there it was, near the upper middle part of the rainbow cloud - a definite sold disc just sitting behind the cloud.  it stayed put for the whole sighting but behind the mist of the cloud.  where it was appeared a peach like color but i'm sure that was the cloud and not the ufo itself but i can't be sure.  it was not dark though like my first two in a rainbow cloud, definitely lighter - possibly white or silver.  there were no flashing lights or stationary ones but it seemed a little reflective but not much.  there was no sound but it was very high up and far away.  it was still quite light outside and earlier in the day, about 4pm there had been a storm including real downpours of rain that didn't last long but were severe plus we did have thunder and not sure about lighting - not all areas of the city got the same effects from the storm.  i believe the first sighting of the ufo in the rainbow cloud happened after a storm as well and about the same time.\r\n\r\nat one point in the sighting two huge black billowy clouds seemed to appear out of nowhere as there were no other black clouds like that before when i first saw the rainbow cloud and they just seemed to engulf that whole area and blocked out the rainbow cloud and ufo altogether then just as fast the black cloud was gone and i am not sure if the ufo was still there or not.  in a few minutes though the rainbow cloud faded and all was gone.\r\n\r\nlike i said i knew to grab the binoculars to see this type of cloud as it had a ufo, well two actually, in it a year back and so of course i wondered if this one would be the same and sure enough there it was.\r\n\r\nthe first sighting, i believe i reported to mufon, was sort of scary because the two discs were large, very large, and flat and coming out of the rainbow cloud and looked threatening because of the color and size like motherships but the one yesterday was small and light colored and stationary and pretty actually due to the peachy color of the cloud covering it.\r\n\r\nnow the thing is that as i have told mufon many times before (i have had 6 or 7 sightings now - all different over the last 5 or 6 years)that all my sightings take place in the same area over quebec not far from gatineau.  this seems to be a real hotbed for ufo activity at least from what i have seen.  this is near a large river and they seem to stay fairly close but the sightings are over land, over quebec.\r\n\r\nchalk river isn't too far from ottawa where the sightings all took place plus i do believe there is a fault line through that area of quebec but you can check to be sure.  i really am starting to wonder if this area has a portal in it, just seems so strange so many sightings are in the same confined area of sky.\r\n\r\nfeel free to contact me by email if you have more questions.  thank you.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:27:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":75260,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.4244596,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03182016-0008","longitude":-75.69516309999999,"occurred":1458241200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1458303194000,"summary":"Unusual swirl rainbow cloud caught my eye around 7pm after earlier we had had a big downpour with thunder.  the rainbow colors stayed for almost an hour and in the middle of it i saw a disc shape hiding in the rainbow cloud.

(it was night time).\r\nat this point the river undercuts a wooded area on a steep slope. opposite, on the other bank where we were fishing, there is a small flat area, a field of marshy ground with type vegetation. (we were facing downstream and wateringbury was on our backs).\r\nthe summer night was balmy and still – not a breath of wind; you could hear the silence! a high, thin veil of cloud masked the lesser stars but the brighter ones shone through.  aircraft could easily be heard droning high overhead with their navigation lights discernible.  wisps of river mist hovered above the surface of the water – it was an idyllic night.\r\nat about 02.30, out the corner of my eye, i caught sight of a movement just above the tree tops on the opposite bank. it was a very bright, orange light (an orb) which drifted effortlessly across the sky.  i mean this was bright.  i strained to hear a noise, nothing! there had to be a noise for the light was at a low altitude and virtually overhead. there were no other lights associated with the orb. it stayed at a constant speed towards the village of wateringbury.  there it seemed to hover for a short period before changing direction, northwards before disappearing over the hills above wateringbury.\r\ni was drawn out of my seat and walked transfixed across the flat field, my eyes did not leave it. the light did not change in intensity as it passed by and went away from me towards wateringbury. it gave no sound. the back of my neck tingled, my hairs stood on end.  \r\ni stood motionless for a number of minutes hoping it might return. the sighting lasted about 30 seconds. my two companions saw the light but were too engrossed in their endeavours not to be disturbed.  \r\nthe night air was still and the silence even more intense.  my companions laughed when i said it must have been a ufo, but what else could it have been? on returning to my pitch by the river my mind was no longer on fishing but on what i had just witnessed.   \r\ni went through every conceivable possibility and crossed them off in my mind one by one – no way was it a conventional aircraft (of any size or shape), it was not a hot air balloon, not a shooting star, not any kind of star, not ball lightning, not marsh gas, not piezo-electricity, not a laser effect, not car headlight, not a bolide meteor, not falling space debris. \r\ntoday of course one of the main culprits for orange orb sightings is the ubiquitous chinese lantern – but it certainly wasn’t one of those – not in the 1970’s – they we’re not in use then. so what was it?\r\nalthough i was interested in the ufo phenomenon and was reading von daniken, i should have pursued matters but, alas, i did nothing. it was years later when i first witnessed early crop circles (pure circles not glyphs) i decided to submit the sighting to bufora but their reply left me cold!\r\nafter watching hangar1 i decided that i should offer the sighting up to mufon to enhance your records. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
