moving object across the sky. it was definitely not an aeroplane. it came from one direction and was moving across the sky into another direction. then we saw another one, and another and another. the stream of objects appeared every few minutes, and they were not side by side, instead more like they were following one another. some were far off in the distance, others came nearer to our apartment (on the 4th floor). it was very apparent they were all coming from the same destination and heading to the same destination. the objects themselves, were like glowing balls when seen in the distance. the movement was not sproadic, instead the objects moved across the sky, some did go a bit faster at times, but overall the objects moved quite steady. sometimes a couple of them appeared to come closer to one another. \r\ninterestingly, the same evening, it was a national fireworks night and so there were fireworks going off across the sky. please note, there was no way these moving objects were confused with fireworks, we have videos to demonstrate this, but it is interesting that such a lot of objects appeared the same night as when they could be partially camouflaged perhaps? as the evening progressed and the fireworks died down, so did the number of objects passing. at its most, we watched an object arrive and go every few minutes, it then slowed down to an object every 5-10 minutes (and then we went to bed). the objects did not suddenly disappear, instead they all continued to travel to a destination that we could not longer see from our apartment. one of the objects flew right above our apartment and the window and i saw it for a few seconds, it was like looking up at a bright, glowing circular object, about the size of a lorry. this close up allowed me to definitely see that this was a ufo. also when taking photos, we could see through the lens, a circles of lights like windows, but i could not see this with the naked eye, and the photos did not show this (cheap mobile camera phone, no professional camera). this is not the first time we have seen ufo's in this same area, it seems there is activity in this area. i took about 80 photos in total, and about 20 videos, i compiled some of the videos together and zoomed in and slowed down some of the video. on some of the photos, i zoomed in.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1

the image too. \r\nthis plane however seemed like a transparent image of a plane.  i could clearly see the outline of the wing span and the cabin. there seemed to be a bright light in the middle as if the sun was reflecting off of it.\r\n\r\n then from the outward of the image to the middle it started disappearing until the white light was the only thing left then vanished.  \r\nfairfield ca which is close by, has travis air force base and this would probably be a good flight plan for it. i immediately thought i saw a military ufo/ optical allusion/ cloud... about an hour later around the same spot i saw the same thing.  it seemed as if a plane was calibrating/testing a cloaking tech, or seeing how well they could scale up the tech as this un-explained image of a transparent plane was kind of big.  not like a fighter jet but more like a 747 or a supply plane of sort.\r\n\r\nafter i saw the image for the second time around the same area about an hour later, i saw other planes in the sky

appear between two power lines that ran behind our property. every night i'd see these same six or so stars in the same area again and again, week after week between tow of the wires. sometimes the group would appear a little lower or a little above these two wires that bracketed them but i always sat in the same place to observe them so i knew they were not normal stars, after all, stars do not move that much distance in just one night. i got the feeling that it wasn't just me watching these stars, but i felt that they were observing me also.  i finally decided to think \"i know you're watching me.\" so for several nights i would say the same thing in my head again. a few nights later i decided to say, \"you know i'm here watching, don't  you?\" the star on the far right glowed slightly brighter then it vanished. i watched the spot between the wires again and again over the next few nights but it was still gone, but the others remained, then the star reappeared in the same place once again. they were there for a few days more but then just vanished from the spot in the sky that they occupied for weeks. i never saw them again, until later that summer, when they were back one night only, i looked at them for a few minutes and then crawled into my tent for the night. a few moments passed and the yard lit up with an intensely bright yellow golden light . i lifted the edge of the tent to see the yard. the light was everywhere but no shadows were being cast. it seemed to flare up birghter if that was even possible, and just that quick, the light was gone. that was the first time i had seen something out of the ordinary like that but not the last.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":75204,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.634524899999995,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03142016-0023","longitude":-89.3974083,"occurred":233884800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1457995957000,"summary":"Was

blvd(99e) at about 4:30 pm on march 14th 2016, when i looked up i could see dark storm clouds moving in from the south and to the north it was nearly clear bright blue skies, i was watching the clouds looking for downpour clouds hoping that i would not get rained on on my walk home, i had noticed to the south east a plane flying out of the storm clouds and then i looked strait south and saw what i thought was a plane so far away that was just a tiny dot in the sky, as i watched it it seemed to slow down, hover and then go the opposite direction. i have of course seen this happen with planes making a u-turn or helicopters normal abilities to manouver. how ever as i watch it suddenly moved back into the opposite direction and continued to go back and forth and stopband hover several times, as i was watching this first object do this i noticed 3 or 4 more appear and do the same thing, at this point i was thinking maybe i was looking at birds flying in a circle but they seemed to far away to be birds and it seemed that they were sometimes reflecting sunlight becoming very bright like i have seen from airplanes in the past, after about a minute the 3 or 4 that appeared after i noticed the first one had suddenly disappeared, and then about 30 seconds to a minute later the first one i was watching from the begining moved at a slightly faster speed than i had seen so far, started to go strait west (the opposite direction that i first noticed it going) and the object slowly faded until it was gone (maybe retreating into the clouds). i watched the skys for about another 20 mins waiting to see if the objects would return, to see if i could get a better idea of what i was looking at. sadly the objects did not return and i had to return to my normal life activates. \r\n\r\ni thought about using my cellphone to record the event but i know that my resolution would not be high enough to catch these tiny dots in the sky so did not attempt to record by picture or video, i do

decided to stop off at a riverside park to wind down for the evening. perfect evening, the skies were crystal clear, nearly no wind and the temperatures were considered warm (50-60's) for mid-march. i could hear the hum of the industrial area around me, the sound of cars, birds and other life of the river. it was an ideal evening to just sit and relax.\r\nsitting on a bench on the banks of the river, a weird calm and quiet came over the area. all of the animals had silenced as if a switch was turned on. it grabbed my attention. the whole time, i happened to be stretched out on the bench looking up at the clear night sky looking for satellites, ufos and watching the bats gobble up insects, so my eyes were somewhat trained at looking for distant/rapid objects. \r\nat approximately 7:05pm i spotted a black almost translucent or cloaked pyramid object with four faint red/orange pods at each corner. at first i thought i had finally spotted a tr-3b craft but noted to myself this object had four pods on corners, not three with a large dome in the center. (note- since my last ufo spotting and submission to mufon, i have been very curious about ufo's and have been doing quite a bit of research on a serious hobby basis)\r\nback to the first craft...\r\nfirst craft seemed to be 5 sided, much like the indian vimana as described as a large flying pyramid. made absolutely no noise. size at altitude was estimated 300-400 feet wide side to side. was traveling at almost perfect south to north trajectory at an incredible steady speed. my estimates of altitude was probably between 5000-10000 feet. speed, estimate based on first sight of object at almost straight up to horizon was roughly four seconds. 3000+ mph at least. no sound, but obviously a solid object traveling very fast.\r\nobject seemed to be cloaked but was slightly visible with clear definition of structure, bottom was reflecting or absorbing the light pollution given off by the city. the night sky and the position of the setting sun left the sky a very slight blue tint. it was a perfect backdrop to see a black object as i was spotting bats swooping around the park.\r\nthe second and third objects were identical to each other. very large chevron or boomerang objects two minutes after the first one. these objects seem to be on a pursuit trajectory toward the last known position to the first one. nearly two minutes after i spotted the pyramid craft. i know this because after the first sighting i pulled my phone out to check time and make mental note of time and my location.\r\nfirst (second of three) craft appeared to be on a elliptical left hand turn towards the first object (from sw to east then north). the second chevron seemed to have come from the east-south east and going north north west to intercept or meet up with the first chevron craft. no sound at all.\r\ndescriptions match the 600 feet or larger boomerang/flying wing craft that can be found all over the internet. five red/orange pods or antigravity engines on the bottom of the two crafts. same translucent appearance, but these craft had definite crisp front leading edges. altitude was same as original craft 5000-10000 feet, but were traveling at a much greater speed. both seemed to be chasing, pursuing, or patrolling the area. definitely on course with the first one. it was impressive witnessing such large silent objects traveling at those speeds and making the rapid turns they performed. the red/orange glows on the objects were the defining tell to spot these craft. much like very, very, very dim led lights flickering.\r\nat first i doubted what i saw, then my logical mechanic/engineer mind kicked in and i just sat there and replayed the sighting in my mind. \r\nthis is not the first time i've seen ufos, lights or unexplainable large objects and i know it probably wont be the last. \r\nmost people don't fix or train their eyes and just zone out to the open sky. i liken seeing these objects as training your eyes to see those hidden 3-d pictures that were popular in the 90's. much like seeing past and into the dark.\r\nvery impressive display not seen every day. i would like to sit down with a mufon investigator and possibly get to the bottom of this most recent sighting.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

continued in a straight line overhead and off to my right (east). note: the night sky was partly cloudy (low patches of white)  to the west but in many places beautifully clear with stars visible. this was both to the west and overhead and to some extent eastward. further east, the clouds appeared both thicker and lower. the object coming out of the west was well below the few clouds that existed there and, overhead, it passed thru clear sky. as it continued eastward it actually disappeared in the lower elevation of the cloud cover. i keep saying \"it\"; however, i saw a total of four of these objects. they were identical in appearance, at the same elevation, of the same color and other characteristics and, mostly notably: made no sound whatsoever. i'm guessing here but i would put their elevation at about 1500-2000 feet. pure guess! wa h object would pass out of sight in the east for perhaps a 30 secs to 1min before the next one would come out of the west. it my pic is of the fourth one as i simply didn't think to take my phone with me when i went in the backyard and was so mesmerized that i didn't think to get until the fourth object was on its was. i managed to get 3 pics of that one object but already to my east! i was so dumbfounded when the next one came along that, having selected video on my phone, i forgot to hit the record button. there are a few characteristics about the objects i haven't been able to get into here because it would be too difficult to describe with the written word. once again, the pics are of the same object as it is already moving away from me. what i would really like to know is if this is a new military aircraft. the silence of the objects as the flew across the sky was very troubling!
