look like a et or reptilian but you can tell it is what who or what was currently playing on tv just distorted which was not the case at all this time which is why i really focused on it and it froze just like the pictures  will send but it d do didn't distort like usual with lines everywhere and being barely visible, this was earily clear, so here i will kind of describe the best i can and i will post the pics in order now i dont have a before pic as i knew not what was about to happen but  will explain what was on before the incident and i the first pic will be a photo of the whole screen and then pics with different angles (please notice in the bottom right of the pics, i have one zoome in pic of it there i is four heads, one looks eerily like me, then a reptilian type, then one im not sure and on the very bottom a humanoid baby and there really small especially to the main entity) and the last pic will be of what came on as soon as the \"transmission ended. -so i am watching digital channel 49.1 a buffalo channel and the show that was on finished and a news weather update came on and as the guy is pointingcamera staring directly into the camerea and i could hear him breathing and i was frozen in fear until i seen in the bottom right corner this weird looking baby head and i immediately picked up my cell phone and taking pics. i noticed the other beings after. the next day i slept all day i just couldn't keep my eyes open and haven't felt normal yet and starting getting axious ant continue to feel scared as i make this report and my tablet has been acting up, freezing and misspelling words which i never do but i feel it should be reported and i know its not what you guys normally deal with but don't know who else to report it too. thank youaway to his green screen the t flashed for a second and then as you see in the pic showed up and it seemed frozen and i thought it would pass but i started panic attacking and it felt like i was being watched so i look closer and it was impossible not to see because there is a creepy human looking guy kneeling down resting his elbow on something directly in front of thes mentioned before this is not the first time this has happened before but never was i able to get photos of the \"transmission\" and even though it was only 1 minute and 23 seconds (exact time give or take 1-2 seconds) it never lasted that long. also this is coming through my television and i use a digital tv antenna  that is all, no sattelite, cable, no wifi and i dont even have a landline telephone. the first thing that i noticed happens before this occurence is lots of static electricity and lots of it, then the tv signal will go out or become distorted (like it does somewhat regularly as it is a antenna and its nothing extraordinary) and  eventually i notice usu usually 1 or 2 \"beings\" that look \"reptilian\" but small sized and they seem to be comunicating to each other not facing the screen, and its only a few flashes of them maybe 4 secons each flash and maybe 45 seconds everything is gone static and all as well i never felt threatened, if anything i felt a overwhelming sense of comfort? now that happened 3 times before basically exactly same way, i should add though this was a different apartment and the last time it occurred was about 1 year ago. now this time the static never came but 5 minutes before i felt really uneasy for no particular reason i just figured it was the weather as it was fairly stormy and the t tv had been distorting a lot due to the weather a and honestly sometimes the digital picture will freeze and distort and sometimes make someone on the tv\r\nthis text was 3 different sections copyand pasted so they may not have bbeen in order, sorry.","distance":"20 Feet or

no wings and was flying quite high in the sky. the area that i am staying is where passenger planes flies and i am quite accustomed to the height of these planes are flying. the object i observed was

of a passenger plane). the object is flying very fast, the speed of an passenger plane. to recap, i am quite accustomed to passenger planes flying above my house. the object is square like but as it

report for school on constellations. as we (my son, my wife and i) stood on our darkened deck in front of our house and looked at the sky for the various constellations he needed to observe we noticed a light that i thought was a high flying jet at least that was what i told my son it was when he pointed it out to me. then we noticed a second light, similar to the first that appeared to be on a collision course. i explained to my son that they were at different altitudes and it was not a danger that they should converge in the sky. seconds later after making this explanation to my son it became clear that there was a third converging light and that they were all going to intersect, each forming a 120 degree angle with each other. i explained to my son that this was a much more rare occurrence but that it was no big deal they would all pass over or under the other and continue on. we all watched carefully, me more incredulous than the other two because i am a pilot and i had only seen two aircraft intersect like this before, never three. but what came next was even more impressive. the three came together and rather than continuing on they appeared to bounce off of each other and gain significantly in velocity.  i stood there with my mouth agape trying in vain to explain what i had just witnessed. then as we watched the lights move away from the convergence point they seemed to slow down as they grew nearer to the horizon, then slow to a stop and start moving back toward the convergence point again. this time they came together accelerating visibly and again they seemed to bounce off each other and reverse course right back to very near the horizon again, and to repeat the slowing down, stop and accelerate toward each other again. kind of like watching two dall sheep banging heads together. but this time the velocity was much faster perhaps taking only a second or two from the time of the stop to the time of the convergence. but this third time proved to be the last as when they converged they accelerated to past the horizon and well over the tops of the mountains to the north, southeast and southwest of anchorage. i only report this now as my son was doing a similar sky-watching and constellation observing session with his 12 year old daughter just a few days ago. i did not see this second and most recent ufl sighting. these lights in the sky must not have been objects as i understand it. there was no noise, no explosion, no obvious exhaust and no sonic booms. at the height these objects were flying they clearly were breaking the speed of sound, but no noise was heard at all. i wonder if anybody else in the anchorage area has ever seen such an incident. all i could tell my son and wife was darned if i know. i didn't actually say darned but you don't need my colorful language for this report. i wish i had been there for the second incident, i nearly always have my smartphone handy these days. sorry to say, i don't have anything to back up what i saw. just the honest observation of common citizens.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

so fast. so i turned my head to look at it and i was kind of shocked how slow the shooting star was going. then i noticed it was what i would describe as 3 somewhat fuzzy or hazy not real bright but very easy to see white lights in a triangle shape traveling in a straight line due east very very fast. it was about a 1/3 the speed of a shooting star. made no noise. i did not notice it until it was almost above me and it was at the horizon in probably less then 3 seconds. unbelievably fast but not so fast i couldn't get a good look at it and watch it. i really have no idea how high it was flying but i would have to guess maybe a mile. the feeling i had was i thought i couldn't believe what i just saw and i was very happy i got to see it. i want to see it again. instantly addicted. maybe the most awesome thing i ever seen. at the same time it is a bit scary. don't know what to think. i wish i had someone with me to witness it too. i seen something that awesome and no one cares not even my

my job warrants paying attention to details..Minute details. unfortunately, there was not a cloud in the sky and i say that for the lack of a reference. to compare for the size, the height ..For comparison reasons.This was seen in broad daylight ! not the cloak of darkness as one might think. above a major road in a major city!The lack of a slow gradual start was not there either, it moved in a fast-steady rate like a car sitting at a red traffic light and another car passing thru that red traffic light w/o stopping moving past the stopped car. objects inside this craft had to be pinned to the walls inside!!!

was. then i thought to myself \" i wonder if there are any other planes in the sky?\" so i started scanning out my window in the 100% clear and bright blue sky to see if i could find another one.\r\n\r\nthat's when i saw a small rectangular dark object 90* directly to the south of us; perpendicular to my passenger window. about 25-30* above the horizon. i estimate it was anywhere from 1/4 mile to 1 or 2 miles away from us. it appeared to be stationary. i was trying to figure out what it was because there were no wings like a plane, no visible engines, no shape that would suggest it held passengers, no rotors or a tail like a helicopter, no noise, and not even a definite shape. so i thought \"maybe it's a balloon? no it couldn't be, even helium balloons don't sit perfectly still.\"\r\n\r\nthen it slowly started moving west. i thought to myself \"oh, it's moving, maybe it somebody's radio control toy?\" then it started moving faster. i had to turn my head quickly to keep it in my field of vision over my right shoulder. \r\n\r\nthe object immediately went backwards without even turning or slowing down, and then it went forwards again. i couldn't believe what i saw. a couple seconds later it appeared to turn in a southerly direction, this time \"leaning into the curve\" like a plane would do. \r\n\r\nthat's when i got a clear view of the top of the object because the sun was reflecting off of it. it was saucer shaped! definitely made out of some type of metal.  [no windows, doors, hatches, or anything else, just smooth metal that i could see.]\r\n\r\nthe object made 1 or 2 more direction adjustments in 1/10th of a second, appeared to head west again (its original direction) at a high rate of speed. i blinked my eyes because my brain was still trying to figure out what i saw.  when i opened my eyes, it was gone.  \r\n\r\ni started scanning the sky again to see if it was still around but in a different position. i couldn't find the object, but i saw a helicopter which appeared to be traveling in a sw direction a few miles east of where i saw the object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

it was clear, warm august evening approximately 10 at night. there was still a little light on the horizon. i stepped outside on the deck for a cigarette and looked into the sky like i often do. i scanned the eastern horizon above the mountain's and watched an aircraft fly over the mountain traveling north. that's when i focused in on a star or what i thought was a star after the plane had passed it. i continued to watch the star as it seemed quit bright and it oddly flashed (pulsated). it was not long before i realized it was not a star at all but a moving object. i ran inside to grab my cell phone and went back out to record it. i have about a minute of it traveling across the sky. i took my eyes off the object for a moment to take a step down the stairs and when i looked back it was gone. i continued to search for it for several minutes without any luck. there was no other stars in the sky at that point. i have seen many satellite's in my life and can 100% say it was not a satellite or plane. it had no flashing beckon like planes do and it was traveling much to fast not to mention it was pulsating.\r\n i also have witnessed something else i think is interesting. i down loaded the google moon app not to long ago. i was searching the vas landscape when i came upon a crater that has what very much looks like a massive structure inside. it has all the characteristics of a building. with also a plume of smoke ascending from what looks like a chimney of a house. i took a close up screen shot of the structure and a screen shot from the regular view before zooming in. everyone i have shown the screen shot to sees exactly what i see without me telling them what i think it is. when i tell them it is a screen shot from google moon they are astonished. \r\n  i was not sure what to do with tis information and have wondered if anyone else has come across the structure. i have looked into the subject and found out there has been a lot of evidence about structures on the moon. so i decided to document my information with mufon. \r\n  the images of both the moon and video of the ufo are on my phone. i am using my computer to submit this. i personally think both the

4th, 2016. i would say that this occurence happened about 15-20 minutes south, possibly near wolcott, vt., in a heavily forrested area. (i'm pretty sure this was on route 15.) the sky was very dark and clear, a picture perfect evening to see the stars in great detail.  i felt compelled to look up to the sky, because of its immense clarity, knowing that vermont has probably, one of the cleanest skylines in the world, something that i don't particularly have, living 2 1/2 to 3 hrs east of this particular location.  i,coincidentally,happened to be thinking in my mind at that moment, \"wouldn't it be cool to see a ufo out here!\" and then, low & behold, something occured...\r\n\r\ni was in the passenger seat, and out to my right window, in the west, a slight degree above the faint outline of the tall mountains, i happened to observe approximately 5-10 white, orb-lights, flashing & \"dancing\" chaotically, in a pattern-less manner. even though they produced these motions, the lights mainly stayed in the west for the 15-20 minutes that i observed them.  they would descend & ascend a slight bit, with some variation of movement, but mainly stayed centralized, in that location.  after a few minutes, possibly 5 minutes or so, i would place my attention to something else & then look back & the lights would disappear, the pop back up again.\r\n\r\ni instinctively & intuitively knew that what i was witnessing, surely was no human-made satelites, as even those, as far as i've observed, don't travel in more than 1-2 at a time & usually have some type of recognizable pattern in their flashing and movement. also, they don't \"dance\", and usually stay on course in their path.  after these few minutes, i brought the lights to the attention of my boyfriend, but he could not witness them right away because he was driving.  \r\n\r\nat the beginning stages, i was pretty amazed by what i saw, but at the same time, i wasn't overly shocked,either. sometimes, i felt, \"matter of fact\" and \"non-challant\" about all of it.  i didn't feel threatened by this experience.  at times, i was thinking scientifically, becoming skeptical & trying to conjure up possible practical explanations in my mind.  however, as i did so, those thoughts dissipated, because there was no logical explanation for what i saw!  \r\n\r\napproximately 20 minutes from the first occurence, around the hardwick area, my boyfriend pulled off the side of the road, in an even more densely forrested area & finally saw, in the west, the \"dancing\" white orb-lights in the sky & was totally in agreeance with me, that these were no satellites, that this was something unexplainable occuring.  about another 5 minutes up the road, this time, ahead of us,i could see in the southwest direction, slightly above the horizon, but very low in the sky & it appeared to be close, three consecutive, ember like flashes-.....One.....Two.....Three....They each glowed intensely with reddish-orange, ember like flames for a second or so, one right after the other & then would fade, just as fast as they came.  i would best describe what i saw, in comparison to the ends of a cigarette, when the smoker inhales, the ends flame up & glow, and when they stop inhaling, the ends of the cigarrette fade.  at first, i thought that these glowing ember lights could possibly have been meteors fading out when hitting the atmosphere, but remembering the strange white lights in the sky earlier, just confirmed my ufo theory all the more!  \r\n\r\ni pointed out these ember lights to my boyfriend, and he had seen the same occurance.  at that point, my attention was taken to something else.  my boyfriend kept on watching ahead, observing what was going on.  he noticed, that the ember glowing lights were at each end of, what he described as a very large, long, cigar shaped object, that was dark, but he could make out some of its outline. this observation happened shortly before we approached the end of route 15, near route 2 in danville, vt. area.  this location was still heavily forrested. at that point, we were getting a little spooked out.\r\n\r\nwhat i also observed, was my psychological reaction.  in addition to what i had previously explained, i also felt that i was \"meant\" to see these crafts.  that, even though i have never seen a ufo, i was ready & receptive to experiencing a one-in-a-kind event.  i felt, that whoever & wherever these visitors were from, they came here on peaceful terms, to observe human life, but not to forthright interfere with us & that they meant no harm or threat in any manner.  i also sensed that humans are going to be sighting more spectacular sights like this in the near future-those who are receptive to these events, but also those who are not receptive at all-that their thoughts would be challenged, as well! no matter what these strange lights were, i will always be proud to have seen such phenomena that millions of people may never get to experience!","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":75165,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.561472800000004,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03132016-0001","longitude":-72.57062149999999,"occurred":1457119800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1457829009000,"summary":"5-7 white orb lights flashing chaotically accross sky  & 3 circular reddish-orange ember lights near cigar shaped craft.

contact with mufon. this due to the fact, that this report refers to a military operation !\r\nthere is also several details i have to leave out due to the military aspect. and i urge mufon to contact me a.S.A.P, as to clarify how to approach and deal with these potential top secret information's further.\r\n\r\nmy father was a norwegian navy seal special ops deep sea diver specialist from approx 1968, until he was headhunted for extreme deep sea diving during the settling of the oil fields in the north sea (between england and norway) approx 1974.\r\nall through my childhood i have been told stories about what they did during my father's navy seal years. \r\nas i got older (i am now 40 yrs) i started to get a feeling that there was things my father experienced that was far from the normal for any military ops. and i kept asking for any form of details of such for many years without finding anything abnormal or interesting. apart from insane deep diving experiments and such.\r\nas my father got older too, i think the time limit for keeping military details secret ran out (this is just my assumption). and suddenly one day approx 5 years ago, while relaxing in his garden he just told me flat out the one thing i never had expected to hear, as uso/ufo's was very far from my mind in regards to me poking in his military history. in my mind i expected to hear some cold war stories about russians and usa and such, as he did allot of ops in the northern region of the atlantic ocean. so what he told me this day blew my mind !\r\n\r\nin 1973 he was stationed at the navy base in the coastal town of bergen. and at the time he was occupied just doing normal training as they do most of the time, even though being special ops. when he suddenly gets called off from his units training routines, and was in all haste air lifted by helicopter off to one of the major fjords on the west coast of norway (details here is only for mufon).\r\nthere, in the middle of the fjord, several navy vessels was waiting, clustered as if searching for something. \r\nit must be said that these unique fjords go on for several hundred miles and are more than 3000 feet deep in places. so it immediately struck my father as an abnormal place for a mission. especially since the norwegian navy has a very good overlook on what goes in and out of these fjords. and ops and training was not normal in there as this is mostly cruise boat and tourist territory, and contains no known military installations.\r\non board of one of the navy ships, my father and another fellow deep sea diver he did not know, was put into oxygen/helium deep-divers equipment. a tell tale sign they were not just going surface diving, but that something more serious was under way. they were also given underwater military camera equipment. and here is where it all gets very mysterious !\r\ntheir instructions was to document and observe, then report and debrief. and as they are lowered down to a depth of approx 250-350 feet it becomes very obvious what they are there to document.\r\nthere are deep track grooves on the ocean floor. just like the tracks from some kind of belted device like a bulldozer or a tank or other similar belted vehicles. but these tracks are more than 30 feet wide, and that is just one of the tracks. there are two tracks running parallel, and both are more than 30 feet wide. and counting in there is a permanent wide gap between them (approx 30-50 feet), it looks like a gigantic caterpillar bulldozer-looking thing has crawled forward through the bottom of this fjord.\r\nmy father told me, it immediately struck him (this being 1973) as very chilling, as it dawned on him that there are no known machinery or vehicle remotely close to the size of these tracks, that can move about under water in this fashion (and to his knowledge there is still no such \"vehicle\" that has been made till this date). and being a navy seal for so long, i know he was extremely well trained in observing and identifying vessels of all sorts from an underwater perspective. as he had told me so many times about some of his missions, where they go out from the torpedo tubes on submarines, and they swim over to place bombs on enemy ships or to observe vessels and other underwater military installations and such. so i trust his observations 100% on this, as did obviously the military as well ! \r\nafter orientating themselves, they were told by surface command to film, take pictures and memorize all details of the gigantic caterpillar track as they were to follow it out through the fjord.\r\nand here it gets even weirder. as my father and the other diver documented this track they had to swim one over each their own track, having to use strong military grade flashlights just to be able to see the whole width of the track. and as he told me, \"it went on forever into the underwater horizon\" and the track was hugging the landscape. or in other words, it had moved intelligently ! this was no scraping or drag-mark grooves suggesting something huge like a platform being hauled (very often platforms are built in these fjords because of the extreme depth and calm waters, then towed off to open sea on completion). this \"object\" had \"rolled\" forwards as if someone driving a bulldozer through a varied and uneven landscape. leaving two massively steady deep tracks in its wake. with a total width of more than 100 feet.\r\nthey swam for a very long time documenting this absurd monster groove, when it all of a sudden just abruptly stopped. and this puzzled them very much. as it looked like the \"object\" had just been lifted straight off the sea floor. this after having documented the track being more than 3 kilometers long.\r\nthere was no trace of it further out the fjord, and they where immediately call back to the surface to debrief. and shortly after my father was airlifted off the group of ships and returned to the base without any explanation as to the origin of this track or the overall purpose of this mission. which all struck him as very un-normal considering his regular ops. and he never heard a single thing about this mission later either. and soon after he as head hunted for the offshore oil industry. and retired from his military career. \r\n\r\nit has later dawned on me that i think the sudden headhunting into the oil industry was a form of \"redirecting\" of attention away from this and maybe other missions he will not tell me about, as to get him away and silencing him with money and jobs that took all off his waking hours up until the early 1990's.\r\nbut in his own words he explained it as something completely foreign to our technological capability, both now and then. and on my suggestion of \"could this be uso/ufo related\" he concurred with me !!\r\n\r\nmy conclusion after having lived next to this man my entire life, is that he is one of the most credible witnesses i could ever have imagined. his military track sheet, the navy seals integrity, then later more than 20 years as an offshore deep sea diver specialist (also used as an expert witness in several court cases) and now in his retired years, as a 10th grade grand mason ritual master (10th being the highest possible elevation in the norwegian freemason system). i must say i do not doubt his words and recollections one single bit. and i would put my full confidence in this man, as did the norwegian government, military, major oil companies and freemasons. \r\nand it must also be said, that my father has never really shown any interest in the uso/ufo phenomena and theories out there. and i cannot recall one singe time in my entire life, that he has mentioned  such things apart from this one day in his garden !\r\n\r\ni ask for understanding as to some details being left for mufon only here. as i do not want any harm or repercussions to befall my dear old father.\r\nso please take this report very serious, as do i. and please help me getting this sorted out. as this goes a far bit over what i can investigate on my own. and maybe it can help a bit, as to revealing another piece of the ufo/uso/alien/government puzzle.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"10:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

elevation. about a year ago i was spending a week up in the mountains with my dogs. after watching tv at 10:00 pm i turned the tv off and went to bed. the bed room is on the top floor of a three story a frame. the bed is located under a bank of windows filling in the top of the a frame. my question is can a ufo shine a beam through a window and interfere with a sleeping person. i was awaken at 3:00 am i was in a setting position surrounded by a ultra white light the brightest light i have ever experienced. i had a felling that something was in the room with me. i put my arm in front of my eyes to shade my eyes from the light. it did not help i was inside this ultra white light and i was kind of blinded from the brightness. i could tell that the room was lit i think i said \" what going on \" at that moment the light just disappeared. i sat there in the dark for a couple of seconds then i turned on the light on the night stand next to the bed. my dogs did not wake up i did but i cannot explained why or what happened. i had a felling something was in the room but when i turned the light on there was nothing there. has your originations ever heard of anything like this happening to anyone else. anything you can do to help me understand this event would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nlarry wagner\r\n70 years
