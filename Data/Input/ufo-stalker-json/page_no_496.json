(20 miles). so lights in the sky has been has been a part of my life for nearly 45 years. \r\non 03/11/2016 i woke up at 0505 did my morning ritual, walked over to the sliding glass door, poked my head through the curtains, saw a light 1000 ft. above and behind mt. ogden (9505 elevation), azimuth 40 degrees n41e. i first thought it was a star but then it flashed and moved upward and then very slowly headed nw toward ogden. i had to put both hands up to the glass door and face to block out the surrounding light on the glass to get a clearer picture. randomly the light would flash 2-3 times a pure clean white light in comparison with a strobe light. then randomly a pure clean red flash located below and a little forward of the white flashing light would happen. again, the lights were completely independent from each other. i knew that with my 37 years around aircraft and usaf chief of safety for 10 years, this was not in the military inventory. \r\ni have always had all of my ufo investigation gear next to the sliding door just in case something like this would occur i would be totally prepared. unfortunately, i had been out of town the night before on a ufo investigation and had put all of my gear downstairs in the office. \r\nso i hurried to turn off the security alarm, went downstairs to grab my gear, headed back up to the balcony all along being away from the sighting approximately 60-90 seconds. fortunately, when i got back it was still there. i immediately threw a few shots of my green laser light at it with no response from the ufo. it is now over downtown ogden, basically a short distance from the original sighting. you could tell that it was just starting to lose its flashing brilliance now moving nwn. within 15 seconds it faded out to the north like a gray cloudy mist and was completely gone. that was the strangest part of this whole sighting  had this been a plane i would have seen it still flying at a much further distance with the lights flashing. the speed of the object during this whole sighting was that of a small plane. \r\nthere are many lessons learned here for me even though i've played this scenario out in my head 100's of times. take a deep breath or three, always have binoculars/monocular, green laser, night vision, camera/cell phone charged and nearby. but the big lesson i learned...Why didn't i just grab my phone 25 feet away. i may have had a chance to put it on film with something to show instead of just a witness report. if recording wouldn't have shown up then i at least gave it my best for visual evidence. just remember though, \" absence on evidence, isn't evidence on absence.\"\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path

into the driveway (i always back in). while i was collecting my things, i noticed two red lights headed in my direction from the south. this wasn't out of the ordinary as we live northwest of srq airport in sarasota so we see the lights of lanes on a regular basis. once i was getting out of my car, i couldn't help but notice that there was no sound. i could see the lights of other planes far to the southeast and that wouldn't surprise me to not hear them, but these lights were so close, i should have definitely heard them with ease so they had my attention. i kept watching as they got closer and still no sound. once they were almost overhead, the lights suddenly changed color from red to white. the air around them seemed to almost look like a heatwave and as it was directly overhead, i could made out the distinct shape of a triangle with one light just behind the lead tip of the triangle and the second in the dead center. i fumbled to try to get my phone for a picture, but by the time i got it out and chose the camera app, it was too far away. the entire sighting took about 2-3 minutes. it never changed speed. when it was overhead it seemed awfully close. almost low enough to hit with a rock, but it is hard to judge because of the way the air looked around it. once it was out of sight, i went inside and told my wife what i had just witnessed and she said that while i was in the driveway, our entire tv entertainment system had locked up and then reset itself as i was coming through the door. in full disclosure, i have always been interested in the ufo phenomenon, but in my almost 50 years have never seen anything that i couldn't come up with some explanation for. this was very close and very strange. if it were not for my wife's encouragement, i probably would not have reported it at all. thank you for your time.\r\nsincerely,\r\nbrian johnsen    ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

continued on to i-270 and pulled of at the east bound entrance. they continued to meander around in a flock like fashion. i tried to take a picture and video with my cell phone but they didn't turn out well at all. finally, i lost sight of them. it was difficult to gauge their size and again, they seemed to be about a mile and a half away and from 200 to 500 feet up. i just have never seen anything like them before in this area and it's hard to imagine a bunch of balloons just floating around in that manner. \r\nthe only other strange sighting i've had were orange lights in the sky over

over the top of the hill/mountain . (at first i thought it was 2 objects,i think now it was just 1 ,moving so fast it left a trail ,it made 2 arcs flying above the hill/mountain then diving down then back up i guess) it was a bright yellow object ,no flames/jets ,the object itself was glowing yellow,strangest yellow ..Kind of like a spark shooting up out of a fire,the spark is burning and leaving a trail as it shoots up .I had never seen anything like this, i went to my truck and got my phone and turned on the video to record,i grabbed my chair and was moving it away from the fire to try and sit and get some video if it flew out from behind the hills/mountains ,i wanted to be ready to catch it on video. as i was moving the chair and keeping an eye to the sky i saw a bright orange sphere,it was also to my west,more to the south of the 1st object,i held up the phone to get video of the orange sphere ,and may have gotten a second or 2 of it on video before it disappeared and but as soon as it disappeared a  strange white streak appeared and was gone in a second ,i couldn't tell if the white streak was the orange sphere moving incredibly fast or if it was something else .But as the white streak faded the 1st object came out from behind the hill/mountain heading south kind of towards where the orange sphere was ,the bright yellow object did not leave a trail this time ,it was solid yelow from what i could see with my eyes) it appeared to skip ,but after looking at the video a thousand times ,it was actually zig zagging ,but from my point of view it headed south past where the orange object was and then appeared to flash many times and fade from sight .(on video you can see an obect flying into or out of the bright yellow object ,but it's moving so fast i can't tell which way it's going ,i'm only able to catch it on 1 frame ) (after watching the video i was able to see that after it went south past where the orange sphere was then it actually went west  away from me fading out of sight . i kept the video going a few minutes after everything was out of sight in case something else appeared . after all of them were out of sight my knees actually buckled and i finally started to breathe again. i sat with my phone in hand in the chair watching the sky for maybe an hour before trying to sleep. \r\nwho.. or what were they ? what were they doing ?
