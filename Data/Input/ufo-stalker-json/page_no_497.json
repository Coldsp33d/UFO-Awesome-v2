weather broadcast this evening, they showed an awesome \"live shot of the moon\" for perhaps 10 seconds. their camera was good, and the thin crescent was dim enough that stars could be clearly seen in the background around the mostly dark moon. what caught my eye, and made me jump up and take a quick photo of my tv screen with my turbo 2 smartphone, was a \"star\" that was obviously either on the moon, or somewhere between the camera and the moon. the light was steady, just like the stars, and did not move. it appeared exactly like a very bright pinpoint of light on the surface of the moon would appear, and it was well away from the crescent, definitely away from any stray sunlight effects. i'll attach two photos. one is my original photo directly from my smartphone, for better analysis, although we really need the station's footage. the other is cropped so it's easier to see the light, which appeared at about the 1 o'clock position near the top edge of the moon, and definitely in from the edge of the moon a ways. i reported what i'd seen to the channel 7 news room and have not heard back from them yet. perhaps a station engineer can verify the camera's integrity, perhaps i can acquire a copy of their footage. i'm working on it. i also checked immediately online to see if any real-time live images of the moon are available, but to no avail so far. the time of the live image was 7:48 and 35 seconds mountain time. perhaps there are images available from one or more observatories at this same time that could support or help debunk this light. i know my \"sighting\" is not that great, but with some connections to better lunar imaging sources, this might prove to be a very good tlp (transient lunar phenomenon). also, i'd very much like to know, if anyone else saw it, how long it remained, when it first appeared, how it disappeared, and any other observational details.

very well have simply misidentified this, but am very visual (life long artist) and this was unusual.\r\n\r\ni think i saw ufo over cleveland. it was heading directly south and it was 10:21 pm on tuesday night i'll look at the calendar to figure out what day of the month it was. at first i saw it coming it was traveling slowly it was not that high up in the air and it was an unusual constellation of lights so a grab my iphone and i thought i should take a picture of that whatever it is and then it got closer and i got closer we were converging right over the interstate interstate 90. as it got closer and closer i thought it might be a group of helicopters. but they were in too tight of a cluster.  i saw a constellation of lights that were in than abstract sort of triangular form. as the craft got closer, i kept looking up and i saw that there was a slightly lighter color to the body than the dark sky. there were  lights on all three corners and in between the corners with a dazzling white very very white bright bright light. on the bottom there was a flashing red light ` at least one maybe they were alternating from different positions on the bottom. the craft was traveling very slowly. it was probably 4 to 6 telephone poles off the ground` not regular telephone poles but the kind of tall ones that are along the interstate. if this craft was indeed triangular, it appeared to be traveling backwards away from the point. there was an aspect of this triangular pattern that was a little bit hard to comprehend. the lights seemed to be pointing toward me, not so much at me but so bright that it looked like they were pointed at me, although it was not pointed at me at all. that's how dazzling the lights were. as the craft approach the highway before it crossed over me i thought it could be a structure a linear structure like i-beams or something that have lights along it and it was not a flat triangle. it appeared to be have a flat aspect but the front seem to be folded a little making it like two long skinny triangles but only in the front. i did not feel any unusual feelings outside of disbelief. i racked my mind trying to figure out what it could be other than a craft. it was not that high off the ground. as an artist my life profession is about looking and seeing. i'm very articulate and i'm able to describe things well. i worked as a carpenter for 30 years and i have a pretty good sense of dimension. i would guess this craft was between 40 and 60 feet long. of course perspective could have thrown all of this off. of course everything about this could be incorrect. but if it was what it appeared to be, i saw something quite remarkable and would like to know if anybody else saw the same damn thing.\r\n\r\nit was west of exit 169 on interstate 90\r\n\r\nthat was what i dictated (with only punctuation changes). i am most curious if there were other reports of this thing. it had to have been seen by many others because it was so low and moved so slowly and was over a very very populated area (edge of cleveland.)\r\n\r\n\r\nand lastly, and strangely enough, i have been struggling to photograph my drawings and for some reason they will not photograph. i have never had a problem with taking photos on my phone. very strange. (and i am not even suggested that they are related at all)\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

relative to the sun. lasts years however was when there were clouds and you can clearly see it above the clouds and then drop in as it appeared in multiple photos. it also appears to be generating a field just in front of it (in last years photo)as it passed through the clouds before diapering into the clouds. \r\n\r\non both occasions i thought it was pretty awesome to see and to be the only

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The day of the event, i had been working on an art history article developing a new interpretation of poussin's \"the arcadian shepherds.\" during the afternoon, i made a major breakthrough that appears to have \"solved\" the riddle of the painting's significance, which is, i should remind you, on the same level as the great pyramids and stonehenge. at around 7:30, i went downstairs to update my blog, which malfunctioned as i was trying to save the draft. i then decided to take my dog for a walk. i was listening to \"jam\" by michael jackson. \r\n\r\nas we were leaving the driveway, she pulled very hard at the leash, forcing me to go right. i found this odd, as she has gone left every time before; we have a route that we typically follow. \r\n\r\nwe eventually reached the brattleboro common, where i observed the first vessel hovering above the brattleboro retreat. it was a consistent, integrated structure, similar in appearance to a cluster of red grapes, composed of lights of varying sizes, flickering in a chaotic rhythm, an asynstactic pattern emerging out of chaos loop. the pattern of lights implied the existence of a larger form concealed by a kind of tesseract, disguised as a high-altitude jet liner in a way that was not entirely convincing; the illusionistic effect appeared to be intentional, as if was intended to convey an aesthetic effect. the vessel hovered silently over the retreat before vanishing over the west river. \r\n\r\nas i was fumbling with my iphone, another vessel appeared, much higher in altitude and made up of two egg-shaped golden lights surrounded by a triangular pattern of blinking lights. i made out the faint outline of a cigar shape behind these lights, but it appeared to be truncated in the middle.   \r\n\r\ni then turned to my right, facing south. the sky was covered in a kind of hyperdimensional manifold made up of a polychromatic fingerprint. i saw a red orb dancing upwards like an ember. as i followed its trajectory with my eye, i noticed what appeared to be an emanation of white light, dancing inside of time-space. the visual effects seemed to be responsive to my gaze. the craft(s) appeared in some way to be an optical illusion, a demonstration of a cloaking mechanism. i was astonished beyond words by these two vessels, the sight of which moved me to tears. \r\n\r\ni then exited the park and proceeded to walk around my neighborhood, where i saw three more vessels: a steady, pulsating red orb, an irregular assemblage similar to the first vessel, and a curved red and green cluster of lights similar in shape to a caterpillar. during this phase of the encounter i experienced a profound shift in consciousness, a communication with a feminine intelligence who conveyed a profoundly sad, and to a certain extent unspeakable, message, related to nicolas poussin's painting \"a dance to the music of time,\" the house of dionysus at paphos, and pyramus and thisbe, whose tragic \"double death\" occurred in the shadow of the mulberry tree. further research on my part has uncovered what appears to be a temporal anomaly, although i won't go into details here.   \r\n\r\nthe next morning, i woke up to find a photo of the first vessel (or rather, it's absence) on my phone. the image appears on its face to be a typical nighttime image, but the digital noise has an apparent structure. i cannot reproduce the image from any angle, and the arrangement of lights does not appear to be consistent. it appears to be inspired by malevich's \"black square,\" and is similar to another image that appeared on my phone under similar mysterious circumstances after a sighting in june in berkeley of a triangular craft. i believe this be a xenoaesthetic text.  \r\n\r\nthe next day, i returned to the site of the encounter. i walked past a dumpster next to the mulberry tree early childhood center. a piece of red plastic caught my eye, surrounded by a bunch of puzzle pieces, each of them differently colored and apparently conceived as art objects. i picked them up, put them in my pocket, and walked home.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While lying on a blanket under the stars in a location less than two miles west of the centerline of what was then carswell afb, i noticed an object approaching from the south just above the treetops.  the object was triangular in shape and that shape was defined by the three lights...One located at each angle of the triangle.  what caught my attention were three things... the lights were in no configuration of any of the conventional aircraft i was accustomed to seeing fly into and out of the afb...The object made no noise at all...Its size was enormous.  additionally, the flight path was going to take it directly over me.  it was moving slowly, much more slowly than any conventional aircraft could fly if on final approach for a landing at the afb.  i estimate it could have been traveling no more than 30 mph.  as it approached i was trying to see details.  i could discern nothing beyond the general shape confirmed by the stars that were masked behind the object's triangular shape and the unusual pattern the lights were flashing.  each light was round and each of the three flashed one of three colors...Red, blue or white.  the lights weren't brilliant, but somewhat diffuse as if they were contained in some kind of domed housing with a frosted lens similar to an incandescent light bulb one would use in their house.  the lights flashed randomly with the only actual pattern being that no two lights were ever the same color and there was no discernible sequence to the colors the lights flashed.  when i use the word flash it was not an instantaneous change, but a short term fade from one color to another.  i had never seen lighting change color or flash on conventional aircraft in a similar manner.\r\n\r\ni has seen strange lights and \"green flashes\" in and around the afb all my life, but this phenomenon was completely different from anything i had seen before.  i was excited while i waited for the object to pass directly overhead. it passed slowly over my head with the complete passage of the craft from the forward \"point\" (the object never wavered or rotated,but kept the same angle of its shape pointed due north as near as i could tell without consulting a compass) to the base taking about 2 seconds. i tried to get a feeling for its altitude, but there was no helpful frame of reference except the treetops.  i mentally established 500 feet, but that was arbitrary.  there was absolutely no noise.  even the night insects and creatures that i'd heard prior to the passage of the object made no sounds.  there was no feeling of static electricity or electromagnetic interference present when the object flew over me or at any other time.\r\n\r\neven though i was with others during the encounter, i did not alert anyone else on the off chance they might interfere with my complete attention while observing the object.  i also didn't mention the observation to anyone else that night.  having read the reports of previous years' sightings i thought i would wait until i saw the papers the next day to see if anyone else reported any unusual sightings.  the next day sightings were reported throughout the southwest.  i never wrote anything down until now and only wanted to insure mufon had this information to use in its work.  thank you for permitting me to finally report my observations.","distance":"101-500
