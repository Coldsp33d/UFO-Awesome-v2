(we were all young & yobbish at the time)\r\n\r\nwe watched as this thing slowly crept out the bushes towards us. it was crouching over slightly, it was a silvery, shimmering colour, but it also appeared to be glowing. it had extremely long, gangly, arms which it used to move the bushes to get out, it wasn't touching the bushes as they moved though. as it got out of the bushes, it fully stood up & was at least 8 foot tall & it's arms stretched down to where a persons knees would be, really long arms. couldn't really distinguish any facial features as it was dark & i was hypnotized by those extremely long arms.\r\n\r\nthere was only one thing going through my head as i watched this thing for a minute or two, run! my fight or flight instincts properly kicked in & i totally feared for my life. being a young yob though, my decision was always based on what my mates would do... i turned to them but they weren't there, they had already ran off. i took another look at this thing & it was a step or two closer, less than 15 feet away from me. i never ran so fast in my life. i didn't look back through fear of how fast the thing could move, i just didn't want to be the last person in the group. i have never been so scared in my life. none of us stopped running for a while, we ran all the way down the lichfield road & all the way to new cross hospital. we needed to be around people, to feel safe.\r\n\r\nwe went back the next day as i'd lost my phone & keys as i ran off. we investigated the area in the bushes where we saw it, the bushes had a metallic type of smell & they all looked 'off'.\r\n\r\ni have never been back to that park/ field since.","distance":"20 Feet or

drink a beer before going to one of the final high school parties preceeding our   senior graduation. we parked right beside the lighted water tower at the given location.\r\nonly a few moments after parking, still seated in the car, we both noticed a white light on the sw horizon; it was moving at what seemed to be impossible speeds over great distances, and was making direction changes that defied understanding. this display was happening in the skies above whiteman airforce base and sedalia, mo.\r\nalthough i could not i identify the object, my instincts told me it was something i had never seen before nor had understanding of.\r\nthe object continued with it's aerial show for a couple of minutes and then began to close on our location. the white light seemed to bound forward for a distance (getting closer) and would then go stationary as if hovering ; over a period of about a minute, it appeared larger and larger before us. eventually, a very large object with 4 prominent lights appeared in the farm field directly in front of us. approximately 150-200 feet above the ground, it was drifting very slowly/silently toward our location beside the water tower. it came to a stationary hover over and exactly centered above the water tower and us (still in the vehicle). i observed single large white lights on the 3 corners and one apparently larger white light in the center.\r\nall the while this event was unfolding, the car engine was shut off, the exterior lights were off and interior dome light was on illuminating us from inside. as the object came to it's hover above us and the water tower, i slid my upper torso out of the fully rolled down passenger door window and looked up in utter amazement. i was viewing a nearly totally silent triangular object, hundreds of feet in length on all sides suspended above me. it blocked out the night sky; and for me, had a detectable audible hum. i quickly looked over at my friend to register his response to the phenomena. as my head turned, i saw his hand reaching up to to turn off the dome light inside the car. at the very instant the car's dome light was switched off, a barely visible reddish beam of light was projected form the object down onto us. i felt the nearly invisible light against him skin as if feeling pressure in the air or static electricity. dust particles inside the vehicle seemed to rise up and suspend in the air before me. this light was only shown on us for a few seconds and went out. i then placed my torso back outside the passenger side window of the vehicle and looked back up at the object. it began drifting slowly toward the nw for about 10 seconds, after which it instantly disappeared from sight in a streak white of light.\r\noddly, i never felt fear during this incident; instead, i was filled with a sense of wonder and amazement. i intuativly felt i was seeing something that represented military tech which we the people did not yet know of. \r\nmy friend and i both agreed that mentioning this event could bare undesirable consequences for our futures and we agreed never to mention the incident. only after many years had gone by did we speak of this again.\r\n i joined the us military only days after this incident and eventually served in 2 branches, followed by a police career in a major west coast city. i later served in international missions for various organizations as a peacekeeping advisor.\r\nat 56, it is strange to me that i am experiencing an awakening of sorts at this time; but i know we are being lied to; i also sense it it's time to divulge the truth.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

no earthly aircraft could move as slowly without falling out of the sky. it was not a dirigible or “weather balloon”. it was nothing mike could identify – and this intrigued him. it made no sound.\r\n\r\ni grabbed the binoculars and looked at it. this time i could see a distinct shape. it was like an ice-cream cone pointing upward. the flat part of the cone was facing the earth. on the back of the cone, near the bottom flat part, was what looked like a small hull or house or hut of some kind. it was about a fifth of the size of the cone itself. out of this structure came a very faint blue light. the object passed directly over our heads at about 15 mph. that’s how slow it was going.\r\n\r\nwhen it passed over us, it banked clockwise and came to a standstill over the adjacent field on the other side of the road. it simply stopped. it did not fall. it did not quiver. it sat there motionless, about 100 feet off the ground. it was about 60 feet tall and the flat part was about 30 feet wide. it had a pewter-like ability to reflect ambient light, dully. there were other small lights on the craft, but it looked like someone had thrown a wadded-up ball of very dim christmas lights onto it, and it stuck. in other words, there was no pattern (as we would know it) to the placement of the lights on the craft. they were red, blue, and white. some were fainter than others. perhaps 20 in all.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, a light shone down from the craft like a spotlight, about 8 feet wide, very much like a spotlight on a stage. it shone the light onto a copse of trees in which an old barn was hidden. the light passed frenetically over the ruin for a few seconds; then it slipped onto the ground, traveling in an arc. i quickly calculated that it was going to “hit” us if it kept moving in the same arc. i was excited and scared. as the light came closer to where we were standing, a car came over the distant hill, from the direction we had come, and as soon as its headlights came into view, every light on the craft went out except the faint blue light in the hut.\r\n\r\nafter the car passed, the object began to move very slowly away from the road (and us), crossing the field and going toward the forest at the other end of the field. there was no way to follow it. \r\n\r\nas it went into the distance, a red light came on that shone dully on the tops of the trees. it sank lower to where it almost touched the tree tops. then we noticed four or five other red lights hovering over the treetops in the direction from which the first object had come, but all moving slowly toward the first one, some slower than others, as if following it. some were farther away, but all flew low to the treetops. all of them seemed to “know” each other, like a herd of cows going back to the barn. they seemed unconcerned and in no great hurry.\r\n\r\ni went home and called the local air force base (seymour-johnson) and told an officer my story. before i got too far, he put me on hold, then another man came on, and i could tell i was on a speaker phone. they did not ridicule or laugh at or make me feel stupid. they said whatever it was was too low for their radar to pick up, and there was no military exercise or game going on in that area. i had no idea whether they spoke the truth or not. i never heard back from them, although i gave them my contact information. i think they recorded my call.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":75080,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.61107430000001,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03102016-0003","longitude":-77.5023088,"occurred":552009600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1457570554000,"summary":"Sighting near farmville, nc in 1987","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":36,"maxtempi":96,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":82,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":36,"maxtempi":96,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":82,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10481,"locationName":"Farmville, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:84364"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Buffalo","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I work at buffalo niagara international airport. i was leaving work at approximately 0528 est when i glanced up to look at the sky and i saw 5 to 6 lights pass slowly overhead moving in an odd non-patterned configuration moving from ne to sw. at first i thought it was just a jet taking off, but there was no sound and there were no beacon lights flashing. i lost sight of the lights as they passed over the sw edge of the airport. the sighting lasted approximately 15 to 20 seconds. i have been working at buf for over 13 years, and i have never seen anything like this before. i am a u.S.A.F. veteran, and still am a current federal employee. i have held a top secret sci/tk clearance in the af and still hold a secret clearance with dhs/tsa. i had a previous second sighting of an anomalous object, but that occurred back in the 80's.

Tobago","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live in england but this incident happened about two years ago on the island of trinidad in the caribbean. the incident happened after a movie night out with two friends. after the movies as we walked out the cinema exit door i turned to my right to see if a bakery was still opened. as i turned my head i saw a huge glowing red ball flying across the sky above the bakery and other buildings on the compound. it looked as though it was descending and appeared to have descended into the fields behind the compound. however my view was obscured by the buildings as the object decended. it was moving horizontal to the ground below it but an easterly direction so definately flying and not just falling from the sky, and it seemed to be lowering itself as though landing at the same time. i did shout and i pointed toward the sky to alert my two friends but it was moving so fast that only one of my two friends managed to see it. it was a bright round glowing red ball of light and the color red seemed more hazy around the edges of the ball. there seemed to be an aura around it.There was no beams of light, no smoke, and no noise. it was just a huge red ball entity of glowing light.  growing up i have always loved looking at the sky and i know what a shooting and falling star looks like but this was definety unlike anything i have ever seen in my life. my first feeling was one of excitement, amazement and wonder. i wish i had the opportunity to see and observe it for longer and it has been on mind ever since. i want to know what it is i saw that evening. my friend and i spoke about it for weeks and weeks after. he saw exactly what i saw and we both speculated if it was a ''soucouyant''. the word comes from a local folklore in trinidad and is named after glowing balls of red flying orbs which the locals have believed in and have experienced for decades. i have heard stories of this growing up but never believed in it and always laughed when i heard it. i like to be logical and i always say that ''seeing is believing''. but i am still in awe about what i saw that evening so now i don't know what to believe anymore!  i am also happy my friend also saw it at that time so i could talk to someone about it who would believe me. i am a science lover and i was watching tv and saw one of mufons tv show one day and it dawned on me that what i saw and have been keeping inside me could have indeed be something perhaps out of this world?! who knows? i was also happy to know that i could be able to contact and share my experience with someone else who would like to listen. on another note i also have something my doctors refer to as ''night terrors'. in these ''night terrors'' i am always provoked or totured by dark strange human shaped shadows. when these experiences happens i also get sleep paralysis. i have had these sleep experiences even before i saw the glowing red ball of light. it has eased up quite a lot now but and i am unsure if both the ''night terrors'' and the sighting of the red glowing object are related in anyway at all? the sighting of the red glowing ball felt so different, so strange and out of this world that i found it necessary and worth sharing. this is my story.","distance":"21-100

8:25pm. walking out to the car to head for home, my husband, first spotted it, along with my 14 yr old son.  they called to us, a friend and her husband and myself, from where they were standing, into the house to where we were. you could see it glowing in the night sky, there were no stars visible at that time. the sky was partially cloudy, very dark. and there was the fireball moving in the slow deliberate pattern.  but only one.  we watched for more and tried to make certain that yes it was really true. there was something out in the sky at a fairly close distance to us.  it seems to me that they are right over peterson's butte, which is a few miles away. i took 2 pictures, normally my camera does not pick up star lights the night sky.  my friend took a video of what we were seeing and what we could not see with our naked eye.  as i stated in wonder during her recording.  we realized after a few minutes that at some point she had lost the object and focused on another light source. \r\n\r\n after we went back inside, i looked at my pictures to see if i had gotten anything, i enlarged it and oh.My.Goodness. i had.  i had gotten two clearly non star lights. the lower one being the tower lights as we confirmed the next evening. and the higher light being what appears to be a space ship. it looks exactly like the typical sightings of the ufo “space ships”. a saucer. the lights are clearly different from all the other light patterns of the man made lights and the stars. these lights are to perfect in conformity to not be created by a being. whether it be a human or what, this is created by a being.  the next evening we tried to recreate the pictures i had taken when i first got outside to see it, at 8.27 pm.  at 8:30 pm on 2-25-16 we took pictures of the night sky again, there were no stars in the same area but i did take some shots of the radio tower that is on the butte.  that tower is in the pictures from the night before. that should help determine the distance of where it was in our sky view.   i did take several pictures of stars in the sky.  the distance of the glowing ufo and the stars are incredibly different. the stars can be barely seen on a clear night sky.\r\nwe were in excited awe of what we had just seen. we tried to \"debunk\" our sighting. we can't. we actually saw a ufo \r\ni tried to get a report of the weather on that night, the data is from salem, or not lebanon, so it is slightly different.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

school student taking an astronomy class. we had to find the planet venus for an assignment and take a picture of it. my house has a lot of tree cover, and venus was low this time of year, so i went to this location to see if i could see further on the horizon with little enough light pollution to still see venus. when i reached the location, i got out of my car and, being able to still see stars and see the horizon much clearer, confirmed this was a good spot to find venus. after this, i took a minute to admire the stars, particularly the constellation orion. then, out of the corner of my eye, i noticed a dark object shaped like a chevron moving through the sky. i first thought it was a flock of geese or other birds, but this didn't seem like a flock of birds. one reason i came to believe this was not a flock of birds was because of how fast this object was moving. with its apparent size compared to a flock of birds, birds that distance away would not appear to be moving as fast as this object. another reason was its silhouette appeared fully shaded, and not with slightly lighter patches where the space between birds would have been. thirdly, the way the object changed direction was too sharp for any birds i've ever seen. lastly, it was too symmetrical to be birds in formation. because of these four attributes of the object, i believe what i saw was not a flock of birds. in addition, this object was completely silent and had no lights on it. \r\n\r\nas previously stated, it flew quietly and quickly through the sky, turning somewhat sharply. eventually, i was distracted by something else and lost sight of the object, with it simply blending into the night. \r\n\r\nwhile i was watching the object, i want even sure what i was seeing was real. after seeing it, it took me a minute or two to process what i had seen. the feeling is extremely hard to describe, probably best being described as a mix of disbelief, awe, and fear mixed together. after i had lost sight of it, i quickly got back into my car and drove home.
