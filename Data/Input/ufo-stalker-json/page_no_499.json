light appeared out of nowhere and began to descend toward the tree-line that was north of me. i had no idea of what the object was, i simply was in fear because i had never seen anything quite like it. it psychologically scrambled me because of the scary nature that it had. i watched it as it softly floated to the ground and went into the woods to the north of me, it didn't crash, it seemed that it was able to actually quickly find a way to drop directly into the woods without incident. it impressively and quickly hovered/dropped into the woods. \r\n\r\ni've seen one other unexplained incident of this before, except the light was red, this time it put more fear into me due to the fact that the shed motion sensor lights were triggered and the object was too far away to trigger it, and there was nothing around to set it off. immediately after it was triggered the lights sputtered out on it and went dark, almost as if electromagnetic interference had an effect on the lights. i lost sight of it for good as i waited for around 3 minutes to see if anything bright emerged from the woods. the object masked its light as it fell into the tree-line. as i type this right now i will have a fire arm alongside of me as i sleep, something feels off in the area right now. i plan to further investigate the area in the morning, if i find anything and i am contacted i will be sure to give more detail of my findings. this was arguably the most disturbing thing i've ever seen, the electromagnetic interference and the triggering of the lights from nearly 500-700 feet away was abnormal enough. tomorrow i will check also to see if the lights were fried, because the odd and eerie way that they shut off in a \"sputtering\" nature was abnormal. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

two hawks flying from nellis afb moving our direction and headed southeast. as the objects got closer i saw a white light reflecting off the objects.  i assumed it was a reflection from the sun, but it could have been something else.  at that moment i ruled out it being hawks.  the objects were about 10,000 to 12,000 feet high.  the highest object was a dark-shaped ball.  another object was flying approximately 200-500 feet below the top object and appeared to be trailing slightly behind the top object.  it was black and appeared to be wing shaped like a hawk would look, but wider, thicker wings.  they appeared to be moving in unison as if they were \"working\" together.  of note, the wind was blowing opposite of the direction of where they were flying.  we could tell that by the direction the flags were waving in the air.  in fact, the objects appeared to be gliding or hovering.  the sky was partly cloudy but as usual there is usually a \"open hole\" with no clouds in our area so we got a good look.  both objects stayed together and floated out of sight as they appeared to be headed towards the direction of henderson, nv.\r\n\r\ni have seen black helicopters flying the same general direction.  this may or may not have any relation to the event.\r\n\r\nthis is my third sighting in the same area of similar objects.  my first two sightings were not placed in the mufon database.  in feb 2014, i saw a black box hovering as a black lady asked me about a black helicopter showing up in the location just minutes prior.  it hovered about 15,000 feet directly under a commercial flight path and floated out in the direction of henderson, nv.\r\n\r\napproximately one month ago the same friend and i observed a double facited diamond-shape black object that was rotating.  as it rotated the sun appeared to reflect off it.  it moved in the direction of henderson.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

went and grabbed a cheap kodak camera. well my cheap kodak camera took some cheap kodak video. i took 2 different short videos 15 seconds long. \r\n    while looking west i saw one object with 4 or 5 lights changing color, brightness, and blinking. skies were clear and object was heading straight at us guessing under 5000'. when it got at about 45 degrees it disappeared, or just went dark. nothing was seen in or around it for the ten minutes i was there waiting to make sure a plane didn't turn around or go through a cloud i didn't see. i don't know what it was but it didn't look like plane lights which we see every day. \r\n    its not a good video and the only thing i can say is it looked weird and then when it was closest it went dark and was gone. as for it looking like airplane lights i've never seen airplane lights change color and i'm pretty sure you cant just turn your lights off ever. i know on video this looks like plane lights. all i can say is i don't believe it was. honestly was hoping to give this video to someone who can look at the light spectrum analysis to see if this is a known light source out of curiosity. \r\nand i did go buy a better camera\r\n

outside in my back yard at 10:15 pm cst, on saturday march 5, 2016. to my southeast i saw a moving bright red light that was flying level at about 3,000-ft altitude and at about 1-mile horizontal distance from me. it was flying northeast, from my right to my left, along a path roughly estimated to follow garland road from casa linda plaza to whiterock marketplace shopping center, where it then turned northward toward lochwood park (google map). \r\n\r\nat first, i thought it was a small airplane in straight level flight without much variation. its speed was about 200-mph, too fast to be a helicopter. i looked for any other lights, specifically white strobes and green navigation lights, but it only had a steady intense red. since it is illegal to fly below 10,000-feet without white lights, i quickly inferred that it was not an airplane or other human construct. no craft silhouette was visible because of the steady bright red light. then, i purposely listened intently for an airplane sound, but there was only dead silence. the craft then swung around from my southeast to my northeast, apparently making a 45-degree left turn, and headed northwest, keeping 1-mile distance from me. when it was to my northeast, i lost sight of it because of trees. i watched it travel about 1.6-miles total distance and my sighting lasted about 30-seconds. \r\n\r\ni am 76-years of age, take walks every night, and have vast experience viewing aircraft in the night sky. i have witnessed several other anomalous objects over dallas within the past three years, but none before 2013. my conclusion is that this particular craft was a machine that is not man-made, because – 1. the lighting was illegal, 2. there was no sound at all, 3. the large scale ruled out an rc drone, 4. the speed indicated a powerful craft, 5. the time was late for small airplane operations, 6. the flight path was illogical. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Hill","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On december 6, 2011 i saw and reported a ufo to mufon that i observed in the effingham county, ga. area. \r\ntonight, i observed what appeared to be the exact same ufo, in bryan county, ga. \r\n\r\nat  2353 hours, i was outside in my front yard talking to a friend on the telephone. at approximately, 0000 hours, i observed two stationary reddish white lights hovering approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. from where i was standing, they would have been east of my position, in the vicinity of the ogecchee river, probably roughly 2 miles east of highway 17, and 3 miles southwest of king's ferry boat ramp. just best guess estimate, they would have been in the marsh area, and not near the ogeechee river, south of georgetown, but not as far east as the little ogeechee river. the two lights hovered from aproximately, a minute and initially i assume it was two helicopters. \r\n\r\nabrubtly, the two lights, turned into five reddish white lights, all in a straight line, with the first two i saw being the in middle, two new lights to the left of them, and one to the right. these five lights stayed lit approximately, 20-30 seconds, and they were exactly the same type of sighting i observed in december of 2011. the sighting in 2011 was approiximately 30 miles north of were i was tonight. after about 20-30 seconds, the lights went out completely. after approximately another 20-30 seconds, all five lights reappeared. \r\n\r\nupon reappearing, the lights were still in a straight line, however they appeared to be at a 20 degree upward angle, as if the lights were ascending upward towards the southeast. i got the impression that these lights were ascending upward with linear mometum, and that there was velocity behind a mass in which the lights were all attached too. however, upon reflection, the lights hovered at a 20 degree angle and there was no movement that would have led me to believe they were indeed ascending. \r\n\r\nat that time, i quickly got of the phone so i could try to record the lights with my cellphone camera. as, i pulled up the camera on my cellphone, all five lights disappeared. i filmed the area of the sky for a minute hoping i could capture the lights reappearing, however after one minute i stopped recording. \r\n\r\nafter i was unable to record the lights, i tried to call the friend who was with me that saw the lights back in 2011. i knew she was working and moreover, would be working in the area of hwy 204 and hwy 17, so she might have been able to look and see if she could see them. \r\n\r\nafter about two to three rings without her picking up the phone, the five lights reappeared, however this time they were back in a straighline and were east of the last place in the sky i saw them. if i was holding a ruler out at arms length, the lights were now approximately a foot east of the last place in the sky i saw them. the lights were again, completely horizontal, just as i had first seen them. \r\n\r\nagain, i got the impression the lights were moving eastwardly with a mometum, however in reality i never observed any movement. they appeared stationary. it may have been because of the differing locatoin from the last observation that gave me the impression that the lights were moving. however, i am ultimately unsure why i had the definite impression that the lights were moving and not technically stationary as they appeared. \r\n\r\nupon seeing the lights again, i immediately hung up the phone and again attempted to film them with my cellphone. again, as soon as i was able to get the camera up on my phone all five lights disappeared. \r\n\r\nafter the last disappearence, the lights never reappeared again. i stayed outside for approximatley 30-40 minutes, without any remarkable being seen, except for some high flying airplanes, that are very common in my area. \r\n\r\nit was a clear night, and visibility was about as good as it gets being this close to savannah. the sky was clear enough that i could easily see jupiter, which was almost direcetly overhead of me at the time, and mars, had not yet come into view to the east of me (in the area of the sighting). additionally, i never heard any noise from any other aircraft during the time prior, during or after the sighting. \r\n\r\nthe flight path from fort stewart to hunter army airfield is probably 100 yards east of me, so i am very accustomed to seeing and hearing military helicopters frequently. the last military helicopter i heard the night of the sighting was approximately, 2200-2230 hours. typically, if there is training or if flights are going on post, i will hear many more helicopters through out the night. \r\n\r\nthe lights did not look like any flares that i have ever seen being fired from a airplane or helicopter. i don't see how any flares could maintain a perfect horizontal line after being fired,  and i never saw any falling motion from the lights as if they had been ejected from an aircraft. addtionally, i never saw any upward motion as if they were fired from a vessel or from the ground. \r\n\r\nthe only plausible way, i could see that these could have been flares, if they were ejected from an extremely fast moving jet, flying low over the marsh. however, if my estimate of them being two miles out was correct, that would mean that based on my position and the horizon the lights would have been approximatley 2667 feet off the ground. i cannot imagine an aircraft traveling 450 knots, 2700 feet off the ground, and only 2 miles from me and me be unable to hear any noise what-so-ever. additionally, with the second set of five lights at an angle, that would be an aircraft would have to have passed right over top of another aircraft traveling the the opposite direction, at a high-rate of speed, at night, less than 3000 feet off the ground. or descending to 3000 feet right behind another aircraft at 450 knots. not to mention, this would mean another after craft traveling less than 3000 feet would have to be right behind those two aircrafts, traveling east for me to have seen the five lights a third time. basically, three or more aircraft dogfighting, in the marshes, in between richmond hill and savannah, below 3000 feet, making absolutely no sound. suddenly, this seems even less plausable. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path

experience of our lives from about 2am to 6.30am.  the evening began at about 11.30pm (tues evening) with a beautiful clear sky, we were star spotting, naming constellations etc and generally enjoying a beautiful quiet night.  then at around 1am (wed) we noticed that the sky had completely clouded over and there was no stars visible in the sky and we were surprised by the difference in such a short time.  then around 2am the action began, i first noticed a stationary single bright light in the sky (it was extremely bright, which is why i noticed it) to the north west of us, which for about 2-3 seconds i was trying to establish what it was, when i then pointed it out to my friend, who saw it straight away and we initially thought it was a star.  almost immediately after my friend saw the light, it began moving in a north east direction across the sky relatively slowly.  we then started rationalizing that the light was a plane, it appeared to disappear which we assumed was it going behind the clouds. it then reappeared a second or so later still moving in a north east direction, we were just in the process of discussing that it has to be a plane, when the light abruptly made a 90 degree directional change to the north east in the sky.  then 2 -3 seconds later the light disappeared again.  when the light appeared again, it had moved slightly in the sky, more west than when it originally disappeared. then for the next 4 – 5 hours we witnessed this light pulsating from bright to dim, always appearing in different spots in the sky and it was always in a general north direction in the sky, with it finally being right above us before it completely disappeared. during this time we witnessed the light split into two, move east and west and then come back together.  we also saw the light move quickly in a southerly direction in the sky and then abruptly change again to a northerly direction, like a fishing hook shape. during the night we also witnessed 2 additional lights that appeared to have the same strange characteristics one to the west of us and one to the south.  we were able to determine that the light in the south was constantly appearing in a slightly different location as we were witnessing it through the tops of trees.  the crazy thing to us was when we were witnessing the original light pulsating in and out , i 'out-loud' asked if it could get brighter, at which point it got the brightest we had so far witnessed.  it was almost so bright that it was blinding to the naked eye.  i proceeded to ask the same question over the next hour and when i did, it appeared to respond and get brighter.  while i was doing this i remembered that i had my digital camera with me (for fish pictures) and i proceeded to try to get a photo of it.  i zoomed in to maximum and was trying to get a picture which was difficult due to the light constantly pulsating in and out  and reappearing in a slightly different location.  at 3.05am i took 2 photos, the first one was blank and then the second one showed two dim orbs and one very bright light (triangular in shape) which was strange i we could only see one light in the sky with the naked eye when i took the picture. you do have to zoom into the picture to see properly.  then at 3.08am i took a series of 5 pictures, the first four show the light at different stages of pulsating with the final picture completely blank.  the first photo at 3.08am is the clearest picture of all, if you zoom in, the anomaly looks to me like darth vader's tie fighter with a couple of swirls of light coming off the wings and also appears to have blue/green color aspect near the wings (only appears when zoomed in).   i think i took all these pictures within about 20 to 30 seconds, but it was absolutely within a minute as recorded by the camera.  please remember when viewing the pictures there was thick cloud cover and this was the only light in the sky at the time.  \r\n\r\njust as dawn was breaking my friend spotted a clear metallic cylinder/cigar shaped object with a light running along its center to our south.  when it appeared he tried to point it out to me and when i looked up, i couldn't see it as it was moving, he then again tried to point it out and by the time i tried to look, it had disappeared or gone behind clouds.  even though i didn't witness this object, i did witness my friend's reaction to it and i know it was genuine.  he exclaimed that he thought it was a plane, but it had no wings. also during our light anomaly experience we did feel that it was possible that we lost some time, maybe 30 – 60 minutes, but we certainly don't know for sure, as it was only our perception. \r\n\r\nby early morning, when we saw and heard  two planes in the sky we realized, that these were the first planes we had seen or heard all night since 6.30pm tuesday evening (we had a red biplane fly over us).  we thought this was strange, because when i have fished at the same spot in the evening, there are normally numerous planes that can be seen and heard.  it may have been the thick cloud cover, as i said it just seemed strange. \r\n\r\n\r\nmy friend and i feel we are very open minded, straight down the line kind of guys.  we tried to attempt to come up with a logical explanation, such as a plane, star, atmospheric/weather phenomena etc, which to us, nothing would fit. the experience left us completely blown away!  we especially felt mentally drained from viewing this phenomenon, we did fish all night and left the lake at 11am the next morning.  i could not then sleep till about 2pm that day and then slept for 24 hours, which i have never done before.
