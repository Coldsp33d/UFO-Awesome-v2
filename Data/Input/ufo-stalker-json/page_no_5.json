crew had spent the day gutting it; tossing everything into a large construction dumpster. \r\nwe had planned that when i got home from work at about 6:30, we were gonna go see what was in there. we walked around to the back talking about the history of the building. i was admiring the architecture of the building and we arrived at the dumpster. there was only one ladder leading up the side of the dumpster and my neighbor jumped on it. i complained and he said that i get to be the lookout.\r\nso i'm examining the building's original entrance, which was on the second floor when i noticed security cameras up in the eaves. \r\njust then a bird caught my eye. it was in mid turn, with its wings at a 45 degree angle against the horizon. strange that it wasn't righting itself like a bird would. i quickly calculated its distance at a quarter mile out and 350 feet up and realized that it would have to be a very large bird. \r\njust then it popped into a more compact shape and i yelled ufo! i yelled to my neighbor to get down here and check this out. as he started down the ladder i thought about running across the street and grabbing my new sony camera, but then realized that as fast as it was going that it would overtake me by the time i reached my front yard. \r\nso i thought oh well, i'll just use my cellphone's camera and i reached for it on my belt when my neighbor arrived to stand next to me and we watched. before i could pull it off my belt i had four distinct thoughts: this is all commonplace. there is nothing extraordinary happening here. everyone believes in ufos. soon this will be happening all the time. \r\nthen it was on top of us. about 30 feet above. i could see clearly the bottom of the craft. there were pipes running this way and that way. it was all a dull gray color and completely unaerodynamic as it flew. it was taller than it was wide and wider than it was long. picture a giant gray cigarette pack flying (very well) with the cigarettes perpendicular to the horizon. it was about 60 feet tall, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet long. there were no windows. it was completely silent. it left zero wake. as fast as it was coming at us and as close as it flew over us and as much air that it should have been pushing, we should have been knocked down, but nothing, not even a breeze. \r\nwe both turned around to watch it gain altitude and clear my house. when it had, something popped out of the lower right of the ship, like a rudder, which caused it to abruptly turn left. the opposite of how you would expect for a rudder to function. \r\nand then it was gone. i said wow, to my neighbor, that was amazing. can you believe it? i started reviewing the facts with him and he says that he wishes to someday see a ufo like what i have seen. what?!? dude, we have both just experienced one of the coolest daytime sightings ever. he said no, that was a helicopter. the kind with two rotors. so i ask him didn't he see how the thing was flying. if that was a chinook helicopter it would have had to be flying with it's nose almost on the ground and with its rotors facing forward, which would be impossible. he says he couldn't be sure as he didn't have his glasses on. i reminded him that it was only 30 feet away and completely silent too. he says well, you know they have these special rotor blades now. so i explained to him the difference between noise-dampened and silent. \r\ni went home confused. the next day at work i'm telling everyone \"yeah, so i saw one of them ufos again last night. blah blah blah. i still thought everyone believed in ufos. it took me a little over two days to realize that those were not my thoughts when i opened up a huffington post and read that only five % of the population believe in them. \r\ni've spent a lot of time analyzing what had happened only to just come up with the questions about it, no answers, only guesses. \r\nit was still daylight. why didn't they wait until dark? \r\ndidn't anybody else see it? \r\ndid it appear as a chinook to everyone else? \r\nit was already turning towards me when i had first seen it. what was its purpose for flying so low right above me? \r\nit being so blatant, why did it not want its picture taken?\r\nthis was not the first time i had been singled out by a ufo. the first time was on the other side of the continent, separated by many years, entailed multiple visits spanning several months, contained contact, and missing time of two hours, but completely different ships. \r\nconnected or coincidence?","distance":"21-100

visit by an on marked black hawk helicopter that when it past my house did a u-turn very quickly and hovered for fifteen seconds or so  and then went and they different heading it was coming from meaning they were tracking my cell phone  having been in the army i snapped to attention and saluted the pilot  all the windows but the pilots were blacked out .  i knew that i was observing an extra terrestrial craft when i saw the 2 ufo’s and there was no sound at all.  i had a 4d cell  mag light and a magnet in my hand and i signaled the large disk of lights which was only less than 200 yards away from me with a sequence of 3×3  it was then that i observed colored small spheres of like moving rapidly past me first being single and then three spears on top of each other rotating end over end  i believe they were knowledge ing my sequence of three . i have a very high iq i know what i saw and what it was and i believe they may be using dark energy and how he focused rotating magnetic fields to affect the dark energy to generate a negative energy field","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My neighbor and i were across the street in the parking lot of the old abandoned mansion / hospital. a work crew had spent the day gutting it; tossing everything into a large construction dumpster. \r\nwe had planned that when i got home from work at about 6:30, we were gonna go see what was in there. we walked around to the back talking about the history of the building. i was admiring the architecture of the building and we arrived at the dumpster. there was only one ladder leading up the side of the dumpster and my neighbor jumped on it. i complained and he said that i get to be the lookout.\r\nso i'm examining the building's original entrance, which was on the second floor when i noticed security cameras up in the eaves. \r\njust then a bird caught my eye. it was in mid turn, with its wings at a 45 degree angle against the horizon. strange that it wasn't righting itself like a bird would. i quickly calculated its distance at a quarter mile out and 350 feet up and realized that it would have to be a very large bird. \r\njust then it popped into a more compact shape and i yelled ufo! i yelled to my neighbor to get down here and check this out. as he started down the ladder i thought about running across the street and grabbing my new sony camera, but then realized that as fast as it was going that it would overtake me by the time i reached my front yard. \r\nso i thought oh well, i'll just use my cellphone's camera and i reached for it on my belt when my neighbor arrived to stand next to me and we watched. before i could pull it off my belt i had four distinct thoughts: this is all commonplace. there is nothing extraordinary happening here. everyone believes in ufos. soon this will be happening all the time. \r\nthen it was on top of us. about 30 feet above. i could see clearly the bottom of the craft. there were pipes running this way and that way. it was all a dull gray color and completely unaerodynamic as it flew. it was taller than it was wide and wider than it was long. picture a giant gray cigarette pack flying (very well) with the cigarettes perpendicular to the horizon. it was about 60 feet tall, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet long. there were no windows. it was completely silent. it left zero wake. as fast as it was coming at us and as close as it flew over us and as much air that it should have been pushing, we should have been knocked down, but nothing, not even a breeze. \r\nwe both turned around to watch it gain altitude and clear my house. when it had, something popped out of the lower right of the ship, like a rudder, which caused it to abruptly turn left. the opposite of how you would expect for a rudder to function. \r\nand then it was gone. i said wow, to my neighbor, that was amazing. can you believe it? i started reviewing the facts with him and he says that he wishes to someday see a ufo like what i have seen. what?!? dude, we have both just experienced one of the coolest daytime sightings ever. he said no, that was a helicopter. the kind with two rotors. so i ask him didn't he see how the thing was flying. if that was a chinook helicopter it would have had to be flying with it's nose almost on the ground and with its rotors facing forward, which would be impossible. he says he couldn't be sure as he didn't have his glasses on. i reminded him that it was only 30 feet away and completely silent too. he says well, you know they have these special rotor blades now. so i explained to him the difference between noise-dampened and silent. \r\ni went home confused. the next day at work i'm telling everyone \"yeah, so i saw one of them ufos again last night. blah blah blah. i still thought everyone believed in ufos. it took me a little over two days to realize that those were not my thoughts when i opened up a huffington post and read that only five % of the population believe in them. \r\ni've spent a lot of time analyzing what had happened only to just come up with the questions about it, no answers, only guesses. \r\nit was still daylight. why didn't they wait until dark? \r\ndidn't anybody else see it? \r\ndid it appear as a chinook to everyone else? \r\nit was already turning towards me when i had first seen it. what was its purpose for flying so low right above me? \r\nit being so blatant, why did it not want its picture taken?\r\nthis was not the first time i had been singled out by a ufo. the first time was on the other side of the continent, separated by many years, entailed multiple visits spanning several months, contained contact, and missing time of two hours, but completely different ships. \r\nconnected or coincidence?","distance":"21-100

sitting at a window seat in the exit row - row 13 seat a,  i could not visually see anything unusual while i filmed it from my iphone 8. i was facing forward and just tilted the camera to film the take off from the little airplane window...I did not view through the phone at anytime.  later when i reviewed this takeoff event, i noticed the orb like object following in front of the left wing about two feet forward. it appeared to be stable in relation to the wing throughout the turning of the plane onto the runway, acceleration of the plane and take off. also this object did not seem to move as i panned to the wingtip and forward a few times.  there are other obvious flashes of \"sun arcs, flashes\" but this one did not seem to act the same. also there are obvious reflections from the window pane that remained constant. it then all of a sudden disappeared.  i cannot understand what it is and have tried to research for an explanation but have not seen anything to care it to.  i still do not know what made me film this,  i have only filmed once before and that was a flight from lima peru up over the mountains... the landscape from above was spectacular. i was thinking of the safety of this flight, for some odd reason,  the fact that my entire family was on this flight and if it should not go well, the whole family would be gone..  kind of was thinking ... praying ... to my deceased parents to watch for our safety... those were my thoughts.  i felt comfortable once we were stabilized at the right altitude.   i then looked back at the film i just made and that's when i saw the \"orb\" following /guiding the wing/plane.    i cannot stop thinking about it.  it is a positive feeling but also aware that this may just be one of those camera mishaps??  i would appreciate an honest review to ease my mind on the subject.  i am not sure of the direction of takeoff exactly but i also sent a picture of the runway from google images i found.","distance":"20 Feet or
