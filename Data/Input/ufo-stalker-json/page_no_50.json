event, in retrospect). i am 17yrs, they are 3 & 5 yrs younger. one sister abruptly stopped playing and appeared startled looking to back of garden, my other sister then stopped and looked round to see and was also startled, i was ignoring them. they said they had seen a very large luminous disc floating behind a mature at bottom of garden, about 100ft away, before suddenly disappearing. i regretted ignoring them, they were scared and knew nothing about ufos while i had been a believer since 12yrs. i then went to look and noticed an exceptionally clear moonless night, which i usually would have been interested in. in a few minutes we started to see what appeared to be a major meteorite shower, with, in my experience, unique meteorite trajectories, including straight down and straight across the sky parallel to horizon. i arranged us in position to see 1/3rd each of the sky. i had a long standing interest in celestial objects as well as always keeping a look out for a ufo, but did not see anything before this night. there were red lights that would move slowly across sky and stop before disappearing, one that pulsed and one that seemed to zoom up closer to us before receding (as far as i can remember now). there were several other strange lights while the shower continued, dozens were seen by us. suddenly a very large object went over our heads, blotting out a large part of the sky, it was greyish/silver, shaped like an triangular arrowhead, completely silent. it left a trail of rainbow-like light behind. as it went over my sisters uttered a strange guttural scream and sprinted into the house, they would not come back out. i had opposite reaction; i was elated and stayed in position to see it fly into distance but blink-out before going beyond my ability to track it. i stayed out to continue watching and seen other strange lights, the most exceptional being a group of luminous objects, shaped quite like something organic, with a front head-like portion and wing-like portions, that flew in a formation, maybe 5-9 objects. i also saw something that looked like a star exploding. when there was a protracted inactivity i went indoors. it was a strange night because my parents were still awake and sitting up in bed with my sisters talking. \r\n\r\nthere was something which confused me, to this day, which was when i checked the time that it seemed impossibly early. i would like to know about this if someone could help, i have heard of time loss phenomenon but not time gain (if that is what i was experiencing)?","distance":"101-500

land navigation exercise on a hillside on fort ord federal lands, and to the south below us was the road going east over to salinas, and across the canyon was an adjacent mountainside that was at that time, i think, civilian public lands.  it was between 7 or 8 pm when, without warning, a huge, brightly lit aerial craft took off from the adjacent deserted mountainside, and startled everyone in my platoon who were witnessing the event. the distance across the canyon to the craft taking off was at least one mile, but whatever was taking place was clear and obvious and visible to everyone who was looking over in that direction. everyone seeing this event commented at the time that whatever this event was, it was extraordinary and unexplainable.  at the time, the adjacent mountainside had been dark but when the aircraft took off, it was accompanied with a great deal of light and there was some kind of loud roaring noise. the aircraft, which was brightly lit and had no identifiable shape, headed out in a straight path over the monterey peninsula and went out over monterey bay and then the distant ocean.  it seemed to change direction a couple of times as if it were piloted, and it eventually disappeared out over the water some distance from the land, but it took a long time, and there were some other aircraft lights at the time in proximity to the craft we were watching.  everyone in the platoon stood for at least 10 to 15 minutes watching this event and we all agreed we had all witnessed, as stated before, something unexplainable.  i can say with some certainty that this aircraft seemed to be piloted, as opposed to being some kind of missile, and it took off from public lands and not the army base, so it does not seem likely this was any type of military aircraft. i am reporting this now, some 50 years later, with the idea that this event might be archived with any other unexplained events in the fort ord and monterey bay area during that time.  my army training unit was 1st platoon, hhc, 2nd bn, 2nd bde, advanced infantry training, fort ord, california, march to may 1966.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

west and there in the sky were three flashing red lights on this massive silent wing shaped craft. it flipped over like a pan cake and kept moving slowly. i was with my folks and we all saw it with our jaws on the floor. we all tried to get a picture but none of them turned out. just grainy black photos which totally sucks!!!!\r\n\r\nthe red flashing lights definitely did not look like normal lights you would see on any aircraft. they had a strange hue to them. very pin point accuracy. the stunner was watching it tilt on its side and then roll over to the other side while it silently drifted to the south west direction. someone else had to have seen this thing. you can’t miss it on a night like tonight when there are very few clouds and could clearly see the stars as well as other planes.\r\n\r\n we all thought the lights were very very strange. no sound, huge and triangle wing shaped. not that high up in the sky. flew over the homes that back up to a golf course. it was on the golf course side of the homes.\r\n\r\ntime: 7:43pm est.\r\nlocation: port st lucy, fl\r\n\r\nhope someone else saw it too.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
