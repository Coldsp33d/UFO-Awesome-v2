de repente realizó un giro y se dirigió hacia donde estaba yo (hacia el sur), pasó cerca de mí a una altura no mayor de 10 mts.Y se inclinó hacia mí (que fue cuando vi las sombras en las ventanas), no hacia ruido, no hubo apagón de luz, no emitia humo, pasó y se dirigió al estadio azteca (que se veía desde mi posición), se detuvo enmedio de él, emitió un rayo de luz blanco (ahora lo veo como un laser) que salía por la parte de abajo del ovni, le dió la vuelta alumbrandolo y al llegar nuevamente al centro del estadio que estaba vacio, lo apagó y en cuestión de 1 o 2 segundos máximos, aceleró

was facing west and saw a bright red cloud explosion in the sky. it caught my attention because it seemingly was happening out of nowhere as the rest of the sky was dark in that area. i almost thought it was a firework but i saw a red cloud that got bigger and something seemed like it ejected from the cloud, which changed directions leaving a trail of yellow/green/white light and fell straight down into the horizon/ocean. the entire event probably lasted around 10 seconds. \r\nat first i thought it was a ufo but than i realized that the event took place right above coronado naval base. i thought it could be a possible missile launch test. however after watching the videos of the mysterious lights spotted above los angeles, in early november 2015, which supposedly was a \"missile launch test\" - i am now unsure. the lights that i saw last night were much different in color, flight path and the time of the event was much shorter. perhaps this was a different type of missile? \r\nthe event

saw the event take place. we noticed that there was a car dealership in the distance about 1/2 mile up the road with a giant spot light revolving on the roof of the establishment. while exiting the interstate we noticed that the spot light had come across something in the sky and at that very moment the object lit up as if it was on fire and descended straight down at a blistering speed. at first i thought it was a shooting star or fireworks but realized it couldn't be so due to the shear size, and trajectory of the object. i wasn't really scared the moment i recognized it but i was very intrigued, and sort of in shock. the object must have traveled 1000 within 2-3 seconds.. which is ridiculously fast in my book. the object disappeared about 100 ft above the ground never to be seen again that night.

rounded a curve approaching the next exit 220.  as soon as i rounded the curve i noticed 4 or 5 lights in an arc formation in the sky north of me.  these looked like stars, but they were not.  i've never seen a constellation like this and they were lower than stars.  they vaguely reminded me of thiose \"flares\" famously observed in california years back. i also saw a couple of planes at different altitudes, which is not at all unusual.  the arc of lights hovered in the same formation while i drove and watched.  i wanted to exit on the 220b ramp, but i also wanted to continue watching.  i chose to continue driving and just watch a couple of minutes longer and exit at the ellenton exit and turn around there.  i was excited and puzzled and a little apprehensive about witnessing this. i could only see them when i was on the overpasses, as the road dipped down to groud level i lost sight of them because they would dip below the tree line.  the best view i had of them was while i drove over the manatee river bridge.  the first few moments i noticed them, i thought they might have been fluctuating from brightness to darker, but i cannot be sure because i was trying to focus on them and there were streetlights obstructing my view of them.  for the moments i could see them, they seemed pretty still.  when i turned around and started driving south bound on the interstate, i tried to catch glimpses of them in my rierview.  they were still there.  i exited at 220 and went to my destination to meet someone who i begged to go back with me for a quick drive to see if the lights were still there, and then he could see them too.  it probably took 10 minutes to get in the car and drive back to where i could see them, but they were gone.  i was amazed and

important le lendemain ã  montrã©al, il avait plu et un ã©pais brouillard s'ã©tait installã©, je conduisais lentement et prudemment, ce soir lã , je n'ai rencontrã© personne d'autre sur mon chemin, la visibilitã© sur la route ã©tait trã¨s mauvaise, arrivã© prã¨s du chemin mahon, ã  sa sortie nord, dans la municipalitã© de low ( outaouais, quã©bec ) ,je vis au loin,  au-dessus de la forãªt une lumiã¨re intense, j'ai pensã©  sur le moment qu'il y avait un gros accident qui s'ã©tait produit sur la route, je continuais mon chemin en me rapprochant de l'endroit oã¹ j'avais aperã§u l'intense lumiã¨re derriã¨re une petite montagne, juste de l'autre cã´tã© de la  courbe, en tournant, quel ne fut pas ma surprise de voir des lumiã¨res qui tournoyaient par sã©quences au-dessus de la route, ces lumiã¨res ã©taient de forme rectangulaire et ã©taient de couleur rouge, jaune ,blanche, mais de couleur mat et non vive !.C'ã©tait trã¨s bizarre, je me suis rangã© tout prã¨s de la glissiã¨re de sã©curitã©, mis mon clignotant, mais sans arrãªter mon vã©hicule, ã  cet endroit de la route, le chemin ã  3 voies de largeur et les lumiã¨res ã©taient au-dessus de mon vã©hicule, il y avait tout ce brouillard, mais tout autour, tout ã©tait ã©clairã© et c'ã©tait incroyable, le temps semblait s'ãªtre arrãªtã©!, c'ã©tait un moment irrã©elle !\r\n\r\nj'ai pu observã© le phã©nomã¨ne pendant environ 10 minutes, a un certain moment le brouillard s'est dissipã© quelque peu et j'ai pu observer la structure en-dessous des lumiã¨res, c'ã©tait en forme  d'assiette, de plus  il y avait un cylindre de couleur grisã¢tre qui touchait le sol a partir du centre du vaisseau qui avait une circonfã©rence  de +/- 150 pieds, j'ai eu un moment d'inquiã©tude et je dã©cida de repartir, je traversa le village de low, et de l'autre cã´te ,je regarda pour une derniã¨re fois cette lumiã¨re au loin, je ne rencontra qu'une automobile quelque kilomã¨tres plus loin,  j'ai parlã© de cette aventure, si on peu l'appeler ainsi a quelques personnes !. encore aujourd'hui, lorsque je passe ã  cet endroit, les images sont bien prã©cises dans ma tãªte, comme si c'ã©tait hier ! .Plusieurs questions resterons

along my bedroom wall next to a large modern window with the blinds pulled up, as i turned on my ps4 i looked outside to see 3 bright objects in the sky hovering beside each other in a strange formation. at first i thought i was looking at airplanes/helicopters with their headlights turned on but their was no movement, after a few seconds maybe 6-9 seconds one ufo at the very top started blinking randomly, few seconds later the middle ufo dissapered and reappeared in the same exact spot it was in, i called my mom over who was in the kitchen to show her and she did not know what it could be... after a few more seconds 2 ufo's started blinking but very slowly and stopped, the 3rd ufo is slightly hard to see in the video the 3rd ufo is almost like transparent slightly visible, so i pulled out my ipad air 2 and started recording. 3 seconds into the recording and the ufo's started disappearing one by one. after the ufo's disappeared into the clouds (which is what it looked like) i looked into the sky all around me inside my bedroom window to notice anything unusual and everything looked normal like always. i went back to review the video and noticed a 4th ufo along the right side above the tall middle tree, that 4th ufo must have appeared and disappeared at the same time the last ufo on the left side disappeared. i did not see the 4th ufo when i was recording the other 3 ufo's on the left side disappear on my ipad screen. i have no idea how high and how far away the ufo's were, possibly hovering 2-5k feet high... the ufo's looked very large. i did not hear any strange noises or any aircraft engines, cars were driving on the road so perhaps that is why. the color of the ufo's was a yellow/orange almost like car lights. i have footage of the event and i uploaded it
