something unusual so she called for her husband (witness b) to come look. witness b, a certified pilot, thought to pull up the flight weather icing report off the noaa website because he and his wife both saw 4 red lights, while the radar only showed a snow front moving through. the airport reported ceilings at 7000 ft. with winds at 120 degrees and 9 knots. both witnesses saw what seemed to be 4 objects moving with the wind then ascending into the clouds, slowly. witness b is confident they weren't airplanes as no airplane would be flying that slow and entering known heavy icing, especially at the direction they were moving. they were traveling from se to nw, which is not in the pattern for this particular airport. they appeared to move from se of the airport to directly over the airport or perhaps just this side of the runway nearest the group of buildings before disappearing.  whether the lights just turned off or they ascended into the clouds and were no longer visible neither witness can say for certain. but there's no doubt they weren't airplanes,because they wouldn't be traveling in a group like that and deliberately flying into icing when they could have stayed below 7000 ft. for just a short time to remain below the clouds until they were past the front. nor would an airplane ever turn off their navigation lights. both witnesses said they were excited but never afraid during this event. witness b does not rule out the possibility of the objects being either weather balloons released by the airport manager or chinese lanterns possibly released by a local farmer and his family.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

oak.  i noticed a very large red object in my rear view mirror. i thought it could have been a life flight helicopter and dismissed the object as that.  roughly 30 seconds go by and i notice the object is now getting much closer than it was when i first viewed it.\r\n\r\nagain, i dismissed it as possibly just a life flight helicopter and continued to drive. the object closed in within 50 to 100ft of my vehicle and i then noticed that i heard no helicopter or aircraft sound.  as the object was coming up behind my vehicle, it turned on some sort of white \"spotlight\" or bright white light that illuminated the entire road beneath the object.  then it moved directly over my vehicle and matched my speed, staying above my vehicle for the duration of this experience.\r\n\r\ni pulled my car over on eastbound side of hwy 80 in the middle of the bridge leading over lake devernia. my wife was with me during this event and once i started to pull over, she became extremely upset and scared and asked me to please just continue to drive and not to stop.  once i came to a complete stop, i opened my door, stepped out of my vehicle and tried to better observe this object.  there was a very distinct \"hum\", almost like a hum you would hear coming from a street lamp.  very consistent and very unique sound.\r\n\r\ni used my left arm to shield my eyes to try and get more details on the craftds.  on each wing tip, there white lights.  the cavity the lights were in looked like someone taking a scoop out of an ice cream bowl.  the light itself looked to come from further back in this recess.  the object was a flat black looking metallic skin.  the only reflective item on this object was the circle around the red light/hugely bright white light coming directly from the center of the undercarriage of the vehicle.  when i observed it, it would have been \"red/white light in recess, reflective black metallic material forming a circle, almost exactly like a recess light in your home.  the housing for the light would be identical to what i saw on this craft.  \r\n\r\nthe best description i can give on how i felt during this is like when you put a 9v battery to your tongue, that metallic/static/uncomfortable feeling is what the whole area felt like to me.  while looking at the craft, there seemed to be something that made the outer edge look like what pavement looks like on a hot summer day.  there was absolutely no wind or prop wash coming off of this object, just the electric sounding hum.\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of seeing the object while out of my car, it slowly gain roughly 100ft in altitude, looking like it was moving sideways or \"crab walking\" back toward the west where i originally saw the red light, it flew over some tree tops and out of my line of sight.  as i sat back down into the car, my wife was hysterical.  extremely afraid, extremely shocked and frantic.  i started driving east again and within seconds started to feel as if i were sunburned.  my face/left arm were the only parts of my body that felt this way.  it was identical to how a sunburn feels.  it felt like it radiated heat, was warmer to the touch than any other part of my body and yet there was no sunburn.  my arm/face looked perfectly fine, but felt as tho they had been burned.\r\n\r\nthere are other details to this event that will remain untold unless it's

pasaba por frente a las casillas de los pescadores del lugar vi que habia tres pescadores al lado de otro vehiculo y haciendo gestos y señalando para el lado de la entrada de la ria, detuve mi vehiculo en la banquina y me baje porque vi a esta gente muy alterada.\r\nestaban a los gritos señalando dos luces muy azules como de color electrico que estaban quietas frente a los acantilados de la otra orilla de la desembocadura de la ria del rio gallegos, tome mi celular y comence a filmar pero estaba muy lejos y ademas esta gente gritaba.\r\nentonces me subi a mi vehiculo nuevamente y segui adelante hasta la zona de los depositos de carbon de ycrt que dan a la playa frente a los acantilados que antes mencione, me baje corriendo y segui filmando con mi celular.\r\nlas luces se estaban moviendo, lo hacian muy rapido y haciendo curvas cerradas subian y bajaban, por momentos desaparecian atrás de los acantilados hacia el norte y despues volvian a aparecer, subian hacia arriba y volvian a bajar hasta casi tocar el agua, la marea estaba alta y el clima estaba cambiante, por ahi habia sol y por ahi se ocultaba, a veces caia alguna lluvia leve pero era un dia con buen tiempo.\r\nestuve filmando por casi 25 minutos, en un momento las luces ya se habian desplazado mas hacia el sur y estaban directamente sobre la boca de la desembocadura de la ria, hicieron un movimiento como girando una sobre la otra, se quedaron quietas por un segundo y comenzaron a subir mas lento en un angudo de unos 45 grados con dirección al sur, a mi derecha, siguiendo la linea de la costa pero como adentrándose hacia el mar.\r\nlas filme hasta que ya no pude verlas en la pantalla del celular.\r\nme subi a mi vehiculo, volvi a la ruta donde estaba antes y me quede adentro mirando el video donde se veia las luces ir y venir, se me acerco un pescador y me pregunto si habia filmado eso y le dije que si y le mostre el video, me pidio que si se lo podia mandar y me dio su correo electronico, le dije que no tenia problemas.\r\ntodo esto paso como al mediodia y duro menos de media hora, yo estuve en punta loyola hasta como las 19 horas; como a las 15 horas estuve mirando de nuevo el video e hice una captura de imagen donde se veian bien las dos luces y se la mande a mi hijo, a eso de las 18 horas vinieron dos hombres y una mujer en una camioneta blanca y estuvieron preguntando si alguien habia visto algo raro ese dia, un pescador le dijo que yo habia filmado unas luces y me vinieron a ver.\r\nles mostré el video grabado y me preguntaron si le podía cambiar el celular tal como estaba por otro celular nuevo, me pareció raro pero igual les pregunte que celular me darian, entonces buscaron en la camioneta una caja y me ofrecieron un celular samsung s6 edge, aca en rio gallegos no se consigue y además es caro, la caja estaba cerrada de fabrica y les pregunté si era liberado, me contestaron que si. asi que no lo dude y les entregue mi celular a cambio de ese.\r\ncuando volvi a casa recupere la imagen que habia sacado del video y un par de dias despues se la mande al pescador y a algunos amigos, hoy vi que el pescador que le dicen el gordo habia publicado algo aca en mufon asi que ahora yo cuento mi parte y ademas agrego la imagen y otra imagen que es un detalle aumentado donde se ven las dos luces perfectamente.\r\nme recomendaron hablar con una persona aca en rio gallegos que parece que sabe mucho de todo esto pero no la pude encontrar.\r\nhable estos dias con muchas personas de punta loyola y varios, incluso personal de prefectura dicen que esos ovnis y luces a veces se ven incluso de noche mas hacia el este mar adentro y que hay muchas historia en el lugar.\r\nyo siempre tuve dudas de que los ovnis existieran, nunca le di mucha importancia al asunto pero ahora se que es verdad, lei varias noticias locales y uno ve que la gente es burra y se burla de todo, no voy a mentir yo hacia lo mismo antes, seria mejor que la gente piense dos veces las pavadas que escriben porque a cualquiera nos pude pasar de ver ovnis en cualquier momento.","distance":"Over One

s.E.,for orions belt, then down a little to the heel. out of same direction, i saw what appeared to be a delta shaped row of lights moveing n.E.,very fast,no sound, high altitude, :my opinion:, i turned to see it again and it was gone,it took one half second to turn around,i had no time to raise my binoculars,should have been faintly visible anyway,this thing seemed structured,the lights never waivered,all attached to the same thing. first shock and awe, then bewilderment, the hair on my arms stood up,i tried to tell family,and was told it was trump one,ha ha. having seen many videos on youtube,ie. ufo lue, there are same shapes in some of his videos, but on nightvision. absolutely did not need any of that to see this, my cell phone not working right,reach me at 1-810-985-4361. i

mufon team,\r\n\r\nback in july of 2009 or 2010 (i can confirm the exact dates if requires) i've went to egypt for vacations and i was watching the pyramids light and sound show from my room balcony.\r\n\r\nafter shooting several pictures of the show, i've just be there and appreciate the show.\r\nlater on, when i was checking the photos i've notice some anomaly in one of the photos. an object seams to be present, and when i say object its because is not a reflection of the lights, i have other photos in the same light conditions (i will send if required) where the object is not present. also, another couple that we meet on this trip stated that they spot the same object and see it moving quite slow for a aircraft and make no sound like an helicopter. \r\n\r\ni have this photo for quite a time and didn't show it to anybody besides my wife and the couple that confirmed that it was what they saw.\r\n\r\ncan you please test it to be sure its not an aircraft or some other phenomena.\r\n\r\nthanks and regards\r\n\r\nluis","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line
