we approached the i-20 interchange.  we noticed what appeared to be a plane's smoke trail way above traveling to the east / northeast, higher than we've ever seen before.  we then noticed movement below and to the left of the smoke trail about 3/4 of the distance between the horizon and the plane. it was a metallic spherical shaped craft highlighted by the setting sun. it was about the size of a bb if held at arm's length. we first thought it was another plane and that we were at an angle which only made it look spherical.  then, to our great surprise, the sphere quickly ascended but in an \"s\" pattern as if it were taking evasive maneuvers. it moved up right, then up left, then up right again and then finally it reached near the level of the plane's smoke trail, as if it were passing behind the plane.  what then shocked the both of us, was that the sphere accelerated upwards beyond the smoke trail and disappeared, as if it had flown out of the atmosphere. a few seconds afterward, the plane also disappeared and it's smoke trail evaporated quickly.  \r\n\r\nas for the plane, we speculated that perhaps that had actually been an object re-entering the earth's atmosphere and creating an illusion of a smoke trail.  we knew that the american astronaut was to return from the space station later that evening, but this time seemed too early in the evening for that occurrence.  as for the metallic sphere, however, we have no explanation.

a second, gazing up at the clear, starry sky, as we live where theres barely any light pollution. towards the western horizon, we saw what we first believed to be a star, but brighter; and moving ever so slightly back and forth in a circular motion; coming closer and farther with each small circular revolution. i headed into my house and grabbed a pair of high quality binoculars, and focused on the ufo. you could clearly observe red-orange lights, around 5~ i'd say, in a circle on the object, with a light blue aura barely, but clearly visible emitting from it. as we stood there astonished, we noticed multiple planes come close to the object, and each time one did, you'd notice the ufo pan towards and then, away from the clearly visible plane coming close to it. the planes were always small in scale to the bright, star-like object. \r\n\r\nit was then, when another plane passed under it, did i realize the extraterrestrial (out of this world) likeness of the object. the lights from the object reflected off the plane, making the wings visible, clearly meaning it was no starlight reflecting, and was instead artificial light. (out of this world) \r\n\r\nanother 30 minutes went by, and need i tell you, it was around 15degreesf out, but i could not for the life of me take my eyes off this elusive ufo. it only ever went left and right, back and forward, appearing to be an eyetrick at first. but as i put my finger in front of it, it moved away from it, appearing again, and then suddenly to the left of it; indictating it's movements as something more than an illusion. \r\n\r\ni was and still am absolutely speechless, as i witnessed only one other paranormal incident in my life, when i was about 12-13. (i saw 10 simultaneous bright flashes, in the dead of night, so bright that the sky appeared to be blue, as if it was a mid-summer day, again with my brother) \r\nduring the observing time, i felt sick and nauseous, as i know i saw the real thing when i was younger (i couldnt sleep that night, years and years ago, because i was so traumatized from the event) and i couldn't believe i could be so lucky as to witness yet another in my lifetime. the sickness though, had to be related to said unidentified object, each time i looked away, it would settle. but when i would gaze upon it, i felt as if my appendix burst all over again.\r\nmy brother recorded the event, but due to the distance of the object, and the quality of his phone and camera, you can just barely see the light and watch it move, but one might claim the video to be a hoax, so it's not worth sharing. the encounter however, was more than real than the sky is blue. \r\n\r\nthe encounter ended as i got tired of watching it just move left and right, back and forth, with no further actions or indications it would 'fly' away. after two hours of gazing upon it, i walked back in my house, keeping in mind i'd go back outside and see if it either switched places (evidence of being a star, to me) or if it disappeared completely. a half hour went by and i stood outside to check, and in the sky, there was nothing. no bright lights/stars. no object, no more planes flying over that area. i can only imagine what i might have missed.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

that you ever see planes and thats running directly above and along the beach.     beach runs in a south east -north west direction   the sun had set below the horison , the sky above us was still light as there was only a  little cloud about . noticed what a asumed to be a plane maybe 100 metres away and about the same hieght thought it was strange that it was coming from overland and heading west ,but there was old patrol boats moored just offshore so thoufgt it was milatery,  the initial glimpse i got was what looked to me an old mirage fighter jet , with two bright green lights at the end of each wing , did not see any type of tail finns, just from 1 wing tip to the other was straight,thats the only structial glimpse i got coz i didnt realise at the time to get a better look,,it was out over the water so fast ,that i thought definatly milatery,,after seeing many f-16 and other jets in darwin it was easily there speed ,,,but no noise , f-16,s are very loud , this thing was nothing, only noise i could hear was the slight waves lapping at the shoreline , craft was well out over the bay when green lights turned red and it changed to a northerly direction , i asked the people sitting on the next table if they could see this as well ,he said he could .Couple on next table to him were ajso watching and pointing , craft headed north dor a few more seconds then turned west and gained altitude , then what looked like it droped altitude and went out of sight  whole experiance @15 seconds , no idea what it was  ,ps i dont know the degress so have put 45 in that
