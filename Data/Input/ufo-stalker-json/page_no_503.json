to be a ufo, until that saturday night: 28th of january, 2016. there was little air and road traffic at the time, and it was unusually warmer than recent days, with barely any wind. i never expected to see anything(as usual), however, as i was adjusting my phone's camera settings, i saw a large figure looming right above me and the garage in front of me: looking up, a boomerang(30+ft across but thin), was...Gliding(10-15mph) in a circular motion taking a sharp right turn over my garage and out of sight. i was able to observe it's underside in great detail- color: dark(blended with the night sky), it's structure: symmetrical, with visible, intricate plates(smooth corners, no significant curvatures), smooth surface(non-metallic or even see-through), with 14+ small rectangular white lights aligned closer to the anterior than posterior. moving silently, at an altitude of about 50 ft(or double the height of my 2 story house). because of the fact i've never seen a \"ufo\", it didn't cross my mind to chase it. instead i waited for it to appear again. \r\nabout 5 minutes later, my second sighting: a somewhat faint yellow glow, as if it were just above clouds(were no clouds)approx. 100ft in altitude and 100ft away) the form of an obtuse triangle with separated \"extensions\" coming from the anterior corners , moving about 20mph in a straight path, to then instantly merge into a brighter yellow(maybe larger) triangle just before accelerating to 100+mph as it dissapeard in the distance. same figure was spotted about 1-2 hours afterwards. same altitude, only slow movement and no \" extensions\" visible, but both moved in a straight path. the faintly glowing figure(even in close range), was approx. the same size as the boomerang structure. \r\n\r\ni could say i saw 15 to 17 ufos total. white, flat circles of light(i'd like to call them \"propulsion units\") aligned themselves (individually) into wide-angled boomerangs. i assume these \" units\" are circular in shapeor at least have no externally visible front, as the formations they created were capable of rotating as a whole, ranging from 50 to 100ft across, and usually asymmetrical. therefore i can assume these \"units\" are capable of suspending each other into these formations. with the exception of the \"letter t\" formations - all 4 that i saw shared these common traits:\r\n1 - the front: smaller in all aspects, usually with 4 oval shaped lights(white) and always symmetrrical. this part is presumably a structure by itself.\r\n2 - the tail: usually asymetrical, comprised of these \"propulsion units\"(all equal in size and color)\r\n3 - all descending or hovering low(40-60ft max when first spotted)\r\n\r\ni'm on mobile, and this is too tedeous to complete at the moment. i will send sketches soon. there is more, and i will submit a complete report soon. i will gladly answer any questions. i feel this is important because the letter t shape ufos are not at all common on the internet. there are more craft sightings i did not mention, i will have to add this in my next submission. from my observations alone i have come up with several theories in regards to the behavior of these crafts and their purpose. for example, the first ufo must be designed specifically for agilty, stealth, and who knows what else. the behavior alone can tell you so much. it was so low i could have thrown a rock at it. please excuse the unprofessional report, this was somewhat urgent. it's really a case of being in the right place at the right time. i truly believe i witnessed some kind of \" migration\". i continue to make theories as to why all these various ufos appeared to be so low to the ground and desecending. honestly i don't expect anybody to take this seriously without evidence other than sketches, especially when i saw no other pedestrians during this 3 hour event(9-12)","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

walked outside to take the dog out and listen to all the fireworks and gunfire going off in the area. i had been standing in our back yard by the north facing side of our house when i noticed what i thought at first to be something burning up in top of the neighbors large oak tree. i then saw that it was moving, traveling in a southwest direction and i couldn't hear sound coming from it. i didn't think much about it and started to walk back to the house. that's when i noticed another one off to the north horizon coming towards my location.The light from these objects was an orange/red light which seemed to be solid and very bright. no flickering or shape changing. when i realized that i was looking at something i had never seen before i called for my wife to come outside to see it as well so i would at least have someone to back up on what i was seeing. (she did) the orbs all came from the same area off to the north and traveled in the same direction as the first. about the time one would go below the horizon in the southwest another would appear off to the north. each were spaced about 90 to 120 seconds apart. it was hard to determine how big or high the objects were because i have nothing that i've seen before to compare it to. if i were to guess based on us living in a flight path for the charlotte douglas int. airport the jetliners that come by our neighborhood are estimated to be 10,000-15,000 feet up usually coming in for a landing and are clearly visible to the naked eye. these objects appeared to be at that altitude, but larger than a jet liner moving a lot slower than one as well. however since i have never seen one at ground level i can only guess to it's actual size.\r\nthe orbs continued to come from the north and travel sw. on the 10th one to appear in the north we saw that it began in the same flight path as the others, however this last one changed course and flew directly over us still at the same altitude as the others. just prior to it passing over us the orange/reddish light seemed to just fade away. i could not see where the lights were originating from like you can on an aircraft. they were just there, and then they weren't. when the lights went off i was looking almost straight up at it and saw that there was now a saucer shaped object there moving by over head. i tracked the craft for about four seconds until i tripped and nearly fell. when i looked back up i saw the lights come back on never seeing where they originated from, and then the craft rejoin the flight path of the others flying out of sight. i felt that this craft exposed itself on purpose for us to see it. the bottom of the craft appeared to be grey on the outside ring and darker on the inner ring. could have had this appearance due to shape of craft on bottom. \r\nwe were not drinking or doing drugs or suffering from any mental disability. i am a police detective and a 20 year veteran with the charlotte-mecklenburg police department. my wife is a social worker and has been for the last 25 years. \r\nduring the time that these things were flying by i called my office to see if anyone else was reporting seeing the lights. they advised that they had reports about two hours prior to this incident advising seeing multiple orange lights heading sw. by the way the direction that they were traveling was directly towards lake wylie, s.C. just over the state line from us. \r\ni was able to snap a few pictures of the things, but they are not the best. you can see that there is an orange light in the sky.\r\nthe job that i do for the police department has me monitoring some 1300 cameras around the city. when i returned to work i was able to locate these objects on our cameras, and in different parts of the city. some earlier and some later than my sighting. \r\n\r\napproximately six weeks later i got off of work at 3:00am in the morning and drove home. i'm not sure of the exact date on this one, but remember the time at 3:18am. i just walked up on my front porch and was looking east and saw another orange orb in the sky at least a mile away from me. i ran out into the street to get a better look at it, and watched it ascend into the clouds, which i checked with the weather station which advised that there was a cloud ceiling of 10,000 feet that night. that was the only one that night and it was only visible to me for a few seconds.

pointed it out immediately to my son and wife who saw it clearly as well. it had a row of four to five round orange/copper colored lights on each side of the v with a light at the point. judging only from it's lights - we could not see any structural definition - it appeared to be about the same size as a mcdonnell douglas dc-9. it flew by approximately 500-700 feet up from the ground, about the same height of approach aircraft to the airport. the object flew due north right overhead of us. we live close to dulles international airport so we frequently see and hear (very noisy) approaching and departing aircraft in the area. there were no aircraft in the immediate area during our sighting of the craft. if flew over steady, fast and silently. not a sound! the whole event took less than 8

entire ground. as the shadow moved i kept looking up and down. i still cannot get over the size of the shadow but then i caught a glimpse of the outline of a craft.  but it looks transparent. then it vanished over the tree line.  it was slow moving and silent. i still to this day cannot get over the size. it's taken a while for me to really believe in my own mind what i seen, i seen. it somehow

acompane este evento ya que es solo un registro fotografico.\r\nel video del celular no registra nada de importancia relacionado con las fotos. \r\nnota: los datos ofrecidos en este reporte como foto y escrito sobre el circulo brillante es anexada por considerarla parte de las tomas hechas en ese momento y que pueda aportar algun elemento mas a considerarse, en este caso, por ustedes. mi referencia principal en el cuestionario es unicamente sobre el objeto que considero mas importante y significativo.\r\nsoy medico de formacion y con educacion cientifica, no suelo impresionarme facilmente. deseo saber sobre este hallazgo y si ambas tomas fotograficas estan relacionadas. poseo algunas fotos con registros fotograficos inusuales en otras fechas y lugares y es la primera vez que me motivo a consultar con una entidad seria como ustedes quizas porque es mas evidente, aparentemente.","distance":"Over One

was a bright star light object so bright that i took my binoculars out. the first time i saw this, the object was far off in the distance perhaps 20 miles away. through my binoculars i saw a stationary white light hovering with a green and blue blinking light below the white light. i watched it to see if it would move and it did not move for 15 minutes. suddenly it dared to the left then to the right about an inch which could have been miles because i was so far away. then it began to move in my direction. closer and steadily until it was just above the tree line and all i saw was the bright white light. it was moving about the speed of a car on a highway. i ran outside as it crossed over my house, barefoot in my pajamas. what amazed me was that it was so close yet it made absolutely no noise. at this time it looked to be the size of a small aircraft or a tractor trailer. then last night 2/29/2016 i saw one again. same place in the sky, same size, this one had two bright lights and two blinking white lights, hovering for 10 minutes. then from the northeast an airplane heading towards the bradley airport area in windsor locks appeared. i could here the engins and it had the red and while blinking lights and was tve usually airplanes i see all tve time for the last four years i've lived here. as the plane got closer to this hovering ufo., the ufo just

glance up at the clear dark sky,it was at this moment i noticed this very large triangular shape in the sky nearly directly above me,for a split second i thought it was a raf vulcan bomber but quickly realised it didn't fit the description or behaviour of any conventional aircraft known to me,this object was just a very large black triangle with no lights and making no sound that i could hear, it was travelling in a straight direction very very slowly and if i had to guess what speed it was doing i would say it was only going about 15 to 20mph, i just stood watching it in amazement for several minutes before it went out of my site because of tree cover, i jumped on my motorcycle and road of in the direction it was travelling and managed to spot it again in the distance travelling in a straight northern direction which i estimate would eventually take it towards southampton airport,it eventually went out of site and i continued on my journey to work trying to think of a excuse for being late, i have never told this to anybody else accept close friends and family for fear of being ridiculed, what i observed was a solid sharp edged object which was no conventional aircraft or a

window. as soon as i turned my head to look i saw a blue glowing object far off in the distance. i studied this object for a good five or ten seconds before this thing started to move very vast towards my general  direction. as it came closer it started to grow and became a very bright blue glow. finally it just zoomed way up over the top of the car at high speed and i lost it. it was just a perfect orb that emitted a soft glow at first, but as soon as it started moving it increased in size and the color become much much more brighter and more vivid. it hurt my eyes so bad, it was like looking into a welding arc. my ears were ringing very bad, and it was like i was paralyzed and stuck to my seat. i sat in silence for the longest time, and tried to process what i just saw. i felt so many emotions running through me. as soon as i calmed down i told my girlfriend what i just saw, and no-one in the car besides me saw a single thing. after i had finished telling everyone what i had saw, i all of a sudden became very very sleepy. i slept for a solid 15-20 min before we came to our hotel. i talked more about it with my girlfriend later on in the night so that i wouldn't frighten the kids. i still think about this alot and have had a few dreams with the exact same orb flying through the sky. whatever i saw on that day seemed unreal, like something out of a movie. but all i know is that whatever it was that i saw changed me for the better. i've never felt emotion and feelings run through me so wildly before. what i saw that day was simply

watch on the military base off soesterberg in the netherlands.\r\nalong with a other cadet i came at the central parking lot at 03.00 hour and notes a big circle in the sky strait on top off us. \r\nit had no shape but only bight lights slowly rotating anti-clockwise and the light points its self didn't rotate, the colours did ant in a liquid manor.\r\ni estimate the object abbot 30/50 meters in diameter.\r\nthe first thing we both thought was a blimp, a zeppelin, the one like goodyear has with the light screens on the sides.\r\nbut the fact that it was very low and absolutely stationary and silent made its very, very odd.\r\nafter some minutes the lights started to rotate faster and suddenly it took off at really incredible speed to the west.\r\na couple off seconds later we felt a short hard wind blowing staid on top of us like a downwash from a helicopter.\r\nif there was a way to describe the speed this thing was going then i give it but i cant.\r\nwe had a clear view for over 30 km that's +- 20 miles ? this thing cover that distance from stationary in some ting like 0.10 sec  \r\ni know aviation and have flying experience and i am very technical.\r\nthis kind off extreme acceleration turns humans in to liquid.\r\nfor many year this has been a unspoken chapter in my live, i didn't wanted to speak about the incident because instantly after the encounter, me and
