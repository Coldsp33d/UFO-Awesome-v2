returning to our work center from lunch. driving north from a restaurant about a mile from our work center, we first noticed the object about halfway through the drive back. it was dusk and the sky was darkening, with thin clouds to the north and east. the object was a bright string of lights located to the north, approximately 25-30 degrees above the horizon, moving slowly in a westerly direction. the light nearest the \"front\" of the object was of a reddish orange color, and a bit brighter than the rest. trailing behind this red light was a line of numerous yellow, somewhat dimmer lights that were spaced very closely together. for the first 10-15 seconds after spotting the object, it continued to move slowly towards the west and the lights appeared to pulse or waver slightly, possibly due to atmospheric turbulence. after this 10-15 second period, all of the lights started to dim and then disappear from sight. this object remained invisible for approximately 5 seconds, when suddenly it began to re-appear. once it reached full brightness and size, i could discern that the lights were not an exact straight line, but seemed to curve under and out at the front of the object. i infer from this effect that the lights were possibly arranged in a v or chevron pattern, and that i was observing the object nearly edge on. the details of the shape can be viewed in the included rough sketch. the object continued moving west for approximately 10 more seconds before fading from view again, disappearing permanently this time. at no time was i able to see a solid object. the were two other witness that i know of at my work center that saw the object as well.\r\n my coworker and i have years of military experience between us in the usaf. neither one of us had ever seen an object quite like this. there are many types of aircraft that operate at edwards afb, nothing we know of matches the behavior of these lights. it is our opinion that these lights were not aerial flares. they moved in unison and did not vary in altitude. what we saw was either a large group of objects flying in a extremely tight formation, or that these lights were part of a single, large object. the behavior and consistent altitude of the lights, the distance between them and the lateral motion leads me to believe they were part of the same object.\r\n also, i believe there are witness to the same event outside my exact location. reference mufon case number 74891, a report made on the same day in california city of a very similar object. california city is located 15 miles north east of edwards afb.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

coast\r\nflorence\r\n\r\ninvisible flying craft?\r\n\r\nwhile waiting in the local grocery store parking lot in the center of florence, oregon, i took \r\nnotice of this moving streaming vapor tail coming towards me from directly south. the streaming tail was in the form of a mist, vapor. i thought military jet? \r\ni quickly grabbed my nikon 3100 camera.\r\nzoomed up on the moving stream tail. \r\nthe conditions were clear and blue. \r\n\r\ni began taking pictures. one after the other. \r\n\r\nthere was no jet or object of any kind. just a short-wide streaming tail moving towards me.\r\nas this streaming vapor tail moved? it disappeared quickly as it moved across the sky.\r\nthere no sound of any kind.\r\n\r\nthis appeared to me as really strange.\r\nthis can't be? \r\n\r\nby the time the streaming vapor tail was directly above me, two minutes had passed. i would say\r\nthe streaming vapor tail was about one mile above me.\r\nno sound. no jet. nothing.\r\njust nothing leading this stream vapor tail?\r\n\r\nagain this was getting really strange!!\r\ni could see clearly the streaming vapor trail. \r\n\r\nno sound of any kind!! no aircraft of any kind in the sky!! any where!!\r\n\r\nwhat could it be?\r\n\r\ni attempted one short video with as it streamed to the north.\r\ni feared my nikon 3100 camera would become blurry at the extended zoom.\r\nstill no plane? no jet? nothing.\r\nnothing but a streaming vapor trail!\r\n\r\ni stopped video taking. zoomed camera back for picture.\r\nthen i was able to see an object!\r\na (jet)) began to flash in and out. \r\nit was there and then it wasn't?\r\ni could see right through this object?\r\nthe craft was pulsating its size in and out.\r\n\r\nthe object? streaming vapor trail continued to move to the north and was gone of sight.\r\n\r\ni downloaded the pictures in my mac computer. \r\nsure enough. nothing lead the streaming vapor trail. \r\nnothing. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

of me but up in the sky and in the blink of an eye it was turned and heading south and then it disappeared. after getting scared at that point i realized i didn't take a picture, but it happened so fast at the end i wouldn't have been able to anyway, because it disappeared so fast. the front of it when i could see it for a second looked like a round crystal. if you have any idea of what it could have been can you let me know. i am still wondering what it was. i filled out the form the best i could. also i would like to tell you about something i saw in the 60's. i swear on my life i am no nut

highway near a small town , named woss at around 10 pm . everything seemed to be going normal , until i had a sudden feeling of fear and overwhelming feeling of anxiety . both karla and i had similar gut feeling something was off, when we both noticed blinking lights in rear view mirror (passanger side) of our car. we didn't say much to one another at the time , except maybe watching for theses unknown lights to maybe dissappear eventually.  i felt the need to try and evade whatever was fool owing our car , gut feeling i guess, so i sped the car up . the lights stuck with us as if almost attached to our car . all i can remember is praying for another car to come along the highway, because both karla and i were terrified for some reason. eventually i got my wish , a car appeared from the distance as i saw the headlights 1 km away heading south bond towards us on the highway. the lights then disappeared . that's all i remember from thus event . the reason i am sending this information is that other similar events have happened to us in almost this exact location on this highway. there were at least two other similar events that happened to us aswell in the past . both events that i remember we were not followed but sudden light failure on our car and electrical malfunction aswell. i believe that there is something strange about this location , outside of woss on the highway . also when i was about ten years of age , my family and i plus lots of other people observed a fairly large mettalic disc hovering not even 100 feet from the ground in cloverdale bc. until recently i believed this to be just a dream that i may have had when i was a child , and this dream would re-occur throughout my life. i finally asked my mother and my brothers about this thinking maybe they would  just laugh at me and blow it off, but we all saw the exact same thing  just never talked about it. my mom can describe this event best because my brothers and i were kids at the time, but all stories seem to match up.
