me, my journey was approx 35 mins and the object remained ahead of me about the size of the moon, when i arrived at my destination the object was almost above me, it must have been large as i could see clearly that it was turning slowly and it had lights around the rim and a dome, it made no noise, i was too stunned and excited to think of taking a picture.   i thought it could be an alien craft as i had seen a v formation in italy once as a child so i knew they existed...I called a witness to the event and they watched it with me for 5 mins or so and then the craft seemed to slowly move a little to the right and then go upwards until it disappeared completely.    \r\n\r\ni immediately phoned air traffic control at nearby northolt military airport who denied anything untoward on their radar...I also called the police who said they had not had any reports and dismissed my call as a weather balloon or perhaps a virgin airship..I called virgin the next day and they said they had no air balloons in the shape of flying saucers and they do not fly at night...Plus they are never static..   i wrote to my local paper who put me in touch with a ufo expert who's editor of a ufo magazine.  i called him, he asked for a description and for me to draw a picture of the craft which i did.  he told me that it was most probably an alien craft as it fitted the description of other reported sightings previously...My experience did leave me with a curiousity to know more as to this day i cannot believe what i saw and people always look at me as if i'm crazy so i don't talk about it...But i know what i saw and i can't explain it...All the photos i see of ufos are so fuzzy and far away whereas this was so bright, close and clear, just wish i had not been so enthralled and had taken a picture with my phone but i was transfixed and didn't dare move..","distance":"501 Feet - 1

talking to me and i was looking out the window. i always look at the stars at night. i noticed one of the stars lower in the sky did not look like all the others. it was slightly bigger and slightly brighter. it also had a golden tint instead of the whitish color most stars have. it was stationary and i thought maybe it was a planet and that's why it looked different. i did notice a plane flying past what looked like the same area of the star.I kept looking at it almost constantly for about 5 mins. suddenly the \"star\" began to move in a nw direction. it seemed to have the same speed from the moment it began moving until i lost sight of it when the angle was over my car. at that time i felt kind of fearful and started thinking of scenarios of what might happen next. which thankfully was nothing! i told my husband about it as soon as it had began moving but from his angle he could not see it. we had a similar experience about 5 years ago a out 15 miles south of the same area. we were in the backyard late at night having a fire. two stationary \"stars\" did not look right to me. they were the same color as the other stars just brighter and bigger than the other around them and just seemed out if place. my husband and i were discussing them seeming different and possibly being ufo's. they were there, from the time we noticed, for about 15 mins. when suddenly they began to move in a ne direction at the same exact time and keeping the same exact distance, direction, and speed. for about 1 min when the lights just went out. i don't know if it was one object or two. just moments later there were several planes in the area of where the lights disappeared coming from different directions. i felt kinda shocked at what i has seen. my husband and i still talk about it sometimes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

approach for landing at lax. i also saw a steady glowing light about 1,000 feet ahead of me in the sky. as i arrived at home, i turned off my car, got out and turned around to see if the light was still there in the sky, it was. i walked to the end of my driveway, looking at the object the whole time. about five to seven seconds later, the light blinked off, but i could still see the object due to all the light pollution in the sky. it was a dull spheroid shape that made no motion. i then walked further out into the street to observe this stealthy object and as i did so, the object began to move towards me, lowering it's altitude. it was directly overhead, about 200 ft or so above the ground and i could see strange detail.\r\nthe object was not spheroid as i first thought, but was more of a soft cube-like shape, white or light grey, with large diameter holes or circles on all faces.The circles appeared about five feet in diameter.\r\nthe object floated like a soap bubble, smooth and quiet, graceful and on a direct path. as i kept looking up at it, it appeared to twist or rotate/counter-rotate at both ends slowly, with one hole or circle facing directly down at me. no glow, it descended and came lower and lower until it seemed to land behind the roof of my neighbors house. there is a cul-de-sac their house, so i climbed in my car and drove to where i thought it might be. when i reached the location, there was no sign of anything at all.\r\nthe next day i related the story to the gentleman of the house and he told me he owns no drone or model aircraft or balloon. whatever it was made no noise but moved across the sky with purpose and landed in a very dark area at night. the only other time i witnessed anything like this was during fourth of july of 2015. i have video and still images of that evening of what appear to be the same objects.\r\ni submit those images and video now in support of this description. i thought they were drones at first, but now, seeing it up close, i can no longer assume that due to the strange movement and appearance without light.","distance":"21-100

to video tape it with my iphone but was not too happy with my shots, but you can still make out the object and the way it was moving and flashing it's lights . one thing i thought to myself , if it is

something.. but at the same second i realized it wasn't moving, it was just there, then like 2 seconds after it flew straight up with a u turn towards the ground, when it was half way to ground it just disappeared in a milli sec.. and it was so big, the closest thing i can compare it with is one of those \"road lights\" dunno if that is what its called but the lights along the side of the road? :p with an orange light bulbe.. seen from 30 meters... but again not the same as normal light, you know when you look at light you can see these light beams out from the sides, this didn't happen when

went over to my dad house to say good night and as i left the house to come back to mine i looked over to the sky and was just remembering about how i used to look at the stars in england and think i wish i was home and i noticed a really bright redish star, it was moving really fast and as i focused on it i saw that there was multiple stars moving the same speed and direction, there was a red big bright one, and several white smaller ones that were less visible and sometimes it would look like they desappeared and another would shine. there was also a moment where it looked like the stars shaped into a y. it looked like a constelation moving. i got really curious and kept looking at it, thinking what could it be, it was moving towards me, and i couldnt think about an explanation for what i was seeing, satelites dont move together like that, it was more than 10 stars (if it was stars) i'm still looking for a rational explanation.. one that can be justified without making me sound crazy, anyways i started getting really nervous as it was moving towards me, when it was getting really close to me it slowed down what made me really scared and nervous so i just ran inside the house. i kinda felt like it knew i was staring at it. it was around 20:00 (1:30h ago) and it lasted around 5-10 minutes, i told my boyfriend and my uncle but they didnt really took me serious, or they just didnt care too much about it, i went outside again after talking to them and there was no more moving constelation. i might just be losing my mind but i'm sure i'm not seeing things that aren't there.\r\ni just wanna know if there is any logical scientific explanation to this, or if anyone as seen the same because i hate not knowing things, unknowing things scares me and i wanna have an explanation so i wont be scared, and a matter of fact i've studied a lot and researched a lot about astronomy (i mean about the universe and not really ufo's) i believe we are not alone but i kinda believe that if there's life out there would be bacterial or something alike, not inteligent life and it doesn't fit in any of the possibilities i would normally think of if someone would tell me they seen what i've seen.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

the military due to adverse weather conditions that had grounded their aircraft.  my family and i were sitting around our fire-pit around 9:00pm that evening, when my youngest brother (5 years old at the time) pointed behind us and said \"what's that?\".\r\n\r\nwe turned around and saw a large diamond shaped craft passing over the top of the hills behind our home, headed right for us at a steady speed that i would estimate was around 60-70 mph.  we all ran closer for a better look, while my mom ran inside the house to fetch binoculars.  we were all fascinated as we watched it glide effortlessly just above the tree line of our property, but once it was within 300 feet of us it suddenly stopped & hovered in place, and a feeling of terror slowly overcame us.  we were so close to the craft we could actually see a very bright white light through the row of windows, and what appeared to be a large room inside.  through the binoculars we could see markings similar to hieroglyphics just under the windows, however no occupants were visible from our vantage point.  \r\n\r\nit hovered in place for 15-20 minutes before moving towards santa barbra and disappearing out of sight.  within minutes the airspace above our property became crowded with helicopters & aircraft at varying altitudes, and they circled over head for roughly 10 minutes before flying towards the navel base at point magu.  \r\n\r\na neighbor drove up to our home historical with fear, pulling her hair and asking us what we saw.  she told us she had seen the craft from the 101 freeway, and followed it all the way to our home.  \r\n\r\nthe next day my mom called the camarillo air traffic control to ask if their had been any aircraft in our area, but the tower assured her no aircraft had been observed on radar.  my dad was contacted over the phone by a strange man claiming to be a ufo researcher, and asked for an exhaustively detailed account of our the experience including our original drawings of the craft. when we never heard from him again, we began to suspect he may have been, in fact,  an official from the navel base instead.","distance":"101-500

step outside to smoke. i immediately notice chemtrails in the sky and point them out. one minute later, a small plane appears over our heads, and i then noticed a flash of light appear just ahead of the small plane, and asked the person standing next to me if he had seen the flash. he said he did notice it. right after that, two very bright star-like objects appear in the sky looking ne. they were near each other. i have no idea how close they were to each other. i believe they were maybe a mile or two from us and they were just above the tree line at slightly different heights. they were bright and they appeared suddenly. it was like someone turned on two huge spotlights in the sky. i noticed right away, and so did everyone else. we all watched as the objects moved slowly closer together before dimming out completely and simultaneously. that lasted about two minutes. i became very anxious and agitated. i stayed outside for a few more minutes, while everyone else went back inside. small planes which were numerous before the sighting, were all gone. quiet sprayed sky and cold is all that remained. i had a feeling that the objects knew they were being observed. i had a very strange dream later which involved me lying on a table in a room with others present. a woman who looked like one of my teachers from elementary school, was standing over me. she smiled then she touched my forehead and stroked my face, causing me to giggle like a little kid. i felt like i was five years old again. she did it again. this time i laughed, but i felt older and a little aroused. when she attempted to touch me again, i grabbed her hand and yelled \"get off me!\" i pushed her away and fell off the table. i struggled with someone on the floor for maybe ten seconds and woke up in a sweat.","distance":"Over One

they appeared they each shot off, in the blink of an eye, as quickly as they had originally appeared. there was never any sound. i have never seen any man made object move that quickly. they were
