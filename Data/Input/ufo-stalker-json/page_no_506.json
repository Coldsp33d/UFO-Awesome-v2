5:55 am, a flicker to my left caught my eye and i looked up and saw a red glowing orb the color of a stoplight and it was blinking at a steady rate.  i'm not absolutely positive, but i think it had an unlighted narrow, black band around its equator region. it was still dark outside and i'm not good at judging distances but it seemed like it was a few yards above the tree tops. i watched it travel on a straight path as it crossed the highway heading east and i watched it fly in an arc then descend as if it was going to land and that's when i lost sight of it. again, i'm not good at judging distances, but i think it was less than a mile east of 169n when it descended.  when it was over the highway, it was about the size of a dime held at arms length; if it was bigger it wasn't by much.  i remember saying to myself it was small.\r\n\r\ni wondered when i first saw it if it was a plane, helicopter or drone.  i was very calm and not very excited about seeing it, thinking a person had to be involved with this.  later i thought it was no way a plane or helicopter because it was too low, at least for a plane.  and even though it was still dark out, there was enough ambient light i think i would have been able to discern the body of a plane or helicopter at that height.  i couldn't hear anything accept the road noise from my car.\r\n\r\ni am acquainted with the minnesota mufon state

very rural area, woods surrounded my house on all sides and i rarely ever saw airplanes or helicopters through my smallish bedroom window. that night, which was about half a year ago, i was wide awake. completely absorbed in whatever game i had been playing. out of the corner of my eye i saw a bright light flash in the sky and i looked out, confused. it was a bright, glowing, orb-shaped object high in the sky and probably very far away since i couldn't pick out any sort of details. right away i thought it was something otherworldly seeing as nothing man made could've done what i saw it do. it moved in a slow zigzag pattern left to right and down, then it curved back up and hovered. it was very bright seeing as it was so far away and i was viewing it through the trees and it cast the trees' shadow into my room. it was the color of an old streetlight, orangish but sort of white. about two minutes into watching it hover it started to move again in a j shape, then it slowly moved to the west and out of my window's view. i had a strange feeling, i was only mildly curious as to what it was though at the same time i was very disturbed. i wanted to get up and look at it again but i couldn't move at all, like i was frozen. i sat completely still, sort of confused, watching a helicopter move across the sky in the same directing the thing had left in for several minutes until i could move again. i wrote down what i saw into my phone (which i hadn't used to record the thing like an idiot) and the next day at school i asked my friends if they'd seen it. they hadn't. it wasn't surprising, though, since i had seen it at one in the morning and i have that weird talent for noticing things that no one else does. \r\ni saw it again the night after, at the same exact time. it appeared in the same way, moved the exact same way, and left the same way. the only difference was that i saw a helicopter beforehand that time. once again, i forgot to record it and nobody else saw it. i stayed up again and again in hopes of seeing and recording it but i never did.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

new year's eve ( the three of us don't drink) and the scientist looks up at approx elevation of 70deg and points out a very bright light that stands out from the stars in the north and calls it as a satellite. we all look up, and as we do, the \"satellite\"  begins moving faster and then stops dead in the sky at relatively 90deg elevation above us but continued to move, stop and flash; which was a continued pattern for approx 1/3 of the sighting. \r\n\r\nwe kept watching it, somewhat flabbergasted. we followed it for 23 minutes total as it continued to move at rediculous breakneck speeds, so much so that the light it was emitting was blurred behind it as it went (we did the math at the time and estimated some moves were made at least at mach 3-4 possibly higher!!...But with not a single sound). it remained mostly in a ne bearing as it continued making seemingly impossible stops, right angle turns, arcs, moving in all directions at some point but it was moving in 4 dimensions; in that it was not just moving up, down, left, right; but diagonally also. it would stop, move up (what seemed like) a few hundred meters then move parallel to the line it just made back in the opposite direction! (like playing a game of snake) at times it looked like it was trying to hide amongst stars. the last time we saw it it literally faded away. we continued to look diligently for it but to no avail. \r\n\r\n it seemed intelligent; playful almost. it was not a plane, as we were near a regional airport and saw a plane pass as we were watching (which gave us a good reference point, but we were all very used to seeing planes land, takeoff and familiar with flight patterns/lights). we saw another plane not long after \"it\" \"left\". it was very strange indeed. it is something that has stuck with me and something i will never forget and something iwill forever ponder i guess. what it was doing goes against/defies everything i know of physics. thank you for the opportunity to share my story with a willing ear. kind regards. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":74818,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-16.8968927,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-02272016-0010","longitude":145.7146469,"occurred":1419995760000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Queensland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1456582485000,"summary":"An aircraft engineer, a pilot and a scientist are together and have a very strange encounter with a light moving at rediculous estimated speeds, making impossible stops,turns and  looked like it was trying to hide amongst stars.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Australia/Brisbane","timeZoneName":"Australia/Brisbane","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"4870","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":423,"locationName":"Brinsmead, Queensland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:87031"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving home from parents on the highway heading towards venice florida when i observed three lights fall from the sky i slowed down then observed the lights fly straight back into the sky towards another much bigger object then i lost sight cause of the tree line. my windows were down they were not reflective lights off glass it was like the light in jerusalem that touched the dome of the rock exact same thing here but three lights instead of one. it has been eating me up not telling anyone until i heard of mufon, i seen lots of different sights over the years and this has got me by the toes the much larger object that the three orbs docked with was half the size of the moon \"from the ground of course\" these crafts are not our government or other government's. i want the unbelievers to stop being so feeble minded and put more resources into discovery instead of cover ups my camera and beliefs are ready to catch someone or something!
