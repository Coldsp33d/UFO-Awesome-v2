my front porch to have a cigar as usual. i had just sat down on the porch swing and turned to face north,when i saw 2 or three round orb objects glowing with an undulating fire which appeared to be coming from its interior but the objects also appeared to have a definitive edge outlining their perfect orb shape.They came from the east and traveled west.They were not an equal distance from each other and moved with a swooping changing of direction ,almost a spiraling or balloon type of movement ,and mostly appeared as balloons tied together. but with a horizontal speed of about 80-100 mph. the way they appeared tied together as they traveled west is the way that they changed altitude by 50-100 feet or so and also in a snake like fashion side to side by just as much. they looked to be the size of large cars or trucks, that were 500 ft up and 1/4 mile out, definitely a strange flight path. so i smoked and went inside . and could not stop thinking about the three weird fire balloons tied together flying by like a snake.Thats when things got interesting when i went back outside on the porch to gaze into the sky and ponder what i just saw. then all of a sudden here come three more over the tree top from the very same direction ,so i ran out to the street to follow a line of sight on them as they also moved west. then one more came over the tree top then two more then about four more appeared over the trees to the east of me . a total of about 8 or ten they all appeared to be tied together by some invisible thread as they snaked their way to the west.Even though they were all at different distances to each other.Just  as the last of  them went by i heard my neighbors holler out ,hey look at that !! and i hollered back at them ...Did you see that ? they all replied yes! i never went to their house and questioned them about that night ,but i also cant stop thinking about it either . that brings me here. thanks for listening william ","distance":"101-500

flying in from sarasota fl. i cant even tell you what time of year it was or an exact date. however this happened just after sunset and early twilight was the time. this could be found in records from flights and visits my mother has made back home here just not sure. we were driving south on i 65 around mm 95 just past the whiteland exit. i looked out my drivers side window and up and seen this huge thing mabey 500 to 1000 feet going south. it was going slightly faster than we were as it was passing us. i shouted to my mom \"what the hell is that\"? i was driving and she told me to pay attention to the road and she would look. my first thought is that it was a blimp. however this was much larger like at least 3 or 4 times and not shaped like a blimp but a wedge or triangle. i also know blimps cant go that fast as we were going 75 or so and was passing us. i only got a few glimpses and to this day don't know why i didn't pull over and look. as i remember there was lights and detail like symbols on it. the angles were sharp on the craft and it was in a way box shaped meaning the triangle had right angles and flat surface. too this day i don't know what we had seen. my mother is 74 years old and lives in venice fl and was with me and a witness the whole time. we both told a few friends about it as we were both confused at what we had seen and really amazed nothing was reported. we got a lot a jokes like what were you drinking or smoking exct. so we kinda just left it there. we have talked about it a few times but the jokes from the very few we told made us feel like we should just shut up. i know the date and info is somewhat sketchy, however my mother and i know we seen something. what it was i have no idea but too this day i wonder.\r\nthanks","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

screaming for us kids to come out and look  at what she was watching  in the sky as myself and two stepbrothers ran into the front  porch  we witnessed a huge oval shaped object hovering above the water approximately 300 feet above the water the object was approximately 3 to 500 feet long and had bright white lights  surrounding the object. there were white lights approximately 10 to 50 feet wide they came out from the center of the craft straight down to the water and hover over the water for  approximately 5 to 15 seconds before shooting  off at a 25 to 35° angle in a south west direction when these crafts left the water,  they were gone in a blink of an eye and left a light trail  behind them. we watched the object come out of the center of the big craft one by one for approximately  10 to 15 minutes.  there were approximately 25 to 35 objects they came out from the center of the big craft once the last object left the craft the big craft  then hovered over the water for approximately five more minutes then drifted slowly and a southeast  direction flying almost directly above our house when the object was passed our house it made no sound there were no noise no vibration nothing all the lights turned off and the craft shot upwards at an extremely high rate of speed and the craft  disappeared  into the night sky.  for the next month or two we all sat out on the porch looking for these lights again we did not ever see any other lights in the same area. it appeared to us the crafts that came out  of the center of a large object and drop down to the water it was almost like they were getting water for fuel or something. there was no sound whatsoever  and to this day it has messed with my head tremendously i don't tell people what i saw for fear of being ridiculed. i know what my stepmother my two brothers and myself witness there was a tv show called operation bluebook that we tried to contact to let them know about the ufos that we witnessed. we called  the local authorities to report the incident as well and no one ever contacted us back. over the next few weeks i asked other people in the neighborhood if they had  witnessed anything  and one older gentleman said he saw exactly what we saw. i have tried doing some research to see if anyone else on either side of the chesapeake bay have witnessed the same exact thing that we saw  and i have not been able to find anything. the area that we saw all these objects is at the top of the chesapeake bay where the bay meets the rivers  by turkey point. aberdeen proving ground

\r\naround midnight,mark tobin \r\n, our driver,decided to crash out in his car while we keep partying. \r\nabout an hour later,paul lelevier and kevin hargis decided to go hiking into the mountains to a place called hackleberry.This is a place we had all hiked to before. \r\nme and eric starr smith stayed at our campsite around the campfire while paul and kevin went hiking.\r\nthis is where our sighting began\r\napproximately 2 to 2:30 i noticed a white light way off in the distance. after about  15 minutes i remember noticing that the light seemed closer to our location and mentioned to eric that it looked like it was getting closer to our location. he agreed with me.\r\nit was moving very slowly and definitely coming in our direction and took at least 45 minutes to get to us. when it was about 200ft away and maybe 4 or 500ft in elevation away from us it hovered there for about 5 minutes. \r\nit was saucer shaped with white stationary lights at spaced intervals around the craft. it was around 100ft across . it was smooth on the sides and the domed top but on the underside was irregular and looked like the irregularities were covering up whatever was underneath .\r\nneedless to say , we were very freaked out and scared.I remember asking eric if he could hear anything from the object as there was no sound at all from the craft,he could not.I remember hearing the snap,crackle,pop of the fire trying to hear  some type of noise. i also remember thinking 'i wonder if they are going to take me '.\r\nas slowly as it approached us it left at a 45 degree angle away from us.\r\nwhen paul and kevin  returned from  hiking we told them what had happened and they just laughed at us . mark,fast asleep, saw nothing. \r\ni was only 16 when this happened.\r\nas a side note, eric starr smith whom i witnessed the event with, was arrested for murdering his own son years later on a new mexico highway and given life in prison  for his crime.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

older brother was making a short wave radio as a science project for his seventh grade science fair. as he was fine-tuning the radio we were passing around the headphones attached to the radio. the only person who heard anything was me. i heard a unrecognizable voice speaking a language which to me, at least at the time, was not of this world. that night as i was lying in bed, the voice resumed. but this time there was no headphones, radio, and everyone else in the house was asleep. the voice came back to me during ensuing nights beginning to affect my sleep and even life. i remember one night i awakened my brother who this time became angry since it wasn't the first time. \r\noccurrences that were apparently associated with those aforementioned  were happening at about this same time. bright lights were running along the walls of my bedroom at night. not constantly, but from time to time. \r\nhere's the most significant part of all of this and why i'm choosing to report these

the light to check to make sure where from where it was being generated.   she was startled to see that it was coming from me and not from above. she didn't tell me about this until many years later when i was teaching and these things were obviously in my past. \r\nabove i left vague details about specific times, etc. because these occurrences were long ago, happening over several months. i was

so long (about 2 min) and pointed it out to my roommate who came outside and witnessed it also. we notice it starts to very slowly move more east towards the sun almost as if it were in a floating or

supervisor, making sure the youths didn't leave the camp.  just as i pulled into camp the ufo glided over the treetops and the building.  it stayed there for some time, bringing other workers out of the building, to see what it was, then glided away.  there was no sound, just the blinking light on the bottom.  later, threw the time i worked there, i noticed children would stagger back into to the buildings, acting like the were drunk.  looking back, i wish i would have checked into the matter better. note: years after, i always had a feeling of being under observation. i am sorry about the insufficient data, but this took place in 1973, there wasn't much for multimedia forms back then,  this facility was run by the government. i am reporting this now because i wanted someone to know, without thinking i was making it up. i don't remember the people i worked with.  quit shortly after the sighting.","distance":"101-500
