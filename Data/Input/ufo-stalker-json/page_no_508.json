bright object in the sky over newark airport nj. at first i studied the object and observe closely because of its brightness. i was expecting a plane. what i saw was a large orb in a circular shape and extremely bright acting in a bobbing motion and what it seem to do was move in a very short distance fast. i thought it was a plane at first but it's speed and movements planes can not do.It was to big and to bright. it then moved a short distance further north and closer to manhattan in the sky of 14th street and the hudson river. its movements were unlike any plane i see fly at night. bobbing at times and at times staying completely still. no sound what so ever. i was a little excited but focused enough to realize this is something i have never experienced before. i live in a 24 story building with an open view of lower manhattan east to west skyline. my windows face approx 270 degrees south west. i can view the open skies over newark airport n j and lower manhattans hudson river. 14th street east to west view. i asked my friend who was standing behind me to view this light and its large bright circular orb shape. it seem like it was completely still. no sooner then i asked him what can it be it moved straight up counter clockwise and stopped at ten o'clock. it moved in a large space of the sky in a moment. to describe this in seconds is to much time. that's right, it made a large question mark in reverse in the sky of nj. what seem like just over the sky of 14th street hudson river. i was jumping in my apartment realizing i had no recording device. it was parked at 10 o'clock bobbing slightly. it then moved from 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock releasing a ashy light before stopping. this ashy light glowed and slowly faded into the clear no cloud sky. at this point it started to move like a stone skipping on water moving very fast going east toward long island. it came over west 14th street toward east 14th street' over the east river toward brooklyn and all the way out toward long island. i lost sight of this ufo as it passed directly over my window. i got a excellent close up view as it passed my window going east. my windows face west only. the

sitting there a flash of light came out of the corner of my eye so i looked out the window. i have no doubt there was a ufo above my neighbours house. that house is a bed and breakfast and very tall.  the ufo was bigger than the house and hovering very low over the roof. it had a gold-ish light on it and was circular. i was stunned because i have never witnessed a obvious ufo before let alone one that close. i got an erie feeling and sort of felt frozen. my husband is always talking about aliens and ufo's and i love to listen but really was a non-believer. the object hovered over the house and a beam came down onto the house. both motion lights on the house came on. i tired to see if i could see anything on the ground but could not. i looked at it for about another 30 seconds and then pondered a bit more wondering if i should wake my husband up to see it. i decided i would so i went into the room and whispered his name about 5 times and said i had seen a ufo outside. he finally woke enough to realize i was not joking and came to the window to look. no kidding it was gone (but the neighbours outdoor motion lights were still on. we watched for about another 15 minutes and it

 but this time it was totally silent.I was shocked- i guess it must have followed me as i ran down the road. i was so afraid that i just ran out into the main road- where thankfully there was not a single car in sight which in itself was amazing as this is usually a really busy trunk road but it was strangely empty until after this event.. i ran into the bus shelter and continued watching this craft as it just remained still over the road junction- there was a pub opposite but i was afraid to come out of the bus shelter to go there for help. then 2 young men came out and went into the car park. they tried to start up their motorbike but it wouldnt start( i dont know if this was connected) i looked at them and then back at the object, then as i was watching it it just seemed to ‘switch off’ like a light- if it flew away it was too fast for my eyes to follow it.Some minutes later my bus arrived and i was so shaky i couldn't open my purse to get out my fare and the conductress had to help me. i was so shaken by it that for a long time i didnt tell anyone about it except for my father-although shocked  by this event however, i somehow felt as though i had been 'allowed' to see this- i'm sorry i cant explain it any clearer than that- looking back i dont feel that any harm was intended and that it was more curiosity on the part of the object  watching and observing me. i cannot say if there were any physical effects afterwards as i would not have been knowledgable enough to have associated anything with this sighting but i dont recall any.\r\n that was my first experience but in subsequent years i have seen and also heard  what i believe to be  things connected with the ufo phemomena including a possible time loss. in almost every house i have lived in since there has been some sort of ufo episode which has also included my son, daughter and husband. i will submit details of further experiences should you require any\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":74754,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.2720645,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-02252016-0008","longitude":0.5623403,"occurred":-36823500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1456397617000,"summary":"Saw object came overhead appeared to go north i ran east then south looked to see if there at it was directly overhead","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17282,"locationName":"Bearsted","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:87890"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Michgan","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in earhart indiana on june 12 2015 at 6:30pm ne spending time at my girls house having a bonfire it was a cold night out so we went inside she went inside for awhile to get warmed up but she said she would come back out after a while so i went back out and attended the bonfire and then i started looking up in the sky because i am a sky n night watcher and then my girl came back out n caught some more fresh air n was seeing what i was doing and then it happen 5 to 7 fly objects started shooting in to the sky 3 shot up in a line n then broke off in a triangle form then a couple feet away 2more shot up then same way an then 2 more in the same area the first 3 took off from shot off as well but the last 2 must of connected in the sky about 100ft up or so n then came falling back to earth in a fiery ball of flame all but one shot off in to the stars/space the crafts were about 1 to 3 miles from us. i was so upset cuz i had no camera on me at the time thou i was super happy i had something like that happened i was witnessing something i strive to see. so i dont got any proof but what my girl eyes n my eyes seen. they were behind some trees so i was a lil unhappy that i couldnt see as clear as i wanted to but i told my girl when we seen the craft started to come down that i could run to it n not care if my lungs burned cuz i was so excited to see that.. i will never forget what i seen. i know it sounds far fetched.

approximately 30 to 45 degrees there was a bright orange/red colored light in the sky (red arrow in map approximate direction).  as i watched a second light came on just below the first and slightly to the left side, having the same color as the first.  the first light faded out over a couple of seconds leaving the second light.  the process repeated with a third light coming on below the second and to the left.  the second light faded out leaving only the third.  after that there were no further visible lights and the third light faded out leaving no other lights.\r\n  this happened three times over the next 40 minutes approximately.  i recorded one of the occurrences with my cell phone, which does little for detail but shows the pattern of what happened.  i also observed one of the displays through a telescopic rifle scope at 10x power.  no further details were seen even through the scope just bright orange/red lights.  \r\n  later in the evening at approximately 1930 hours i observed a light ascending from the horizon upwards very slowly.  this light was almost straight to the east (indicated by the green arrow on the map) and started very low at about 5 degrees.  the light moved slowly upwards over the next 30 or 40 minutes finally stopping at about 20 to 30 degrees up.  this light had about the same color as the dropping lights. i also watched this light through my rifle scope however as before no further details were identified.  as i watched it it appeared to dim and go out but then come back up again after a few seconds.\r\n  i had no way to tell the distance of the objects from my location (circled in red) however i would estimate they were at least a mile away or more.  these lights were also observed by three other people there with me, and another friends cousin also saw the same light from inside el dorado.  \r\n  in the direction of the east clouds were building up and starting to obscure stars and other details in the sky.  it is possible that these clouds prevented me from seeing any other lights in the distance however i did not believe that the original lights had been high enough in the sky to be covered by ordinary cloud cover.  a helicopter was observed flying in the area briefly before the lights were observed and during the observation of the dropping lights.  i could not see any planes in the area while watching these lights.  the dropping lights could have been military flares, and seemed to be very similar to the phoenix lights video.  mcconnell afb is in wichita and one of the witnesses told me that the planes from mcconnell use unoccupied areas in next door greenwood county for \"testing\" or training  i have never heard of this happening before, but regardless the direction was not right from were he said this had happened in greenwood county.  i have also not ever observed military craft using flares or other ordinance in the general wichita area.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

tv) opposite the large window behind me that looked out into my backyard. there, i saw a large head with two huge, angular black eyes. when i looked behind me, i saw nothing outside, but i could see a reflection of the face in the window when i looked at it through the mirror. at first, i thought it was a trick of the light, but when it tilted its head slightly, i knew it wasn't caused by anything in my room, as i had the tv turned off now and i was alone. i was so terrified, all i could do was sit and stare at it through the mirror and back into the window behind me. i could see that it blinked several times as i watched it. after about 30 seconds of having a fight or flight response of just freezing, i finally worked up the courage to bolt out of the room and run upstairs, where my family was already asleep. since i was too scared to stick around long enough (i don't think i've ever been that scared in my life), i never actually saw it leave.\r\ni'm sitting in the same place where i saw it a couple nights ago (nothing has changed position in the basement room like lights or anything) and i see absolutely nothing in the corner of my window. i took out a measuring tape the next morning and measured to where i remembered its head being, and found that it was about 4 feet tall, maybe a little shorter.\r\nnormally, the curtains to the window are closed completely, and when i'd be down in the basement by myself with the curtains closed, i would hear what sounded like movement outside. oddly, our motion sensor light didn't come on that night i saw it, though, and the sensor is only a couple feet away from where i saw the entity. for the past several weeks, with the curtains closed, i would be in the basement late at night and alone, watching netflix or tv. however, i would hear strange noises outside like movement, or even tapping on the window. until i saw this entity, i never really took notice or thought these sounds were odd or out of place, as we often have deer, raccoons, rabbits, outdoor cats, and other animals in our backyard. i always assumed the noises were just animals, but now i hesitate to enter the basement at night now that we took the curtains down entirely to replace them.","distance":"20 Feet or
