65 mph. i've taken this route weekly for 8 years and know it very well. heading towards lewiston, id (which is about a 15 minute drive from lapwai, the town i work in), i noticed 3 red lights in the sky, located above the clearwater river near where the mill is. the sky was clear and the moon was full so there was no question what i was looking at - 3 bright red lights. they appeared to be in perfect alignment, widely spaced apart, way high up there which i thought was pretty amazing for \"three jets to be able to maintain such a perfectly straight line\". that was my first thought because what else could those lights be?\r\n\r\nas i kept driving, i kept my eye on the lights due to the fact that they were just too odd. they seemed to be really high up in the sky yet they were bright a clear. no blinking strobes, no green lights either. then it struck me that they appeared to not be moving. i was driving and moving but those lights seemed to hover. which meant that there was no way the lights were 3 jets. nor were they 3 helicopters. that made me think they could be drones hovering. still, the lights maintained their positions and even three drones would have some variations in alignment at some point. so i began to slow down to 45 mph, (there wasn't any traffic around me), and i kept turning my head around as far as i could behind me to continue looking at the lights which were now behind me. \r\n\r\ni passed the mill on my way into north lewiston, having thought about pulling over to watch the unusual lights because now i'm thinking this could be a ufo.  but then i quickly wrote that thought off telling myself it couldn't possibly be a ufo because everything around me seemed normal with light traffic, no blackouts, etc. it finally got to where i could no longer see them as i continued driving forward towards town.  a fire engine was heading east and i decided to continue driving since it takes me about another hour from where i was to get to my house. by the time i got home i honestly forgot all about it.\r\n\r\ntoday, at work, i mentioned to my co-worker about the odd lights and to my surprise she had seen something herself about 30 minutes prior to my sighting but in the opposite direction. i tried finding reports for this in our area but have not had any luck which is why i decided to document it here.\r\n\r\ni will add that i was listening to an audio book in my car while driving and didn't think of turning the volume down or opening my windows. so, there wasn't any unusual noise and there was no loss of electrical power. everything was a pretty typical drive home other than those three widely but perfectly aligned, bright, solid red lights just staying still up above in a clear bright night sky over the river and the mill.","distance":"Over One

downtown austin) on the evening of february 23, 2016, something in the sky caught my eye around 6:15 p.M. i was sitting about mid-field on the home side of the bleachers, which face northeast toward the away team side. a former private pilot years ago and growing up in an aviation family, i have always kept an eye on the sky and have a very good visual familiarity with planes of all sizes. i knew what i was tracking was not airplane at all.\r\n\r\ni surmise the object was a little lower than normal airliner cruising altitude, somewhere between 20,000 to 25,000 feet above ground level. it did, however, appear to be about the size of an airliner, but there were no wings. given this, i would say that the object was “cigar” shaped and rounded on both ends. it was also, in my estimate, not flying at airliner speed, approximately 500 mph. i would say that it was going only about 1/3 – 2/3 normal airline speed. it appeared to be white or metallic as an airliner appears, but again lower, slower, and with no contrail. it was tracking across the sky in a straight line traveling roughly north northeast to south southwest. i was able to watch it for two minutes or better before i lost it behind height of the bleachers.\r\n\r\nthat i know, no one else around me noticed the object. i didn’t mention it to anyone because i happened to be seated between away team parents that i don’t know.\r\n\r\ni have seen weather balloons at high altitudes track across the sky in a very slow fashion, but they’re little what dots in the sky. some i’m confident it wasn’t one of those. \r\nto be honest i’ve never in all of my years of watching the skies seen anything like this – with one exception. in early april 2015, my youngest daughter and i went to an airshow at the little airport in burnet, texas, about an hour’s drive west from our home in leander. at some point as little pitts special aerobatic light plane completed a round of stunts with smoke, i notice something not quite right in the sky. i would say this object was at or above normal airliner cruising altitude, approximately the size of an airliner, and tracking slowly. this object was white/metallic like an airliner, except the shape is what i can only describe as “bowtie.” looking at google earth, i would say that this object was moving west to east as i was standing looking north down the runway.\r\n\r\nin either case, i would definitely say neither object was a standard plane/airliner or any weather balloon that i’ve observed. they could possibly be drones or experimental aircraft. but my gut tells me that’s not the case.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

walking to our car from her class after school. i looked up to see what she was so excited about and immediately pulled out my phone (android galaxy s5) to capture the anomaly in pictures. i was moving my phone around to different sides of the sun as i snapped picture after picture to try and get the biggest ring in the shot (it seemed like the rings were outside of my vision with the camera screen because they were so big and bright). the photos were all shot within a 10 second period. we were amazed by the beauty and strangeness of the sun rings but could not look for long because of the brightness. there was no humidity in the air which is the typical meaning of rings around the sun or moon. the weather was a dry, warm 80°. as soon as we got into our car we looked at the pictures and to our amazement, we had captured a strange orb with layers of color around it in a couple of the shots! as we zoomed in to the object we could plainly see several white spots on the orb that changed with each shot. the orb started almost on the sun (upper left side of sun) with the most color around it. i then zoomed in as close as possible for the next shot (where it had already moved south west of the sun in the picture). then i zoomed back out for the 3rd shot (where it had suddenly moved closer to the sun again almost at the middle west position). by the 4th shot the orb had moved up to the outer 2nd ring of the sun and no longer had colors around it (but if you enlarge the orb on your screen, you'll still see the white lights on the orb). the last picture (taken literally one second after the 4th picture) the orb had shot down to the opposite side of the sun (se) and was already starting to disappear. not sure what this was but it was exciting to capture on camera as it would be impossible to capture with the naked eye. my daughter and i were feeling blessed that we caught it...What are the odds?! later that evening at sunset, there was a strange spherical orange beam between the clouds that we observed as well. not sure if it was another anomoly, but we decided to capture it anyway. this was shot from downtown los gatos, california (silicon valley).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The event took place around 5/5:15 am, i recall it being at least a half hour before our alarm would ring at 5:45am. i went to use the restroom, washed my hands, and as usual, because it's my tendency, looked up through my clear window at the dark sky. it was a thoroughly clear, starry night, on the early morning of 2/16/16 from my location.\r\n\r\nwhat we saw in short: 3 star-like objects moving in the sky, at a very far off distance, who seemingly met, then parted ways. please refer to my pdf attachment with my detailed drawings of our sighting.\r\n\r\ni would like to first say my restroom window looks almost directly north with where my house is located. as the 1st object is headed down in my view, i am inclined to say it was heading sw, however, i do believe that looking up at the sky from my window that views north, indicates i must actually say it was headed nw, (ie, the 3rd object was first headed up while looking out my window, so i should say it was moving se). please correct me if i'm wrong!\r\n\r\npage 1. i drew my view from my bathroom window, on the second floor, and the clear night view i had. nothing looked out of the order, several stars were in view at this time. if you refer to all my pages as a collective, i did not redraw the tree and roof lines, however, if you were to line each page under each other you'll see i traced each one from the original page to indicate where the stars positions were in reference/approximate distance from each other and that of the moving objects.\r\n\r\npage 2. shows the 1st star-like object moving downward from the right side of my window. i steadied my gaze, and started looking at the other stars and the rooves of my neighbor's houses. within seconds i can tell this one object is heading nw, approximately within 5-7 seconds i can see it slowly moving, as i calmly called in my partner (he too awoke before the alarm like myself).\r\n\r\npage 3. shows my having noticed the 2nd object, slightly lower and to the left of the 1st in my view, heading ne. it wasn't hard to notice the 3rd object after, lower than the other two, heading se. it seemed they were all heading towards each other. we both noted how the other stars remained in their position. approximately 10-12 seconds elapse while we watch. \r\n\r\npage 4. shows specifically how close they got to each other, before the 2nd and 3rd object changed their flight direction (s/slightly se and nw respectively). approximately 3-5 seconds elapse.\r\n[please note: in pages 3 and 4 i accidentally drew the flight paths with a \"beginning\" dot, i do not mean to indicate they we're leaving any type of trail nor a trailing same sized orb of any kind - just my mistake.]\r\n\r\npage 5. i should have indicated the 1st object never seemed to slow its speed while they headed towards each other. when the other two objects did change their direction, the 1st object continued its direction nw following along with the 3rd object. we watched the 2nd object continue s, very slightly se, while approximately 7-9 seconds elapsed.\r\n\r\npage 6. eventually we lost sight of the 1st and 3rd objects beyond the tree lines, so approximately 3-5 seconds elapse while in view. we continued to look on the 2nd object heading s until it past up out of our view at the top of the window; i mean to say in my drawing on this page that an additional 4-6 seconds elapsed while watching the 2nd object after losing visual on the 1st and 3rd.\r\n\r\npage 7. we continue to watch the 2nd object for almost 20 seconds more.\r\n\r\nwe were calm during this event, if anything a bit happy having been witnesses to vessels flying in our night sky (obviously very far away). we took it as a cool event, and got on with the rest of our day as normal. this was by far from my first witness event, and at least my partner's second.","distance":"Over One

from which a voice asked \"do you want to go with us?\" he agreed and felt a tingling static sensation then found himself on what appeared to be a polished marble surface. a female et (she had breasts) greeted him in a soft feminine voice with \"hello (name withheld) it is nice to see you again.\" she was about 4 feet tall with milky white skin, a small nose, no lips (he thinks), and almond shaped eyes that were not as large as a typical gray. he was led up a staircase to a hall about 12 feet wide and in to an area with 12 beds, 6 on each side of the room. one bed was empty. there were hybrid (he thinks) children with medium gray skin in the beds and several were jumping on the beds. a clearly annoyed et told them to stop jumping. \r\nthe female et escorting him gave him a medallion like one she was wearing and told him she was going to help him increase his mental powers. she told him to concentrate on her inner self. she then passed through what appeared to be a solid concrete block.  she then instructed him to try. he was able to go only part way through and she had to pull him out. she told him to try again and the second time he was successful. she told him that he had mastered it faster than she did. she took back the medallion.\r\nshe next led him through a door that opened by sliding up. where he met a male et who was taller than the female and had \"native american cheek bones.\" the witness states that the male was holding back his emotions. there were windows in this part of the craft and he could see out into space. there were also controls of some type in this room. he could see through a window in the floor into an area with a machine which he believes was the teleportation device. the craft was a disk and the size of \"4 aircraft carries end-to-end.\"\r\nan old et entered and said it was time to leave. everyone became sad. he woke up in his bed neatly tucked in. no one had ever tucked him in before.\r\nwhen he was 8 years old, he saw the same type of craft and said that when it ascended, it was gone in the blink of an eye. he estimated the speed at '60,000 miles an hour.\" he stated that they have craft the size of small planets and the one that was recorded drawing plasma off our sun is one of them. the video is on youtube. \r\non one occasion, he was shown a vision in which he saw 4 disk shaped craft and hangars as if on a military base. there was a crowd of people who all appeared to be in a trance state walking into a craft. he pretended to be in a trance also and boarded with them. in side there was a bench on the wall and happy gray children sitting on it swinging their feet. several old ets approached him and asked him, \"do you want to come with us or stay here?\" he said he wanted to go with them and they were surprised. the vision ended.\r\nwhen he was 16 he had a vision of being taken to a beautiful planet where it was very bright but it did not hurt his eyes. he felt a powerful sense of peace. the houses appeared to be of adobe. there was one building that was made of bricks that looked something like a college. it had a tower reminiscent of big ben. he was told that this is where they receive knowledge and store things from other planets.\r\non another occasion, he remembers military doctors operating on his head. a reptilian male told them to stop because the boy was in pain.\r\nthe witness is 23 years old. he has celtic and native american (iroquois) ancestry. after his experience at age 5, he felt \"different.\" he has short term memory problems and states that he often feels that he is different ages, mostly older than his years. he has had chronic nose bleeds and his right nostril is difficult to breath through. he has a cousin who has had some experiences that were not gone into.","distance":"20 Feet or

morning. weather was clear and sunny and they were across the street from a fire station in fairview, nj. while walking back to his friends home noticed that the area was empty of cars and people when normally there would be \"50 to 100 people in the park.\" noticed rainbow colors out of the corner of his right eye rainbow colors. when he looked he saw a shining silver metallic saucer with round tinted windows. he alerted his two friends who also saw the craft. he heard and felt whirring/roaring and his shirt was flapping as if in \"a 50 mile an hour wind\" but there was no wind. they were paralyzed and could not run. they arrived back at his friend's home with no memory of walking there. witness discussed the incident with two friends (both now deceased) and they had no memory of being on the ship as he did. he recalls seeing them on \"operating tables\" but he was standing approximately 30 feet away. ship appeared larger inside than outside, possibly 400 feet across. about 25 creatures, approximately 4 feet tall were present with about 10 to 15 around him and the rest around his friends. the creatures were gray in color with large round heads and large black eyes. the creatures were touching him all over. they were speaking telepathically and were surprised when they realized that he could hear them. his mother had told him that there was psychic ability in their family but he had never really believed it. he asked why they were there. his impression was that they were friendly and curious and meant no harm. he believed that they were trying to help his two friends who both had heart problems and he believes that their lives may have been extended by the aid rendered on the craft. he remembers looking out the window and down onto the basketball court where they had been playing. he could see other beings moving about in long corridors. he remembers seeing the craft ascend after they had been returned. it moved up and to the right, then left, then up and away leaving a rainbow colored trail behind. when he returned to his home his mother said he seemed changed and he replied \"it's no big deal mom.\" before this report he had only confided this story to his two daughters because he did no believe that anyone would believe him.","distance":"20 Feet or

hovering over my car hood approximately several feet above it.  i thought at the time it was going to crash into me.  i saw it was a triangular shape silver (not shiney) in color and had blue and yellow lights around the triangular edge - the lights did not pulsate or move, there was absolutely no sound coming from it, no windows that i could see.  i never did stop, almost felt like time stood still.  when i looked up, it was gone.  there was no where it could have gone as left side of the road was a sheer drop-off and the right lane where i was driving, had huge trees.  i worried that it had crashed into the trees but could see no sign of it. shaken, i drove to work and another nurse said i was pale as a ghost and asked what was wrong.  i told her and encouraged me to call police,

leaving my house to walk my dog.  approaching my house was a squadron (5) apache helicopters. i pulled out my phone to snap a picture.  the phone was a lg g4 with high end optics.  as the choppers flew over my house i set the magnification to maximum as the aircraft were flying at approximately 1500-2000 feet and i wanted some good detail.  this process took longer than i thought and i was only able to catch the two choppers that are in this picture.  i thought cool, and went about my day.  later that evening i was showing the picture to my wife when i noticed something.  in front of the lead helicopter i saw some dots.  6 of them in what i believe is a near to far flight pattern.  when i magnified these even further with my phone i was unable to see any contrails or pixilated movement trails.  i didn't see them at all in real time so this leads me to believe they were hovering at a very high altitude over the yakima training center which is the direction the helicopters were going. this military complex is a well known hot spot for ufo activity.  any conventional aircraft would certainly be leaving contrails at that altitude as contrails are everywhere in the sky above yakima.  i took 3 more pictures of the same sky in the same weather to see if my camera had dirt or a flaw however there was nothing.  i don't know if these are actual ufo's or not but i would love to see this picture washed through a computer to try to clean it up and see what they really are.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":74711,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.64265035931388,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02232016-0150","longitude":-120.5994870822088,"occurred":1455977400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1456236566000,"summary":"My
