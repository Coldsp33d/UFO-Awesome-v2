tall swaying blinds. at first i didnt think much of it until only seconds later not only did i see another flash of light, this time the flash was red and seemed larger. thinking maybe there was an intruder inside the closed wooden gate of my backyard i quickly grabbed my silver .380 pistol from the floor near the couch and hurried to look thru the blinds. what i saw next changed my life and has affected me mentally until this day. as i stood at the sliding glass door looking across the parking lot maybe 60 feet away on the rooftop of the adjacent townhome directly in front of me was a perfectly round extremly bright orb which could have been approximately 5 to 6 feet in diameter. i couldn't help feeling as if i was being beckoned to come to the door with these flashes of light. after about 10 seconds or so of staring at the bright luminescent orb it had doubled in size and again changed color to yellowish green in a single flash of bright light. immediately following the flash there was what sounded like a large very loud hellicopter if one would have been directly above my house. at the same time the orb grew something that looked like a large praying mantis mixed with a snake flew out of the orb and straight up, i could see that it had what seemed like a long 3-4 ft tail as it exited what i can only describe as a \"portal\" and then the portal was gone. almost as quickly as it had exited this orb, the being flew directly toward me as now the loud sound was ear peircing and the being moved at an incomprehensible speed toward me, it took all of 2-3 seconds to cross the 60+ft of parking lot between the adjacent rooftop of the town home directly behind mine, over my wooden backyard fence where it came to a stop directly in front of me no more than two and a half feet, hovering about five feet off the ground. at this time the creature displayed no lights it was all black with what seemed like very strange symbols i had never seen before that went across its midsection (torso area). at first glimpse i could only describe this being as a bio-mechanical praying mantis mixed with a snake. it had a small head, long ringed neck but very large in-laid black eyes that extended beyond the sides of its head, which i saw last as i quickly and carfully looked it over from bottom to top, my jaw stood wide in awe. out of sheer terror and the close proximity it was to me, i immediately raised my weapon over my head and pressed it firmly against the glass of the sliding doors. almost as soon as i had made this motion the entity while still hovering in midair less than 3 feet away from me separated by only the glass of the patio door. the creature then extended from both sides what i can only describe as two sets of wing like appendages and emitted what looked like hundreds of tiny blue, sparkling lightning bolts in every direction, above and below each of the 4 \"appendages\" (i say appendages because if they were wings they didn't seem to be used for flight, just because of the sheer fact it did not use them after it exited the large orb like \"portal\" from which it had emerged and flew directly towards me, nor did it use them to hover in place) which seemed to encompass and engulf the being completely  (at this moment the loud helicopter, static like sound had stopped). each of these small blue lightning bolt like energy emissions were no larger than my pinky finger, after just a few short seconds of me witnessing these \"lightning bolt\" like electric emissions the entity shot directly up and over the roof of my home at an amazing speed out sight toward the front of the townhome. after much time and thought i've come to the conclusion that this entity did not spread the wing like appendages and emit the plasma like discharge until i brandished my weapon leading to me to believe that this display must have been some sort of protective energy field to shield itself had i fired upon it. although this entire encounter which started at about 4:45 a.M. and lasted no longer than 5-6min. or less. about 2min. after the being had disapeared out of view over my home i quicky ran to the back door less than about 3ft. away from where i stood and went outside. as i stood there staring into the sky i immediately realized that it had left almost the exact time of dawn because the sun was coming up. honestly i dont like giving this part of the account but at that moment i realized that what i thought to be only 5-6min. in reality, over an hour had passed because it was now dawn with the sun quickly rising and till this day, years later im still no closer to an answer of what this being could have been, what it wanted, why it beckoned me to the door with the light flashes, and most importantly what happened during that missing hour... (if anyone has had a similar experience and/or any further information that could help, it would be greatly appreciated.)\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s), Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":89687,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.85141763461398,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01202018-0006","longitude":-87.97357426773402,"occurred":1335156300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1516419611000,"summary":"Entity exited large glowing orb","tags":["sound","lights","flash","disc","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1516587947139,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":16,"maxtempi":60,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":10,"meantempi":50,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":16,"maxtempi":60,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":10,"meantempi":50,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":4,"mintempi":39,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"60181","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2097,"locationName":"Villa Park, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2403"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"San Francisco","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Every morning at daybreak 6:30ish, i leave my apartment, i looked up and saw a big huge face staring at me!. well it felt that way but in all honesty i think they were interested in city hall government building. they hover over government buildings and make evil faces. they have destroyed government buildings in antiquity, there are religious pictures depicting this. they are not all disk shape they come in a few different forms, boxy, multi craft hovering silent and perfectly still like they can orbit at building level. strange way to explain this but it's all true. every since i started writing about my home city they have been hovering over my home in front of city hall making faces and pictures. i discovered pixel data hidden within the clouds and even where none seem to be they are making art in color up in the sky, i discovered if i ran a special algorithm it produces real pictures bi color diamond pattern snakes. i know it is a lot to take in but this is going on now and i have pictures showing in more detail than i have seen on any youtube video.

square lights of indeterminate distance straight overhead. they flared twice, slowly, with a pure-white brilliance that lit up the whole yard, then vanished with the object stationary and silent. at 7am january 1, 2018, witness emerged from physical body, passed through wall of bedroom, and went nw about 200 feet, then turned and faced se. at that point, witness observed deep solid-blue craft of strongly rectangular shape (corners slightly rounded) descend from 45 degrees directly above mobile home. it descended smoothly and quietly, to stop and hover quite motionless about ten feet above ground, directly behind witness's bedroom. an opening appeared in bottom of craft, and a ramp was lowered to ground.  witness observed twin panels set into bottom of craft which could be possible sources of the lights observed on dec.31. three men in uniforms descended the ramp and came to ground.  each wore a different color uniform. there was a person whom i thought might be a mechanic, because his white uniform was fitted with pockets and loops all over, from which could be seen numerous tools/apparatus of  unfamiliar design. another man wore red, and the man that i thought might be the leader wore a uniform of the same blue as his craft.  if there were emblems or insignia, i didn't notice them, for once i approached to within several feet of the men, my eyes were captured by those of the man in blue, and i remained directly under his mental control for the remainder of the experience.  all three men had golden hair, worn somewhat short but not severe.  the leader's hair was very curly.  his eyes were a sort of purple-violet, and the pupils were not really round: somewhere between round and diamond-shaped. they stood tall and muscular.  under the leader's control, i nonetheless went willing up into their craft.  the inside was compact but not cramped, filled with screens, especially. i saw very little in the way of controls, but the screens responded to touch and also to direct mind control. i was seated facing the leader, and he never broke eye contact. he was very kind and intuitive: i think that he knew me better than i know myself.  his voice was strong and colorful, but i heard it only in my mind. i spoke back in the same manner. we rose up in the sky, but stayed withing a few hundred feet of the ground. i could see the ground clearly below: even the floor could be made transparent, or perhaps it doubled as another viewing screen. we traveled in a circle above three of the neighboring roads, for perhaps a half-hour.  the entire time, we spoke telepathically.  i had endless questions, and the answers were often slow and careful. much was told to me, but i can no longer remember anything except: \"does your craft utilize antigravity?\" he replied, \"that is what you call it. we have the ability to attract and repel numerous all-pervasive forces.\" there was always a language barrier, because they were literally ages more advanced than anything i can imagine.  all too soon, i was returned, and they departed.  i felt they would be back.  the next day, my body suddenly began to reject a synthetic opioid prescription that i had taken for almost nine years, following a head-on collision that put me in the hospital for a month. the withdrawal from this medicine is unbelievably horrible: i've never been so sick.  but my mind is emerging from a drugged haze, and perhaps that is the point: maybe those visitors knew what i didn't. or maybe just a coincidence? perhaps.  but it feels like they are here to help us out - if we are willing to be helped.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

mo. i watch your youtube programs regularly and have a great appreciation for you and others that bring to light the things that happen to people who have no one, usually, who wants to hear what they have to say about \"strange\" occourences in their lives.\r\n\r\ni have had several things happen that are hard to explain but one of the strangest happened in april of 2016. as i do fairly often, i started out the back door with a cup of coffee to enjoy on the patio. i observed the sky that it was fairly overcast with billowly, light and dark grey clouds and then i saw something that caught my eye and could hardly believe what i was seeing. there in the front area of one of the clouds was an etching which was done in 3-d and not just a drawing. the picture remained on the cloud for another 20 minutes as i looked at it in amazement. there was no action around the picture as long as i watched it but after the 20 minutes it slowly started to go away and the cloud became just another cloud in the sky.\r\n\r\nat this time i didn't have a camera that i could take a picture of the design with so i watched the news fully expecting to see the cloud on the news or in the news paper but it never showed up. i tried to make a rough drawing of the design but i am not an artist so my best efforts do it no justice. \r\n\r\nthe design was huge and just for a clue, the best i could guess, it was at least as large as a football field and the design was perfectly drawn and it had a nice border all the way around it. it was oval in shape, not square or round.\r\n\r\nhas anyone else ever came to you with anything like this, ever? if i could get someone to draw the design for me i would be glad to send the drawing but the people i know who could do the drawing show no interest in doing it so as of yet i still only have my rough draft.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

scared so i started the car and hit the gas heading into town where the local sheriff ran a drive-in restaurant. i believe he was called 'woody' and the restaurant was called the 'tinker tot'. it's still there but closed for decades. we told the sheriff what had happened and another couple came up to us and stated that they had seen it rise from a swamp a little earlier while they were parked off the road. we all raced back to the sighting spot and found that it had moved north up the road were the road took a sharp turn left (west) the object was hovering again near a farm. at that time i counted 16 people observing it (most were kids). one person went into a farmer's house to call the air force and said the farmer and family were frantic. i remember the names of some of the kids but several have passed away by now. i'm 74 years old and should have reported it a long time ago. the incident was reported in the ladysmith news and they asked what we were doing out by the

denver, colorado, i witnessed 6 bright lights hovering in formation approx. above denver intl. airport. i noticed the lights on my approach to the interstate but wrote them off as stars. i lost sight of them as i passed through the area of town closest to the freeway but as i merged onto i-25 regained visual and realized they were not stars. i then assumed them to be landing lights of approaching aircraft, fairly common sight but normally in low visibility which was not an issue this night. i quickly realized this was not the case either as these objects were stationary. they were formed in 2 triangle formations of 3 each, separated by 2-5 miles.  i drove south for approx. 5-7 mins. and observed no motion. after about 6 miles and watching the whole time i exited the freeway and proceeded to a secluded park & ride lot to watch and get some video. as i parked i noticed that 2 of the lights were no longer visible, 1 from each side so now 2 sets of 2 but still motionless and holding formation. as i started filming i noticed another object, smaller with a different appearance, that seemed to be moving slowly between the other lights. this one appeared much dimmer white light but seemed to pulsate. after watching for a minute it seemed to have another light of a green color inside of it that appeared to be spinning. that's the best i can describe it. i documented about 3 minutes of this and observed what i assumed fighter jets inbound from the west, high speed and elevation, at which point i honestly believed that something big was happening and decided i needed to get home to my family. of course, i regret not getting more video but having had a previous encounter and with the location of the event, i firmly believed this situation would escalate, to what degree i didn't know and felt i needed to reach my family. i returned to the freeway and headed south while still observing the event which was now due east when the lights started to vanish and reappear for a short time. i then watched what had been one of the stationary lights start moving, change radiance and take on the pulsing appearance. it traveled slowly to the sw for a short time before abruptly turning due north, opposite my direction of travel, essentially coming straight at me but continuing it's same, slow speed. this is how i confirmed it not to be any commercial aircraft, far too slow. also, it's movement was very smooth, fluid, no degree of erratic movement of any kind. it continued on its northbound path and when at about my 11 o'clock position i attempted to catch more video, which i did but of low quality. it passed over and to my left where i could now see a shape with randomly flashing red and green lights from the bottom side of a square within another square. the lights flashed from center outwards, red front to rear and green to the sides, without rhythm. i'd estimate it's elevation at 1,000 to 2,000 feet at a speed of 100-150mph max, and absent of sound. if one hadn't been watching it it would easily have been dismissed as some common aircraft, i.E. helicopter, smaller plane, and wouldn't have drawn much attention. i watched as long as i could and it continued north, out of sight. by this time i was into the city and couldn't see the remaining lights and by the time i got to where i could see the airport again, all appeared normal again. this all took place over a span of approx. 30 to 40 minutes starting around 11:00pm on a november night in 2016. apologies for the poor video.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
