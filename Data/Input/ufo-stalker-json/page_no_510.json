later when we were outside at the tub, she was pointing to a 13 ft wall!! my wife, who was 60 yaers old at the time described a long bullet shaped object very dark and no lights or features, the sky around the object \"wobbled\" \"like the wake from a boat\" or \"when heat makes the road appear to wobble\" my grandaughter saw something else, she saw the craft as \"goldie, brownie, black\" object and it \"sparkled everywhere, then was gone\" she turned to my wife and asked to go inside because she was frightened. when they came inside i asked my grandaughter what shape the object was and she pointed to our tall surround sound black cylinder tv speakers \"it was that shape\" she said. i asked her to draw me a picture and she included the sparkles, which appeared everywhere over the hull of the craft an instant before the craft disappeared. these sparkles were not bright, my wife's sixty year old eye's did not notice them, \"they were tiny gold sparkles\" said my grandaughter. we live on

of the house to get something from the car when the bright light caught my eye. it was moving very slow, 15 to 30 mph. over the ocean about 8th of a mile off the pismo beach pier. i had seen it before, so i called out to my neighbor to come out and look. he's some kind of expert on aircraft, and is a retired pilot. \r\n    \"i've seen it before\", i told him. \"about the same time, two or three times a week\". \r\n     we watched it and listened intently for any engine noise that could identify it. we were startled to hear none, considering how low it was.         \r\n     with his little binoculars. he looked at the craft while i ran about 20 feet to grab my new nikon 16x50 binoculars. they were already focused when i first laid eyes on it over the pier. the pier is 2 miles north of my location. \r\n     at first i thought i was out of focus, because all i could see was a super bright round sparkly orb. i checked my bino's very carefully and rest them on the rail of my deck to get a perfect still view. i drop to my knees to stabilize even more. \r\n     it appeared to change shape and morph into three landing lights. my neighbor, bobby, says, \"what the hell is it?\". i said it looked like a privet jet.   \r\n     then i saw the red and green, port and starboard flashing wing tip markers and had a good full stable view of the craft that looked like a privet jet.\r\n     as we watched it fly directly over my domicile, we were both totally confounded at how an aircraft of such design could possibly remain airborne flying that slow, 25 to 30mph, and that low, about 800ft with out a sound. \r\n     i suspect this sighting may be some kind new man made technology, only because of the regulation style marker lights. the landing lights on the leading edge of the wings had lit the fuselage which enabled me to see it was a dull battle ship gray color, with no visible id markings. \r\n     it could be a military drone. but still a ufo.

far away. we all was in so much shock it scared us a little. i just thought it was a shooting star when i first saw it but it was coming down too slowly to be one, it didn't make no noise at all for it to be an aeroplane or helecopter. it was flashing all colours on the outside and you could see the spinning of the object. i was absoluty shocked to what i saw. i lost sight of it because it went and landed behind the trees. as we started walking back down the lane there were lasers getting shone on us all the time on the way home and car lights appearing from no where but no cars in sight or even being there. it was such a frightening experience but i now know there is something out there for sure.","distance":"101-500

father, 2 sisters and a baby brother that was a year old at the time. we were sitting, my mother, father and i in the living room, little brother a sleep in bedroom. my father was first to notice lights coming in thru the window. he stood up and said the police must be out side and said did we hear any one pull in the drive way has he was beginning to look out the window. he turned and said it was some thing in the sky hovering over the house. he went out the front door with me and mom following. at that time staying in the yard in front of the porch. i saw it. a round like craft with light pulsating going around it. it gave off a glow from the lights. it also had 3 white lights underneath. one on either side and 1 in the middle. it appeared to be about 15 to 20 feet wide and about 10 to 12 feet thick. because of the glow from the pulsating lights. i could see a clear outline of the craft. it seem to have a small dome on top. i didn't see that it had any windows and it make no sounds at all. we got about a 10 sec look at it before it hovered up in to the air and then, in a blink of an eye. it shot straight up, like a shooting star. now we could still see it when it stoped but it just looked like a star in the sky, but then another shot in from across the sky from the sw and stoped beside the one we had saw over the house, then another from the same direction has the first, se and stoped at the other 2. while we were watching this my sister and cousin pulled in bringing my sisters home and by this time my other sister at come out of her bedroom and joined us watching what i would call orbs. i hadn't noticed when the first 3 but has more came in. i noticed they were lining up next to each other making pyramid shapes, 3 orbs for each pyramid. my mother had to go in at these time to be with my little brother so dad and my sisters followed him in and my cousin left, but they had seen the orbs too but done would talk about it to people out of fear from being called crazy. i stayed out until about 4 in the morning watching these things. i did get to see 2 more a little closer has they where coming in but not has close has the first one. there had to have been almost from 100 to 200   of them. straight up from over our house but way up there. they had came in from all direction thru out the night and lined up in pyramid shapes. they weren't like perfect rows either. some rolls had more pyramids and there were 5 rolls with 7 to 10 in each roll and they didn't like make a pyramid and then make another beside it, more like when one came in it may have joined to fill a pyramid toward the middle of the roll, then another one would come in and join by itself, then later on another one would join it, it was like each orb had to line up with certain other orbs to make the pyramid. they came in like that and left like that to, but when they left. they shot away, like a shooting star. i didn't see any shot back down like toward the earth tho, they shot out into space, but coming in, some came front the ground some where and others from space, but they all left shooting out into space. i am sharing this in case some one else has seen some thing like it or that maybe some one has seen some thing else and by me telling this it helps them in some way. this was the only time i'd ever seen any thing like this and will never forget it. i doubt my family talking about it. my mother doesn't even like talking about it with me. i come from a long line of christians. to a christian these things are either demons or angels. i wish i could have videoed it, but we had no recorder and had no film for the camera, back then my parents only bought film when they knew they were going to take pictures.

( my road is a dirt road only 3 permanent residents on the street the rest are cabins mostly unoccupied, lined densely with trees on either side)as i'm watching the light it is still blinking but now it is not all over the place it is following the exact center of the street. i remember the whole time i was struggling to figure out what the light was attached to as i could not see any type of structure it just seemed like a ball of light. i watch it continue slowly down the center of the road probably a couple hundred feet until it reached the stop sign where there is a paved road with a street light. when it reached the street light it was gone. i waited for maybe 10 more minutes for it to come back but i could no longer see it. after this i remember just thinking where did it go ? then i simply laid back in bed and went to sleep. i don't think i mentioned it to my parents until several years later. actually i think i told them after my dad had told me he woke up in the middle of the night to the master bathroom completely illuminated which at first he thought car headlights, but then realized the only two windows are a skylight and a window 8ft from the ground facing to the right which is facing another houses wall. oddly he just went back to bed.","distance":"20 Feet or

star so we waited outside viewing the star sky, after about 5 minutes we saw a plane crossing the sky navigation lights clearly visible crossing west to east.As the plane was going east we saw another object going in the opposite direction almost straight past the plane glowing white with no navigation lights i thought this quite strange thinking this was a plane. within a minute i knew this was not the case the object after having past the plane made what i can only describe as a u turn immediate and almost instantly and began to follow, the turn is like nothing i have ever seen before, this tracked the plane until it disappeared into the distance. my daughter was only 5 at the time but saw exactly what i saw she was supprised that a plane could turn so fast!!!! .I have seen more before

travelling across the sky from left to right.  as the object was emitting no light and making no sound i originally assumed that it was simply a night bird such as an owl flying relatively close to the ground.  however after watching the object curiously for a few seconds it suddenly and rapidly changed direction and made a sharp left turn, advancing rapidly.  it then made an equally sharp right turn straight after this and once again accelerated forwards rapidly once the turn was complete.  i knew then that this could not have been a bird as i have never seen any bird make such rapid turns and accelerate so quickly and effortlessly in my life.  there are planes that often fly over my house to the local airport however these are easily recognisable as planes due to their lights and the sound of the engines, the same goes for any helicopters that fly over.  these facts make me firmly believe that this object was genuinely a ufo. this was my immediate reaction when i saw the object make such seemingly impossible manoeuvres in the sky.  i lost sight of the object after 25-30 seconds as it simply seemed to disappear.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

quarter of a mile to the other shore directly across from the deck we were standing on which was maybe 10 feet from the shore. so we were just standing there smoking and talking when we both noticed an unnaturally bright and large star that seemed to not be there a few seconds before.(it appeared to be in the far distance beyond and above the trees in the sky) we both at the same time said \"wow look how bright that star is ...\" and i said \"why is it so big it looks weird\" so probably 30 seconds of watching this bright star then all of the sudden its getting brighter and larger, as if its moving towards us at an extremely high rate of speed because now its as if its actually over the water, but it was hard to tell exactly how high in the sky because of how bright it was, but if i had to make an estimate i would say less than 100ft. then it just kind of hovers over the water for a couple seconds and there was a bright flash and shoots to the left and it was just gone. now we both looked at each other and said \"did you see that!\" afterwards my boyfriend just was indifferent but i thought it was really really strange. i was like wanting to just keep talking about it. i immediately told my parents about what we saw and my mom told me that her and my dad have been frequently seeing strange white lights over the lake. so i probably would have dismissed it had she not

separate witnesses.\r\n\r\nsometime in october/november 2015, i was discussing ufos with a co-worker. he told me he had observed some fireballs in the local area where he lived. i didn't think much of it at the time.\r\n\r\n1st personal sighting - in early january 2016, i observed a red/orange/yellow orb outside my house while walking across my front lawn. it was between the hours of 7pm - 8pm. it was traveling from southwest to northeast in a straight line. it made no noise and i estimate its height to be 2,500 ft. i lost sight of it as it disappeared into the dark horizon sky.\r\n\r\n2nd personal sighting - approximately 1 week later at roughly the same time as before, i was leaving my home. i was on my front porch and looked up. again, i saw the exact same object; however, this time it was traveling for northwest to southeast. i yelled out to my wife to come see this object but by the time she arrived it had disappeared into the night horizon sky. also the neighbor's roof obstructed the view.\r\n\r\n3rd personal sighting - again a 3rd time, i observed the same object but this time it was my place of work. i work at a local airport so i can narrow the time down. it was very close to between the hours of 4:00am - 4:15am. the exact same object was travelling in a northwest to southeast direction at roughly the same altitude as the previous 2 observations; 2,500 - 5,000 ft. i got a good long look at this object because i was walking through a pretty much empty parking lot. \r\n\r\ni would say roughly 30 - 45 seconds after this object passed almost overhead, a twin engine jet along the exact same flight path and very similar altitude flew over. it is my belief this jet was chasing the object. i could hear the jet, whereas, all 3 times the object was silent. this jet appeared to be a 737 or airbus 319/320; i could see both jet engines mounted underneath the wings on either side of the fuselage. i could not identify if was a commercial aircraft or military because it was almost directly overhead. also, this jet did not have it's landing lights on and if i remember correctly no navigation lights. the light pollution from this area is pretty bad but i could still and hear the twin engine jet.\r\n\r\nif i receive a follow up from mufon regarding my 3rd observation, i will give more details on why i believe the jet was chasing the object and not a routine commercial/military flight. \r\n\r\nin mid february 2016, i ran into my co-worker whom i previously chatted regarding his multiple sightings of fireballs. i relayed my 3 personal observations to him and much to my surprise, he indicated my sightings seemed identical to his. when he originally told me about the fireballs, i was thinking there was a trail of fire and/or smoke behind but that was not the case. we both saw a red/orange/yellow colored round object travelling across the night sky that didn't make any noise. \r\n\r\nmy co-worker also forwarded to me a video he made of one such sighting of this object. the object in his video is much larger than all 3 of my sightings and brighter. also the object is much lower to the horizon than in my own 3 observations. he told me the

i was racing faster through a field when a very disturbing loud screeching noise hovered above me. a flashlight came down surrounding me. i was paralized looking down at the grass. it faded to black as i passed out.\r\n\r\nwhen i woke im not dumb as i knew i was in a metal room with strange built in luminating lighting in the ceiling. i did realize a presence and a deep telekinetic voice entered my head saying how surprised they are to learn that im able to withstand the amount of pressure surrounding me whilst moving at great speed through space.\r\n\r\nanyway he assured me no harm and said no we do not eat your kind as we dont have mouths, only eyes and nostrils. he told me it is safe to get up and stand. oh boy it was like being on the gravatron machine or even pluto. i had to heave my body to my side and force myself off the unit bed to stand up. you can look at me he said and said it will take time to walk properly and then i looked and for the very first time in this lifetime, i observed a tall creature man. most definately scary but assured me again there is no danger and that he already knew i had a 1001 questions including god.He was so skinny-thin with long arms and two and a half fingers. two small nostrils almost built in with no mouth\r\n\r\nhe said to follow him towards the captains room,but not to touch the walls like star trek and there was another they are the same. anyway to cut a two year journey short it was so amazing and they taught me so much on our endeavor throughout a colorful and full of light journey with\r\nplaces in space and other areas with planets and landing spots. i learned to drive but not land or take off at least i was privileged to navigate through space at a speed and directions too fast to understand. and i earned my stay as a worthy friend and operator.\r\n\r\ncoming home:\r\non my return i never forgot that day my good friends and only family companions said it would be sad how they can not interfere with the nature of human relations as i was lucky.\r\nwe landed and i did not want to leave them but that was my gift from them plus i was kinda homesick. i walked through the door so happy very very happy to see my family and you know what? they were looking like they saw a ghost i was wondering what they were looking at? then there was silence...And they all started at the same time is it you? is that really you? we thought you were dead! \r\n\r\n. okay now that sideways look.\r\n\r\nthey found it very extremely hard believe me but you know what i found to be extremely harder?\r\n\r\nthey said i was gone for a long time\r\nyes i was presumed long gone\r\nand you know what i mean?\r\n\r\nokay thats my touch base story with you all and now i really need a coffee. i dont have much to go by but i am a good sketcher it helps me remember.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then
