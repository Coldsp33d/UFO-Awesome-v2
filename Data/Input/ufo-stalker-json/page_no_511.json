that object was hallowing in up and giving some weird lights from up. it also showed some blinking spot-lights.* the object gave hunnering sound. it was steady going. it was large and path stationery. many people were seeing that object on the road. first time my father have seen that object and then he have informed me. i was just shocked to see that freak object. that object was freaking downside. it was a shocking site means it was a shocking event. it was close to us. but was very far. it hallowed us means it surprised us. it was a great event that i saw in the city. my father and all were just shocked to see that freak object. it was light, means it was a full of lights object that it was looking of heavy and many lights. there were two major light. it was a very big object and it also moved here & there during its sighting. it was just very ground to the earth. we all were shocked very immediately when we just saw that huge object. first we just  thought that it was an fake object but then i just thinked upon that really it may be fake or not? it was not a fake as per my thinking because as per me that object was not fake because i just observed that particular object very carefully and i really found that no!  no! it was  not fake! it is real! and it can't be fake! i believed that it was just a real event and very true phenomenon. it is my believance. my father just ignored that it was fake and also all the members present in our car also concluded that it was fake. but no!!!!!!! it was just a real freaky object. it was just very very true. and it can't be ignored...... its my thinking and my opinion and my thought that it is real... after sighting that event, i was completely buzzed, means i was in a very surprising mode. i was shocked eventually! it was a very big object. it was just completely vast. it was dark and dull. and made some noisy annoying sound. it gave a humming sound. it was a vastly freak phenomena with that vast object which gave a fully freaky sighting on that event! it was very shocking to watch that sighting phenomena which happened this date. it was also a very good experience to remember in my life. it was completely true event. it was just really not a fake sighting. it was really a genual and a very true sighting of an ufo phenomenon.* !!~  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500

i was lying in our living room at around 12 noon i noticed from our glass window a single flying object in the blue sky. the object is silvery white elongated and looks like an airplane far above. as i watch i’m a little bit wondering because in our province plane does not usually pass and extremely rare as there is no airport nearby. i estimated that the height level of the object is for jet plane, however this “jet plane” does not have smoke trail. jet planes sighting is the more common occurrence in our place. my curiosity is more heightened when i noticed that it barely moves, planes or jet planes can be out of sight in seconds or few minutes. but this object is already over 5 minutes in my line of sight and still there. \r\ni called my 8 year old son to show it, but my son is playing and it takes another few minutes before he came out. when he came out i show him the direction of the object. he’s having difficulty in seeing it so i stand up and open our glass sliding door to show it better.\r\nbut to my amazement the object is not alone but trailing it are more flying objects vertically spread that when i counted there are at least twenty five (25) similar flying objects. i’m already so excited at this moment that i called my son’s nanny and also some workers in my neighbour and they too see the flying objects. similar to the first one all the flying object are just slowly moving (right to left) like in a squadron formation. then they are almost stationary in front of me above. i watch it continuously thinking that maybe they would scatter in different directions. but they just all fade away farther more in the sky.\r\ni have taken a video in my phone camera, but the small object is not visible when i replay.\r\nafter a few minutes of disappearance, clouds suddenly covered the blue sky then began to rain and few minutes the blue sky is back. i thought maybe their cover is a bit late.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

outside to do one of the messier experiments. it was about 3:30 when i looked up towards the sky and saw something flying towards our direction. my husband was outside with us and i told them to look at it. i asked him what it was and he was as lost as i was. it looked almost \"n\" shaped and a copper color but it would shift from side to side and the color and shape would change. it was almost like the sun would hit it and the color would change. we walked to the side of the yard to see it better but it started going higher and faster and that is when we noticed two more  objects in the sky only they were spaced out from the first one and farther away and looked like metallic balls. we tried to get pictures but even with the camera on action shot the photo's were impossible to get. there was no sound from anything around us, including the objects, there were a few birds but as the object got close to them the birds would scatter. they flew straight for a few minutes but started to climb and just vanished. the first one we saw, which was the closest to us, flew about 20 to 30 feet above the power lines but with the way it was moving, it was hard to get an exact color and shape. after they disappeared we just stood there for a minute asking each other what we just saw, neither of us could define to the other what the objects were, we were at a loss. the objects had no set color, other than metallic because they seemed to shine, they had no flight pattern, they left no trails, they didn't make a sound, the birds flew from them and then they climbed and just disappeared. we are still curious as to what we saw, it was a very confusing 4 minutes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

the morning of february 20th. heard some noises that sounded like someone walking around on the hard snow outside. we looked out his balcony window and noticed movement in the treeline on the back of the property. it was around 3:30am. we watched for about 15-20 minutes and we assumed it was just an animal so we waited to see if it was a deer, fox etc. the figure was about 75-100 yards away. we couldnt identify what kind of animal it was and we closed the blinds and went back to watching tv. moments later we heard more noises and when we looked outside again there were several figures slowly moving around. we couldnt tell exactly how many were there or exactly what they were doing. we got a flashlight and shined it at the figures and thats when we saw that they were approximately 4-5 feet tall and all appeared to be the same size and they were walking around on two legs. it was very dark and far enough away that we honestly couldn't make out faces or clothing or anything. we thought the figures could be kids messing around or something so we went out with his dog to see what was going on. by the time we walked through his house and down his stairs and got outside the figures were nowhere to be seen. his dog was acting very weird and when we went over to the area where the \"people\" were walking around there were no tracks or any signs of movement in the snow. we both assured ourselves that we were not crazy and that we both definitely seen something out there. we went back inside and within minutes starting hearing strange noises outside again. we opened his curtains and sure as shit there was figures walking around again in the same area. the dog was acting very weird and putting her tail between her legs and whining. i shined the flashlight at the area and yelled \"what do you want.\" no noise or response was heard. we then heard noises on the side of the house. we were standing right next to each other and we shined the flashlight in the tree beside his house and there was a creature with a large head in the tree looking out towards the figures moving around in the treeline. the creature turned his head toward us and looked directly at us. it had an unusually large head and eyes. the level of fear that came over me was unlike anything i have ever felt in my life. i have goosebumps covering my body this moment thinking about it. we both were scared half to death. we closed the curtains and when we finally regained the courage to open them again minutes later the creature in the tree was gone and the figures in the distance were also gone. between the weird stuff that was happening in the area recently and what we saw in that tree, and the lights that were above the area when i left hours later i am convinced that what we witnessed was either not from this world or proof to me that demons actually exist. i have had a weird intermittent ringing in my ear ever since that night. he contacted me last night and said that he was having electrical interference issues. we believe we had a close encounter with entities not from our everyday world. i know what we saw the other night  was real and nobody can convince me otherwise no matter how crazy it sounds. my brother asked me if we were drunk or on some sort of drugs and i told him we were both stone cold sober and he just laughed it off. i really dont care if anyone believes us or if they think we are crazy because the level of fear i had that night and still get from thinking about it assures me it was real. i just thought someone else would be interested in our experience or could maybe explain to us what they were or could be","distance":"101-500

the window. we were about 12 years old at that time. but there's still no reasen to have doubt about what i say. i woke my friend up to show him what i saw outside. so my friend saw the object as well. the object was quiet far away, i guess, but it still seemed giant. it was about as big as the full moon. it was a cloudy night, so the object must have been extremely bright. it was clearly behind the clouds. when i first niticed the object i emidiately thought i was seeing an ufo, i hat no idea what it could be. we watched the objekt moving back and forth from w to e for about 10 minutes. than it suddenly flew away extremly fast (seemed like light velocity, as known from movies) towarts south, right across our heats. during the sighting my friend and me wondered wheather we should try to take a video but it was night and all we had at that time was a nintendo ds camara which had quiet bad quality. on the one hand we were a bit scared eventhough there was no evidence of attacs or so. on the other hand we were curious. we wanted to fnd out what we saw. we still talk about that incident often and we're still sure that we did not see an airplane or anything like that. there were no position lights, it was not moving like any known terrestrial aircraft, it was only oval, bright (not flashing) and giant. please excuse me for spelling or grammar mistakes. as you know

that it now had a red light on top and i heard a whirring noise.  i assumed it was a drone toy of some sort, but it happened so fast that i could not determine the actual size and distance of the

(as we saw a similar event happen in nc (near monroe)back in 2008 that she witnessed with me. she then confides that she saw something similar about 3- months ago. then again about 3- nights ago. now this. so she is now a bit more concerned of what it could be and what is going on. she is surrounded by military and definitely knows what those aircraft look and sound like. this was not an aircraft she is familiar with. considering it also had no sounds!  she wanted me to report it as she is worried about her military connection. however she is willing to talk to someone.\r\nher phone number is (386)-299-5518 and please be discreet as she is a little hesitant for above said reasons. though... we both feel these occurrences need reported and investigated. we are wondering if anyone else reported it. it seems many, many, observed it but are too reluctant to report it. also, because of their military connections. \r\nwe are fans of james fox and his work at mufon so we are hoping it is taken seriously.  thank you for your time, and listening. &#128515; \r\n (daughter's name is chelsey)","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":74647,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":21.4356324,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212016-0006","longitude":-157.7549783,"occurred":1455840000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hawaii","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1456044258000,"summary":"Huge light over oahu marine base.  it brightened and dimmed and moved around. all cell phones went to static and the entire island lost all power. then she witnessed planes scatter appearing to be military.
