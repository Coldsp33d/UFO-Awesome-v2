than a minute when i saw a green light illuminating my room and the room outside my door. i sat up and looked out the window and witnessed a green orb decending from above the housd to the second floor window adjacent to me. i could hear what sounded like large gears rotating even though the window and wall. the orb then entered through the window affecting nothing physically. the sound of rotating gears was quite loud at this point and i had been watching it move from behind what served as a temporary door. the orb moved half way into the room before i got up to approach it and had been no more than 10 feet from where i was standing. i slowly and quietly began to approach the door because i had wanted to see it up close and personal, touch it if possible. yet when i got to the door and tried to go out the orb moved at incredible speed back through the window as if it were not even there and accended rapidly into the sky and out of sight. this event was not ball lightning yet i do not particularly expect anyone to believe me. this orb however expressed awareness and inteligence and when it knew i had been aware of it. it flew away. this is not my first experience and i am sure it will not be my last.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with

greater than 1 mile from where we stood. \r\n\r\nmy wife and i were soon joined by two other couples who stopped to watch with us. one woman mentioned that they looked like balloons. but, again, these orbs moved very swiftly -- faster than the airplanes you see in the distant sky. they looked similar to the ufo orbs i have seen in videos on the internet and on the news. they had no contrail and were noiseless. they did not make any erratic turns or movements, nor did they appear to vanish or \"blink\" away. they simply continued on, moving steadily northeast, until the naked eye could no longer observe them. their direction of travel was uniform, although it did appear that some of the orbs moved toward each other while others moved apart.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting i felt excited and curious, a rush of elation. i wanted to see more, i wanted them to descend -- but it was not to be. this is my second sighting, the first being in 2007 also in brooklyn. on this occasion the orbs were much closer, glowed orange and blue, and followed a nonlinear flight trajectory.  \r\n\r\n ","distance":"Over One

and school. \r\n\r\n2.Something to my right just so happened to catch my eye. \r\n\r\n3. wtf is that??????? is that flames around it? awfully round for an aircraft.\r\n\r\n4. round, solid black, heading west, was to my right and in front, it was maintaining a steady speed in excess of 75 (which is what i was doing), appeared to have some kind a orangish/blue ring around it, similar to what would be in a blacksmiths forge. its course seemed to be heading west, true and straight, no vertical or lateral motion. \r\n\r\n5. feelings were mixed, still is. was tired from work and aggravated because of school at the time, wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me. even now, feelings are still mixed, since i don't normally believe in flying saucers, but by definition what i saw was a ufo. \r\n\r\n6. lost sight when road dipped, and object went behind the line of trees on my right. never did regain visual contact since the area i was coming up on is very well wooded.
