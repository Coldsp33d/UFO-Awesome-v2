thought they were from a hiker drawing with a stick or a motorcycle spinning out in a circle, until i realized the markings were clearly impressions in the soil.  i do not know if they were there on my way up or not and can not say if the markings were minutes or a day old. they were fresh enough to notice clearly however.\r\n\r\ni first noticed a small curved line about 12 inches. it was the deepest mark that had cleared all surface gravel away.  i then noticed the large circle about 40 inches in diameter which was the one that convinced me it was an impression from a very heavy object.  after a few minutes i found the other smaller circles.  i searched for a logical 3rd smaller circle but could not find one in the area most likely.  the depressions were positioned in the only way possible due the the adjacent hillsides and spanned about 12-14 feet long and across the road.  coincidentally in the center of two of the circles, were weeds that had been flattened in exactly the same direction. there was also no evidence of thrust or forced air disturbance from a take off visible on the dirt surface of the road.  i studied the site for at least 20 minutes before resuming my hike, but my gut reaction was, i was convinced it was not a landing pattern from any man made craft or drone. i did not have a camera and i was unable to return before rain surely washed it away. it has remained heavily on my mind.\r\n\r\nthis fire road has been closed to vehicle traffic for at least 2 years due to a wild fire and washed out road at the trailhead. only motorcycles and hikers can reach the area.  i had hiked here a few times recently over two weeks and the same set of motorcycle tracks has remained in that time.  i very rarely ever encounter anyone on the trail and i am usually hiking for about 5 hours.\r\n\r\ni am a person who has never doubted existence of other life in the universe and this has served as personal confirmation of it.  i will be hiking there again soon and i will be paying even closer attention.\r\n\r\ni am posting to see if anyone else has ever seen this particular landing gear pattern?","distance":"20 Feet or

there almost two years ago when our old spa died). the first one i noticed was located wsw, a second almost due south, a third one towards the east and many more at all points. i looked around then and noticed there were more than 1 ine different locations, some more prominent than others. they looked like a mix of blinking lights on airplanes and the way saturn looks when close only they were brighter and more distinct. if it turned so you could see what ii took to be the front it was one bright white light. i couldn't tell their distance although they looked closer at times.\r\n we sat in the spa 4-5 nights that week and i saw them every time. i decided to look for them every night and noticed they didn't really show until late at night and would fade as it started getting light. then the more i looked at/for them i noticed some of them were dark and almost impossible to see. when i looked through the screen on my tablet while taking photos there were many sparkling lights all around which i didn't see with my naked eye. the ones i could see the lights of looked like a slow moving ball of mercury with black craters/shadows all through it when i looked through our small binoculars.\r\n a couple weeks in i decided to ask \"them\" a question and wrote out: why are you here\" as one word per screen and caught the one in the south just before it started to fade around dawn. i shown a flash light to get it's attention then scrolled through the question, it seemed to come closer. i then noticed the one to the east was still visible so showed the question to it. i walked beside my mother-in-laws house to get out of the shadows which should have blocked the first one from my sight yet it \"flew\" to were it could still see me and seemed to move beside me until when i stopped it was next to the other. so instead of the two being say 45 degrees apart they were more like 10 degrees apart. they also stayed visible further past dawn than before.\r\n after that it seemed when i went out at night they'd move in closer. even ones that were so far away i couldn't see them would come in. not much later i started seeing \"people\" on our property. the animals acted as if they saw them as well, yet when i'd head their direction they'd be gone. i'd ask my husband if he could see the lights or \"people\" and he'd always say he couldn't and showed absolutely no interest which seemed odd to me. he's the kind of person that doesn't like too many people coming over and can't stand it at all if he doesn't know them so trespassers should have made him angry.\r\n i started noticing things had been changed in the house. not just things being moved but actual architectural changes. paint splatter dried to the bottom of the bath tub and last time any painting had been done was about 6 months earlier. the paneling in the living room was just barely held up with very few nails so you could actually pull it out quite far. made me suspicious so i told my husband and he said i was crazy. i forgot to look at the outside wall until a couple days later and found it had been screwed back down caulked and painted in hopes no one would notice. many random things like that. then i realized every time i told my husband something i'd noticed it wouldn't be like that the next day. i realized my husband must be part of it and saw he was different as well.\r\n it was around then (about a few weeks ago) i noticed many of the lights seemed to be on the ground at different points seemingly circling our property and if i went out at night they'd start coming closer. i really thought i was losing it because they'd seem just as distant but at the same time i could see them and the only thing i can figure is some kind of astral projection. the have

changing position. it stayed at the same altitude. it would come in with one to two bright white lights which appeared to be part of a reflective surface. more red lights would be added in a straight row ranging from six to around ten lights, mostly red. they would fade out, disappear for awhile then reappear at different positions sometimes with different intensities. the lights were straddling or positioning from left and right of a radio tower in the immediate foreground.\r\nupon reappearing one time with lights numbering eight to ten light ejected one upward and to the right(east) of the array.\r\na tree in the foreground was between me and the tower bracketing the lights.\r\ni was on a porch across the street from the tree and the tower. i had the impression this object was large and far away.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i were waiting on a porch at the door to be let in the building  for a meeting. we watched the sighting for about 35 to 40 minutes. noticed the lights framed by tree branches against a dark sky. the white lights were bright an the brightest lights in the sky. i just happened to be positioned to watch the northern part of the sky.\r\ni was curious and thought they might be aircraft landing lights. i stayed focus on them because it became obvious that they were very bright and strings of more lights would appear to complete a row.\r\ni use to be a member of colo. mufon and began to think of things i needed to pay attention to. i took mental notes, try to take picture, marked time and detail of activities.\r\ni had to go into my meeting and lost sight upon returning to the porch\r\ni went home and began writing extensive notes.\r\n\r\nmy feeling are that we saw a large hovering object a distance away emitting bright lights that showed a reflective surface with more lights appearing that were red.\r\nthe radio tower or clouds might obscured the object causing some of the variation in their numbers.\r\ni went back at 7am this morning and took pictures to better view the field in daylight to better determine the elevation of the object etc.\r\ni went back tonight in darkness at the same time 18:00 to eliminate repeated reflections of lights that might occur and to reaffirm my evaluation of what i saw.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
