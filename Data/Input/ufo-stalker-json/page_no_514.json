somewhere south bound between savanah ga. and jacksonville fl. on 95 south,  sometime after midnight, no later then 1:30 am ... the whole thing is strange , the sighting and my reaction to it, plus the event's afterwards.  so im driving south bound on 95 there is no traffic from either direction,  and above the hwy is a bright white light, at first thought it might be a helicopter or something,  but quickly realized that is was not, the light was very bright, i turned my radio off, and began to slow down thinking something had to be going on up ahead on the road or air, as i got closer the light just got bigger and brighter, too blinding to make out what it could be, but as i began to drive under the light i could see the underside of a large airplane sized triangle with three neon blue colored donut shaped lights, i was looking up through my windshield of my car while passing under the triangle,  i could see this thing very clearly, it was only right over the hwy, directly ovet my car, but when i was driving towards it before going under it, all i could see was a bright light, never expected to be passing directly under a triangle, well i immediately pulled over and by the time i came to a full stop and looked back and up it was gone,  not a trace, and strangly i just just drove off , i felt very calm, but at the same time something was not right, i felt like i was being watched or followed,  just very strange feelings, and even now after all this time, alot of strange things, ill talk more about that stuff another time, just a lot of unanswered questions, and

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was out singing karaoke i lived in van nuys at the time so i guess we were at encino as we were getting in the car we noticed this huge thing above us not that close like if you look at the manhattan bridge go above that 3/4/times it seemed that close it was hugelots of lights we became too frightened to notice the color so we got in the car and started to drive to the freeway i looked out the window and it was speeding behind us somewhat distant but coming at us like it was following us i yelled hurry hurry press on the gas then it just shot into another direction and then another one came out of another direction then another one there was at least four to five of them but when we first saw it it was they're above us and then it went into a rocking motion then shut off when i looked out the window it was chasing after a car then all of sudden and when it didn't make a you turn up my. it went into another direction that's when i yelled to my friend peter leblanc from selma cuz we were driving to sylmar he lives there in a guest house at the time i told peter oh my god peter there's more than 4 of 5 bigos one another one another 1 peter bagels 1 another 1 another 1 pizza we started to speed to get away and just as fast as it was chasing behind us it disappeared going we will going straight heading towards sylmar it was behind us they all went towards the left and disappeared now i know how you are ! please don't let the government kill me because i saw thisthis thing could move fast i'm a woman and it was big very big and more then us had to see .How could something that big not be seen. it was kind of square like 7 cars piled up on top each other talk 7 cars going to the left 7 cars going to the right 7 cars going to the left 7 cars going to the right something like that i don't know how to explain it i'm a woman it wasn't something for two people passenger put it that way i think it could have held at least 10 we lived in san fernando valley california i lived in van nuys he lives in selma the twin towers came down in new york me and him all of a sudden got into this big fight we broke up i never saw him again i move to new york to help my country yes i'm afraid of what i saw and yes i'm afraid of what will happen to me because i'm sure they know i'm doing this but oh well you're here and we know you're here what i fear now that they might try to hurt me or my family or make me seem crazy but like i said it look like it was just standing there before us then started to rock shot across we got in the car next thing we know it's behind us and we see another one and then another one then all of a sudden it just shut off in another direction they always shooting in different directions one thing i know we were driving straight they were behind us they all went and one direction left there was supposed to be a meteor shower that night i remember it but then things would too big to be medium if they were meteors and they would that big in that many and crashed they woulda did damage and they would too close on top of the earth to disintegrate okay they will not medias they were some kind of let's say it flying saucers ufos whatever the hell you want to call it that's what they were the lights made it difficult to see but i do know it was wide seemingly square but when i say square along square that's what it look like but then when it moved it look different when it was flying across the sky it didn't look square in sick and then the size of it seem to be a different pattern i just don't know how to explain it it just look different it didn't look the same as if when it was standing still before it started to shake and move and go fast and shoot across the sky when it was going really fast and look kind of smaller it was speeding it was just coming out of so when you ask me questions that i can answer if it was a done this i just know it look like a big giant square so many lights the lights would have been a lot of blurring to if it had windows cuz it had a lot of lights how nobody elseseen  it is beyond u they were too big to be medias they said it was going to be a meteor shower november 19th or 18th in 2000 that's why i looked up the sky i remember why i wanted to see if there was going to be medias nice all that big thing too big it was too close to the earth to burn without doing serious damage and they was more than 145 following cars speeding behind cars above us but speeding behind us with us but in a distance","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional
