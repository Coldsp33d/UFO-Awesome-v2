in the car we noticed this huge thing above us not that close like if you look at the manhattan bridge go above that 3/4/times it seemed that close it was hugelots of lights we became too frightened to notice the color so we got in the car and started to drive to the freeway i looked out the window and it was speeding behind us somewhat distant but coming at us like it was following us i yelled hurry hurry press on the gas then it just shot into another direction and then another one came out of another direction then another one there was at least four to five of them but when we first saw it it was they're above us and then it went into a rocking motion then shut off when i looked out the window it was chasing after a car then all of sudden and when it didn't make a you turn up my. it went into another direction that's when i yelled to my friend peter leblanc from selma cuz we were driving to sylmar he lives there in a guest house at the time i told peter oh my god peter there's more than 4 of 5 bigos one another one another 1 peter bagels 1 another 1 another 1 pizza we started to speed to get away and just as fast as it was chasing behind us it disappeared going we will going straight heading towards sylmar it was behind us they all went towards the left and disappeared now i know how you are ! please don't let the government kill me because i saw thisthis thing could move fast i'm a woman and it was big very big and more then us had to see .How could something that big not be seen. it was kind of square like 7 cars piled up on top each other talk 7 cars going to the left 7 cars going to the right 7 cars going to the left 7 cars going to the right something like that i don't know how to explain it i'm a woman it wasn't something for two people passenger put it that way i think it could have held at least 10 we lived in san fernando valley california i lived in van nuys he lives in selma the twin towers came down in new york me and him all of a sudden got into this big fight we broke up i never saw him again i move to new york to help my country yes i'm afraid of what i saw and yes i'm afraid of what will happen to me because i'm sure they know i'm doing this but oh well you're here and we know you're here what i fear now that they might try to hurt me or my family or make me seem crazy but like i said it look like it was just standing there before us then started to rock shot across we got in the car next thing we know it's behind us and we see another one and then another one then all of a sudden it just shut off in another direction they always shooting in different directions one thing i know we were driving straight they were behind us they all went and one direction left there was supposed to be a meteor shower that night i remember it but then things would too big to be medium if they were meteors and they would that big in that many and crashed they woulda did damage and they would too close on top of the earth to disintegrate okay they will not medias they were some kind of let's say it flying saucers ufos whatever the hell you want to call it that's what they were the lights made it difficult to see but i do know it was wide seemingly square but when i say square along square that's what it look like but then when it moved it look different when it was flying across the sky it didn't look square in sick and then the size of it seem to be a different pattern i just don't know how to explain it it just look different it didn't look the same as if when it was standing still before it started to shake and move and go fast and shoot across the sky when it was going really fast and look kind of smaller it was speeding it was just coming out of so when you ask me questions that i can answer if it was a done this i just know it look like a big giant square so many lights the lights would have been a lot of blurring to if it had windows cuz it had a lot of lights how nobody elseseen  it is beyond u they were too big to be medias they said it was going to be a meteor shower november 19th or 18th in 2000 that's why i looked up the sky i remember why i wanted to see if there was going to be medias nice all that big thing too big it was too close to the earth to burn without doing serious damage and they was more than 145 following cars speeding behind cars above us but speeding behind us with us but in a distance","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

smoking a cigarette at the time.She called out a loud for me to come and see what she had seen up in the sky.At the time i was working in my shed.  i suffer from chronic back pain and could not sleep.  it is rare that we are up this early in the morning,  but not unusual for us to be looking at the sky.  this summer we had seen a lot of activity,  mostly just lights in the sky ,  the majority of them were probably satellites.On occasion we had seen this peculiar flashy thing, which is what my wife nicknamed it.The flashy thing was not what we saw this morning.Initially when she had called me out i thought she was teasing me so i was not taking her seriously .She told me that when she looked away to call me she had lost sight of it for a moment .  before i had  reached where she was i turned back towards the shed. but just as i reached the shed door ,she cried out there it is babe there it is what is that ?  i hurried back to where she was standing and pointing up at the sky.At first i did not see it then she stood behind me pointed her finger and told me to look straight down the line of her finger i finally saw it.By that time it was still very high in the sky like an aeroplane . three lights and absolutely no sound.I ran back to the shed and grabbed a pair of binoculars.As soon as i had returned it began descending.It was almost as though it knew where we were and that we were watching it.It descended to about approximately 1000 feet above us and banked towards us as though it was viewing us i handed her the binoculars and she said when she looked at it she couldn't tell what it was, so she handed me the binoculars and i took a look.It was very cold and fairly foggy at the time, but what i saw look like a  triangular hockey puck with three lights.The structure of the craft was very very dense or dark and the three lights did not pulse or flash they remained constant. it then leveled out and headed south towards national city , chula vista ,imperial beach, san isidro.As it got further and further away it did not seem to change altitude,  the entire time i would say approximately 1000 feet wasthe lowest altitude it flew .  we lost sight of it as it went past our home and into the distance. had our home been on the southern ridge and not on the northern ridge we would have probably been able to view it the entire time it headed south.  the entire event took approximately 3 to 4 minutes but it seemed like it took more like 20 minutes or more. strangest part of the sighting was that the craft seemed to expand or got bigger the further away it traveled. and  as it was heading southward i then called 9-1-1.  the 9-1-1 operator was a bit surprised  when i asked if any other calls had come in about a ufo.  she asked me if i felt in danger and then asked if i wanted to report a ufo. since the object came about 1000 feet above us and directly in the flight path of lindbergh field i said yes i want to report a ufo .  she then told me that this was not a life threatening event , so she  connected me to a non emergency line for the police departmnt who in turn told me a call brownfield or lindbergh field airport. since the police operator didn't seem like she was taking me seriously i decided not to make any more calls. after all of this my wife and i could not go back to sleep right away so we talked about it for the next hour or so then went back to bed .  since this sighting we haven't had but a few sightings and none of them were anything like this one.  mostly shooting stars or aircraft.  but definitely no ufos. my wife told me that when she first saw it , it looked like a comet or had a tail like a comet.  i think what we saw was a hologram. we've ufos are from another planet i think they're sinister like demonic and evil. honestly i believe ufos are the fallen angels that are described in the holy bible.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

shortly after 4:30 am without any reason. felt oddly restless; couldn't get back to sleep. got up to look out the window. observed a starless (possibly overcast?) sky and a white light in the nearby distance that seemed to wobble in a relatively stationary position.\r\n\r\nthis light alarmed me, because i'd witnessed a similar light that exhibited the same behavior in january of 2001. incidentally from that very same window.\r\n\r\nthe area behind my mother's house abuts a neighbor's yard who has very tall trees. the light (object) almost seemed to know that i was observing it and would move just enough to obscure itself behind a tree trunk. i'd change position, and shortly it would go back again. i had to keep at this tactic, going back and forth, in order to get a decent length of footage.\r\n\r\nwatching the video recently, i was kind of astonished by my whispered ramblings. i was mostly stating what i was seeing and trying to make sense of it, but at times i would go off on bizarre and somewhat incoherent tangents. i also didn't directly recall it at the time, but you can hear my mom's dog barking downstairs at some point. no one had stirred, but myself. and i'd been completely stationary with the exception of moving my camera's position throughout the sighting.\r\n\r\ni would also like to state that after shooting this footage for about 20 minutes i found a pair of binoculars and wanted to get a better look at the light from the outside. i took my dog and my mom's dog with me to the back yard. looking through the binoculars i could discern that the one light i'd perceived with my unaided eyes was actually a row of 6 or 7 lights oriented at an awkward 12 to 15 degrees. it moved a lot slower and with less frequency at this point, though still at the same distance and location in the sky. i could also just barely see that the row of lights seemed to outline the object's apparent shape which was a disc or, perhaps cigar shaped. this was at about 5:10 am; still quite dark. i decided at that point to go back inside. i was going to check if it was still there before the sun came up, but i fell asleep.\r\n\r\ni observed the same phenomena the following morning at approximately the same time. i awoke my mom this time to observe it with me. i think she was more annoyed that i'd awoken her than she was interested in observing it with me,

intensities of blue, and no other color.\r\n\r\nthis anomoly remained in the same approximate position for at least the 20 minutes or so that i was outside observing it, and when i came into the house to file a sighting report. \r\n\r\nthe object must have been traveling at thousands of mph, in my opinion, in order to travel and suddenly change direction at the distance from which i observed it.\r\n\r\ni am attaching one of several videos that i took of the anomoly, with my cell phone (on maximum zoom).
