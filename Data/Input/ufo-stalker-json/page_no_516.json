i hope to get more data very soon. her and her husband were camera shy and often sick, so in order to get a report into mufon i agreed to formally interview her over the phone, which went really well. the two times i went up to their house they were visibly scared and rushed me out both times. i did get rock samples, soil samples, and even tree branch samples that were a few feet away from the original spherical event.\r\n\r\n\tlorna and i developed a very close relationship revolved around the approximately 50 hours of phone time we racked up. she called me more than i called her. she very quickly trusted me, and i reduced her fear of the events in play. she would send me videos often and i would always call her right back and talk about the new video. she was always intelligent and very believable. to show you how well our relationship is – she actually called me the day after the phone interview to tell me i was doing a good job on the case. she also wanted to add that at times certain cameras would “go out” and then magically turn on. i always asked her what she thought different things were about. lorna has gotten much less fearful and is now wanting to know answers.\r\n\r\n\tshe lives in a remote area of northeastern new jersey; an area with 17 lakes, many of which have had ufo reports associated with them. from her back porch, you can see part of the appalachian trail, and on a good night you can play appalachian 9 ball.\r\n\r\non further investigations\r\n•\tbirds are mainly ruled out on this case.\r\n          hummingbirds left the area to migrate to south west united states early in september.\r\n\teagles are too big.\r\n\tvultures are too big.\r\n\tbig black birds are too big; and not many of them are in this area in new jersey. \r\n\r\n•\tthe scole experiment in italy dealt with similar phenomena. thusly showing the same phenomena on two different continents. two of the images on the scole website were identical to the images picked up on the hard drive from the witnesses.\r\n•\ti would like to try and capture at least one of the spheres on two different cameras, from different angles at once.\r\n•\tthis would be great and easy to set up.\r\n•\ti would also like to capture images from the woods around their house towards their house, for a two hour period at night. lorna and i agree; that one to three in the morning would be a peak time period. (i could use my sony nightshot mode also.)\r\n•\talso, my sony outdoor has great audio, which i could pick up for two hours straight. inside their house, they never heard anything.\r\n•\tat this point, all six cameras have had at least one event happen.\r\n•\tthe diversity of the data is starting to show patterns.\r\n•\tthe data may be even showing intelligent thought.\r\n•\ti have complete rock, foliage and soil samples which i would like to have tested.\r\n•\talthough they (the witnesses) are hesitant, i am ready to rf and elf test as soon as possible. (i have a meter ready to go.)\r\n•\taround their house exists a horseshoe shaped natural rock sculpture that is striking in size and composition. most of it actually is quite old looking and black. this property structure is another candidate for rf and elf readings.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":74499,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.064343799999996,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02152016-0010","longitude":-74.4019812,"occurred":1442016000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1455546331000,"summary":"Spheres observed on security cameras.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":70,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":20,"meantempi":68,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":70,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":20,"meantempi":68,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":156,"locationName":"New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:89866"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Chico","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing in my backyard when i looked up to the sky and noticed an object that was at a very high altitude, yet very bright, flying directly overhead. it was heading south-west, and had a contrail behind it. the contrail, however, was erratic and not straight as normally observed from an airplane. the object was moving quite fast, and within roughly 5-10 seconds, the object disappeared without seeming to lose elevation. \r\n\r\nat first, i thought it was a high-altitude airplane, but the speed and the fact that it disappeared so quickly made me think otherwise.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":74498,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7343144,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02152016-0009","longitude":-121.8333777,"occurred":1455368400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1455541693000,"summary":"Very high altitude object with erratic contrail seemingly disappeared.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":69,"maxvism":32,"maxvisi":20,"meantempm":13,"meantempi":56,"meanvism":17,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":6,"mintempi":42,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":21,"maxtempi":69,"maxvism":32,"maxvisi":20,"meantempm":13,"meantempi":56,"meanvism":17,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":6,"mintempi":42,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Chico, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:89867"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Brockport","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting at the dining table with my wife and daughters who were 8 & 6 years old at the time. it was daylight, suppertime say around 6 pm in the early summer - june i think. i suddenly felt a strange electric-like energy, maybe like if you like if you were near an electrical transformer or something like that. it was enough to make get up quickly from the table and instinctively go outside. our dog was outside and barking for no apparent reason. i looked up to the eastern sky and saw 3 distinct lights in a slightly triangular horizontal pattern, with the middle light appearing to be just slightly higher than the ones to the right and left. \r\nthe lights seemed to be moving rapidly away from me to the east. within seconds, maybe less than a second, the lights seem to converge and disappear. during this time i felt the strange sense of energy that i felt when i first felt it in the house. i never saw the shape or outline of an object. i flt as if i had actually seen what i saw and in no way could i explain it to myself as any kind of normal aircraft. when i went back in i asked my wife and kids if they felt or saw anything. as i recall, they didn't seem to have felt or seen whati did as much as i did. my yougest daughter (6 1/2 year old) then said she saw a plane or something like a plane. i asked her to draw a picture of it, and she did.\r\nshe drew a picture of an craft similar to an airplane, from a top, side view, with windows along the side, wings on either side, and as i recall there were people figures in the windows. i think i still have the drawing somewhere, as i remember keeping it with her school memorabilia -pictures, drawings etc- as she went through grade school and then high scool. she is now 32 years old and lives in dallas where she is an elementary school teacher. i plan to ask her what she remembers about this event the next time she visits home, or if i visit with her this spring. \r\nthats about it. i had thought about rprting this many times but the demands of work, raising a family, etc, always seemed to take priority.\r\nas i recall this event it comes back as a distinct sensation of a burst of energy - almost pulsatingly so, like electricity. and i can still envision the 3 lights disappearing to the east. i have often wondered if other people reported anything simiilar in the area during that time frame of the late 1980's to early 1990s. after this event i semmed to notice more strange lights in the night sky, but wasnt sure if they were just airplanes, satellites or other man -

lights, i recommend everyone to try and watch over lubbock as it has become a major hot-spot. the night of the sighting i had made previous videos in my home and took the camera to prove it all. as i have gotten many weird orbs and craft on film, this close and highly illuminated triangle would not show up... even with my iso set to 800 and aperature exposure to be quick, it wouldn't catch or show on my dslr. i had weird vibrations and i felt connected ton this object, i lost sight of it when it moved to south and the tress started to cover it on my street. again... lubbocks becoming a hotspot every night and i encourage more interaction with the new lubbock lights.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path

object approaching on the horizon. it was a very cloudy day and the object was flying just under the cloud cover. i described the entire event to my friend that i was talking with on the phone. what was so unusual about the object was the way the entire disk shaped object was glowing. there were no individual lights on this object, rather the entire object glowed like a white fluorescent light. the out line of the object was fuzzy. it continued flying closer to me, just under the cloud cover and eventually turned and ascended into the clouds, at which point i lost track of the object and never saw it again. the object did not fly unusually fast, or make any unusually sharp turns. what made this object unusual was the way it was glowing. the entire siting was no more than 20 seconds. i did park in a parking lot and continue to watch the general area where i last saw the glowing object. no more than 5 minutes after the object ascended into the the cloud cover, a black helicopter came from the same general area and flew right over the top of my parked car. the helicopter had a very crisp outline and individual lights that were very obviously lights. both the helicopter and the brightly illuminated disk shaped object were over joint base elmendorf richardson (jber). i was curious about the glowing object because i had never seen anything illuminated like this object before. other than curiosity and excitement over seeing something so different than ever before i was unaffected.
