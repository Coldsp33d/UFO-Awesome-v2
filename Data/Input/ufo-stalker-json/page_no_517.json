see lots of contrails. she was at a local park with her 6 year old son and she told me that on this particular afternoon there were more contrails than usual and their pattern was different than normal. the sky was very active she said. so she took her cell phone, a samsung galaxy note 3, and snapped 5 pictures of the sky and contrails just because. the whole procedure took maybe a minute or two. the sky was too bright to see her pictures as she took them, she just aimed at some of the contrails. later, upon studying her pictures, she found this object apparently flying across the sky. in the last picture, the object appears to be changing colors and glowing or reflecting light differently than in the earlier pictures. judging by its position in each picture, it was moving across the sky much faster than the jets. it moved from southwest of her, to more westerly, and then southeasterly. she did not see this in the sky. she just saw a lot of jet contrails, including one moving straight up. almost as if they were searching for something she said. in the first picture there is nothing, then the object is at 2:00 to the sun, then 3:00 to the sun, and then 11:00 to the sun. that is the sequence of the pictures.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

hazy perimeters and did not resemble regulated lights common to civilian aircraft.  the lights had a separation of more than 10 trees each indicting to me that they were either separate objects or one very large object.  the immediate consensus was that they were not normal.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

7), i was getting washing in off the clothesline, when i saw something to the south east, which caused me to do a double take,\r\ni saw what looked to be a slate grey elliptical aircraft seemingly emerge from fog and rapidly disappear back into fog, just above the tree line - there are no zeppelin's or blimps active in this region of australia and there was no fog or cloud of any description on tuesday afternoon (here on the coast). the sighting lasted no more than twenty seconds and at first i decided it had been a trick of my eyes. i also felt an illogical sense of unease, a sense of foreboding, directly after this 'uncertain' sighting - which lingered for much of tuesday afternoon, which was inexplicable, in itself.  earlier in the day, i had passed jervis bay and observed that the navy were conducting maneuvers off huskisson and if the thing i glimpsed (fleetingly) that afternoon was an aircraft of some kind, it would be comparable in size to one of our smaller ships (presumably) - as i said, i was prepared to dismiss the incident as a trick of the eyes, but on friday night, i took a look at mufon (ostensibly to see if there were any tributes to edgar mitchell) and i started reading through some of the 'news reports' and read of an incident reported in america, which gave me cause to reflect that there was some similarity to what i thought i had seen. the american case involved a horse owner who was talking with his wife and two friends, outdoors near their horses, under cloudy skies - he observed the 'thing' passing through cloud and by the time his colleagues had turned to see it, it was gone, but then they saw it for themselves about half an hour later.\r\nreading that gave me cause to consider that my sighting may not have been a trick of the

road in spaceships by gavin gibbons. as i was reading an intense smell of sulfur was to my right hand side and slightly behind me. the next thing i hear is an powerful voice in my head saying 'your mind has developed sufficiently for contact', then i just knew what i had to do. i had to try make telepathic contact and if i succedded i'd be given further instructions. at first i thought i was imagining it all due to the book i was reading but about 10 mins later i had a response, they said 'be up clifton downs by precisely 23:00'. whoever this lot are, they are extremely precise with time. after these incidents i became precise with time almost in the extreme. \r\nthe library shut at 19:30 so i went to the cinema to pass the time. i saw my cousin vinny at the odeon cinema on union street, broadmead, bristol. the film ended at 22:20 then i took a slow walk upto clifton. i went into miss millies in clifton, bought 2 bits chicken and chips and can of diet coke then walked upto the downs. i have a tree that i always train by and meditate under so i went there, i walked up and down a few times then a bright white appeared over bristol city centre at precisely 23:00 and zero seconds by my watch. i remember looking at it thinking, oh it's real then. as i turned round to walk back up the down i glanced at it, it had vanished, i looked around and found it had moved about 90 degrees to the left, it was between two trees. i moved to the right for a better look then it moved then it moved to the right, hiding behind a tree, i moved to the left and the same thing happened. playing games i thought. i decided to cross the road splitting the downs and the only thing in the way of it was the water tower, i said 'now hide', it moved in a arch and flew right over my head. it was a big cylinder about 400-500 feet up and maybe bigger in length, difficult to tell at that distance. it had two white lights, one at each end and flew down to the clifton suspension bridge, down the portway and was hovering in a field over the river, maybe 100 feet up. i watched it for a while then heard the telepathic voice again saying 'go home now, you won't see us anymore tonight no matter how hard you try. i went home and didn't see it again.\r\n\r\non the friday of the same week i was in the missing peace christian cafe on city road in st pauls, bristol. i was in there all night with friends just chatting. it was getting late so i walked a friend jim home as he was elderly then. we walked upto upper ashley road where jim lives, it was about midnight when i dropped him off. i started walking down ashley road when i heard that telepathic voice in my head again. 'be up clifton downs by precisly 01:00. i thought, you gota be kidding at this late hour but it happened on the wednesday so why not on the friday. i decided to go. when i got there i was a few minutes early so went to my tree. at precisely 01:00 and zero seconds by my watch a pulsing red light appeared over bristol city centre, where the white light had been on the wednesday. it was just hovering there, i happened to glance about 90 degrees to my right and up in the sky about 5-10 miles away were three more in staggared formation, they had a red light at each end with a white light in the middle, again cylinders. i stayed there looking at them for about 30 minutes then went home. when i got to the edge of clifton downs on top blackboy hill one craft went right over my head, a pulsing red light at each end of the cylinder with no sound, about 100 feet up. i decided to take a short cut home through st pauls, when i got on top picton street another craft went over my head looking the same as the previous one. i didn't see any more that night. i know that something else happened but i have a block in my mind. i went to a hypnotist called bruce waddall in downend, bristol. on the way there on the bus i saw them in broad daylight, i heard the telepathic voice again saying 'you won't be able to be hypnotized no matter how hard you try. we tried every technique but i'm completely immune.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

eion resort. that's where i lost them because the light pollution from the ski resort was bright... i know what satellites look like and air planes they usually have a straight direction these were going everywhere but not incredible fast, one was even pretty slow and followed the others. there was a four all together two were like playing with each other one was following and the other leading... also they lit up like a helicopter or satellite but no red flashing like was sort of white and every time it flashed i could see a sort of bell/triangular outline. this happened between
