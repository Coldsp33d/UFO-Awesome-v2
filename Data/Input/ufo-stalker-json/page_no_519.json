newport, oregon. i was located roughly 3 miles south of the local municipal airport and was outside stargazing before going to sleep when i noticed a light and what appeared to be the underside of a vehicle lit from below traveling overhead.\r\nmy first instinct was to get excited, thinking i was viewing the iss traveling past. i knew that at those altitudes, they are usually still lit by the sun while other areas are in pitch black. i then realized that this object in no way resembled the iss and would have been far smaller if it were. \r\nbeing near the municipal airport, i then tried to guess if it was a plane or helicopter, but the object consisted of a single light (approximately as bright as sirius) and a main body that split into a âtâ shape that appeared lighted from below. it seemed to be traveling low, but there was no sound at all â we normally have helicopters flying overhead and can hear them very clearly, especially when all other daily traffic is gone. the âtâ shaped section was moving approximately 30-45 degrees off axis, so i knew it could not be a plane. \r\nlocated along the coastal highway, i watched as this object moved into the tree line. i was unable to grab a picture with my camera phone, so i jumped in the car to a lookout point along the ocean about .5miles away. by the time i pulled in and got out (about 2 minutes max) it had already disappeared, having flown off over the water in a west-southwest direction. \r\niâm a scientist for oregon state university, and have seen many type of aircraft, but this was nothing i know

looking at the ocean, when all of the sudden a large lighted rectangular structure appear on the ocean surface. i recalled the structured just appeared. it didn't land or surface, it was as if someone just turn on the lights. it had several color of light and they appear to be position on a sequential way and it was cover with light from top to bottom. i don't recall if the lights were blinking on static. since it was at night and at sea, sizes and distances are hard to acquire. also the rush of adrenaline since we had been trained to always report if we saw something close to the ship as there are risks of accidents. the ship i was traveling was close to 300 feet, and the structure seem enormous. i will guess it was about 5 to 10 times bigger then our ship long wise and about 3-5 times taller. it seems just to be there, we all were alarmed and started to wonder if it could be a gigantic ship, but it looked too big. we had seen cruise ships before at leaving port at night and this didn't look anything like it. the size was also something that it was just not a ship. it was also practically just a huge rectangular shape or a net of lights. the lights were big and i would guess it had about 500 to 1000 lights, all distributed in a sequential or neat pattern. after for what it seem to be a minute, we realized we needed to inform the flinging bridge crew. my self and another friend, ran up the stairs to inform the crew and when we walked into the flight bridge and you could tell they were alarmed. the first mate was giving orders and the situation seem a bit stressed out. once we could talk, we told them, we saw something big with lots of light very close to the ship. the first mate or another crew member (don't recall who) told us that it had all of the sudden disappear from the radar. we stayed there talking with the crew and wondering what it was. about 2-3 other crew members at the flight bridge had also seen the structure and where making arrangements to communicate with whatever was near by. they had seen it on the radar, but quickly disappear from the radar and also visually, as if someone just had turn the light off. \r\n\r\nregarding the location: i wrote domican republic as this is perhaps the closest thing i could find on the map. but the sighting took place in the middle of the ocean. perhaps there should be an option for oceans in the country list as well. \r\n\r\nwe (the witnesses) talked about it and we all had seen the same thing. unfortunately this was back in 1991 and neither one of us had a camera. i don't know how ship logs work, but it would be interesting to find out if this was documented. i would also like to know if you have any similar reports.  \r\n\r\ni have added a couple of images. \r\npicture 1 of the trip and approximate location of sighting. \r\npicture 2 comparison between ship and lighted structure in the ocean. the images was put together using images found online and also remember the sighting was at night. \r\n\r\nplease let me know if you have any questions, ","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

from florida. i was 13 or 14. i had put in a long day and went to bed about 10 or 11 pm. next thing i know, my sister and i were downstairs in our living room in our old farm house. we were fully clothed, and the whole house was dark. \r\n\r\na full-moon glow shown through the living room area. now with the moon it would ascend out over our barn in the early months of summer and as the time past, it would rise more so towards the southwest. so it could of been early fall as well. \r\n\r\ni don't know how we got up and dressed and downstairs that night. as the scene unfolded, my sister was sitting in an upright position like sitting in a barber's chair. she was fully dressed and this being had her left arm in the air and apparently this being was sticking something in her, because she was saying och, that's hurting me. i was sitting on our couch in a paralysis state at this point. \r\n\r\nthen she seemingly just disappeared and next thing i know, this being was right next to me and looking down at me. i still could only move my eyes at this point. this being then takes my wrist and lifts it up with two of his appendages and said \"common\" like he either was challenging me or we were about to go somewhere. \r\n\r\nhis fingers were long, pointed and cold feeling. he was about five feet i would say, because he was standing and i was in a sitting position. he had very lighted skin. like a pale tannish white color. his skin felt and looked like a synthetic material.{rubberized}. his eyes were black as coal but i didn't get a full view of them. when he turned toward the window i could see an outline of them. \r\n\r\nthere were no lights on at the time. in our old house, the full moon would shine it's light through every window on the south east side and glare off the front of our garage. there were 38 windows. this means that the full moon would shine through six windows. these windows were nearly as big as a doorway.\r\n\r\nsuddenly i must have taken my eye off of him for a second, when i heard some commotion over my left shoulder. i stood up and wasn't in a paralysis state any longer. i growled like some monster or something and next thing i know, these beings rolled up into three orb like structures and they weren't a foot or more away and you could see their hands and feet just sticking out of these three orbs. \r\n\r\nthey then past through our living room, right out through our dinning room, right through our kitchen and went right through two panes of glass. they past up by and in front of our garage and then did a three-sixty and shot up into the sky like a laser beam. as they pasted through our house, the furniture didn't seem to be anywhere in sight. it's almost as if they moved all the furniture from out of their way as they past through the downstairs of our house. i stood at the window looking upwards toward the darkened sky and wondering what had just happened but didn't see any craft. i guess i wasn't suppose to or something at that time. \r\n\r\ni had submitted a letter similar to this one to that of mr. raymond fowler my icon in the ufology. i have this and the account that i had wrote to him but he had then but retired but still wrote me back.\r\n\r\ni saw this dream and many others like it in the summer of 07 &08 and all these images are still there. they are the only dreams that have sit inside my head that long in my sleeping history. it's been about eight years now. i thought that they would have passed by now like normal dreams usually do, but they haven't.\r\n\r\ni felt that it was time to write to you folks and find out what can be done. i am spooked by these measures and experiences that i have had. i started studying ufos in 2000 just after i married. what can i do to aleviate this distress.\r\n\r\nmr.P. \r\n\r\nps. i have proved photos of the area affected. they stuck a five inch needle in my spine and i have scare on my left knee and a four star pine hole just below my neck and i think i may have an implant in my left ear lobe.      \r\n\r\n     ","distance":"20 Feet or

communicated with me telepathically.\r\ni immediately stood up, and noticed my husband sleeping next to me was not waking up, they kept him asleep. the middle grey communicated with me telepathically. they were about 5'10\" tall, had big eyes and acted friendly and nice. we went into the living room and the middle alien told me his name and i wrote it down, but could not remember it or find it later. he asked me if he could have some of my hair for dna and i said ok. i asked him about his outfit and he said the grey was the outfit. it was skin tight, and he had big eyes  slit for a mouth, and two holes for a nose. he had no accent. i wasn't scared. i told him he was very nice and he said, not all are nice. i asked him what we can do about it. he said the government knows already. he asked me to lie down so he could take some hair and i don't remember anything after that. the next day i was sitting on my porch and my neighbor asked me what happened to my hair. i went in the house and saw i was missing a patch of hair on the back of my head as big as a palm. i am sioux indian and have long hair. i immediately called my dermatologist and went in. she said the hair had been removed by the roots. and gave me a lot of sample tubes of medicine to put on the bare patch of skin. it took about a month for hair to start growing in. i have also suffered seizures since then and the doctors don't know what causes them. i feel fine afterwords with no after effects. i also no longer have hair under my arms or on my arms since them.","distance":"20 Feet or
