evening, and i have for a few years, increasingly so. they vary in size, shape, color, and behavior. during this particular sighting, my family and i had just arrived home from a family celebration.  the family went inside, and as my husband entered the house, i told him, \"look, it's one of my ufos!\" he acknowledged and looked up, as he is very used to seeing them when i point them out, but does not enjoy watching them or pondering about it.  the object was glowing/pulsating a yellow/orange light. it appeared slightly larger than the largest star in the sky.  it seemed to stretch around the edges, as stars sometimes appear to do with atmospheric interference, but more so.  the flight path was wobbly (up and down a bit) in a south/southeast direction.  when i began watching it, it's behavior changed.  it hovered above the treeline while i got a photo, mostly stationary, but with a bit of a circular movement.  the sky was very very clear, with many stars visible, yet the object was the only light visible on camera.  i filmed it for a few minutes, but got cold and decided to come inside.  when i came in, i checked on the object through the back french doors, and when i looked at it, it began moving again in the south/southeast direction.  i quit watching it then.  i have become fairly used to seeing ufos from about that far away.  they don't stir me a bunch anymore.  only when they get closer do i become very concerned. i would report previous experiences, but i don't have dates available, nor any photos from these encounters.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

after visiting a friend. it was around 11:00 pm and we pulled off the road, parked the car and stood outside the vehicle to observe, after noticing a red object eject from a larger white object. while observing from outside the car, every few minutes, another red object was ejected from the larger white object until there were seven red objects of the same size following the larger white object across the sky in a straight lined formation.  we continued to observe for approximately twenty minutes until all of the objects passed into the distance and out of sight.  the white object and red objects all appeared to be round shaped. they also appeared to be at about the same distance from us as planes normally fly. when we first noticed the white object, we assumed that it was an airplane; however, after observing the first red object eject from the larger white object, we were amazed and pulled off the road to observe while standing outside. we became fascinated as additional red objects ejected from the larger white object every few minutes until seven red objects of the same size followed the larger white object in a straight lined formation across the sky until they passed out of sight.  the entire event lasted approximately twenty minutes. afterwards, we discussed and speculated concerning whether the objects were related to military/government aircraft or possibly even extraterrestrial in origin.  we have discussed it many times through the years and considered reporting the event years ago.  this is the first time that i have reported the experience although i have described it to friends and relatives through the years. i discussed the event with a local physics professor during the mid nineties and he revealed that he had witnessed a disc shaped object hover over a rock quarry on the same country road that our experience occurred.  he also pulled off of the road and observed the object until it departed at an unusually fast rate of speed.  there was also a story passed around for years, concerning a close encounter on this same road, (dating back to 1929) with two beings entering a disc shaped craft and taking off at an amazing rate of speed.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

fireworks and watched a few others in town celebrating, we settled back in lawn chairs to watch the stars and gaze at the milky way. \r\n\r\naround 1-2am we noticed a bright light in the direction of grand forks. it was pretty high up and very bright, as we watched, it began dropping lights from it, i assumed it was air force training with flares but the flares were multi colored, blue, yellow white and red, the main light was white. \r\n\r\nas they dropped, they kind of hung in the air like flares but then they started moving up and around the main white light. flares can travel with the wind but i've never seen them move up and circle around what dropped them. as we were watching the lights, i caught movement out of the corner of my eye, looking to the left off the corner of my dad's house, i saw an object going over the street light on the road to the south of the house. \r\n\r\nat the point i first saw it it was about 100 feet away and travelling above the treeline across the street, i watched as it went along the street above the trees, just as it was going out of sight it released what looked like molten metal from a port on the side of the craft. \r\n\r\ni could see the street lights illuminating the bottom of the craft. it looked somewhat modular in construction, it was about 20-25 feet long, taller in the back and slightly tapered towards the front. it kind of reminded me of the ships from space 1999 but smaller and more compact. \r\n\r\ni turned back after the ship passed and within 30 seconds the bright white light we had been watching had absorbed all

i thought at first it was a helicopter cause there is a airport mybe 10 miles away but when looked i couldn't believe what i was seeing it was rectangle shaped object standing on end not moving at all and the whole thing was wrapped in chrome panels no windows no lights no markings no engine no sound just hanging there it looked about the size of a school bus standing on end hanging mybe a 100ft or so i was so shocked and amazed by it it took me a few seconds i need to get my phone out and get it on video and i was driving and there was 100 people leaving work behind me so i was going to video it once i got off the rd were everyone was coming out of work mybe 10 sec and i had my phone out and turned on so when got to the place to pull over it was gone i look around the sky in every direction nothing in just 5 to 10 secs there is no way anything could be gone that fast i was mad at myself self for not getting it on video it was just so amazing to get to see it i have watched shows on ufo and i have never seen anything like it but the next day i was at a friends house that works there with me and he was in front of me leaving work and i asked him if he seen the same thing i seen but he said he didn't see anything i told him how could you not see it the sun was shining off the front of it and everything and he laughed at me so i told him just wait when we go back to work on monday i would be shocked if everyone's isn't taking about it and i told him i won't say a word about it and we see so monday came i get to work i was ready to tell him i told you it real but to my amusement not one person said anything about it and didn't say any thing there should have been hundreds of witnesses but that's not all about 2 months later i was leaving work i turned on the rd that i was going to pull over on to get video and i see a super bright light right above the gas station in front of me and it was so bright u couldn't even look at it to much it was like trying to look at the sun and it was moving away from moving west and it was the same way i going to get home i couldn't see it again because of the trees till i got closer to home and by then it had moved over my house and was still traveling west but was several miles away then it stopped and moved up and down me and my sister watched it for about 30mins and i did get pictures of it but it was night and my cheap phone it just looked like a a blob of light no details but i grabbed my binoculars so i could see it better and it was really weird it was a triangle shape and the whole thing was covered in orange and red flames so in 2 months i got to see 2 ufos and not the same thing but 2 different types of ufos what is the odds of that happening iam sorry it has taken so long to report this i have been on here 3 times but i just couldn't do it and everyone i have told just laughed it off but it has really changed me i look at things in a totally different way now and i think about it almost every time i go out side we are differently not alone but if would like to talk to me about it contact me ian not a good writer so i can give u more details about it.","distance":"101-500
