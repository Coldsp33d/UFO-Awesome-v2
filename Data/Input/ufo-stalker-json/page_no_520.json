have seen in the area i would estimate it to be less than a mile away. it was just around daybreak and the sky to the east was beginning to brighten however this object was easily brighter than anything i've ever seen in the sky easily brighter than landing lights on planes. the object made no noise whatsoever and was traveling very slow. if it were a helicopter i would have expected to hear a noise at that distance. i watched the object for just under 10 minutes and it did not close the distance to my area it seemed. i unlocked my car and placed my work bag on the seat, as i turned back to where i'd seen the object there was now nothing. the total time it had taken me to unlock my door and place my bag would have been less than 10 seconds. if it were an aircraft i would have been able to see it if it had turned to the east or west. the only thing that was visible at that point was a jet at a very high altitude to the east of my location traveling to the south

after 11 pm when a bright light pierced through the darkness and shone directly onto us. our first initial thought was that someone had a flashlight and was walking towards the vehicle to tell us to leave because it was after hours--maybe a cop or something. i squinted at it to see if i could determine the source of the light and it looked as if it were coming from a window of a house that was towards that end of the park. she was antsy and wanted to leave but i was mesmerized. we were stating our observations aloud, trying to piece together what the light was. it had a yellow-orange tint, similar to some surrounding street lights, so another theory i had on the spot was that a street lamp was shorting. as i observed, the light seemed to grow brighter, almost as if it was coming towards us. it was a fair distance away and hovered at first-floor-window height in accordance with house behind it, so probably a few feet from the ground, though it was hard to tell. the light grew and then rapidly shrank, making it easier to focus on. that's when i saw that it wasn't coming from the pole of a street lamp or a cop car's spotlight, or any human holding a flashlight. i couldn't believe my eyes. it wasn't displaying a beam, so that ruled out a few possible sources. it grew back to its original strength and then seemed to pulsate very slowly between extremely bright and moderately bright, then it slowly dimmed until it disappeared completely. it was then that i got a good look at where it seemed to be emitting from and concluded that theres no way it could've come from the house's window. as it was dimming, i could see the window behind it. the shudders were unaffected, they didn't have a glow behind them.  when the light was completely gone, i could see that it hadn't lined up with the window directly either. it then struck me that what i had witnessed was supernatural in nature.","distance":"21-100

drink when i was a kid my parents would put all my gifts for christmas in the living room christmas eve night and i wasn't allowed to come out till morning. but since i was thirsty i thought they wouldn't be mad so i got up and left my bed i walked through the hall way and standing in front of the front door was a five foot tall brown alien with the almond eyes pudgy belly thin arms and no distinguishable gender the being was looking around the living room as if looking for something. me at that age didn't know what aliens were so i though it was one of santa's elves beside it was my brand new barbie tricycle i thought the ''elf'' had brought it for me so i told it thank you and when it turned to look at me i waved and said hello it kept looking at me i felt no fear though because i thought it was friendly then i don't remember anything else it's all blacked out and i woke up in my bed like nothing had happened i told my mother and even told her about what was in the living room so shed know it wasn't a dream she had no idea though it was an alien i had seen since i was calling it an elf so she asked me to draw the elf and i did the best a five year old child could but it was an alien it scared her but she tried to tell me it was a dream for many years i never again thought about it or talked about it till i saw a picture of my barbie trike and then brought it up with my mom she helped me remember the bit about the drawing i made we went to look but the picture no longer exists but the account exists in both me and my mom's memories. she told me about you all at mufon so i decided to share this story with you also according to my mom that's not the only otherworldly experience that's happened to our family but i can tell you the other encounters with my grandma and mom if you want to hear about those too. but my encounter was the closest in the family. and i've never experienced anything similar since. i know i don't have photo or video evidence to prove this i just want you to take my word for it and i'll offer my mom as a valible witness to help validate my story if you need anything more thank you for reading this it feels good to share this after all this time. if you want me to draw a picture of the alien from my memory i will just let me know.","distance":"20 Feet or

old work taking a video as i did quite often (i am a prop mamipulator). i thought it was just a normal video this whole time, until last night when i couldnt sleep. i found myself going through old videos on my instagram account (i have a 15 second clip saved on my smartphone so i dont need to send a link). i clicked on one & a black object caught my eye. at first i was skeptical & thought it was a bird, until i searched on my facebook page and found the whole video. i noticed it firstly at 2:27, but upon further investigation i found that these objects appeared as early as :09 seconds in. they would be visible in one spot, then disappear. the more i watched it(which i would pause frame for frame) the more i would watch these objects move around & fade or move further from its spot throughout the same second. at 2:27 the object comes up from behind my head, & as i slowed it, i watched it dis purse into 2 objects. i paused it, screen shotted it when the object was one, then again as it changed into 2. then i noticed a 3 black object. they moved kind of in a pattern but at the same time its hard to tell because i am dancing in the video. they seemed to come out of no where in the clouds. i dont know any bird that can multiply itself in mid flight. my feelings are confused. my first ufo sighting was when i was at 5 years old, & have seen more since this sighting. ive always kind of thought i was watched by something, but never contacted. i also dont know to many kids that checked out books on aliens in first grade(i did), & have been intriuged from a young age. i lost sight of the objecys many times(as they can go invisible). i just want help figuring out what it is. i can attach many screenshots & the 15 second clip. if mufon thinks its actually something i would

and occasionally looking up at the stars. i can't remember how it came to my attention but i noticed the first bright object and suddenly realized it didn't look like any kind of known air craft or anything, so i immediately turned the video filming function on my phone to film it. i started filming it and after a minute or so i believe, i decided to grab my husband inside to tell him to come watch it with me. (everything said is in the video.) he came out to watch it with me and my two sons (ages 8 and 12) came out as well to watch. you can hear them all commenting during the video. unfortunately my iphone completely sucked at capturing how bright these objects were, and didn't even pick them up at the end.. but i still couldn't help but film it because it was so odd looking. so first i saw the one object glowing very brightly, and then a second object came up near it. they both seemed to pulsate i guess would be the right word. they didn't seem to be following general laws of gravity or propulsion... quick redirects, slight morphing of shape, extremely quick movements and then hovers.  a third object was visible for a brief moment but quickly disappeared near where the others first showed. we lost sight of them because they simply disappeared into thin air\r\n they seemed to pulse out. they looked like they were made of fire but not burning in a fire way.. almost like a glowing coal or something. it's very difficult to explain. they were completely silent and behind some very tall fir trees for a good portion of the sighting. it was hard to tell how far away they were or how large they were. their apparent size was a tiny bit smaller than a pea. they seemed to glow a different shade of reddish orange inside the center of the darker outer glowing shade. but i could not identify any structural details aside from the illusion of a spherical shape that slightly morphed several times into a less perfect sphere shape. i felt excited to see these things and my sons and husband were very interested as well. we were interested in what they may be but none of us have any idea other than \"ufo's\".

that lies between beaumont, and san jacinto, ca. there are no buildings, or known construction in that area. saturday , approx. 8pm, i saw a small light fly, & apparently land, on the ridge, in direct line of sight, i would guess at about 3-4miles from my home. i tend to watch tv in a darkened room, because i just like the night view. my view is directly south. i was going to ignore it, because we do get some helicopter traffic through the pass, but the light not only got brighter, but lit-up in gold and violet. not the usual faa colors, so i got my camera ready, canon eos 1200d, and decided to try my new telescopic lens. the winds were blowing at about 30miles/hr, with gusts close to 50mi/hr, so movement during filming was unavoidable. then i saw a very bright, fairly large red light move across, from east-west, below and to the east of the main light, which had been stationary, since it landed. i started filming when other objects/lights came and hovered, circling, etc, then one of the lights moved east, and landed, not far from the main light, it seemed to turn-off it's lights, but i could visually see something moving around. all the while, there were another set of lights, that only were visable in the camera, lower to the west of the main lights, and not visable to naked sight. the object that had landed to the east, rose straight up, hovered over the main lights, then moved to the west at a high rate, and disappeared quickly. as the time was over 2 1/2hrs, when the main set of lights started to dim, it never moved, simply dimmed from view, to darkness. no trace of this stuff in the daylight, very curious. a single helicopter was later seen circling to the west of this sighting, where an aviation warning light flashes at night.","distance":"Over One

today at 5:52 am.  i awoke for no particular reason this morning and was staring out the large bay window that dominates my bedroom and faces the southwest.  had been starring out this window for a few minutes, wondering why i had to wake up so early on my day off, when two relatively bright, white lights steadily appeared in the upper portion of the window.  there is a thick transom board that forms the upper sill for the bay windows below and is the base for the triangular window that is the top of the bay window group.  the lights appeared from behind this board, up into the large, clear portion of the triangular window, slowly moving upward and to the right for a short period.  at first, i thought it must be a pair of light aircraft, but it was weird that they would track so steadily with each other and move so slow.  i really didn't think too much of it, i had seen similar things in the past that weren't too far out of the realm of normality, but when the lights seemingly halted, and rapidly shot upwards to tiny points of light (probably about a second to a second and a half) in a very gentle quarter twist motion), i was pretty sure i was not watching a pair of cessna aircraft.  the twin points of light glittered for about two seconds before one on the left just winked out and the one on the right shot across the window in a northernly direction in about a quarter of a second,  after waiting a few minutes, keeping my eyes on that patch of sky to see if anything else manifested itself, i turned on the table lamp and noted the time of 5:52 am and got out my

in law and i were finishing up cleaning our house. the subdivision in where our house was like a ghost town because most of the residents had to evacuate the area. there was no electricity and water for more than a week because of the damage the flood caused. a few days after our slow and tedious cleanup of the mud inside our house my brother in law and i went outside our house to do a last minute checkup of the perimeter, he noticed an orange orb and called my attention. as we were observing the orange orb it changed shape into an angular looking craft and it was clearly cloaked. there was no electricity so we could clearly see it against the backdrop of the evening sky. if there were streetlights on you wouldnt be able to see it because of the interference of streelights glare. its trajectory was semi circular. as it neared the back of our house where the cagayan de oro river was it began to descend. i was full of excitement because i couldnt believe what i was seeing and yet here it was in front of me. my brother in law was freaking out and wanted to get the hell out of there but i wanted to go to the area where it was descending. thinking of our safety i decided not to pursue my wanted course of action. it wasnt until last year that i stumbled upon the picture of the black knight and i was sure it was the thing that we saw. i just want to add that the night before we also witnessed a blue light slowly ascending into the night sky and when it reached a certain altitude it shot up like went to warp speed. i was lucky to have my brother in law with me during both
