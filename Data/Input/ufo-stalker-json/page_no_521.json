connecting two rooms. the room was dark there was a trunk a desk and sewing setup a bed and some other miscellaneous shelves and a window its was semi lit from street lamps, i saw nothing, my grandma's bedroom door was opening and and from my peripheral vision i saw a very small and glowing.I turned getting a good look at the miniature man, i heard pitter patter footsteps and and i saw a little green glowing man running through my grandma's room and into a closet and her closet connect to mine. and the little creature ran through the closet ran into my room then it jumped out the open window but went up to the sky. i ran to the window to go look up or down and i saw nothing... it was so bizarre, i kept it to my self only reason i say something now is i'm curious if anyone has a similar event. it's hard for me to disgribe but i had a clear line of sight through my grandma s room to her closet door and a clear line of sight from my open bedroom door to the

came around the corner near the dumpsters and it stopped in it's tracks as well! i stood there staring at this massive craft! as it made no noise at all!! the red light continued to pulsating! i was stuck! i couldn't move my feet! my dad was still on the phone talking! all of a sudden i was able to move my feet! i told my dad and ran into the house to get my friend!! i screamed and told her that she needed to see this! i got her to come outside with me and by this time the truck was gone!! and the craft was leaving she stopped and looked up at the bright lights in dear and yelled at me saying lets go!! i'm going in the house and should too!! she left and i watched it go behind the high tree's still seeing the white lights flashing and then they went steady! i ran in the house and sat down in amazement at what just happened i recall not feeling threatened while being stuck in place! but that night the dreams started coming to me! i work up crying and screaming! i remember being terrified out of my mind without knowing what happened but i felt it was them!! something happened!! the next day after 1pm i went to the store..I took my phone out and started taking pictures of people doing odd things and what i caught is way more than i bargained for! i blew the pictures up and tried to enhance them to get a clear view of what this thing was but it didn't help! i'm the pictures you will see what appears to be an alien!!! follwimg me, staring at me!! i'm not sure but i haven't been the same since these things have taken place!! look at the pictures and tell me what you think! i wish someone could help me with the quality of the photos!!\r\nalso as i blew up my other photos i took that day i see something else on the other side of the street that look like the

(i've owned some decent telescopes an have done a number of hours of constellation watching even at that time in my life).  i pointed it out to my girlfriend and we both just watched thinking it was just bizarre at this point.  for about five minutes it just slowly explored the sky from one end to another and not consistently moving in a straight lines, it would do some angles and soft bends.   then it would stop for 2-3 minutes and just twinkle.  then at about ten minutes in it started to pick up speed after one of its \"rests\".  the best way to describe the movement is to take a laser pointer and start doing erratic patterns on the ceiling including 180's bends, loops etc.  when it would do a 180, there was -zero- sign of acceleration or deceleration.  so zero inertia properties??  totally unreal to see an object do that.  it would do its patterns for about 2-3min and then just stop and stay still.   zero reason i could see.  about 140 degrees of sky was visible when you looked up that night as we were on a hill.  it was exploring about 90-100 degrees of the sky as you looked straight up.   so that is to say covering enormous distances if it was that high up.  i could cover that whole 90 swath of sky in less than a second, and it didn't have to do it straight, it could bend it or zig zag or go straight.   what speed is that!  imagine.  \r\nso.  at this point we had been watching it for 30min.  and just not knowing what to do but just stare. then it stopped again for one of its \"rests\".  \r\nthen,... this is the crazy part.   when it was stopped there twinkling.  what looked like a shooting star lit up a streak almost hitting it...... but it wasn't a shooting star....  it looked like a shooting star hitting the brakes.  so a streak of light about covering about 10 degrees of the sky looking up, going from what looked like light speed, warp speed, down to the pace a satellite moves.   ... then it just crawled past at the first object at a satellite pace, got about 5 degrees by the first object, missing each other by two degrees...And then accelerated back to \"warp\" speed generating that same trail of white light, ... and the second object was gone...\r\nthe first object then traced the path of the second object as it got into it's flight path and (tried to follow? the second objects path to warp speed? it did this at its \"laser pointer on the ceiling speed\" which is extremely fast, but not turn your ship into stream of storing star light speed apparently :|)   i don't know what to say, other than thinking 20 years ago, \"does this stuff happen all the time up there and i haven't just been looking??\"   so the crazy part here and there are many, is that they were \"aware\" of each other.  holy crap.  and that really freaked us out... we started to get really scared thinking that if that twinkling star could communicate and see that other object, maybe it could see that we were watching it, and we got very scared and started running back to the car... drove off freaked right out and looking out the windows to see if anything was following us.  it was still in the sky as we ran back to the car, but by the time we got home about 10 minutes later and looked up we didn't see anything.    so thats it.   i've been telling anybody who was interested that story for 20 years and everybody just said i'm either stupid or just flat out wrong..  my girlfriend even turned on me after a couple weeks changing her story to \"we didn't see anything\".\r\n\r\nso take it for what you will.  that's all there is.\r\nthe crazy things here:\r\nthis craft and the (beings?) inside (unmanned?) has the ability to act and move without feeling the effects of inertia,.. f#&king crazy.\r\ntwo:  what was the purpose of what it was doing these seemingly pointless patterns in the sky and then pausing?   it came to me that if you open your mind,.. maybe there was no goal... they were having fun with the ship?.  it was friday night fun?.. they were teenagers with \"dad's\" car.   ever consider that?   \r\nthree:   there is such a thing as \"light speed\".... if not light speed, so fast you become invisible, no more light streak behind you.\r\nfour:  there's more than one of these things -and- while doing light speed you can actually sense there's some punk in front of you \"doing dough nuts all over the path\".  at the very least the second ship had to be aware that the first ship was out there and there was a possibility of collision.\r\n\r\nfor your own understanding, to give you an idea if you raise your thumb to the sky and give the thumbs up sign to the sky, the span of your thumb is covering what i'm calling 2 degrees of sky for the purpose of imagery.\r\n\r\none thing has occurred to me, what really stands out here is the observation of hyper speed.  and the these things can communicate with each other even if they are from different \"squadrons?\"  or more different races?... we'll never know the relationship between the two...\r\n\r\noh ya, the whole thing was completely silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(this area was a scene of many civil war engagements).\r\n\r\nwe had not been in this new area very long when my metal detector started sounding.  after digging about 16 to 18 inches, we found the source.  it is a silver colored metal that is about 3 inches at its widest point, and about 4 1/2 inches in length.  it only weighs 109.96 grams, but looks like it should weigh much more.\r\n\r\nin addition to being light in weight,  it appears that it had been molten when it came into contact with the soil.  the bottom clearly shows it hit the soil while molten because of the rough pits, obviously caused by the damp soil giving off steam from the heat.  the top looks like a smooth molten blob of metal.  (see pictures).\r\n\r\nit is important to note that soil in this area is very hard, red clay.  as such, everything we have ever found had been stained a reddish color by the clay.  \r\n\r\nmy first thought was that it was possibly aluminum, however; i have found aluminum cans at much more shallow depths, that were not only stained red by the clay, but displayed extensive degradation through the oxidation process of being buried in this highly acidic red clay.\r\n\r\nthe fragment we found, as i mentioned earlier, was buried quite deep by comparison, yet showed absolutely no sign of red staining nor degradation whatsoever.  it was just a curiosity to me at the time, and we kept scouring the area.\r\n\r\nwe wound up finding a very large quantity of different types of metal than the first piece mentioned above, but they too showed no sign of staining or degradation.\r\n\r\ni make jewelry, so different metals interest me.  about a year after obtaining it, i ran across it.  using my jewelers fine toothed electric band-saw, i cut a piece about 1 inch long off of it.\r\n\r\ni also started handling it more many times.  not long afterward, i started having numerous dental & respiratory problems.  i lost a few teeth, and will have to get more removed.  there was a period of time while i was handling it quite a bit, that my fingertips became and stayed numb and/or tingling.\r\n\r\nit has other strange properties, specifically when it involves magnetism, and in a very short time i associated my symptoms with the metallic pieces.\r\n\r\nabout one month after the last time i handled the metal, the numbness in my fingertips went away.\r\n\r\nsometime after that, i started watching various television programs with my grandson in which your organization was mentioned.\r\n\r\ni would welcome providing samples of the various fragments we found, especially the piece that hit the earth while molten.  \r\n\r\ni would like to have a metallurgist inspect and try to identify what this metal is.\r\n\r\nwhile taking pictures of this specimen, each attempt to take a picture of the end of the larger piece, ended up out of focus. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":74334,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.987766900000004,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02062016-0008","longitude":-81.2292507,"occurred":1375369200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1454781368000,"summary":"Fragments found with metal detector","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":87,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":80,"meanvism":13,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":2,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":87,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":80,"meanvism":13,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":2,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":919,"locationName":"Lexington, South Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:91303"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Lake Oswego","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I already gave a description in my first report but had to send a second\r\none because i uploaded the wrong video.","distance":"501 Feet -

photos to with it is this so i remember walking out side ihad been watching the skies constantly since i had my firsrt ufo experience in september 2015 a few weeks before i watched a orange ball fly around in ways that had me like a exited kid for weeks anyway when i was in my back yard on oct 1st and looked up in time to see a very strange object appear out of nowhere and it began to do things i have a hard time explaining ( the pics i took do a better job of explaining ) but of what i can say is it began to light up pulse change colors and kinda crackle  with energy then i noted a second object that kinda liked like some creature or entity begin to attack the light object even looked like a few smaller creatures were attacking too then the light object  turned bright white and it looked like it made the entity light up white then it looked like holes opened up in the air then it was gone all of it and the very weird part is i don't remember anything afterwards i even forgot about it completely until the next day or so until i found the pics on my phone then the memory's came back to me for the most part but its still feels really weird in my head i'm very glad i have the photos i study them allot and it helps but the whole thing is strange any way i want to share this with who ever wants share their thought s with me and like i said i have other things on photo, audio and video and its a few different things like paranormal things i am ready to share with the world.....Btw i feeling been allot lot more humbled and consciencely aware of the universe since i've been

hanging in the air. i stopped in the road got out of my car and i could see very clearly a saucer type craft hovering over the top of some pine trees. i was sixteen yrs old and had just got lucky with

looking out the windows i could see three beings looking at me i was out in the country and i was alone no houses for miles.After i saw the aliens i suddenly got scared and jumped in my car and i can't remember driving home but the next morning when i got out of bed i remembered everything that i have told you in this letter.     i never told anyone it changed my life i've spent fortyfour

friend and i just got back from the store, the house is located on the bay and is a two story building. as i was walking through the living room i noticed an extremely bright white light outside over the bay, at first i thought it was a reflection on the big bay windows but it seemed strange so i walked up to the window and cupped my hands on the window. it was then that i knew whatever i was looking at wasn't a reflection, star, or moon. it was absolutely unmistakable for anything else. this craft was hovering about 5 or 600 ft off the water, it looked like a perfect circle and just sitting there, it was the brightest pure white i'v ever seen but not hard to look at, not like looking into the sun. as it just sat there a few moments and just as i was saying to myself, \"what is this thing\" it darted about 300ft to my left headed in a southwest direction, then stopped staying at an altitude of about 500ft. then again shot strait towards the water back into the bay at a 45 degree angle right into the water, or so it seemed, it was just gone, no noise, splash, nothing that i could hear but i was inside. every time it \"jumped\" or darted it left a tracer behind it sort of like if you wave a glow stick real fast at night it will leave streaks. i couldn't believe what i had just witnessed and ran over and got my friends from the other room telling them what i just saw but what i was surprised to hear is that right before we got back from the store my friends girlfriend said that she thought she had seen something darting around over the bay but when she approached the window she saw nothing. the craft was at least in the area for 20 minutes, my viewing lasted no longer than 2 min. next morning we were sitting outside on the porch drinking coffee discussing the sighting from the night before when we heard a helicopter getting louder and louder until we saw it flying right over the top of the house heading strait back into the bay where i saw the craft dart

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We live in kirkland near the shore of lake washington. the west side of our home faces the lake and is covered with floor to ceiling windows. from all three levels of our home we have an unobstructed 180 degree view of north seattle, from the noaa facility at sand point in the south, all the way up to sheridan beach in the north. on the night of 1 april 2015, my 11 year old daughter decided to sleep with me in my room. the bedroom lights were off and we were ready to fall asleep. after a moment or two, my daughter noticed an aircraft flying south in the sky over north seattle and she asked me if what she was seeing was an airplane. we both agreed that the aircraft in the sky was not moving like an airplane. seconds after that, we noticed that there was a solid white orb higher in the sky to the right. we were commenting to each other about how bright it was and wondering what it was because it was stationary in the sky. it looked like a tiny full moon. as our eyes were fixed on the orb, an object deployed out of the bottom of the orb. the object descended vertically and rapidly for a distance and then without decelerating, it made a 90 degree turn and began flying south. once it began to fly south we could see it was a domed-shaped disc. the bright white orb began moving around the sky but no more discs were deployed.  a moment after that, multiple domed-shaped discs began to appear in the sky, but i do not know where they were coming from. they began appearing out of nowhere. \r\nmy daughter and i began to realize that there were also bright colored lights flashing in the sky. they flashed and moved rapidly, changing location frequently, disappearing and then reappearing. we determined that there were three distinctly different types of objects in the sky…domed-shaped discs, bright white orbs and flashing colored lights. soon there were up to 15 objects in total flying in the sky. the time that elapsed from seeing the first object until seeing 15 objects in the sky was about 2-3 minutes. it began to occur to me that i couldn’t hear any sound, so i slid open our large windows and listened. there was absolutely no sound coming from any of the many objects that were in the sky. i was surprised to not hear anything with all the flight activity in the sky. we are accustomed to seeing and hearing commercial aircraft in the area, as well as smaller private aircraft and seaplanes, and you can hear all of those whether our windows are open or closed. after noting that there was no sound, i asked my daughter to check the time, it was 2217.  i also asked my daughter to go get binoculars. \r\nmy daughter and i continued to watch as the domed-shaped discs flew around the sky. i viewed them through binoculars, she through her naked eye. the crafts and their lights could be seen well with naked eye, but seen extremely well with binoculars. the distance from our shoreline in kirkland, to the shoreline in north seattle, is approximately 1 mile. the discs were flying approximately another .5 mile to the west of the north seattle shoreline. so we were witnessing this from a distance of approximately 1.5 miles. the discs were smooth and metallic silver. there were two large bright white lights, one on each “end/edge” and red and green, and occasionally blue, lights flashed both rhythmically and randomly at three tiered levels of the central area of the craft.  \r\nsome discs flew a flight path from sand point to sheridan beach and back, repeatedly, in an elongated oval flight pattern. other discs flew randomly. my daughter made a comment that some of the discs’ flight behavior gave the impression they were searching for something or mapping something because of the precise patterns they continually repeated, and other discs appeared to be playing with each other in the sky because of their seemingly random and playful maneuvers while interacting with each other. at one point, three different discs were coming in from three different directions heading on a collision course towards each other at an extremely high rate of speed. if they would have continued further they would have collided, but instead, they reached a close range from one another and then abruptly stopped dead in the sky, forming a triangle formation, pausing for 10 or 15 seconds and then breaking formation and resuming flight, accelerating rapidly from a standstill. \r\nwe observed discs frequently change directions during flight. they did this by rotating while staying on the same horizontal plane, in other words, they did not bank or tip to turn. when they would change direction they would not decelerate. we witnessed discs making 90 degree turns without decelerating, and once the directional changed was accomplished the disc would sometimes accelerate even more rapidly, disappearing from sight in an instant. of all the discs flying in the sky, two consistently remained stationary. the first static disc was positioned over the noaa building at sand point, the other was just to the left of that and further away in the distance.\r\nabout 5-7 minutes into this amazing flight show, things really got interesting. i had my binoculars fixed on one particular disc as it was flying south. my daughter was also looking at the same disc, but with naked eye. we were having a conversation about that particular disc. i could see this disc very clearly. all of the sudden the disc began a slow bank to the east. prior to and while initiating its turn it appeared as a disc. then mid-bank, it morphed into a black triangle.  as it was tipped fully vertical i could see that it was an equilateral triangle. a complete triangle, there were no notches, and it was low profile, no dome. my daughter and i both gasped at the same time when this happened. it was incredible. she too witnessed the transformation, but with her naked eye. the disc literally morphed into a triangle in front of our eyes. the shape was not the only thing that changed. the lights were different too. the triangle began flying east, towards kirkland. once it fully turned heading east, its distinguishing feature became an extremely bright singular light located on the right of the triangle, just back a bit from the front tip. at a distance of approximately 1.5 mile, the light was very bright in our eyes, like the brightness of a stadium light. at a distance of about 1 mile, it was difficult to continue to look at the craft through binoculars because of the intense brightness. as the triangle continued east, at a slow pace, the light intensified and became too unbearable to view through binoculars and i had to drop my binoculars and put both my hands in front of my eyes.  i positioned my hands to blot out the light, but still be able to see the underside of the triangle. there were no lights on the underside of the triangle. there were no lights anywhere else on the craft except for the singular light on the front right that was blinding us. this becomes important to note because something very interesting occurred as the triangle passed the shoreline of north seattle and began flying east over lake washington. with my hands above my eyes i couldn’t view the entire triangle. i could only see the underside of it and the geography of land and water below. i knew the triangle had passed beyond the shore of north seattle because a bridge of light appeared on the lake. the light appeared on the lake directly below the position of the aircraft, not in front of it, never in front of it, but only directly below it. so, because of this, i could gauge how far across the lake the triangle was coming based off of the bridge of light on the water. but there was no light being emitted from the underside of the triangle that would account for the bridge of light appearing on the lake directly below the craft. the bridge of light was an amazing color of white. very bright white, but a cool white light, easy to look at. the bridge of light was straight-edged and the same width running the entire length. imagine a ruler. there was no diffused light or fading out of light onto the water beyond the left and right edges of the bridge of light. only a straight edge of light, total darkness of the lake on the left and right of the bridge of light. the width of the bridge of light was three houses wide. this bridge of light was directly underneath the central area of the triangle. so, the central portion of the triangle was three houses wide. so, in estimating the total “wing span” or width of the triangle from left tip to right tip, my guess would be in excess of 300 feet. as this triangle continued to fly further east, the origin of the bridge of light continued to touch, or maintain contact with, the shoreline of north seattle and never faded in intensity from its point of origin on the shore even as the triangle continued to fly east while the bridge of light beneath it stretched east in following the path of the craft. there was definitely no light emanating from the underside of the triangle, only a bridge of light being created on the water. it gave me the impression that the central portion of the triangle was electrically or chemically interacting with the surface of the water.  based on the distance the bridge of light extended east across the lake, i could see that the triangle had flown half way across the lake. so i was now viewing the triangle from a distance of .5 mile. the triangle was nearly completely straight ahead of us, it was just slightly to the left of dead center of our house. the light coming from the front of the craft was so intense my eyes were watering. my daughter couldn’t stand the light any longer so she turned around and sat on the floor and covered her head with her arms. she was very upset and felt like she was in danger. i remained standing in front of my open window with the craft continuing on a slow approach directly in front of me. this triangle was enormous and there was absolutely no sound. the triangle then made an abrupt 90 degree turn on a horizontal plane and accelerated to the south and was completely gone in an instant. even upon acceleration, there was no sound. a few seconds after that, a disc that was flying over north seattle also began to morph into a triangle and fly across the lake too, but this was occurring further south near sand point. i believe this was a second morphing disc. i do not believe this was the first morphing disc just reappearing in a different location. this second morphing disc didn’t make it very far across the lake before it instantly turned 90 degrees and flew south and was gone from view in a flash. \r\nat that same moment, my daughter and i began hearing a high-pitched sound originating from the north and closing in fast. it was auditorily obvious that the military was coming. two jets came from the north, flying south straight down the center of the lake. they flew below the tree line in a front to back formation. they were flying so low i could see the side of their jets without tipping my head to look up. the jets were dark grey with no markings and there were no lights. they showed up at approximately 2230. they ripped down the lake and just kept going. all the objects flying in the sky above north seattle, the domed-shaped discs, the flashing colored lights and the solid white spheres, did not alter their behavior. these objects seemed unaffected and/or undeterred by the military fly-by. likewise, the military did not linger, it was as if they just zipped by to get a look. \r\nmy daughter and i watched the activity in the sky over north seattle for about another 15 more minutes from my bedroom. my daughter was tired and shaken. she wanted to sleep but did not want to leave my side because her nerves were shot and she was frightened. she would not lay down in my bed because she did not want to be far from me, but i wanted to continue to observe from the window. we compromised to move down to her bedroom on the main level, which is directly below my bedroom. her bed is much closer to the window. we moved to her room and she got in bed. i continued to look out the window and watch until the last object disappeared from the sky. the last object to leave was the disc that was stationary hovering over the noaa building the entire time. the duration of these events that i witnessed was from 2215 to 2325, 70 minutes. i got in bed with my daughter since she made me promise her i would stay in her room all night and sleep with her. i fell asleep in bed next to her. i was nearest to the windows. the entire west wall of her room is windows, with no window coverings.  at some point later i started to wake up. i began to consciously become aware of the room. i was lying on my back with my head tilted toward the windows. i began to open my eyes. my eyes were fully open and my mind was fully aware when i saw the center window begin to change. the first thing i noticed was that there was light “dancing” around the outside of the window. brilliant jewel-toned blue, green and red lights were flickering outside the window. the lights began to intensify in color and movement, it seemed the lights were coming closer to the glass. there began to be white twinkles incorporated into the colored lights. then i saw a gentle ripple-type effect on the glass and the glass seemed like it was watery and vibrating and then the glass opened up like an aperture on a camera. i could see the colored and twinkling lights so clearly, swirling at the window opening…it was like looking at a mini universe. then four small beings walked through the opening and into the room and positioned themselves at the foot of the bed. they looked like stereotypical “greys”. they were nearly identical in size and all were about 4’ tall. they were humanoid, with large heads and large black eyes and long thin arms and hands. their integumentary system was grey and appeared thick with some areas of their face and body having deep creases, giving each one individual character. they took up position at the foot of the bed with two standing very near each other on the right, one standing more to the left and one slightly behind the others in the gap between. there was a definite hierarchy/job division amongst them. the one in the back was in charge of the group. the pair to the right collected data and the singular one on the left recorded the data. the two data collectors wore a device on their left wrist or possibly held it in their hand. it was hard to tell which because the device twinkled with colored light so i couldn’t quite distinguish if the device was attached to their wrist like a watch or if it was being held in their hand. the device did not make any sound. their presence in the room was totally silent. the singular data recorder being was not holding any type of device, it recorded data in its mind that was transmitted to its mind from the pair of data collectors. \r\ni was lying on my back but couldn’t move my body. it was like my body was shut down but i was able to breathe and my eyes and mind worked. i knew my daughter was asleep because i could hear the way she was breathing. the greys did not speak to each other through spoken language. they communicated with one another through their thoughts and i could clearly hear and understand their thoughts.  the first communication among them was initiated from the pair of data collectors when they looked at us. they seemed surprised. i heard “there are two.” they were referring to my daughter and myself. i got the sense that they were not surprised by finding two people sleeping in one room, but rather that they were surprised by finding two identical people side by side. this discovery seemed to intellectually stimulate them. the pair on the right began taking readings from us at a distance with their wrist devices. i was able to understand what type of information was being relayed from the pair collecting the data to the singular one recording the data. just by pointing the device in our direction they instantly knew everything about our biophysiology. they read our vital signs, the size and weight of our body and individual organs. they read our body mass index, blood type and ph. they knew our blood and tissues were healthy, our system was free from sickness or disease. they knew our age. they knew i had reproduced and that my daughter had not. they knew our eye color and read our dermal ridging. they took particular note of the length of our hair and fingernails. they read how fast our synapses were firing. they measured our brain waves. they were able to ascertain everything about our biochemical-electrical system from a distance. then detailed information began to transmit about our dna. not long into the dna scan, something was discovered about our sequencing that led to an interesting conversation between the pair of data collectors and the one in charge that resulted in all of them immediately ceasing and leaving. i do not want to share that conversation publicly here, but i will share that information privately with a mufon investigator. when they left the room i was able to move. i am guessing the duration of this entire event was less than 5 minutes. i was shaken and could not go back to sleep, i stayed up the rest of the night. my daughter slept through the whole thing. \r\nthe domed-shaped discs, flashing colored lights and solid white orbs returned in the sky every evening for the next 6 nights, from 2 april to 7 april. but on those six nights the only thing that occurred was flight activity over north seattle, there were no more triangles flying over the lake, no military fly-bys and no more visits by greys. i have amazing video footage that i shot that week and also footage from 27 may (which involved a fly-by along the kirkland side of the waterfront by a huge black helicopter on the morning of 28 may). also noteworthy to mention is that every night for the first half of april 2015 there was a very large, very bright, very colorful sparkling ball in the w – nw sky. it was a long distance away in the sky. it was a large sphere that twinkled blue, red, green. it was very, very bright. in one of my videos it appears closer in the sky and one of the flying crafts flew close to it and there was an amazing interaction between the two. it was phenomenal. i am submitting one digital photo. if you zoom in you can see along the central horizontal portion of the pic there are two objects, a small spec of yellow/green light more to the left and on the right you will see a large disc. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

observed what i thought were three airplanes to the west low over the horizon.  the objects appeared to be stationary and were shining brightly, we are local to the area and are near several airports so my first thought was airplanes with their landing lights on.  it struck me as odd though that they didn't seem to be on any of the usual flightpaths over thee area.  we soon came to a stop at the intersection of garey ave. and orange grove ave. just south of the 10 fwy. while we were waiting at the light in the left hand turn lane i noticed a blinking red light moving south to north in the direction of the other lights.  this red light was dimmer than the three white light and blinking, i believe though i am not certain that this was a helicopter of small plane.  once this other object nears the other they start to noticeably move this is when i realized i was looking at something unusual, the three lights moved in unison as if was a single craft and if it was it was big. i noticed that the object seemed to pitch slightly side to side as it was moving and the lights stayed in perfect formation.  its motion was smooth across the sky and was now moving west to east north of us and 10 fwy with the fourth light flying along side.  i was a bit in aww of what i was seeing my girlfrind was with me and was a bit nervous and frighted she was a skeptic until that day. the object continued moving east north of the 10 fwy and south of the san gabriel mountains, we lost sight of the craft after our view was blocked by trees and building.  later on my girlfriend learned that her friend witnessed the same craft in rancho cucamonga around the same time that night, she posted photos on her facebook and stated that it was seen by hundreds at los osos high school football game and everyone was taking pictures. there are also videos of the object on youtube search (11-6-15 ufo rancho cucamonga) ","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The date was december 20 2014, just a few days before christmas. me and my mother are sitting in the living room as my sister is in her room. i was waiting the arrival of a friend who was visiting us for the holidays to stop in to say hi. i had nothing planned at all to go outside, i was concerned my friend had driven past our house or was lost since we are still fairly new to the area. so i got up to go out front to check to see if i could spot her driving down our street. the very moment i walked out of our front door my eyes immediately took to the sky over the split level house across the street from us and the high school and football field behind that house. if you were to be outside at that time nobody could miss these lights. \r\n\r\ni did a double take because at first my eyes played tricks on me making me think they were an airplane or a few airplanes flying but i noticed they were not coming nor going in any direction and even as i first thought that they were conventional aircraft i noticed that something wasn't adding up, it just looked too strange and so unfamiliar. it was a striking feeling, almost a strong sense of feeling intrigued. it was so sudden and such a strong feeling that i started to look around at the neighbors houses to see if anyone was staring at the sky along with me but no one was out due to the bitter cold weather. so at this time i can only see about 3 of the lights because the house and pine trees on their property was blocking the other two light orbs. so i immediately noticed that these lights were on an angle all in perfect formation on about a 70-75 degree angle id have to say. so as i noticed this i realized i had to move over more, so i moved to my right in the driveway which revealed the other 2 glowing orange orbs also in formation in a line. i stared for about 20 seconds, just enough time for me to run through any possibilities of what these lights could be. i thought maybe its planes but wait no, ok maybe its flares, but no it cant be because theyre not falling to the ground, theyre not one solid color, theyre in formation, and theyre not burning out. \r\n\r\nat this point now i realize im looking at a ufo sighting so i run inside and yell to my mother. my exact words were \"mom come here and look hurry, i see a ufo in the sky!\" she hurried towards the door and she noticed them right away, i didn't have to even point them out to her in the sky. we stared at these lights for about another 20 seconds making the event about a full minute. however i do not know how long they were in the sky and i was mad at myself for not going outside sooner actually. anyway as we stared and just watched in amazement, they hovered in a line and flickered with a soft glow and it was hard to tell if they were vibrating or not. maybe it was the light that made it look like they were vibrating. suddenly the last orb on the right side at the lowest elevation broke formation and just seemed to hover over to the left underneath the one next to it. they seemed to be acting like a person who was messing with a dimmer switch in your house, slowly going brighter and dimmer but in a particular order it seemed like. \r\n\r\nalmost like a pattern or communication with a type of light sign language. i did also try to focus in with my eyes and if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, i may have seen what looked to be an outline of an almost invisible or transparent looking big craft and it seemed like these lights were on the bottom. for a second i couldn't make out if it was separate lights or one huge craft and these lights were on the what appeared to be the tail end of a huge craft that was not a just a round shape but round and almost like it had a tail on the end of it. like the stern end of a ship, only on an aircraft. kind of like a huge wing on the back end with lights. it was an odd shape, hard to tell for sure if it was fully round, an egg shape, round with a tail shape in the rear, or triangular in shape. a boomerang kept coming to my mind the whole time i was watching it. and idk why, it was like instant i thought of a boomerang even though i couldnt see anything other then lights. it was as if i could almost make out a faint outline of the rest of the craft, like it was designed that way.\r\n\r\nso anyway after the last on lowest in elevation broke formation, it went to its left under the next orb and continued to flicker softly in an apparent pattern and then it floated back to its position and as we pointed at them and talked together all of the lights started to go more dim and die out but they also went out in order as well. they went out in order from top to bottom, slowly dying out not just cutting off. it was dark mind you, clear skies but dark so it was hard to tell if i was seeing an outline of one big ship or a separate one next to the lights to the left. now that i have time to think about it all, i'm fairly certain the lights were all individual separate lights because they all seemed to die out slowly, and i just very slightly could see what looked like them each darting off instantly and almost a very dull soft white glowing hazy glow to them as they darted off one by one after dying out. it was so strange because i recall that they seemed to be fast yet slow all at the same time. as the bottom one moved over as i said, it seemed to be both fast and slow like some kind of projection almost or like it was playing tricks on you. the orbs also moved so smoothly though, as if they were on a track. think of the motion of a ball berring or a on a horizontal track, very smooth and in perfect straight lines.\r\n\r\n it was so odd to describe but i know what i saw. it was like they were dancing in the sky or vibrating and when they moved it was like smeared image like as if your computer mouse is moving fast but skipping ever half a second because your computers freezing up momentarily. they were all in a perfect, ascending line, 5 of them, orange/red glow that was almost hypnotizing in nature. and i felt as if it was wanting to be seen due to it being out in a perfectly clear night in the dark, and five days before christmas. it seemed like they were scanning something or searching the ground. they didn't even disappear until i started pointing at them with my mother while talking. as if they knew. during this time i never really felt afraid or intimidated, i was just very intrigued, interested and amazed and actually felt privileged to have a sighting. i did for a moment feel as if they knew we were watching but i thought about all the other people possibly watching and it didn't bother me. so nothing frightening. oh i should mention the lights seemed to be at about idk a thousand feet maybe, just under where the clouds would be if there were clouds out but it was such a clear sky that night so it was hard to tell the elevation. but they were low, very low in elevation. \r\n\r\nthey were about a mile or just under a mile away from my house where we were standing and at about a 70 degree angle from us to the lights. maybe that helps with a mental image of their elevation. the sky around them was kind of wavy looking like heat waves on a hot black top that you see in the summer time. and as i said i'm pretty sure they were all separate lights but i couldn't help but look at them and squint as if i was seeing a transparent outline of something bigger, something i couldn't make out shape wise. that's why so many shapes came to my mind but a boomerang shape just stuck, it seemed like i knew its shape without being able to see it fully. but for the record i can only say they were orbs in a formation as described and the rest of what i saw could've been my mind merely seeing what it wanted to. everything else here is 100 percent accurate and true and that's exactly how it happened in order. i saw them, studied them, one moved to the left and then back again in line, then they died out perfectly in succession as if they were on a timer or being controlled and this happened all in about just under a minute. about 40 seconds. i wouldn't know how long they were there before i came outside just by chance though.\r\n\r\n i feel a certain level of responsibility to post all this for the record. especially because at the time of the sighting,and i also had just had a very strange experience in my sleep just weeks before this sighting. i have a history of seeing paranormal things and strange experiences and during some of said experiences i had witnesses with me . i do use my telescope from time to time so i'm used to looking at the sky and the stars and planes. but i just knew id miss something if i went to grab my camera or telescope so i stayed and sure enough they started to disappear a few seconds after  my mother has suggested i run to get them, they started to fade away and seemingly dart off into the dark night sky... this is my story. i am posting this a year later because as i went to post it the first time i didnt know if i should talk about it on a public forum and bring it to light due to a small amount of fear and because i simply procrastinated in doing so. it was the next day or the following day that i was driving down rt. 13 near my house when i saw a convoy of military trucks coming down the road which i never ever see by the way, and if i did before it wasnt to this extent. they had stopped along the road and two soldiers were just crouching down combing the grass with their hands as a superior seemed to be watching overhead. i also want to mention that i checked the news the next day and i heard nothing of this sighting, not a peep. this is why i have been so conflicted on sharing my story because i dont know what it all means. nonetheless i couldnt make this up if i tried and this is what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
