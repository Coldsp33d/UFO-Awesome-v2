that time i lived nearby at 8 longcroft avenue, harpenden, hertfordshire, england. shortly after entering the park i looked up at the clear night sky and noticed an unusual ball of orange/red light traversing the sky slowly at a fixed altitude and direction coming from approx. nw. it was larger than any star and initially i thought it might be a aircraft, however it was noiseless and exhibited no flashing white navigation light, nor a red or green wing light. at this point i felt transfixed by the object and became fearful as it was travelling in my direction and something felt 'odd' about it. i would estimate that when it was about a mile away it made a 90 degree turn to the se, maintaining height and the same speed (comparable, say, to a piston engined aircraft at cruise speed). as it turned, the shape mutated into an oval and again i saw no navigation lights that one might expect as it did so. the object then continued on this new track for a minute or two and then rapidly accelerated at an amazing rate, continuing on the same course, again with no sound and disappeared from view as it shrank due to distance. i was riveted to the spot for a while and felt deeply disturbed with my arm hair 'on end'. i returned home quickly. the following day, i reported my observation to the local newspaper, the herts advertiser, who expressed no interest but curiously, about a week later, while in the garden of my home at about the same time i saw another light in the sky approaching me. this was identifiably a large plane which flew over my home at a very low height of only a few hundred feet which aircraft are not supposed to do. i imagined that this was some kind of deliberate act to discourage my 'ufo sighting'. in that era there was no internet or anyone else i could think of to report this. i only today happened to visit your site and found the 'report a sighting' link, so i did so. out of curiosity i searched online for 'ufo sighting harpenden' and found 2 links to articles in the same newspaper i originally contacted decades ago, both in this area, one very nearby, dated july 2009 and sep 2010. i can provide links to my observation point on google maps and those 2 newspaper articles. apologies for this late submission but i'm glad that it is now reported. it still makes my hair stand on end when i think about it.","distance":"Over One

following my usual routine of watching the clouds move, when i caught something out of the corner of my eye. it was a large semi-triangular object, and it seemed that it came out from behind the clouds. i thought it was a plane until i saw the flashing lights on the side of it were not the typical lights that you would see on an airplane. they were yellow, green and white and the flashed in a pattern of green, then white, then yellow, repeatedly. i would say the craft was approximately 30-40 feet long and 15 feet tall. it was moving in a fairly straight line. it started out going northeast, then made a sharp turn and headed true north until i could not see it anymore. it also made a unexplainable sound, similar to the sound of high frequency. obviously at this point i

center somewhere between 7:15-7:40am. remembering i told my family i would take a photo from my hotel of the beautiful landscape and the vegas city skyline. i opened my curtain on this sunny morning. i got my phone ready and began to scan the view for the best picture. after a quick glance i noticed a hot air balloon to the right it was a typical looking hot air balloon. i looked to the left side of my window and noticed a dark shape that seemed contrast in color and shape against the mountain chain. i looked a few moments longer and thought wow that large shape is actually moving. i starred for a few moments and came to the firm conclusion that the object was indeed moving slowly left to right from my viewpoint. after a few minutes of personal viewing i thought i might take a video cause no one will believe me. so i began to take video and a short time into it the video stopped and a message of lack of storage came up. i thought to myself- i should have bought the 32gb phone. any way, i took a few moments to clear up some storage glancing up to make sure the craft was still there, and it was still moving almost hovering as it had been doing. i cleared the necessary memory and began to take a picture and video again. i wondered what it could be moving so slow it didn't look like any blimps i have seen at sporting events. it was moving too slow for conventional aircraft, it seemed large for a drone. at one point i quickly pan to the right to see the hot air balloon i had seen earlier to give some perspective. in addition, you can see cars driving underneath. while the first video is a bit shaky i made sure to lean on the window support to try to steady the video. after about four minutes i stopped recording because i had get my rear downstairs to work my booth at our
