the key bank building, and so i zoomed in and found that the figure has a metal look to it.  i first got other opinions and when even my professors told me \"i have no clue what that is\" i knew i caught something literally out of this world.  at first i was a skeptic and thought it was a plane, but there are no wings, maybe a bird, but again no wings and no head.  i finally smartened up and concluded it was a ufo.  the object was unnoticed until my photo analysis was finished, so the movement on the second photo was the little light that shot into the distance.  i felt as though there was a different presence while we were both shooting, but i could not put my finger on it.  it was a weird comfort i had up until the object shot off.  the sunrise was suppose to be at 7:45am and the photos were documented at 7:15am.  there was cloud cover all over, but the object was in sight under the cloud cover, which means it was flying too low in the city for a plane.  sight was lost when it

quickly and was too large to be one. i alerted the other two witnesses, and they watched with me as it passed overhead. it looked to be slightly bigger than an airplane, and at one point passed behind a small cloud on its path, so i know it was travelling at a high altitude. it maintained a steady speed. i don't believe it was a meteor because it didn't give off much light, and it moved across the entire sky without disappearing or breaking up. the shape was very difficult to make out, because it was dim and opaque, but my best estimation is that it was an oval, or cigar. two thirds of the way through the event, the object changed color slightly and looked pink. we watched it until it moved behind the trees, and we couldn't see it anymore. i was excited to see my first potential ufo, and we discussed it at length and stayed outside watching the sky for a couple more hours, but we didn't see anything else out of the ordinary.

friend's house. we couldn't sleep so we went outside to play (around 0200 or later). to the north, i saw an orange light that was occasionally flashing coming towards us. i figured it was an aircraft or something. it took quite a while for it to reach my friend's house. as it got closer i noticed it was a triangle shape, we just learned about different airplanes from a field trip we took and i thought it looked like a concord jet. as it got even closer we realized it didn't have wings. it was an actual triangle, all black. the orange light was located at the front of the aircraft and was slowly flashing. there was another black triangle, slightly higher in altitude escorting the object, both moving at the same slow speed. the second black triangle didn't have a flashing light or any light at all. we could see both aircraft because of the size and the lack of starlight where the aircraft was located. the lowest aircraft flew almost over the top of us and was flying very low to the ground. the aircraft was not a normal size (it was much larger) for the airplanes we usually see flying in the area, nor was it flying at the altitude we usually see airplanes flying. at no point did it make any sound, even when it was at it's closest point it made absolutely no sound. we both figured it was just some airplane... we watched it slowly move across the sky to the south until we couldn't see it anymore. from what i remember it didn't have any effect on my friend or myself, or the several dogs he had.\r\none of the things that stood out the most, besides the lack of sound, was how slowly the object was moving.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
