very exciting story, but it is something that i can not explain. there is no explanation for what i saw. \r\n\r\nmy event took place in northern ireland and this story takes us back to either 2010, 2011 or possibly 2012. the truth is i can't remember, i think it was in 2011. i can't remember the time of year at all, if i had to guess i'd say april or may. \r\n\r\none night between 1am and 3am i was awoken from my sleep by our dog barking at something outside. i live in the country not really near anything. \r\nat first i assumed it was the dog barking at a fox or someting but as i lay there i noticed there was a much more vicious tone in her bark, so i assumed maybe there was an intruder or something. \r\nmy bedroom is on the second floor so i have a good view of our back yard and the fields at the back of the house. there is also a lot of trees around our property. \r\nso i went to the window looked out through my blinds and could see the dog looking in a north/ northeast direction. my parents room extends out from the back of the house and was blocking my view plus it was a bit dark to see anything clearly beyond the tree line. it was a particularly bright night as i could see the dog in the yard at 2 or 3 in the morning. she is white so easy to make out. \r\nanyway she continued and continued to bark for maybe 20 minutes. now the strange thing was that she was barking like she was about to attack something or someone (which was very very unlike this dog as she is very timid and friendly and would never really bark) but she was barking for this amount of time and my parents did not wake up and she was right below their room and my mum would be a very light sleeper. \r\nshe sort of stopped for a bit and i got back into bed. it was unlike me, i felt very uneasy for some reason. i knew something wasn't right so i couldn't sleep and then next thing maybe after 5 or 10 minutes the dog started going berserk again, and as i went to the window i couldn't see her any longer. \r\ni lifted the blinds completely up to improve my view. the next thing that happened is dorm thing i will never forget. \r\nthere was a huge huge bright explosion of light that lite up the entirety of outside and strangely for a light who's source was outside, it lite up the inside of my room completely. \r\nthe way i describe it to people is if someone took a photo of you on a disposable camera or something and held the the flash bit up at your eyes and took the photo you be blinded by the flash. it was like that expect strangely i wasn't blinded by it. \r\nit was a blue light, not yellow or white or a mix of colours, it was a really really bright blue powerful light. \r\nunfortunately the ending of this story doesn't end with me saying and then i saw a ufo. \r\ni have never been as afraid in my life, it was fear like i never felt. i turned, and ran straight for my bed. \r\ni don't remember getting into bed, or laying in bed thinking about what had just happened, or whether or not the dog continued to bark. i remember nothing after turning to run for my bed. \r\nstrangely i woke up the next morning not having remembered anything about the event. \r\nit was only maybe a week or possibly more i remembered and told my parents. \r\ni know there's nothing special about seeing a light, it could have been a guy doing some fox hunting in one of the fields behind our house with one of those powerful lamps, or maybe it was a bolt of lightening. well it was an extremely calm night and there was no weird weather and i can tell you it was no lamp. this light was so strong and lite absolutely everything up. \r\nthe  fact i can't remember even getting into bed creeps me out. \r\n\r\nanyway i hope you enjoyed reading about my experience.

going crazy despite the proof of the videos. i still question why me?\r\nstrangely by some unknown force or perhaps luck, i just ran into karla turners books a few days ago online and i am on the 3rd

over me. i don't remember her face, i recall seeing a childlike arm, the shirt was black. she had black hair and he, the male had a pointed chin, flesh colored but not human, and black eyes. i felt drugged. it was hard to move. i was trying to wake up, move and then i heard a male voice say my name and that is what broke the trance or whatever it was.\r\nanyway, i have more videos that i won't post...Videos of them talking and one is very disturbing...They are doing something to me and my mother is in the other room. it sounds like a drill and i clearly hear my own pain. \r\ni just want to know how to stop them. blessing the house, prayers from the bible helps me but they're here. they say they are trying to protect me but i learned recently they are the same two creatures from the

were aircraft flying over at one point i even saw one orb fly circles around jet as if it were playing with it only to veer off at a complete different direction almost a right angle these two craft were similar in size very visible with moon as backdrop i watched many different craft one closest to me had red pulsing lights that descended towards lake just behind my house and emerged moments later rising up in different path then descended a triangle shaped craft was observed but other than just being in vacinity it basically hovered all night and with multiple aircraft with red flashing lights at wing tips were also and can through the night i became a little spooked and went indoors to watch from windows when one yellowish lighted object flew above treelinesis when i think the helicopter was heard by me for first time around im guessing 5 am all this activities i tried to capture with my cellphone but my own ignorance could not figure out why camera would not work at this time luckily i resolved that next morning i observed all this till sunrise overcametoo bright to see i went in to sleep next waking on way to work an unusual cloud didnt take pic but got me to figure out issue with phone camera in daytime hours around noon i began watching skys again and with at least four jets in air all through day im thinken to grid pattern area observance more sightings in daytime which i do have videos of on phone maybe can be enhanced to capture better proof of what was in skys above and most visible craft to me was viewed and recorded on drive home along hwy aa there is a curve that speed reduced to 15mph with a gravel road offshoot i saw a two tone red and pinkish craft with a light at one end long and flat not red bottom pink top long slender hovering but not

was smoking a cigarette at the rear patio of my girlfriends apartment at 7:20pm local time, when a brilliant white rapidly blinking light crossed the sky from south west to north east direction, with a directional change resembling a snake's slither. the blinking light travelled very quickly, too fast for a satellite pass, then it stopped abruptly, and hovered for some time maybe a minute or so. the lights, lights multiple (as the brilliance of the strobe seemed to emanate from alternating point, very close to each-other) changed to bright red as the object then descended, straight vertically, paused, descended further, like a falling leaf, paused, at which time i had to stand on a chair to view over neighbours roof, the object/light then shot off at high speed at that altitude (tree-top) toward the north east, out of view. my girlfriend was in the shower when i first viewed the object, and i, very excitedly, asked her to wrap a towel around herself, and come out to see this thing. she did this, and also witnessed the object from the time it was descending for the first time. the sky was partly cloudy, but the object was in clear sky at first, and hovered long enough for the clouds to draw closer to it. the cloud-base was around 2000 to 3000 feet, and only when the cloud was in the same space did i realise that the object was smaller, and closer, than i had at first guessed, because it was just below the clouds before descending. it occurred to me that this might be a drone, but was travelling very fast, over a long distance, in controlled airspace, and a drone is not a usual thing to see in this area, day or night.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
