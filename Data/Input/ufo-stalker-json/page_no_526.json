over the peak of bear mtn,a 3thousand ft mtn. approximately 2 miles from my location.No movement just an unnatural looking extremely bright light.I went inside the store and brought my co. worker outside to see the light.We watched it for approximately 25minutes as it remained motionless. suddenly it began to resend.It moved slowly and in 30 seconds it disappeared behind the mtn. top.When it decended i knew what it wasn't but not what it was.We went back over to the front of the store where we normally hang out and were talking about what we just saw when out of the east came a giant craft.Being a usaf veteran i can attest that there is nothing like this in our inventory.I estimated it to be a half mile wide and i made its speed to be about 100mph.Its altitude was about 1 mile.It came right over us.The total time it took for it to pass overhead was 8 to 10 mins.The craft was the same color as an sr71 i had seen.A stealthy looking black.We noticed surface features like the craft was compartmentalized.It reminded me of being under my car at the shop when it was on the lift.We were a full service gas station and convenience store.A car came in for gas while the craft was passing over. we ignored the customer cause we were watching the ufoshe beeped her horn and asked for 15.In gas.We said we were  busy watching a ufo.Anyway i pumped her gas and we all watched it pass over.The customer left and we continued watching.Until the end of the ship passed over then we lost sight of it.It occurred to me later that the giant craft flight path was on a course straight for the strange glowing object we had seen earlier.Now 10 years after the event i have a almost compulsive desire to talk about it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

off to my right, towards the hillside.  as i got to the store/boat harbor area, i realized it was 3 blinking lights close together.  i thought maybe it was a remote control airplane or a drone, because it was really dark out, too late for planes to fly and too close to the hillside.  also the object was flying pretty fast.  i lost sight of it for a bit and drove on.\r\n     when i arrived at the school i could see the 3 girls swinging on the swing set waiting for me.  my daughter came running at me full speed waiving her arms.  she was all excited saying \"did u see that mom!!! it was a big drone or something right above us!! it hoovered right above us!!\"  i searched the sky above the school and caught site of the blinking lights.  3 colors, the object traveled fast, south, toward the church, then took a sharp left out toward the bay.  it headed strait to the airstrip fast! i thought it was going to land. my daughter wanted me to follow it.  i turned by the post office and headed for home.  we were almost back to the culvert when we spotted it heading our way from the airstrip.  it was still out over the bay, my daughter wanted me to stop the truck. she said it was coming closer to check us out, that freaked me out but i stopped the truck anyway at the first beach pull off after the culvert.  i looked just in time to see the blinking lights fly up higher, fast and go towards the hillside.  we continued home and got out of the truck and looked towards the hillside just in time to see the lights go up, over the hill and disappear.\r\n\r\nwitness 2, my daughter.\r\n     on russian new years eve, my two friends and i left night gym early.  as i waited for my mom, i heard a buzzing noise, almost like a blow drier.  i was swinging on the swing set and we saw it hoover for some 5 minutes about 8 feet above us.  after my mom pulled up, it glided toward the church and then over the ocean toward the airport.\r\n     this drone type object was about the size of the hood of a truck and was diamond/pyramid shaped, u could see several layer/steps, top to bottom and a different light on each side, red, green, orange and white.\r\n     after we saw it

girlfriend and i went to new hampshire to stay for the weekend of august 27,28,29 in 2010 at our friends newly cleared heavily wooded vacation property, it was located just north of maddison n.H.And just south of laconia n.H. right near lake winnipesaukee. it was saturday the 28th, it was roughly 11:45pm, a friend and myself were outside sitting by the fire when i noticed 2 red glowing balls very high in the sky, it was crystal clear out that night and not a cloud in the sky,i commented to my friend saying i wonder if that's a satellite or planet honestly had no idea what it was,so jokingly i said maybe it's aliens, then i pulled out a flashlight and began flashing it in the sky in the direction of the red lights, i was only joking with my friend saying maybe they'll answer.At this point both red lights began to move back and forth erratically and pulsating a red glow, it was still to far away to make out any details, my friend and i became extremely unsettled at this point, i immediately stopped flashing the light, when i did they kept pulsating moving back and forth from left to right. now is where it gets a bit strange. we are literally in the middle of nowhere in the woods and as the red lights were still moving around and flashing, i see this very bright white orb about the size of a softball slowly moving through the trees about 4 to 5 feet off the ground towards me and my friend, i asked my friend what is that? he replied very shakily with firefly maybe? i laughed and said fireflys flash they don't just glow. this orb passed right in front of us no more than 15 feet away, it slowly passed us and down the front side of the trailer it then made a sharp right hand turn at the end of the trailer and disappeared. i turned to my friend and said what the heck just happened, then we both looked up and the two red lights were gone too. was it a ufo? what was that white orb? some sort of probe? i don't know but none of slept that night and we left the next day. i haven't been back since. this is the first time i am speaking publicly about this.","distance":"20 Feet or

with no neighbors, roads, or closely located facilities anywhere. we were sitting in her green house late at night when i thought i noticed a shooting star outside the windowing in the roof.  after focusing for a bit longer i realized what i thought was a shooting star is now still. so i dismissed it and went back to hanging out.  only after another hour i saw the \"star\" slowing drifting like a plane, so again i didn't pay it much attention.  what caught my eye on this very clear night was the sudden downward movement of the light. paying attention to it now the drifting progressively turned into quick movements, quick enough that the light trailed behind itself moving so fast a small + sign was in the sky. just as soon as my amazement took over and i started to question what it could be, it dramatically stopped, then began to quickly brighten making no noise. mind you we were on the top of a canyon so a small plane would have no business flying literally 50ft next to the small house we were in. only then when it passes the greenhouse i could relate it to a plane in terms of noise, but the surface was pitch black, and i saw a brighten cockpit, but right after it passed no noise, lights nothing.  so we say there and explained what we just saw in awe. i thought maybe we had been kind of loud cause we were slightly worried we didn't know what happened, that's when i thought my grandma was coming to check on us which was odd. the light i saw wasnt on the small dirt road but approaching up an almost vertical incline horizontal to it.  what i saw then has made me question my existence as an individual, because i saw a outline of a person made of light. imagine a normal weighted man, but  his outline was a culmination of colors but i could see through the center of it. that and when it walked it left almost copies or like a slinky stretching of fading images in the previous stance of its walk. only to continue across the path,up another sheer face of 20 ft, and disappear into one giant flash.  i checked the ground no footprints or any sign of evidence that something was there, even were the light brighten and the event ended, i went and check to find a few bushes nothing more. as this went on though i felt privileged to see this. my grandma is the only other person to have seen anything strange before too just as a side

secluded area so i tend to look at the stars often because there are hardly any lights obstructing the view of the sky. when i glanced at the sky i noticed a light brighter than anything else in the sky other than the moon, and upon focusing my attention on the object i quickly realized it was much larger and closer than the stars and was pulsing different colors, mostly white, blue, green, and purple, but much faster than i could really process. i stood staring at the object in shock as it moved from left to right, it would move  down slightly  and then jump back up quickly and seemed to be changing shape in no particular pattern or order. after i got my dogs back inside i grabbed my phone and took a couple of still photos along with an approximately 10 minute video. in the video, zoomed in, the color change is much more apparent and the object almost seems to be a ring with a hollow center - the first thing it reminded me of was a sand dollar or amoeba shape. there is some \"human error\" movement in the video, as i was using my cellphone, but it is very clear in the video that the object moves under its own control and zoomed in, almost seems to be spinning while the rapid color change takes place. i watch the stars all the time and have never seen anything like this in my life. it remained in the same general area in the sky, moving but returning to the same general location, for approximately an hour and a half when it slowly started to get smaller, as if it was moving away from my direction, and in the matter of seconds it was gone.

house.  on returning i noticed what i first thought was a bright star fairly low in the sky just above some treetops approximately 100m away.  it was a cold. clear night and the moon was very bright in the sky in a westerly direction. there were no clouds and many stars were visible.\r\n\r\nwhat made me take notice was the apparent brightness of the object in relation to other stars in the sky and the fact that it was constantly changing colour.  i stood at my back door and observed it for 3 to 4 minutes mesmerised.  i'm familiar with looking at the night sky as i usually let my dog out in the garden before bedtime and sometimes have to wait several minutes for her to come back in so, to pass the time, if it's a clear night, i spend a few minutes gazing at the stars. \r\n\r\nthe object was stationary above the trees in a sw direction approximately 30 degrees above the horixon.  it was brighter than any of the other stars in the sky and was continuously changing colour.  it would change from red to blue to green to white to yellow and so on several times per second.  i'm familiar with seeing stars twinkle but this was very different.\r\n\r\nmystified as to what it could be i went back inside to get my iphone.  i have a stargazing app which, when you point your phone at the night sky, tells you what star/planet you are looking at.  the only thing i suspected it might be was the planet venus which sometimes appears very bright in the night sky.  however the app confirmed that venus wasn't visible in this part of the sky at the time and neither were there any stars of this brightness either.\r\n\r\ni observed it changing colour for a few more minutes and then all of a sudden it just blinked out and disappeared. i waited to see if it reappeared but it didn't so after another few minutes i went back inside to get warm.\r\n\r\ni was quite taken aback at what i had seen and several times i went to my back door to see if it had reappeared.  on my 3rd or 4th visit i saw it again but in a slightly different location and lower in the sky.  i can't remember how long i watched it this time, maybe another few minutes.  approximately 5 minutes later i went to the back door again but it had gone again.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

girlfriend was sitting up reading and our two boston terriers were at the foot of the bed sleeping.  there were multiple taps on glass sounding like it came from living room.  my dogs heard this as well and immediately barked, and ran to living room. my girlfriend sleeps on side of bed closest to window.  she got up, opened window and looked out at front yard of house.  it was dark and she could not see anyone.  it was approximately 11:30 pm.  i got up, quickly dressed and went out front door. it was a damp night and if anyone would have stepped on the grass in front of picture window there would be footprints;  there were none.  i went into back yard and also saw nothing.  at this time there was another apparent knock at the front window.  i looked with a flashlight to see if it might have been a squirrel or raccoon but there was nothing.  we then returned to bedroom and prepared for sleep.  as i crawled into bed, the light in the back bedroom came on.  when i went to see what was the cause, i found that the light switch was in the on position.  after shutting off the light i returned to bed with no further events that night.\r\n   day two:  in my living room was a large persian rug.  this rug was left to me by the previous owner of the home when i purchased it.  this rug, although it was some 15 years old was in excellent condition. over the span of several previous weeks this rug emitted a gray dust that i had never seen before.  if you lifted the rug this dust appeared on the floor.\r\ni took a photograph of the rug that day with my cell phone camera.  i also took a photograph of one corner of the rug pulled back. i was planning to show these photographs to my sister so she could advise on how to clean it.\r\nwhen i reviewed the photographs the second photo showed something under the fold of the corner. when initially taking the photographs i saw nothing unusual.  it appeared to be a face strikingly like that of the popular image of a gray alien.  when i enlarged the photograph it became more apparent.\r\n   i no longer have the rug, as this event disturbed me so much that i no longer wanted the rug in my house. it was disposed of.  i am including a picture of what the rug looked like in my living room and also a picture with the face visible.  these pictures have not been altered in any way and i would be willing to submit my phone

anyone else had spotted it, but didn't see anyone looking at it. all of a sudden, light disappeared & in it's place was a flying saucer disc shape, kind of grey metallic, with a large fin on top. slanted & concave on right side, flat on top, & a half circle on back. at the time i couldn't believe what i was seeing. blinked my eyes for a better look & it had completely disappeared. i scoured the sky for about 10 minutes & there was nothing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":74146,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.9713088,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01282016-0011","longitude":-99.89718309999999,"occurred":1453969800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1454009465000,"summary":"Very
