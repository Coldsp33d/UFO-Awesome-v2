away) my uncles response to that was no he was sacred and wanted to just leave them be do we drove back home.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

slowly dimmed as it reached an altitude where it seemed to stop ascending- then the other-- also stopped ascending as if it had run out of fuel and then dimmed out-- burnt out seemingly--  as if there were rockets leaving the atmosphere- except for getting brighter it just burnt out-- this seemed to happen towards the middle of the sky-- so if it was a long ways away it could've been a very high

concentrated \"white light\" shown through two of our windows; the light was rectangular in shape, approximately 10'x 10'.  the light \"flashed\" several time like a strobe light and then it went away.  she also said the white light had \"blue\" coloring in it.\r\n     what makes her experience even more bizarre is that it coincides with an almost duplicate experience i had about two months prior: when she had her experience, i was downstairs doing some paperwork.  when i came up, about 11 p.M. she detailed the event to me, as described above. when i had my experience, i was outside playing my ukulele about 11 p.M. with me, extremely focused, concentrated white light shown on the exact same two windows of our upstairs bedroom.\r\n     the \"white light\" flashed, kind of like a strobe light.  it did this \"on and off\" three or four times and then the light was gone.  what was also very odd, was that there was no source, that i could see, from where the light originated.  i told my wife about my event and now, about two months later, she had the same thing happen.\r\n     what makes our events even stranger, is that about four to six months earlier, i was, once again, sitting outside, playing my ukulele, at approximately the same time, 11 p.M.  the night time sky was totally clear.  very low, overhead, maybe 100', coming directly towards me, a very large, black ufo appeared.  it was \"silent.\"  it made no sounds.  it had three red lights, but i could not actually tell what its shape was, because the sky was clear, but dark, and the ufo was black in color.\r\n     i called out to my wife and told her to \"hurry downstairs, come outside and 'see' this thing.\"  she did so, and \"together\" we saw the craft move extremely, slow; it almost seemed to be \"hovering\" overhead and then it kind of glided away at a slow speed and then, a minute or so later, it moved away very quickly and then it was gone.  we talked about it for a long time afterwards.  \r\n     over time, we have recounted the ufo encounter to a few of our friends, but we have never mentioned the \"white flashing lights.\"  we obviously do not know if the \"lights\" and the ufo sighting are related; but we do know, these things have never happened to us before.\r\n            ","distance":"20 Feet or

warm weather when it should be cold and/or snowing. the fog stayed close to the ground reaching a few stories in the air at most. i went to town to buy something and made my purchase right after they called \"shoppers, you have 10 minutes...\" so i know it was about that approximate time when i arrived home.\r\n\r\ni drove the rural way home along the river. i live very close to the river. when i was getting very close to home, i noticed a cluster of 3 orange lights very close to me over neighbor a's yard across the road from me or right on the river; that's how close we are to the river.\r\n\r\ni live in a rural area so the neighbors' houses are a few hundred feet from each other.\r\n\r\nthis cluster of orange lights was about helicopter height. there was no structure to support the lights or i could not see the structure even though it was above the fog. the lights beamed a little. they looked exactly like the street lights on my road with the same color, same size, and same slight beam of light except that i was looking at a cluster of 3 lights. the orange lights stayed stationery as i drove down my road and into my drive way.\r\n\r\ni had never seen orange lights this low in the sky and there was no structure present as to why the lights would be there.\r\n\r\ni parked the car in the back of the house and ran to a front corner of the house to see if the cluster of lights were still there. it was but it started slowly moving in a straight line, moving closer to me.\r\n\r\ni ran the short distance to get my sister to come outside and look at \"this big plane\". there is frequent unusual activity in the sky here so she put on shoes and came running out.\r\n\r\nwhat i witnessed before she got outside was a giant black triangle shape reveal itself over neighbor b's house which is the 2nd house from me to the west.  the triangle went in a straight line over neighbor b's house, it backed up a little bit like it changed it's mind and then traveled in straight line directly at me.\r\n\r\nit had descended to top-of-tree height by now. was it going to crash? why is it so low? what is it? i was scared and wanted to run somewhere but where to? i was in the middle of the yard and if i ran in the house and it crashed, that was not a great place to go. if it was looking for me, it had already spotted me.\r\n\r\nmy sister arrived outside and looked up to see it just as it started to travel in a straight line from neighbor b's house.\r\n\r\nit had great height to it. it was not a flat triangle. it was several stories height. it was flat black or dark gray color. it was way larger than a football field. it was enormous. it was so close, detail was clear of it's structure, size and lights.\r\n\r\nit turned on it's bottom lights on it's way over to my yard. it had varied bottom lights. outlining the craft were small white lights with 3 sets of red/green lights. in the middle was a large triangle area of what looked like white led lights glowing. the pattern of these white lights was indescribable.  was it showing clouds or transparency?\r\n\r\nas the triangle front endpoint arrived at the yard, it started emitting this hydraulic engine type of noise, loud, roaring, and bumpy sounding. i'm familiar with hydraulic engine sounds as to the many boats on the river here and that's the closest i would describe it. \r\n\r\n(i had heard that same loud engine noise travel the entire sky a few weeks prior to this event from inside my house. i ran outside to sight what would make that loud noise and i could not see it.)\r\n\r\nit scared me so i didn't look when it was directly overhead but my sister watched it. i could still see it even when not looking directly at it. the white lights glowed. i looked up at it after several seconds, and it was still there, hovering/moving very slowly. \r\n\r\ni got a good look at the bottom lights at this time but still don't know how to describe the white lights in the middle, what pattern the white lights were. maybe it was a transparent area as well as being lit up.\r\n\r\nif she hadn't come outside when she did, i was on my way to hiding. instead, she came outside and yelled at it to get out of here. the noise was loud enough that i couldn't hear her yelling at it. i felt responsible for calling her outside to see it and i didn't want it to get her so i stayed while making useless getaway plans and getaway movements.\r\n\r\nshe seen it approach but she didn't realize how close it was because of night depth perception issues. i wouldn't have yelled at it but she did and i'm glad. i hope that's what made it go away.\r\n\r\nwe watched it until the end of the triangle shape went over us. it turned off it's sound and lights after it went over us. the black triangle disappeared into the black night and we didn't stand around outside after that. when the sky is heavy with water like that, you can't see the stars, it's just very dark.\r\n\r\nwe still marvel over seeing this triangle. we talk about it every day. i'm nervous when i have to frequently walk back and forth between the 2 houses on the lot here. you don't want to see it again but you want to. such a mixture of feelings, it was a major event for me.\r\n\r\nit would be nice and way easier to believe that it is human military but i don't know if that is plausible. now we joke about how it was a good thing she came outside before it vacuumed me up and that two of us was too many for it to beam up. i nervously laugh.\r\n","distance":"21-100

any kind on it. the craft was moving very slowly. having been in the military for quite a while, i can gauge the size of craft pretty well, so i'd say this craft was easily 400 - 500 ft. long per side. it moved in a south-easterly direction, again - extremely slowly and with no noise, and then just vanished. i brought my dog inside and wanted to call someone, a friend or relative, and tell them what i saw, but was afraid of being laughed at. i'm still a bit afraid of being laughed at, but finally decided to tell mufon about this. i don't really expect anything to be done about it.

out my trailer house when i started hearing a sound that i never heard in my entire life. it sounds like a craft with a very distinct sound but it sounded like it was failing mechanically. whatever was inside of it i could hear it despite there being some distance from it but i was in reality close enough to see it very good. i may have gained telepathic ability for that moment it passed by me because i heard 2 distinct sounds which i took to be alien beings. i wasn't afraid at all just intrigue to be fortunate to see such an unusual event taking place in front of me. i actually think that the past by was on purpose because years later when moved to dublin, georgia something happen there also. and not far from where i live. i didn't see it but people living around me did and was telling me. and it even hit the newspapers and the news in dublin, georgia. my 1st cousin told me story in the past that make me wonder if that craft did landed nearby. because my immediate family all live in the same 1 mile radius and one of my cousins said that he was having sex in the woods on his car hood when he heard hissing behind him. he looked back and there was a man stand there but he did look right. his head had a glow like appearance and just ignored it because he that he was imagining it. he looked back again it was closer to him. his girlfriend can't see it but hear it but take her down from the car and turned around quickly again it was gone just that quick. which is why i wonder if i was the manlike image that was one on that craft i saw that morning. my cousin claimed it hissed like a snake or a cat but it was a man. the image i have below is nothing short of what i saw. the only difference is is that it wasn't up in the stars and the whole object glowed in a pulsating manner. there was 2 more witness but they were 20 miles from me at the time. i just heard them talking about it when i got to work.

wasnt a flash it was like turning a candle on. it was a very bright white light and they kept increasing in altitude to the point where they reached for the near cloud cover and disappeared. i have witnessed this with a friend and a bunch of three people who were just surprised since i was trying to take a picture but i took only one where while my flashlight was on so it wasnt that perfect i was also trying to take video but i couldnt since they moved fats and disappeared. one more thing there was an airplane and i saw it just seconds before seeing the ufos. also one bizarre thing happened. my phone charge and it is an iphone 4 was around 70% and suddenly not in the same moment the ufos were witnessed but after some few hours i found my phone totally dead black screen and not response. i sudden battery failure?? it was weird. i put it on the charger and it was fine but i still dont understand how from 70% while i didnt use it at all then suddenly drops to 0% like its not charged. maybe it has to do with the ufos?? who knows. but am quite sure its not a plane or a balloon or anything else. it was moving quietly smoothly and it was two of them and they were pretty close like less than 100 meters above us. so i think they were aliens after all.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On a warm night in 1984, we were sitting outside in the yard talking at our family farm in central texas. i cannot remember the exact date, but it was a pleasant, starlit and moonlit night, perhaps in the early spring or fall. we could see well enough to walk around outside, so there must have been a full moon or a nearly full moon. \r\n\r\nmy two dogs suddenly began barking and running off toward a the neighbor's pasture, which is located to the north side of our farm. the property line runs only 30 yards or so from where we were sitting, and a barbed wire fence separates the two farms. the other property was pretty large, perhaps 200 or more acres, with a mix of oak trees, mesquite thickets, and grassy areas scattered with weeds, brush, prickly pear, and brier patches. nobody lived there except a herd of cows, so the pasture next to the fence was an overgrown tangle of brush at the time. my dogs ran through the fence wires and into the neighbor's pasture, still barking, and i walked over there to see what had caused them to bark. \r\n\r\nthese were very vigilant, fiercely protective watchdogs -- the kind of dogs that kept people in their cars until i called the dogs off. they weren't prone to running off barking at rabbits or small animals, but they did chase the neighbor's cows if they got too close to the fence. if a person were to get close to that fence, that would be as far as he would get without getting dog-bit. so when those dogs barked and ran toward the fence, i followed them to see why they were agitated. i fully expected to see them chasing the neighbor's cows, but all i saw was the vague outline of trees, weeds, and bushes in the moonlight, and the two dogs charging back towards me. they shot through the fence and stood beside me, no longer barking but looking toward the neighboring pasture. it was really strange behavior for them. \r\n\r\nat that point i heard a very weird sound, like a baby crying, which was coming from the pasture. the sound lasted only a few seconds and then stopped. the dogs didn't react except to perk their ears a bit. no baby would be in the woods at night, but a rabbit makes a similar sound when it thinks it's about to die, so i thought something must have killed a rabbit. obviously it was not my dogs that killed it because they were now beside me.\r\n\r\nwhile still wondering about the weird noise, i was startled to see a bright red light suddenly appear, hovering above the ground perhaps 12 to 15 feet, just 50 to 75 feet beyond the fence. it was like an orb that glowed red but had a brighter beam of red light that was slowly rotating. it clearly illuminated the trees and undergrowth below and around the light-object, and when the bright beam rotated in my direction, it was blindingly bright. i could see nothing below or above it to which the light might be connected -- it was just a \"light\" that just hovered there, silently. it was not in a location where you would expect any people to be at that time of night (or any time), and my dogs would have continued to bark if there were people so close to the fence. i do not think a vehicle could be driven to that spot, and there was no sound or noise -- you can hear vehicle sounds long before you see the vehicle, at that location.\r\n\r\ni went to get the others, and three of my relatives ended up witnessing this, in addition to myself. we watched the revolving red light for 10 to 15 more minutes, excitedly discussing it, wondering what it was. we were too freaked out to think of getting a camera. nobody went closer because you'd have to climb the barbed wire fence and then walk through a very overgrown, rattlesnake-infested and cactus-laden pasture to get closer to the light, and we could see it very clearly from where we stood. nobody saw anything to which this light was attached, and it remained about 12 to 15 feet off the ground at all times, steadily rotating its bright red beam. then suddenly, the light went out.\r\n\r\nabout 30 seconds later the light re-appeared, but in a new location. in total silence, it had moved to the northeast part of the pasture, which was heavily overgrown with mesquite trees. this was probably 200 to 300 yards further away and the mesquites were so thick it was hard to see the light, yet it still lit up the trees around it as it rotated. we began walking along the fence to get closer, but when we began to close in on it, the light went out again. so we started to go back to the house. then we saw the light again, now in the northwest part of the pasture, and very far away from its previous position. once again it had moved in total silence. we walked in that direction for a few steps and the light went out again, and after that we never saw it again.\r\n\r\ni don't know what this light or object was. if it was related to human activity, i don't know how they got to that first location or the other locations, one of which was virtually inaccessible, in total silence and in a matter of seconds between locations. or how any person could be in that first location, so close to the fence, without getting bit by my dogs (one of my dogs was notorious about biting people who she deemed to be \"trespassers.\") also why had no humans been seen in the illuminated area created by the hovering light and the moonlight. the light seemed to be an object hovering in space, 12 to 15 feet off the ground. it illuminated the ground and there was nothing under it except trees and brush. nor could we see anything above it.\r\n\r\neven a 4-wheel-drive vehicle would probably be impossible to drive in that area and would have made a lot of noise. walking through acres and acres of overgrown property at night would be very strange and foolish. besides this, it was rare to ever see people on that property. nobody lived there and people hardly ever ever walked around or drove around on that farm, or hunted or did anything else on that property. certainly not at night. besides this, any such activity would have made noise, but there was no noise associated with the hovering light. our farmhouse was adjacent to that pasture, with windows overlooking it. it had been about 10 years since i personally had seen a person step foot on that part of the neighboring property.\r\n\r\nwas this a ufo? i don't know what the heck we saw, just that we saw it. if it was hovering as it seemed to be, then yes it was a ufo. at the time, we had no idea what it was and we still don't. we never reported it. there is actually a history of at least one reported ufo sighting and a cattle mutilation in the area, and a couple of other incidents have happened on the farm, but this incident was witnessed by more people and we had a much closer view of this rotating-red-light object. mufon can contact me for more info on the other things.\r\n ","distance":"21-100 Feet,

caught my eye from my western-facing living room balcony.   this is a bit normal since i live in a medical center. so, i see helicopters quite a bit from my balcony. it honestly didn't seem right, but i casually kept an eye on it.  there were too many bright lights coming in from the nnw.  like 3-4 headlights from a car over the treetops and buildings.  i still didn't think it was too unusual since we have a lot of helicopters flying in from various locations to the hospitals in my area. \r\n\r\nthen i felt something was off, so i went out onto the balcony to get a better look.   i felt that what i was looking at was \"off\" and it was too graceful and slow to be a helicopter or airplane.  so, i knocked on my son's window to get a second opinion.   since that time the object changed direction and headed towards the west.  i begin recording at this on my phone.  by that time my son appeared on the balcony with me.  i was still convinced that it was a plane.   we took noticed of a jet following, according to our perspective, above and behind the object keeping a constant pace with it.  the lights on the object were flashing randomly, and a blue light turned on and this convinced my son this was more than a plane.  it flew low to the horizon from our 2nd floor perspective.\r\n\r\ni lost visual on the object due to buildings and tree branches.  my son however ran after out of our apartment to get a better look.  i followed.  by that time the object was heading from a sw direction and headed east.  like its flight path was more of a curve.  my son went up the street to follow it, and according to him it just disappeared mid-flight.  this frightened him more than anything.  needless to say that there was a sense of disbelief and excitement.  i'm still not sure what we witnessed that night.  the jet escort followed this object up until it disappeared.  for a while afterwards the sky was \"crowded\" with jets and helicopters.  my son was able to get a good visual before it disappeared, and quickly sketched the object our with the layout of its lights.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
