may concern, i have something i need help with reporting and i want to be contacted for help with an ordeal i have had. i have seen ufos many times outside my home in marysville wa year's ago but what i would like to get help with is something that has baffled myself  my friends, and family for the past few years. i went to bed one night and not much later i heard noises coming from my kitchen. i assumed my oldest daughter was cooking. pots and pans crashed about and loud noises of banging came from my kitchen. i thought nothing of it and tried to go back to sleep. suddenly i heard a loud high pitch ring it was disorintating and my bedroom door opened. i saw 3 beings walk into my room. i couldn't make out what they looked like light bathed behind them so they looked dark to make out details. but i can say that were short. not thin like a child but they had large heads short to no neck head. they reminded me of someone with dwarfism. not skinny but stout yet not fat. as soon as i saw them i sat up and tried to speak, they walked to the foot of my bed and then one touched my foot and bam i was out like a light. the next day the very moment i woke i exhaled what tasted like a gas. i not only have worked in surgery but have had many from a kidney disease. when i exhaled i knew it was a familiar feeling and taste like i just had woken up fresh from surgery and had been put to sleep with an anesthesia. i was groggy so i tried to sit up in my bed and felt a sharp pain in my abdominal area. i looked under my shirt and i indeed has an insicion. this was like no insicison i had ever seen before. first it was very straight as an arrow and was very clean.  the skin looked void of blood at the incision.  second no bedodine or other substances were used to prep a patient's skin to prevent infections. i have always had an orange yellow hue to my skin after any surgery from the bedodine that they use to scrub and clean the area before cutting open. third it was glued together. no stiches or staples.   not only did it not have any dried blood or cautery marks but most of all the odd thing was it could be pulled apart and still no blood and when you let go it sealed right back together until you pulled it apart again. you could open it up a couple inches down. i was too scared to let it open as far as i could go because i didn't know if i would injure myself or start a bleed. yet not a drop of blood could be seen. just the layer of epidermis and down into the day and muscle layer.  now who could i tell. other than my family.  as someone who worked in nursing and surgery for years i knew i couldn't talk to my doctor about it without being labled crazy. or seen as disillusioned . but i did have an ultrasound appointment a week before this happened showing i had a large gallstone and sugery was needed which my doctors were about to do. so a few days after this happened the insicion rapidly healed. far faster than any i have ever had before. most the time my insisions took  well over a month to heal due to my bad kidney disease.  i was scheduled a week after the incident to get another ultrasound for surgery for a pre surgery exam and when they did the ultrasound the stone that was as large as my gallbladder was completely gone. this stone i had was far too large for me to pass it had to be removed along with my gallbladder. but when i got the ultrasound the stone was gone yet my gallbladder. remained. this baffled the doctors. a gallstone surgery has to include removing the gallbladder. yet mine was intact sans stone. alittle over a year later i got a new stone same size and when my gallbladder was finally removed the stone had spilt the gallblader into two pieces. this event has changed my life in a bad way. even though i am thankful to who ever helped heal my body from a bad stone it scares me that i have no idea who i was or why they took me to do such a thing. was it a routine check a person out but i had health difficulties so that has to perform emergency surgery.I have never suffered from anxiety but after this event happened i had no one to turn to but my family. they all saw the incision they all knew what happened and i was telling the truth but i had no one to help me figure out what happened. also no one was cooking that night everyone else said that heard the noise mainly my grown daughter. everyone was in bed at the time. my kitchen was the same as we left it nothing moved or gone.  this has made me fear who could remove me from my home and perform a surgery and put me back without anyone else being the wiser . also to not know who did this to me our own goverment or some non human beings has made it quiet hard on me. i want answers yet have no way to ever find out who did this. since this has happen i have had one more surgery like that but couldn't go to the doctor again for fear i would be labled crazy. that was just this summer and i have no clue as to what they did that time other than it was over my chest where my sternum is. i still have both scars. i need answers but most of all i want people to know that life is not exactly what we think it is when someone else can remove you from your home and you have no memory of what happened no power to s too it. it's scary yet i know people need to know it does happen. i am willing to work with anyone to find out what could have happened or put my story out there if it helps others who feel lost and alone from things like this. i'm not looking for money or game i just want to let other know that aren't alone.  i'm smart and have no history of delusion. i am willing to provide medical records and proof of my gallstone being there and disappearing. i also would do a polygraph to proof i am being honest. sorry if i am contacting the wrong person also i'm sorry this was so long but i wanted to give clear details. if you could please pass this along to the right channels or have someone contact me i would very much appreciate it. thank you, i can be reached at 369-322-8341. i can be emailed back but rarely go online. a call is best. again thank you for your time.","distance":"20 Feet or

corner red/orange colour, my first thoughts was a military aircraft, but it definitely was not a stealth aircraft as this was a proper triangle shape i would say equal lengths on each side, it flew with point first manner, as thinking it may have been military i headed to the nearest air force base in coningsby lincolnshire, but when i got there the base was quiet, nothing going off and no sign of the ufo, after speaking with friends i have come to believe this not to be any military aircraft know to anyone, this is either technology we do not know of, or some form of alien craft.\r\ni myself am not convinced of alien visits, but do not rule anything out, therefore i am thinking it is military technology that is being withheld, whether this technology is alien or not i can't agree or disagree.\r\ndue to my camera being on a tripod and the fact that photographing a moving object at night only gets you mostly a blurred image unless flash light is used to light it up, so unfortunately didn't capture any images.

thought this plane must just be passing by. the more i looked the more it looked like a hotdog shape that was silver but had a dark band around the middle of it. suddenly it looked a little different, like the light was reflecting off it differently, and then it completely dissapeared. i think now it may have been changing shape. i still wasn't convinced my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, but right after that two planes came along that looked smaller, and i could clearly see their wings. they also had trails out of the back, but the other object didn't. then a helicopter came by from the other direction. \r\nit moved so slowly and steadily it could have been a plane, but once it was gone it was 100% gone, i didn't see it fade away. i was pretty excited to see it because i have had an

az) during rush hour traffic after being detoured twice by two different auto accidents to alternate route of surface streets i selected.  while going eastbound on maryland to central avenue (north) i observed 3 red-orange orbs in a triangle formation directly in front of me with no noise emitting from them.  the dominate/larger orb (softball size) was at the top of triangle formation while the other two (tip and bottom) were smaller (orange size). they were glowing and appeared to be pulsating to my human eyes of which i was wearing my prescription glasses for night driving.   the distance in the sky from me was approximately 1000-1500 feet away.  i noticed no other vehicles appeared to notice them except for myself.\r\n\r\nwhen i approached maryland/central avenue i turned northbound until i reached dunlap ave.  during this time traveling northbound the 3-orbs moved their position and remained in my front view as i continued driving.  once i reached dunlap avenue i turned left heading westbound to the black canyon freeway/i-17 northbound to commute home to camp verde, az, which is approximately 93 miles away (rural community). the 3-orbs continued to stay constant ahead of me as i traveled westbound to the freeway.\r\n\r\nupon entering the freeway northbound off of dunlap the 3-orbs remained  within my front view but changed position/formation:  the dominant larger orb was at an 11 o'clock position, the bottom orb remained below dominant at 9-10 o'clock position (northern sky direction). while the orb that was the tip position moved drastically away from the other two and was a 2 o'clock position to my right (more east sky direction).  also, they had changed colors now white/silver, with still no noise emitting as i kept my window down. throughout my trip home i almost drove off the road several times as i continued to watch them.  i then stopped off at anthem (north suburb/phoenix) gas station for a restroom break since my commute home (camp verde) would be another 45 minutes (approximately).\r\n\r\ni came out of the restroom got into my car taking the access road back onto i-17 northbound when i noticed the lights remained fixed in the sky at their same position as if waiting for me.  i then spoke to the glowing white/silver orbs in the sky asking them if they were guiding me safely home.  i traveled i-17 northbound continuing my conversation with them in regards to reaching my destination safely to my son who was at home alone. the 3-orbs remained constantly traveling with me of same position in the sky.  \r\n\r\nprior to coming into the verde valley i was to ascend, travel a small mountain terrain this is when i called my son to inform of experience and asked him to go outside and look into the sky of stated direction of 3-orb position.  estimated time to arrive home was 10 minutes.  once out of mountain terrain i exited off the 260-northbound (cottonwood/camp verde exit) with the 3-orbs still remaining with me.\r\n\r\ni headed northbound-260 for approximately 3-5 miles to the yavapai-apache nation (tunalii district) where i reside.  the 3 white/silver orbs stayed with me until i reached my driveway.  once home my son came out to inform that he saw nothing.  i suggest we go out to the backyard where it is pitch black and look at the sky.  we went to the backyard and saw nothing.  then we went to the front driveway where the 3-orbs were in the sky pulsating in same directional position.  i informed the 3-orbs i was home safely and introduced them to my son who witnessed the event.  the east direction orb disappeared. the little orb that was accompanying dominant orb flew north disappearing in the night sky. while the dominant white/silver orb flew towards us (approximately 500 ft) with an asension 4-pointed star design/craft change formation then flew abruptly away towards sedona, az. \r\n\r\non november 14, 2015, an elongated 4 fingerprint impression was left on my dusy kitchenette table of

it remains unclear from what exactly. something in that lightning storm effected me too. i realize i handled myself poorly, but truly feel there is something here. my entire belief system slowly re-invented itself from this point on. \r\n\r\nno history of insanity runs in my family and has never happened before or since that particular year of recovery. they diagnosed me as schizo-effective, and bipolar. i have since been re-diagnosed as having had ptsd due to other things and am perfectly healthy currently.\r\n\r\ni flushed the meds soon after and sought to get my mind/body happy and healthy again. that was my cure for certain. i also began my research into the rabbit-hole of ufo's, spirits, tricksters, etc. a few years later. i found many, many similar cases. the racial and religious agitation is one notable, historical similarity. people also love to believe they are special and needed to save the world. it is an easy point of manipulation for most. some ufo websites attract the \"crazies\", but i have noticed some of them ranting similar things as what i was. they need help and i found all of them are in weakened psychological/physical states--wide open for this kind of assault.\r\n\r\ni am also an artist/musician. we tend to be sensitive to this? most of us are diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the slightest sign of depression. i often wonder......Those drugs are terrible. when i focused on my health, all signs of mental illness, invasion, or whatever you wish to call it disappeared and no further psychological oppression has been allowed. education is power. \r\n\r\nanyway, i consider my experience to be an awakening of sorts and i felt it was time to share what i learned with you. john keel also mentions the racial agitation, telepathy, religious oppression and general nonsense information we sometime receive, in his books \"our haunted planet\" and \"operation trojan horse\". he also notes the similarities in reports of ufo's, historical fairy reports, airships of the 1800's all culturally relevant for the times. but they are similar in content.  digging john mack, james redfield, \"what the bleep do we know\" as well as many other researchers, thinkers and works out there.  telepathic contact is quite common, it turns out. what a strange reality this turned out to be! we are slowly piecing it together. \r\n\r\nit is my sincere hope that my story is a contribution to the puzzle. thank you for all your wonderful and hard work. my the force be with you!\r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nkristen johansen\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":74087,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.742581900000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01252016-0017","longitude":-118.2824461,"occurred":994118400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1453735014000,"summary":"Weird lightning, thoughts that absolutely were not mine, premonitions, junk ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":87,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":25,"meantempi":77,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":10,"minvisi":6,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":87,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":25,"meantempi":77,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":10,"minvisi":6,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5319,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:91746"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Oudtshoorn","country":"South Africa","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"They move across the sky all the time. i've seen many before. my best sighting was last year at the park at night when i was chilling with my friends and sitting on the swing looking at the sky to see if i can spot any weird objects moving through the sky, and i did. it was an orange light moving slowly across the sky but in a weird movement, then it flew off with a high speed. the one i am reporting now was moving across the sky, it looked close enough to be in out atmosphere. it had no blinking lights and fitted the description of a ufo. i looked at it fly across the sky. every day and night i look in our atmosphere to see if i can spot another ufo. please believe me as i would put my right hand on the bible because i am telling the truth. i keep record of sightings e.G date, time, year and month and i describe it also. i would like to hear from you guys again. my friends are also witnesses as i show them where the ufo is when i see it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":74086,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-33.612167382276276,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-01252016-0016","longitude":22.208873926905493,"occurred":1453755960000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Western Cape","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1453734270000,"summary":"I have been seing objects fly across the sky from 21.01.2016 until 25.01.2016 (tonight). there are no flashing lights and they move, hover and take off very fast. i've never seen anything like it before. i believe in ufos, please believe me.
