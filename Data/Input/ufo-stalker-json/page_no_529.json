saw an object white in color yet reflective appearing to float along, the reason why i say float is because it did not waver, shutter and had no noise the strangest thing i ever saw, the day was so clear, sunny , no wind as soon as i saw the object i knew it was not man made, no windows, no markings no wings and was floating lower than the personal planes that come in on the flight path over head, i live near the flight path to van nuys airport. i tried to take a picture with my cell phone but nothing came of it, it would have been great too because there was a personal jet that was coming in a few feet of the object. the object looked like an oversized transformer, the kind that you see on telephone poles, although it seemed to have a \"cinch\" in the middle. if i didn't look to the east as i was entering the back yard i probably would never have know it was there. lol the object was floating from the east to the north west, as soon as i saw the object i was dumb founded, i couldn't understand what it might be, i also was mesmerized (because i didn't know what it was) i guess also i was waiting for something fun or entertaining to happen like the object shooting straight up into the sky, but nothing like that, just boldly floating along as if it is something that happens everyday. as if to say yes i'm here, you caught me , i'm just going to go about my business anyway. lol the object just kept on a path i guess to where ever it needed to go....Stopped watching after it became a tiny spot in the distance. the reason for my post is that i wish someone from the airport would come forth with hopefully pictures, video, radar... if someone was looking out the window of the private jet they would have seen the same thing , the day was crystal clear, i personally didn't and don't want to approach anyone with what i saw because i don't want to be labeled a loonie. funny, to this day i wish google earth would have an option of inputting date and time for map look up. (really want to see it again). oh ya, the object was cylindrical yet floating vertically, not horizontal.","distance":"21-100

wasn't really sure what i was looking at it was so alien to me but he just stood there on 2 feet looking at me, so i started walking backwards very slowly taking the last picture, he then jump'd the barbwire 10ft fence in one quick motion, i wasn't sure if my eyes were playing tricks or not, i then started to questioned what i just witnessed ..An animal? when it landed it leaped in one motion about 25-30ft and then whistled 5 notes like a scale going up and down. i then was convinced it was exactly what i thought i was looking at, continuing walking away from my building,not wanting to be in an in closed area i thought i would just go for a long walk and hope he was gone when i seen an alien ufo to the west that at 1st was the size of a star but quickly grew so i thought it was coming for me so i ran and jump'd to grab the sewer grate across from the stop sign, bcuz of it's speed i knew it would be 3-4 seconds if that, as i was an inch from grabbing the sewer a beam of light shot out and caught me in the air, my body inches from the street, and i just couldn't reach the sewer i then started to get pulled backwards and up  i guess to avoid the power lines instead of straight up. when the bean shot out, my fingers were able to scoop out some cement leaving a 3 foot hand imprint drag mark in the cement, i have no memory of being on board and actually i didn't remember seeing the ship or the drag mark until 3 months after while i was trying to figure out, how what i thought was an hours walk ,really was 6 hours, i don't remember being returned i just remember seeing the sun coming up as i was around the block walking home, and b4 i went in i had stopp'd right where i was taken because to the east there was the strangest looking cloud it looked like a face smoking so i took a quick video of it then went inside. i thought since i was only gone for an hour maybe 2 at most that i must have took the pics of the alien around 3-4am but when i checked the time on the picture it said 12:15am? this had me stumped cuz i didnt remember being abducted, it felt like one continuous walk after taking his picture, then like i said b4 i was out side reenacting everything when i got to the stop sign and remembered the ship then i remembered the sewer walked over to it and nearly puked when i seen my drag mark, also i have a faint vision of seeing the alien that jumped the fence standing on my neighbors driveway as i was pulled up.  here's a link to the face in the sky video -https://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=cktsoiougrs also i included to compare the 3rd picture with the same daytime picture, you can see the aliens head is obscuring the horizontal chair leg,  i've added some enhanced copies of pic 2 black and white zoomed in with the aliens left eye highlighted, and pic 3 i added 2 enhanced to see him better, the last cement pic is where the alien stood when i was being pulled up and i'm pretty sure he made this mark ,i didn't have time to take a pic of the ship sorry enjoy\r\n ryan","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path

and a half years old. my parents and i saw three domed shape flying saucers as we called them.  they came over the mountain ridge about a mile and a half from where we lived. we were on our way home from grandma's. they came over on the right side of the car and hovered on the ridge of the mountain. there was no sound, and then after a short while they just disappeared.  it was broad daylight. mom and dad just kept talking about them and wondered if they were part of the mass hysteria going on about the people in manchester nh.  \r\n\r\nafter that i didn't think about it until i was 13 years old, it happened again down town winchester nh, except there was only one shinny uf0 that descended from the sky at night. quiet a few people saw that one but everyone was told it was a weather balloon. most people including myself wanted to believe it was a weather balloon.\r\n\r\nin 1975-76 i had to undergo surgery on my neck.  when the neurosurgeon and orthopedic surgeon went through my mouth to remove the odontoid tip they retrieved what looked like a bb. we all wondered how that got into the tissue in the back of my throat. i had often wondered about that. i thought about the time my little brother shot my sister in the lip with his bb gun, and could he have hit me with one.\r\n\r\nfor years, when i took airplane trips they would wand me and it seemed as if i was wearing metal in my lower leg. it wasn't until i needed an mri a few months ago that a piece of metal in the lower left leg appeared. we were looking for something in the right leg. the mri machine attendants asked me if i had any mental on because the machine was showing an alarm that i had metal on. we looked and felt through the cloth on pant leg. we couldn't find anything. when the findings came back there was a piece of metal about 8mm long. no one can explain it. my doctor, probably because he is a naturopath thought we should just leave it alone. if it has been there all these years it can stay there is what i was also feeling until i began to feel invaded again.  i asked my doctor to set me up with a surgeon to get it out of me. the surgeon didn't want to do the operation because it was imbedded too deep. he suggested an orthopedic surgeon. we set up an appointment for that, then i watched a documentary about mufon.  i stopped everything. because i wanted someone i felt i could trust to remove it while i am awake and see what it is myself. so now i am waiting to see what will happen next.  will mufon help me to a doctor they trust to get this out of me.  \r\n  \r\n

from ohio, but i visited a girl in malta for new years eve and stayed for a week. on new years eve we went out and did the usual: visited a coue clubs, drank danced etc. she tends to sleep late and we didnt even get to bed til around dawn. i woke up first, not unusual. i got up, and had a cigarette, but i wanted to be outside and she has 3 balconies so i went out on the one by her kitchen. the other is for the dog and cats, and the third is accessed thru the besroom and i didnt want to wake her. im smoking on the balcony because im in a new place and enjoyed being outside and seeing something besides ohio. i looked at the horizon and the sky, just sort of taking in this experience. as i looked in the sky i saw a black dot. i think as humans we jave the ability to sort of judge distance feom seeing cwrtain things all our lives.. we see planes and bkrds in the sky every day. i saw the black dot and knew it was higher than a bird, and higher than a plane. and i first thought \"bird? plane?\" and honestly wanted it to be explained as either. it was too high. and slow, but moving slowly from left to right. so small that i would look away and have to focus on the general region where id seen it a second before, but there it was. afyer three or four times looking away and refocusing, i started seeing white orbs in my direct vision. not in the sky but in my vision. to the point where i at first swatted at them because i thought it was gnats or something. but as id try to focus on one to determine what it was, theyd disappear from my direct vision and reappear in the sides of my vision. and they happened a bit more as id try to focus back on the black dot i was watching.\r\ni began to feel confused because i couldnt make sense of this, and i thought \"am i still drunk?\". but i am a drinker, i handle my alcohol quite well and know my limits. i wasnt hung over and was not still intoxicated. \r\narou!D the time i begin to wonder if my phone camera will even focus on something so small, i realise my friend is awake and i see her in the kitchen. i feel confused and like i shouldn't tell her because i feel like its crazy and inexplicable. a buzzing sound starts happening. her condo is on the top floor of the building she lives in, and it sounded electrical..Like wires. and it sounded like it was coming from the roof. i looked back to try amd find the dot but it was gone or behind clouds.\r\ni went inside, still feeling odd. she started to make coffee and the power cut out. i dont know the technical layout of her place, bit she had to leave and go to the bottom floor to reset a breaker or something. as soon as she shut the door,i had an incoming phonecall from something that wasnt even a phone number: 5171#32. i didnt answer because i was a little freaked out now, i managed to screenshot the call after it appeared, and immediately my phone died.\r\ni felt strange about the whole thing, not exciytd to tell anyone. she had to reset the power several times and we had had any problems before, or after that. i didnt tell her til a couple days later.\r\nas she made coffee after we got the power back, i went back out for another smoke, and saw an identical dot originating in the same spot where id seen the first amd i just went back inside.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

(not being the first time seeing a ufo) so i am describing where in the sky the object is located by describing the stars to lee because orion’s belt & the moon was to my right from where i was standing at the time, as the object passes the moon lee said to me i can see it too mate! i said what? you can see that from where you are and his reply was yes! he is out walking his dog at this time, later checking on google earth the distance is 5 miles between us so i am impressed with this fact! as the object is silently gliding toward my house (still quite high estimated 1000ft) i keep saying please flash! & are you seeing this “lee yeah its flashing’’. not knowing if its flashing at us or me or just flashing randomly?  i’m thinking to myself and speaking out loud there is no pattern to the flashing so it must be flashing to us mate. so about a minute or two into watching this metallic round object flashing random or at us and gliding silently towards my house getting closer & closer at an estimated speed of about ten mph lee is saying the same thing! flash. when the object is more or less over my house lee said i have to go help my girlfriend with the shopping so we ended the call, i can imagine the confused look on her face when turning up to see lee staring into the sky! ha-ha. i then thought i should be getting this on camera so i ran into my house trying to get past the dog because she thinks i’m out there to play, running towards her while still looking into the sky myself and it looks like its fazing in and out now? heart racing, i come back out with my canon legria hfr606 hd camcorder, so while looking in the sky again where i thought the solid object should be but it seems to have disappeared? how bazar considering it seemed solid just now? (repeating to myself please flash) but couldn’t see anything? so i continue to record anyway and end up swearing on camera out of disappointment of missing the whole encounter! while moving the camera all around the area looking for the object i pull the camera down slowly & suddenly the object reappears in and out! with my eyes it looked like it flashed at me again like before but not as bright as when it was higher in the sky so while looking at the footage after i not only realize it’s not flashing like the last time we saw it flash but fazing in and out, wow i’m so glad i didn’t stop recording now because i caught the last fazing in and out on film!","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":74052,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.92878634540714,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-01232016-0008","longitude":-1.324239027346391,"occurred":1452879300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1453557004000,"summary":"Craft appeared metallic & solid! flashing bright white at us before dematerializing above the houses, i seem to have recorded something completely different to what was seen by us both in the sky that flashed at us twice. weird!","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"SO196DA","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Southampton","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:92591"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82750,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":529}
