about 20 minutes. i noticed a very bright flickering light in the southeastern part of the sky fairly far away about 2 miles. we looked at it a little more and we noticed it stopped flickering. it stayed there in the same spot for another minute or two. we got out of the car and continued to look at it. i told my girlfriend i thought it was venus because it was bigger and brighter than anything else in the sky. but, i was confused because i know venus couldn't be that close to the horizon. we continued to look at it more and it started to move in our direction very quickly and like it hasn't moved before. my girlfriend was kind of freaking out. once it got closer it moved in our direction and flew over the neighbor's house right in front of us in a straight path the whole time. we could only see the three lights it had giving it a triangular shape. it had a white and red blinking light as well. it moved very quietly making little sound. the creepiest part about it is how low it flew! it was only maybe 200 feet above us. it flew not very high at all which made the fact that it being so quiet was also very weird. no pilot would fly that low in this mountainous area at night that's insane. it continued on in the northwest direction and flew over onto the mountain overhead dodging the mountain itself by making slight turns. it looked like it could've landed on that mountain i'm not sure if it did or could. i believe it was a man-made plane of some kind because of the red flashing light being similar to the ones on real planes, but it has to be some secret military plane or something because this plane can create an extreme amount of light from miles away, possibly stay in one place, fly very low, fly very quietly and maneuver through mountains at night. i have a video showing the object flying by. it's hard to tell in the video how far or big it was but i didn't zoom in at all, it was close enough to shoot with a bb gun and it really wasn't that big just the size of a small plane at least what we could tell. at the end, the lights get kind of blurry because we are in a heavily wooded area and its flying right in the little valley behind the trees. i wish i could've gotten the whole thing. i just can't really explain what it really was.","distance":"101-500

window behind the couch. i looked out the window and approximately 200 ft from the window on the open grass on a concrete basketball court i saw approximately 4 feet off the ground a bright white light which i later decided was a rip in space, the only way i can describe it. this bright light or hole which was probably only 3 or 4 ft in diameter i saw 3-5 aliens or whatever you want to call them exit out of the hole. somehow i knew that they were going to come over to where i was and this terrified me. i did not actually see them walk from a basketball court and over the lawn to the window which was approximately a foot and a half from my body. so, it's the couch between me and the window. on the outside of the window 3 is what i remember 3 of the grey aliens where staring down at me. i tried to move but my entire body was not responding and i was frozen... frozen's probably the wrong word it was like i was a quadriplegic or something the only thing that i could move was my eyelids and my eyes so i could look over and see them staring down at me. their faces were proximately 3 feet at the most away from mine still looking through the window directly into my face. i was fully awake and this continued for i'm guessing somewhere between 15 minutes and 1/2 an hour. i know that seems like a big variance for one who is describing something that occurred when they were completely awake but it was a terrifying experience and i suspect a minute may have lasted in my mind forever. subsequently i discovered that people had sleep paralysis and describe something similar to this. however, this was not sleep paralysis i was wide awake and aware and i know what i saw so the paralysis started sometime after i saw them come out of the light or the basketball court and i was laying back on the couch and at some point they paralyzed me they seem to enjoy it and i seem to be either reading their thoughts or or something to know that...Or more correctly they communicated that to me without speech.\r\nother than staring at me i don't know what else they were trying to accomplish. during this encounter i was struggling with all of my might to try to move even one little finger i could feel my body all over. i could not move it, i tried and i tried to try and fight them to get away from them i would have went down the hallway to my room and picked out my 243 to blow them away if i could of but i could not move.Then they left. i did not see how the exited but i imagine it was the same hole. i have the distinct feeling that this has happened several times and may happen again but that that was the only incident that i remember. possibly i remember them when i was ~ 5yes old in missoula, mt. but that could be just a bad dream.\r\n i did tell some family members and a couple of friends about it but i described it as the worst bad dream ever but i'm letting you know it was never a dream i was wide awake and aware. \r\nnow approximately 30 years later i have the guts to at least report this to you in hopes it may help somebody or you guys with your research.  i am mentally stable i have managed millions of acres of federal land as the primary land officer. i am a gs-13 30 year federal employee with a staff of 30. i'm not some nutcase and i'm scientifically trained i have had no mental issues no drug issues and i have a very long and responsible

tuesday november 29, 2016 at 6:10pm local time(it had been dark for awhile) i went out into my garage. once i had entered the rear door of the garage my attention was immediatly drawn to a very bright light in a southwestern location outside the garages' south facing window. i assumed it was a star -venus specifically- but was curious enough to go and get my binoculars,7 year old canon 8x25 is. on the previous thursday night at around 7 pm i and a neighbour had used a phone app to correctly locate venus from his front lawn. this location now of what i thought should have been venus seemed off once i started to mentally compared it to the previous thursday nights location of venus. this is probably what prompted me to go and get my binoculars and go back into the garage to observe the star through the window again from what i had determined was the best vantage point after walking around the property. i had no reason to expect to see anything but a star until i looked through the binoculars and saw that it was a circular disk with 5 light filled apertures in a row along the side/edge facing me. i was at once confused and shocked because i was expecting to see one bright light, as from a star, not a disk with 5 light-filled openings in a row. multiple times i switched between looking at it with just my naked eyes and then through the binoculars. it was always the same, single bright light with naked eye and five separate lights around the outside disk shape when viewing through the binoculars. i just kept saying to myself \"it has five lights\". i was so surprised. it was moving so slowly that i didn't think it was moving at all except that during the 15 minutes that i could see it i had moved to a position up against the garage door (1 1/2feet) and was standing on my tiptoes in order to continue watching it over and beyond my neighbours roof. it did not seem to change altitude for the duration of the time i watched it. it did not revolve. it did not display any other light colour other than white nor did any lights ever blink. the five apertures on the side/edge visible to me seemed rather large and did not appear to be the source of the bright light visible with the unaided eye. by that point i wouldn't have been surprised to see figures moving past any of these openings around the sides of the inside of the craft. but i did not see any movement. there were a few wispy clouds in the sky which allowed me to see that there were additional lights continuing around the out of view sides/edge of the craft. the clouds reflected back enough of the crafts light to allow me to see its shape. i watched until it disappeared behind the neighbours roof line. during the time i was watching it i called my husband who was a 5 minute drive due west of me and he grabbed binoculars but could only see the singular bright light. so then i called a co-worker. she was driving south to go home and though she could see the bright light she had no binoculars to view it more closely. this is not my first sighting of a disk shaped craft from my home. that is for another report. sincerely  ","distance":"Over One

the light was so bright i was seeing it through the windows, or if it almost made the roof transparent. i don't know if it was dark or chrome for sure as the glow was around it.\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\ni felt like it was looking for something or doing something. i was afraid it was going to enter the house or demo it.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\nit ended and disappeared as quickly as it appeared.\r\n\r\ni shook my husband and asked him if he heard that and he wasn't phased at all and fell back to sleep. only i heard it and saw it. i thought maybe i just dreamt the whole thing and tried to forget about it. i was doing ivf and they just implanted that week, but it wasn't until after that moment that i had an faith it would work. after that event, i felt i had this knowing i was pregnant. after my daughter was born 9-12-93 and was talking she kept saying her birthday was december 12th. i kept correcting her it was september 12th. simple confusion for a child, december sounds like september. but i kind of thought about that boom around that time and again brushed it off. now, years later after watching your show on the history channel, i felt it was more real and unresolved in my mind. maybe there is more to it. i can say my daughter was quite brilliant through school and turned down going to ivy league schools. she has profound statements and a great writer. she seems to funnel all her creativity to music. i don't know if there was any correlation to that event. i don't want any media, just curious to know of any validity of this event perhaps from some more research.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

bought and was fixing up. we were traveling southeast on high way 96 when we noticed a yellowish white light in the middle of a pasture some distance from the road. the shape of the light looked like it was coming from a door or square portal. i could see inside but could not make out any details due to the fact we were to far away to see anything clearly. the upper portion of the object was hard to see because the weather was misty and low fog cover, the best i can remember the shape was kind of like an inverted triangle. we were only able to observe it from one perspective due to our position on the road. i stopped and was going to walk out and try to get a better look but the other people in my car got really nervous and wanted to leave so we did, kind of wished i had went a little closer for a better look. the object did not move or make any noise and was still setting on the ground when we left. back when i was 16 and visiting my stepdads brother in california we were out sightseeing on the coast it was kind of late because he had had to work that day so we got a late start. we had stopped at a stop sign and were going to turn onto highway 1 i think, when we stopped the clock on the dash said it was 12:00 o'clock and the next thing we knew we were still sitting at the stop sign and the clock was reading 1:00 o'clock. at that point i think we just looked at each other didn't really say anything but we decided to go back home. still can't account for the hour that we were sitting at the stop sign. there was very little traffic at that time on the

would be in the sky. i loved to star gaze. so it was in the evening hours just before dark. the object was a huge bright object. i ran and got my nephew and big brother and we all observed it. the one object slit into 4 objects one went in each direction. the mother ship as i call it shot straight up in 2 seconds it was gone. the one that came towards us descended down until it leveled off it seemed just a little more than tree top height. i was very young about 12 year old.  but i remember seeing the object as i was up close. it was triangle shaped with the top being a little domed shaped. it had no sharp edges. the area where the lights were, were flat panels. one panel will light then move to the next until it made a full circle around the ship. when the light in one panel would go out i could see a metallic panel through the glass. the craft flew until it stopped over the northeast sky and sat for a couple of hours. at this time my brother called the radio station and reported it. they said it had been reported and a jet was in route. we heard and seen the jet. when the jet got close to the object it shot straight up and was gone in seconds. the dates i gave may not be completely right because i am 60 now it's hard to remember exactly the dates but the images of the ship are burned in my memory. i could tell an artist the full description. the underside was circles of triangler shaped circles that had 7 circles until they reached the middle. it was kinda burnt looking maybe the propulsion area. the object did not make a sound as it flew over. unfortunately we didn't have a camera. we couldn't afford one back then.
