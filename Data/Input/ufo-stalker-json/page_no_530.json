appearing stationary in the southeast sky in the direction of a small airport for personal aircraft approximately 1-2 miles away. i knew right away it was unusual so i knocked on the window to my fiancé to bring my camera(canon powershot sd700is). there were bare trees and rooftops in that direction for a reference and i noticed it drifted to the left a few feet gauging at arms length and then drifted to the right of its original position fairly quickly. about that time my fiancé came out with my camera and it banked left and headed southwest or to my right. there was no noise noticed up to that point and all of the sudden it sounded like a small aircraft with a single engine giving full throttle like it was climbing but it wasn't,just banking. i also saw seemingly typical flashing navigation lights at that time. i thought that whole event itself was kind of strange but convinced myself it was a small plane because of the engine noise,which you can hear in the video. so this morning 1/23/2016 i decided to look at the video on my computer for the first time and noticed the light on the left,which is the one i thought was the plane,doesn't really look like plane lights. but stranger than all of that was the light i never noticed when making the video. you see it to the right of the light i was filming and it started out very bright white and then dimmed to a star like light,appeared to jump a rather large distance instantly, and then rapidly shot down towards the ground at about a 45 degree angle and left the screen. several seconds later it appears to be moving parallel with the ground moving to the left on the screen at the bottom. this is my second sighting i have reported but have seen several things in the sky in the past year that i can't explain. i live near and in the flight path of louisville international airport. i was very excited when i first saw it,but then decided it was a plane but kept filming anyway. i lost sight of it because of dense trees.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

lake minnewaska in west central mn. as far as i can tell it happens around once a month probably more. i have no memory of it after it happens. at first i wasn't sure what was going on.\r\n \r\n   i began experiencing anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, periodic headaches, unexplained cuts, scars, rashes, and bruises. i began having strange confusing flashes of memory. at first they were just a terrifying jumble of fragmented images, sounds, and sensations. after a few years of thinking i was starting to crack up, they eventually started to come together and become more distinct, and orderly. at this point i have a pretty clear memory of what happened.\r\n\r\n   it usually happens around 2am or so. if i'm asleep, i wake up in a panic, unable to move. all my hair stands on end, and i feel an odd sensation. almost like an electrical charge flowing through me. its very difficult to breath. a blinding light shines in through the windows and there are tall thin figures standing all around me. i start hearing there thoughts in my head. usually something like don't be afraid, or there will be less discomfort if you stop trying to resist. \r\n   \r\n   i raze off my bed, and float outside, and raze up in to the light. here is were things vary a bit. some times they just do some kind of scan. other times they preform surgical procedures. i can remember having my head clamped in place, and needles or other instruments inserted in to my scull, ears or up my nose. other times in to my forearms, or abdomen. at some point i looses consciousness, and find myself back in my bed.\r\n\r\n   i know there was at least once that they came when i was awake. it happened 3 years ago in mid september. i couldn't sleep so i was watching netflix on my computer. next thing i know i'm waking up the next morning. i remember thinking how odd it was that i didn't remember going to bed. i made my way down stares where i noticed the door was open. i found my rifle laying on the front step next to 3 ejected rounds. all 3 still intact, except that there primers had been struck. so far i have not regained the memory of what happened that night. \r\n\r\n   i'm not 100% sure this is related, but i just had to reshingle my roof. i only put the new asphalt shingles on about 3 yeas ago, and they already started curling up and crumbling. they appeared to be scorched.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":74047,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.6146825,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01232016-0002","longitude":-95.73810259999999,"occurred":866246400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1453527357000,"summary":"I

there were almost no clouds in the sky and the near-full moon was shining brightly not far from where i first noticed the object. it was almost circular or spherical but i had originally thought it was just appearing that way and was actually a plane on fire. there is a small airport near my home but this object was coming from and heading toward completely different direction(s). i was on my cell phone at the time and began freaking out, explaining what i was witnessing in great detail to the person i was speaking to. they live in the northern us so there was unfortunately no way the person could also witness the event. i thought about recording it immediately but because i was on the phone talking, while being in awe and amazed at what i was seeing, and also remembered what a few pictures i took of an orange moon looked like from my phone camera... horrible. therefore, i unfortunately did not take any pics or video. they would have just looked like a little orange speck in the sky, especially with the bright moon just a short distance away from what i was seeing. the object moved from left to right and, again, i thought it was a plane on fire and in danger. i saw what looked like flaming debris falling from the object. the first time i saw that, i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. when it happened two more times, i realized i really was seeing something fall from the object. it would happen very quickly and was only visible for a split second as it fell and the flames would go out. once the flames went out from whatever was falling, i could not see where it fell after that since it had just finished getting dark out when this whole incident took place. the entire time i was freaking out on the phone and had a feeling inside that i was witnessing something strange and unexplained. after deciding that it might not be a plane, i thought it might be a meteor. it had no trail at all and was not really moving quickly either. i wasnt sure what to think, and still dont know. after only a few minutes, the object changed directions from its original path, to suddenly heading away from me. i could tell at that point the object was getting smaller, and what i thought to be fire was slowly fading away. eventually, before it was too far away to see, the orange glow was totally gone and i could only see a tiny speck just above the treeline. that shortly vanished as well and my experience was over. i absolutely regret not taking video or trying to take pictures and you can take my story for what it is worth. i will say that i am not a dishonest person and would never take the time out to join this site and make this report unless there was good reason. do i think it was aliens?? i have no idea. what i do think is that it was a ufo as far as i'm concerned. an unidentified flying object, and i will never forget what i saw. after the event, i ran into my house and immediately searched the internet for other people who may have seen it. i found the mufon site in the process and decided to make a report. i hope there are others out there who saw this object and have some good photos or video of it. i will be searching for quite some time for answers and other people who shared my experience. i'm not sure how high up it was because i'm not sure how big it actually was, but it was definitely in the sky so i know other people must have witnessed it and it should have been visible for a good distance all around. so, that's everything. i will never forget it and i await the day i see it again. this time, i will have my camera/phone ready and regardless of what i think it will look like once i get a shot of it, i'm going to try. hopefully, i will be able to add to the mystery at that point and maybe even find some answers. thanks for listening.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

and/or snowing. the fog stayed close to the ground reaching a few stories in the air at most. i went to town to buy something and made my purchase right after they called \"shoppers, you have 10 minutes...\" so i know it was about that approximate time when i arrived home.\r\n\r\ni drove the rural way home along the river. i live very close to the river. when i was getting very close to home, i noticed a cluster of 3 orange lights very close to me over neighbor a's yard across the road from me or right on the river; that's how close we are to the river.\r\n\r\ni live in a rural area so the neighbors' houses are a few hundred feet from each other.\r\n\r\nthis cluster of orange lights was about helicopter height. there was no structure to support the lights or i could not see the structure even though it was above the fog. the lights beamed a little. they looked exactly like the street lights on my road with the same color, same size, and same slight beam of light except that i was looking at a cluster of 3 lights. the orange lights stayed stationery as i drove down my road and into my drive way.\r\n\r\ni had never seen orange lights this low in the sky and there was no structure present as to why the lights would be there.\r\n\r\ni parked the car in the back of the house and ran to a front corner of the house to see if the cluster of lights were still there. it was but it started slowly moving in a straight line, moving closer to me.\r\n\r\ni ran the short distance to get my sister to come outside and look at \"this big plane\". there is frequent unusual activity in the sky here so she put on shoes and came running out.\r\n\r\nwhat i witnessed before she got outside was a giant black triangle shape reveal itself over neighbor b's house which is the 2nd house from me to the west.  the triangle went in a straight line over neighbor b's house, it backed up a little bit like it changed it's mind and then traveled in straight line directly at me.\r\n\r\nit had descended to top-of-tree height by now. was it going to crash? why is it so low? what is it? i was scared and wanted to run somewhere but where to? i was in the middle of the yard and if i ran in the house and it crashed, that was not a great place to go. if it was looking for me, it had already spotted me.\r\n\r\nmy sister arrived outside and looked up to see it just as it started to travel in a straight line from neighbor b's house.\r\n\r\nit had great height to it. it was not a flat triangle. it was several stories height. it was flat black or dark gray color. it was way larger than a football field. it was enormous. it was so close, detail was clear of it's structure, size and lights.\r\n\r\nit turned on it's bottom lights on it's way over to my yard. it had varied bottom lights. outlining the craft were small white lights with 3 sets of red/green lights. in the middle was a large triangle area of what looked like white led lights glowing. the pattern of these white lights was indescribable.  was it showing clouds or transparency?\r\n\r\nas the triangle front endpoint arrived at the yard, it started emitting this hydraulic engine type of noise, loud, roaring, and bumpy sounding. i'm familiar with hydraulic engine sounds as to the many boats on the river here and that's the closest i would describe it. \r\n\r\n(i had heard that same loud engine noise travel the entire sky a few weeks prior to this event from inside my house. i ran outside to sight what would make that loud noise and i could not see it.)\r\n\r\nit scared me so i didn't look when it was directly overhead but my sister watched it. i could still see it even when not looking directly at it. the white lights glowed. i looked up at it after several seconds, and it was still there, hovering/moving very slowly. \r\n\r\ni got a good look at the bottom lights at this time but still don't know how to describe the white lights in the middle, what pattern the white lights were. maybe it was a transparent area as well as being lit up.\r\n\r\nif she hadn't come outside when she did, i was on my way to hiding. instead, she came outside and yelled at it to get out of here. the noise was loud enough that i couldn't hear her yelling at it. i felt responsible for calling her outside to see it and i didn't want it to get her so i stayed while making useless getaway plans and getaway movements.\r\n\r\nshe seen it approach but she didn't realize how close it was because of night depth perception issues. i wouldn't have yelled at it but she did and i'm glad. i hope that's what made it go away.\r\n\r\nwe watched it until the end of the triangle shape went over us. it turned off it's sound and lights after it went over us. the black triangle disappeared into the black night and we didn't stand around outside after that. when the sky is heavy with water like that, you can't see the stars, it's just very dark.\r\n\r\nwe still marvel over seeing this triangle. we talk about it every day. i'm nervous when i have to frequently walk back and forth between the 2 houses on the lot here. you don't want to see it again but you want to. such a mixture of feelings, it was a major event for me.\r\n\r\nit would be nice and way easier to believe that it is human military but i don't know if that is plausible. now we joke about how it was a good thing she came outside before it vacuumed me up and that two of us was too many for it to beam up. i nervously laugh.\r\n","distance":"21-100

perfectly still. then two of the white lights went out. the other ones went out, then the same two that first went out came back on. they proceeded to almost \"blink\" at each other, and appeared to get brighter and dimmer. at one point all the lights went out, then came back on. \r\n\r\ni lost track of the object as we exited the highway, but watched it for a good 2-3 minutes. the whole time the object/objects were in sight, it remained stationary in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

lights and then released towards the ground or into the water as i could not tell if they were over the gulf or near shore.  as i watched in shock of what i had just witnessed they continued to do this 3 more times, about three projectiles at once.  i then ran and grabed my phone as it was the closest video recorder i could find and videoed these two lights for another 18 minutes or so.  the

is a small ridge in the eastern direction starting not far from where we live here where i am writing you from on lincoln street in bolivar.\r\n\r\ni reported here a few months ago about seeing a lot of ufo activity in this area and i still see them.\r\n\r\ni saw stan gordon on the local news last night talking about people in fayette county that have felt blasts and heard booms over their horizon, that's what got me thinking about what me and joe had seen.\r\n\r\ni had e-mailed stan gordon in the past about orbs that i saw in december of 1999 at uparc (university of pittsburgh applied research center).\r\n\r\ni think the lights and sounds were either a crashed ufo, a starport being set up, or just some kind of a landing.\r\n\r\nlater that day i was outside smoking once again and an old army truck drove past, the kind that carry troops but it didn't have the canopy in the back and only had a driver.  the driver beeped at me but while he was passing the next house down, and turned off of lincoln street.\r\n\r\nthere are fly-overs any time i am at the state hospital or in a placement like i am now in this retirement home.  i cannot even begin to describe it all and i don't know
