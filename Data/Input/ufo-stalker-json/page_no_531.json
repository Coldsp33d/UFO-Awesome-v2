i replied \"i don't know man but something serious just happened\". my mother came into the room, looked at us and said \"what in the world is wrong with you two\"? we looked at each other, looked back and mom and said \"nothing\". then i made up a story about some older teenagers trying to hit us with eggs in a speeding car. then, i found my mothers pistol and my friend and i went back out in the back yard and waited to see if the object would return. it did not. \r\n\r\nin 2009, i was standing with a group of people in my neighborhood in booneville, mississippi when a giant object appeared in the sky. i was the 1st to see this object. it was shaped like a diamond. there were 5 of us all watching the exact same happening. all of a sudden, another object appeared next to the diamond shaped object. a long arm began to expand out of the 2nd object and attached itself to the larger diamond shaped object as if it were fueling up or transferring something. i pointed my camera at the object and got several photos of this object before calling my ex wife and telling her to go outside and look up into the sky (she lived a few miles away) \r\n\r\ni made duplicates of the photos and hid them in different places as some strange things began to happen to me. on april 17, 2013, i was framed in a presidential assassination plot via ricen letters. men in black had already showed up at my home and took my computers \"before\" i was framed in ricen letter attacks. these men took my computers. right after that, the most powerful attorney's in our state were arrested and put in prison on obstruction of justice charges. i had been getting emails from one of those high profile attorneys. \r\n\r\nas i stated, many strange things began to happen to me. once i was cleared in presidential assassination plot, flown to new york and back for talk shows...I was forced to meet with a federal government appointed psychologist to sit down and answer questions. i demanded my attorney be present as i had lost all confidence in our federal government by this time. she attended meeting with me after words were exchanged between my attorney and the government therapist. he was agitated that she attended. the very 1st question i was asked is \"mr. curtis, do you believe in ufo's and life on other planets other than earth\"? \r\n\r\nmy attorney looked away, picked up her digital ipad and began typing (maybe recording meeting. i was secretly recording the meeting as i always do on my iphone. \r\n\r\nafter this meeting, my attorney gave me a t shirt she had bought for me while out of town and everything changed between my attorney and myself. to this day, she won't speak to me in private and if/when she has, it's been very hostile. she seems to hate me now with a deep passion. \r\n\r\nmy life is completely turned upside down. nothing is normal now. i keep to myself and have very little communication with the outside world. i have been harassed by police and security officers for years. i have filed countless police reports on harasser's and have been to a half dozen kangaroo court trials where the judge treated me like a trouble making rebel nutjob. nothing to date has been done to protect me. \r\n\r\ni fully understand why so many people either lie about sightings or simply keep their mouths shut. we are living in a world where to speak out on what you know can get you killed and/or change your life for the worse so yes..I fully get it. \r\n\r\nthis is my story and i am sticking to it. thank you.

[please forgive any misspellings, since my english is not that perfect.]\r\n\r\nbackground \r\n\r\nlet me get one thing clear from start.\r\ni am not making this up. i am not writing to get any attention, in fact i am still reluctant to describe these things to anyone. i am not in any way mentally ill, imbalanced or suffer from any type of experience in life that can explain this.\r\ni have never been to the hospital for any serious illness or accident, i have never been drinking alcohol or taken any drugs in my life, cause i have always believed in that we should try to stay as healthy as possible.\r\n\r\ni am a completely ordinary person. i have no specific fears or inhibitions of any kind. i am social and easygoing; there are simply no 'odd' things about me or my life in general, that can explain what has happened to me.\r\n\r\nlet me also tell you, that i have done many tests, both during my military service and later for work and all these tests has shown the same; no irregular patterns of any kind. taking the risk to be boring here, let me also explain a bit about what i have worked with and my background. \r\n\r\nworking as a guide and ski teacher, i have spent hundreds of days trekking and skiing in the wilderness, many times alone in tents. i have made trekking tours alone for up to 1500 km. never ever during all these years have i even had the reason to fear anything or any animal. during many years i was also doing a lot of outdoor sports (rock climbing, paragliding, diving). all these kinds of activities require that you have at least a decent sense of safety and clear understanding of risks and you also get used to handle a low level kind of fear or anxiety and fear, since many of these activities are quite exciting. \r\n\r\nwhen it comes to education i have studied ecology and during some years i worked with and came to befriend several climate- and space scientists from different parts of the world. later on in life i have also had the pleasure and luck to be able to travel a lot and get to know many countries and cultures. \r\n\r\ni write this so you should get an understanding that i consider myself as a person completely normal and can evaluate both physical experiences, understand odd natural things in nature and also have a good perception of different people, cultures etc. i am a father of two great kids, the most wonderful thing in life.\r\n\r\nyet i can not explain what has happened to me during most years of my life.\r\neven though i have grasped to understand it, i started to realise that it can be nothing else than abductions. \r\ni would  have preferred to dismissed it and considered it as a result and product of my vivid imagination. \r\n\r\none year, i even contacted a clinic at a hospital, specialised in mental illness and went there to do a number of tests. \r\ni told them i had severe anxiety cause i wanted to see the result if they tested me. during 2-3 sessions (including 2 doctors) they did not find any strange mentally with me. i ended the visits, told them i felt better; the truth was that i did not want to waste resources that others needed more. they professionally confirmed what i already knew. there was nothing wrong with me.\r\n\r\nyet i woke up in terror and fear almost all nights during so many years. totally disorientated, not knowing where i was. yet i found myself as child sleepwalking; or more correctly – waking up in odd places. and with very odd dreams and memories. i never thought much about it as child. but later on in life, as these things happened constantly, i started to wonder what it was all about. it also became very embarrassing, when (for example) my friends that i visited found me sitting in the middle of the night at their kitchen table, with every light in the apartment switched on. in fear.\r\nthey always joked and knew i had 'nightmares' and needed a night light not to be disorientated.\r\n\r\nwhen i was checking online and i just focused on my symptoms, i found that ptsd (post traumatic stress disorder) was the thing that was most similar to my reactions. yet i found that very strange. why should i be suffering from ptsd? \r\n\r\n\r\nyears went by, and i was busy with life. as always, i was so used to this fear at night, that at some time i just got very angry about it, thinking that \"i don't care what it is, just let me get my sleep!\" at other times i just resigned to whatever it was, and decided it was just a product of my imagination. of my fantasy.\r\n\r\nand i could have lived with that. i can accept that we don't grasp everything in life. \r\ni know we have selective thinking and warped memories. i know that we humans are prone to trying to find the \"final\" explanation/solution to the world around us. i know we try to live in utopia. i know, just like you that we love to create myths about our reality, and that we in fact (sadly) fear things and are prone to lie to each other and live in denial. \r\ni could write it off as sleep paralysis (even if i have nothing else to indicate it). i could have accepted is in the same way that the people during the middle ages or in history made up stories of 'small folks' as folklore.\r\n\r\nwhy i started to look into this\r\n\r\nbut there is a few things that happened, that made me change my mind and try to understand what has happened to me.\r\nthe most personal was when other persons, that i had relations with or friends, started to tell me some very odd things they experienced. and remember – i have never told anyone, not even my closest partner in relation, about what i suspect this was. not a word about ufo or abductions.\r\n\r\nyet, several times during the years - also this year -i hear stories from people i know very well. simply starting to explain the same thing. they are paralysed in bed. in fear. around them, or beside them, are small persons.\r\nsome times they don't see them, only a \"quick movement\". they have bruises they can't explain.\r\n\r\none of the most amazing stories was with one of my previous partners. she was absolutely not the kind of person that would even think of these things, very 'down-to-earth' kind of personality. she had a cat. and during a period she had some of her family take care of that cat. i was not there at that time. after two or three days when the cat had been gone, she tell me that she had this extremely fearful nightmare. being paralysed and with someone on top of her. someone at the end of the bed.\r\n\r\nthe next morning she find the cat food. under the bed. dry cat food. in a pyramid shape. as if someone had taken out cat food, piled it up for the cat. the problem was that the cat food was stored in the kitchen, in a can.\r\nshe could not explain how that cat food got there.\r\n\r\ni saw that pyramid shape with my own eyes. it made absolutely no sense. i knew my partner very well. never nightmares. never anything that would made her tell this and do something like this.  that she would have sleep walked in to the kitchen to pile up food under her bed did not make any sense. i could see a true fear in her eyes, as of a real experience you can not explain. at that moment, i knew directly who had put that cat food there. and why.\r\ni could even sense it. \r\n\r\nthey did not know where the cat was. they tried to attract it to come back.\r\nthat pyramid shaped pile of dry cat food finally brought home what i suspected all the time. that we are not alone. and how contradictory, odd, strange and outright crazy it sounds, we are visited night time by other living beings.\r\n\r\nthey are small, pale, with dark black slanted eyes. they are much thinner than us, and weaker. they even fear us, or that we should wake up. that is why they are coming at night. that is why they paralyse us. i have seen it in their eyes. and they have looked into mine.\r\n\r\nthe last month, i had long conversations with a very good friend of mine, from another country. what did she tell?\r\nwithout that i have ever mentioned anything. paralysed in bed. small creatures moving. seeing a box floating in the mid air as child. hearing voices. seeing 'small japanese men'.\r\n\r\ni would have written it off as a mere fantasy, delusion or sleep paralysis. i could have told myself it was all a bunch of false memories that i had made up myself. but it is not. cause i have friends saying the same. in this country. in other countries. they are all serious, normal people. why would they make up such a story or just tell it for no reason at all?\r\n\r\neven that could have been accepted. we might all be victims of our imaginations? if it was not for that visible pile of cat food on the floor. finally, the visitors had made a mistake. we took a picture of it. she still got in her mobile phone. they left an evidence. and they were not the only ones. \r\n\r\nthe other thing that made me change my mind about this subject was two other pieces of evidence that told  me that this could not be a fantasy:\r\n\r\nthe first thing – hundreds, if not thousands of serious witnesses, military, police, pilots, ordinary people that has seen unidentified flying objects. mass sightings of ufos. radar evidence. thousands of movie clips that defy reality. even if 95% is fake, wrong, misunderstood, there are so many serious cases that can not be dismissed. \r\n\r\nthe second thing – 9/11 – that really made me understand how even governments in democratic countries cover up and lie to their own citizens. (if anyone has any doubts, check out some of the latest findings and make up your own mind about it).  i keep myself well updated what's going on around the world and know that most countries unfortunately suffer from authoritarian, corrupted regimes. but it is also clear that most democratic governments are keeping many things hidden from the public. none of these are as evident and clear as in the 9/11 case, where who ever is responsible, as told completely false stories of criminal acts.\r\n\r\nthe cat food. the stories from my friends. the ufos filmed and on radar. the cover up stories of governments.\r\n\r\nthese four things made me realise a very uncomfortable truth. a reality that i had experienced all my life.\r\nthat all over the world, visible flying in plain sight and sneaking around in our houses, are other living beings.\r\nwith a mindset and technology that are totally different from ours.\r\nthat is why i write this. \r\n\r\nthere is something going on, that is partly hidden from us. that we can not grasp. that we are not told.\r\n\r\nafter 50 years, i has accepted that i will probably never know the truth about it. and it's ok. but at least i will share my experiences to those who had the same, who felt that fear and who doubted themselves.\r\n\r\nnowadays, i see no other choice but to look at what the evidence and reality tells me.\r\n\r\nthere is simply no way that all these ufo films and evidence can be false. i have heard the testimonies from pilots, military and the polices. i have studied hundreds of hours of them now. my sister has seen one. and i had come to realise that the shadow of a black triangle over me many years ago that made the starlight disappear was probably one as well. that is the most worrisome and at the same time most clear thing.\r\n\r\nif unidentified objects are flying around, then there is someone controlling them. \r\nand i know who it is. they have visited my homes all my life. and perhaps yours too.\r\nand it is also obvious that the governments know about it. but do not tell us. \r\n\r\na shattered mirror om memories\r\n\r\nlet me then try to explain to you what i have experienced.\r\n\r\nthe first real odd things happened as child. i still have a very clear visual memory in my mind from my childhood. \r\nthe problem with that memory is that i am flying diagonally over a high way somewhere. i can see he net of wires and orange lights that shine down on the street. i am probably 2-4 meters above. the strange thing with that memory is that i can not understand why i have it, how i can see that angle. and most of all. i remember clearly the dust and dirt on top of the lights. that kind of detail that i never had in a dream. \r\n\r\nthe second thing was that my father needed to tie a rope around the clip where i opened the window as a child. one night he found me hanging out the window. for the fear that i would 'sleep walk' and fall out (we lived on the 3rd floor) he locked up the windows. why was i hanging out the window in the middle of the night? why would i like to get out through the windows?\r\n\r\ni had a fear as a child of dark \"goats\" eyes. when we visited an animal park/zoo, i feared their eyes for no reason.\r\n\r\ni also got terrified over a picture my family put up. a santa claus. with totally black eyes. i feared it so much that they had to take it away, i told them that \"santa was coming through the wall\".\r\n\r\nthe most terrifying experience was at about 11-12 years of age. i was staying at my sisters place. \r\ni had these really scary nightmares. and flashes of seeing 3-4 small pale persons with black eyes, standing beside the tree outside, they first seemed a bit unsure where they were going, then they turned and looked at me inside behind the glass door and started walking towards the door. and of that one of them pressed his face against the glass to look inside. then memories that they were inside the house and how i tried to escape. then my mind is blank.\r\n\r\n\r\nthen all these nights, waking up in odd places. in different rooms. with all the lights on. screaming in fear loud so other woke up. \"sleep walking\" was the reply from the family. even nowadays, i prefer to have some kind of natural light (window) or small night light. i know i always will be disorientated before waking up if i get these nightmares. my partners always had to endure all these years of  night mares. they told me i always wanted to \"get out\".\r\nyet i have never suffered from claustrophobia. i have been diving in darkness. i have been crawling in caves as a guide in the mountain. this is not any kind of it. this is something else.\r\n\r\none of the nights that i woke up at my friends place (previously told) i had switched on every light in the whole apartment, including in my friends bedroom! i was sitting confused of fear in their kitchen. and i heard voices. downstairs by the door. voices getting fainter, as leaving. and a sound as if the door was closing. \r\na short while later my friend was awake, asking what happened?\r\n\r\na very good question. yes, what was happening? 15 years later, i still ask myself that question.\r\n\r\none year, i was skiing in the alps. in austria or france. at that time i spent many seasons of years doing that.\r\nand one winter i was in a smaller village with my friend, they had some kind of traditional celebration.\r\nthe villagers had costumes of different types. one of them had like a mountain goat. even 100 meters away when i saw it - in full daylight and knew it was just a traditional celebration and a costume - that shape and eyes got me suddenly so scared and paralysed of fear that i directly told my friend we needed to leave. i could not understand it.\r\n\r\nmy friend was surprised, i made up a story why i needed to go back. i could not stand a moment more seeing this shape and costume. i could not explain why. i was out skiing with my friend, and just stopped to see it. i was truly terrified by that look, but was trying not to show it. why did i suddenly got scared away from a costume of a goat in the middle of the day? it was something with that shape, eyes and movement the person with the costume did that triggered something in my mind.\r\n\r\none time, not so many years ago, i found myself sitting and staring at the door. suddenly gripped by a fear that someone would enter. at lunchtime. i full daylight. i tried to reason with myself. the funny thing was at that time i lived in a very peaceful village close to the national parks, with minimal reasons to worry. never any crimes or anything happened there. so i laughed at myself and realised that it must be something else. like a memory of something.\r\nfinally, i had to give up and locked the door. i laughed at myself, but at the same time i had some really odd memories. of strong lights outside the window at night time, shining down from above. of small persons walking through the wall. i was sitting eating my lunch, totally gripped by sudden fear that someone would enter. so odd. it felt like a 'bubble' of a memory, that surfaced my mind.\r\n\r\nthis is one of the oddest things about all this. i have at wintertime looked in the snow outside my house or apartment to see if there are any tracks of any kind. but has never found any.\r\n\r\nin the end i decided that i would not fear these things anymore. and honestly, during all my life nothing bad has ever happened that i know of. at that time when i got the sudden  fear, locking the door, i also got two red rashes on each side of my belly. the lasted for some days.\r\nand suddenly the tips of my ears lost the pigment, as if they had a cold damage. but it was in the middle of summer.\r\ni woke up and stared into the mirror, laughing at myself. the top of my ears were white. they still are. they never got any pigment back. i don't know why. the rashes and the strange look of my ears is the only strange things that appeared in associations with these experiences.\r\n\r\nstill i have a bad feeling about this. the paralysing fear that is felt close to these creatures are worse than any fear one can describe. it's so bad that i know that most of the time i have not even dared to look at them. \r\nbut one day i understood that feeling. in an unexpected way.\r\n\r\none year i had the pleasure of joining the work of a friend in northern scandinavia, herding the reindeer’s in the winter.\r\nthey are staying most part of the year in the wild, but a few times a year they are located, rounded up and they are captured by the family owning them. they are marked, so every family know how many reindeer’s they have, they are sometimes given antibiotics or some medication, and some of them are taken away to be slaughtered for food.\r\n\r\nwhen i stood there and worked and assisted my friends, i could see the terrified horror in the eyes of the reindeer’s. they tried to get away, they run as fast as they could. the fear of us was so clearly displayed in their eyes. they were almost paralysed by it sometimes when we grabbed them. they could not understand what was happening to them.\r\nmost of them was later released, and could live the rest of the year in freedom on the mountains. until next time.\r\nsome of them never returned.\r\n\r\nthat day, when i stood there among them and saw the fear and terror in their eyes, i recognised the behaviour.\r\ni realised that i was just like them. that we were all rounded up by someone we did not understand. that did something to us. and then let us go on with our lives.\r\n\r\njust as difficult as it is for a reindeer to understand what we are doing and why that is happening, just as difficult it is for us. imagine the reindeer. strange intelligent creatures appear suddenly surrounded by technology he animal can not understand. we even fly in air planes. how would a reindeer ever understand what that is?\r\nthen we capture them, inject things with strange metal medical tools. and let most of them go.\r\n\r\nthat day, i understood that we are no different. what if we are the reindeer?\r\nthen it would not be so strange at all. we show exactly the same pattern of fear and problems of understanding.\r\n\r\nlater on, when i was finding and ordering whitley streibers book communion i got such a bad feeling of that front cover when i opened the package that i had to put the book away and i could not stand to read it. i did not like that front cover. it took many months before i got over it. a front cover. on a book! it just does not make sense to have that kind of reaction. what is triggered in the mind, seeing such things?\r\n\r\nto this day, i don't know what all this is or means. but i know one thing.\r\nwe are not alone on this planet. actually, i never thought so, looking up at all stars, knowing how many hundreds of millions of solar systems there are. already as a child i was fascinated about space and about zero gravity. \r\ni spent some of my time as a kid learning the numbers of distant galaxies. i never understood why.\r\n\r\nfrom an ecological perspective, it's not surprising at all. there are so many species in our world, many of them are rare and look really strange and weird. nature has a diversity and a way that is so complex that it would not surprise me at all if there is a lot of life everywhere in space.\r\n\r\nit is just very odd to find them in your own mind, bedroom, apartment or house. sneaking around at night. \r\n and to realise that they fly around us. sometimes so obvious that one wonder if it is done by purpose or if many of these orbs are just unmanned things measuring or studying the planet. that they do not even understand that we see them clearly sometimes.\r\n\r\nanother feeling that i have for them is pity. pity because i know and have felt that they fear us. that these tiny intelligent creatures are not as strong as they seem. and many odd things, such as the cat food, missing clothes or items and how they behave, seem to me the most realistic evidence of all, that we are not dealing with any fiction or fantasy.\r\nthey sometimes simply don't seem to understand that some of their behaviour is too obvious. they even seem to be forgetful and to be fascinated about some things. \r\n\r\ni do not believe most of the stories about them. and not what they have 'told us'. or many too detailed conspiracy theories about it, where people claim to know everything about them. it just does not make sense either. \r\nif they have the power to do what they do, they can most likely affect us to believe anything. most of the time we are probably filling in the gaps ourselves with whatever personal, cultural or fearful imagination we have.\r\n\r\nif it was not for the the way they look and act, so terrifying for us on a personal level, i would almost feel pity for them and could almost stand their presence. but still i fear them too much. and i hate the way they move. but the more i learn about it and other peoples experiences, the easier it gets over the years.\r\n\r\ni hope you can feel the same. thanks for taking the time to read my story.\r\ni hope you can feel comforted by the fact that we are many sharing the same strange experience and the more we understand it, the less we fear. never mind what other say. we all know that feeling. we all know what we have seen.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

about 20 yards west from where i was standing smoking a cigarette. i was looking up because there was a tiny little cloud formation right about above the treeline, just floating very calmly no wind at all. i noticed what at first i thought was a kite sort of fluttering up above the treeline but it was a dark, super calm night and was hard to see it through the tree canopy, but as soon as it rose above the treeline i could start to get a better look at it.  it then came towards me off to the south side of the oak tree flat like a bird, the whole time i'm just staring at it trying to get a good look, it starts coming at me and so i'm thinking ok, its a really big bird with its wings out, then it banks sharp exposing its underside it seemed to be triangular although its hard to say, as the object appeared to be translucent with a black surface and i'm not sure 3-5 red circles on the bottom of it, the harder you tried to get a good look at it the harder it was to see, the object had almost whitish edges, the whole thing looked like it was made of light, but there were no visible light trails coming from anywhere as if it were being projected, it flew off like that on a south east direction until it dissipated? it did not seem to be going very fast but it made no noise and it was most definitely not an aircraft we have mucho air traffic here, i'm used to all kinds of things flying over head except this thing. and we aren't far from the wapato basin which i hear is a ufo hotspot, never saw one until recently and i have lived here since '86. although i have seen many wild things in the sky in my life even witnessed a real life skyquake( sounded like a mothership concealed in dense cloud cover) in liberty wa, super freaky, and my father saw his first ufo when he was 10. so i'm like whatever , i finished my smoke and went inside and started telling everybody what i saw.","distance":"21-100

projectile. it was spherical. i watched as it glided right over my car. it was the size of aspirin in the sky. it headed northward a few miles then turned eastward toward crownpoint, nm. it kept going until it was lost to the atmosphere. there were very sparse distant clouds, so i had a pretty good view. this object was flying below the clouds and was not flying very fast. it looked pretty deliberate. i didn't feel any reactions or feelings except, \"i need to watch it and rule out planes.\" i was excited more than fearful.\r\n\r\ni know it wasn't just me who saw it, but i was the only

were walking along a trail in the woods that went from her mom's to her dads, the walk should have taken about 20mins. it was pitch black outside, we had a flashlight and gun. the woods were thick but eventually we reached a clearing about 2/3 of the way to her dads. there had been many sounds of wildlife all around us then suddenly the world went silent, a total absence of sound. we both looked up and saw a huge ball of light directly above us about as high as the treetops. the light was brilliant but surrounding the light was an absolute absence of light circling the bright ball of light, after that total absence of light was the residual glow from the ball of light. we tried to scream but there was no sound. we blacked out what happened next but we \"woke up\" while running full speed

1/4 have been extremely close encounters. 7-10 close sightings had multiple witnesses, my last encounter/abduction that i last remember was november 5th 2015 , well at 1st i didn't remember anything, i woke up and knew instantly something had occurred, found a few scratches but couldn't find anything that strange to know foresure. later in the afternoon i looked at the pictures on my cell phone and my memory of the encounter came back as i looked at each picture for the 1st time.\r\n\r\npic-1\r\n it started off that i remember feeling a energy wave that was throbbing and it felt as if i was being put to sleep. i got up, grab'd my cell and stumbled to my bedroom window looked out and right above my building was the exact same glowing golden amber red/orange plasma alien ufo as carlos diaz's ufo pictures. and was now my 3rd time seeing that specific craft, that close. i took a pic as it started to come lower and it had some energy beam dematerializing my nextdoor neighbors home, so that the ship wouldn't damage  anything. \r\n\r\npic-2\r\n when it got a lil lower then 80-60 ft a large golden white sphere ejected out from it and slowly came down almost touching the ground , hovering a few feet off. when it started to pull me towards it, as i got near it floating towards the opening i took a picture, but it is too bright to really see anything..And i think bcuz of the dematerializing retractor beam i was in, is cause for the blurr\r\n \r\npic3 is not the original, only filter was added as it was too bright.\r\n before i entered the ufo i figured that like every other time before (whoknows?)i wouldn't be allowed to stay awake or remember anything this time either,... so as soon as i entered i took a pic, and was right.. i black out as i took the picture, and i remember what the 1st alien looked like, half of his right side of his face i captured in the pic,(top right side pic3) also he had like a yellow-golden  holographic glowing image or version of himself radiating off of him, like his body was a projector, could be a biomagnetic force field of sorts?Maybe?If i were to guess,..Anyways .I think he may be the reason why most ppl remember a big bug like praying mantis, i think he may be 1 in the same.. he had dense thick glowing white energy clothes ..And then i blacked out fully..I hope?Lol\r\n\r\npic4\r\n i came too, still inside the ufo laying down, still with my eyes closed,(my choice)i could hear that i wasn't in my room, as they made such odd noises talking back to each other,. as i became aware of what happened, i pretended i was having a flying dream, so that i could feel for my cell and not get caught by any telepathic eavesdropper listening in and monitoring if im still blacked out under their control or awake. and i believe he was distracted and didn't notice me open my eyes turn my camera on and said \"say cheese!\" and i was out again as i took the last pic. but i got to take a look at least, and i myself was bright light. light was radiating from off of me and i couldn't see any other lights, the walls were like black void, i seen a laser machine to my right,floating away hovering from the top. and i seen 2 aliens at my feet doing something, working on something,  closest alien was a tall clammy brown/with a pale white hue-  humanoid,same glowing white clothes as the big bug and when he turned to look at me, he vanished, or was cloaked, and i caught it on camera! as he is turning invisible, you can see his blue fingers in motion blurr reaching towards me, with a few finger tips behind the toes of my left nike jordans shoe glowing the same white light i was glowing. \r\nthe 2nd alien is very short, 2ft tall and navy blue'ish dolphin skin.His face and eyes are visible- follow directly above my shoe right above those fingers blue fingers of the 1st alien is the short aliens face, he is the same alien i took 3 pictures of my last birthday, i'l file that 2moro 2u..\r\n\r\npic#5 is pic#4, but with color inverted like a negative- gives more perspective.\r\n\r\npic#6 is also pic#4, but with heat and thermal filters- which shows actually a lot more than the original, you can see detail in the alien, his face and eyes, his body,  the dip in his armpit, his arms and fingers, and the aura around him cloaking him, i suspect this is important to our scientist. :) welcome, it also shows a perfect absolute clear cut no doubting outline of my shoe and to top it all off is the laser machine in the top right corner, with my face, cell and fingers reflecting my image like a mirror off of the laser machine,\r\n\r\npic#7 is the alien from my june 17th 2015 abduction @ 12:15am   \r\n\r\nplease investigate as i contacted mufon at the start of my ufo sightings in 2012 and never got a reply back, thank you for your time ryan g.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

alongside the road in our direction so i was paying extra attention to my surroundings. as we were getting closer i told my friend he should get his phone out to record because i thought it was rather odd what i was seeing . in the beginning of the video you can see the 2 bright saucer like objects side by side going in and out of the tree lines the was to the left of the road . however , about mid-way through the video the 2 saucers go from side-by-side from a good distance away from us,  too them looking as if they were stacked on top of each other that ended up hovering still in thin air fairly close to the ground right above downtown sharpsburg. once this happened , you can hear us both react to what we were seeing . this transition happened in about 5 seconds after watching the video again. while staring at it i noticed a very faint misty beam of light that was dark green aiming towards the ground . i had to really stare at it though to see it . (you can not see it in the video). however you can hear me say something once i notice it while the camera was recording. my friend finally saw what i was seeing and he got so freaked out he stopped recording and told me to pick up the speedi was going .

into the sky and surrounding stars.  there \r\nwas a half-moon shaped object about 1,000 feet up and was in a \r\nnorth-north east direction.  it was brighter than the stars that were \r\naround it.  the colors were like blue & white led's.  they seemed to be flashing or going around the object.  it's present up in the sky \r\nalarmed me and it also scared me, so i went inside to get my husband up \r\nto see what it was.  as i pointed in the direction for him to look at, \r\nhe said, \"it's the northern lights and went back to bed.  so, after he \r\nsaid that, i felt less fearful and went back to bed, as well.  however, \r\nin my mind it was something different.  i probably watched the object \r\nfor approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  the object did not seem to be \r\nmoving.  the lights never changed patterns or anything else.  \r\n\r\nthe 2nd sighting occurred on nov. 28th, at 5:15am, again letting our dogs out for potty run, i looked up in the sky toward the same direction as the 1st sighting.  i noticed an object of similar shape as the 1st one and at about the same height, about 1000 feet.  i believe this object, like the 1st one, was not moving.  again, the sky was clear with lots of stars around it.  the lights seemed more brilliant and brighter than during the 1st sighting but the shape seemed to match.  it gave me an eerie feeling \r\nagain.  i was afraid to even keep watching it.  so, instead of waking my\r\nhusband up again, i felt like i might be able to get a picture of it \r\nwith ages old kodak digital camera (kodak easy share c 613 200-af3x).  \r\nwhile i was trying to get a sighting in the view panel, i could not \r\nbelive what i was seeing.  i clicked and shot 4 or 5 pictures.  the 1st \r\nshot that i had taken when i printed out the pictures, came out blank.  \r\nwhat i remember of what showed up on the viewer, was a fan-like shape-3 \r\nblade shapes, looking like a propeller.  however, all the other shapes, \r\nonce i enlarged the individual shots, left me stunned and bewildered, as\r\nwell as confused as to what the object really was.  i feel that this \r\nsighting was something unnatural.  i can only speculate that it was a \r\nufo sighting--and hopefully, friendly. \r\n  \r\nnow, when i let the dogs out, i don't look up into the sky.  this 2nd \r\nsighting was about the same time span as the 1st--about 20 minutes.  i \r\nlet the dogs back in and went to bed.  \r\n\r\nmy 3rd sighting occurred on jan.10, 2016 at 7:00am.  looking out our kitchen widow, i saw the bright pulsating light in the sky.  the sky was clear with no other objects or stars visible.  this object is in the same general area as the provious sightings mentioned previously.  i've again taken pictures of it.  \r\n\r\nmy 4th sighting occurred on january 14th at 7:03am.  looking out the back door, automatically looking up to the sky, noticing again, very bright lights.  it appears to be the same object that i've seen on other sightings.  the sky was still dark but it was getting more daylight in hue.  still clear but as time elapsed, the fog started interferring with the visibility of my sight of the object.  the object appeared to be the same shape, color, etc. as the previous sightings. \r\n\r\nmy 5th sighting occurred on january 14th at 7:15pm.  looking out at the sky tonight, not expecting to see anything, again seeing the object in the general area as it was this morning.  there were 2 more objects left and right of a central object.  the formation of the sighting was like a \"v\" shape.  these objects were very active--moving sideways, up and down.  the same colors, bright white, blue, red and green were in a flashing pattern.  at one point the object on the right appeared to tilt on its side a bit.  with this new angle, it appeared to be a very large (huge) saucer like shape.  i don't like using that as an analogy but don't know what other way to describe it.  it looked like it has a wide rim around it where the colors were flashing either through it or around it.  the fog started to overtake my view of the object.  the night was clear with lots of stars out.  \r\n\r\n[f.I. comment:  witness made a verbal comment that was left out of her written statement.  she said it appeared, during this last sighting, that the objects knew they were being watched and they were, basically, showing off for those who might be watching.]","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

that wasn't white in color like the one i was observing that was in the top right corner of the picture and it was a long worm like figure that was a brownish copper color that seem to have what i
