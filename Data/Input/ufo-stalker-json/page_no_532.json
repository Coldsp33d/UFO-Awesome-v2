aerospace engineer and am fairly knowledgeable about astronomy, types of aircraft, and how to identify them. this is where the story begins. one clear night (early june, around the 5th or 6th), i was walking back from the bars to my apartment with two of my good friends. in order to get to our apartments, the end of our journey requires that we follow a road that goes over a small hill. when we crested the hill and were heading down to our apartments on the other side, one of my friends said there were bright lights in the sky. we all look up (more like ahead and slightly up) to see four very bright yellow/orange balls of light. these objects looked as if they were on the same vertical plane and were very similar in brightness to some farther off street lights. as we are all gaping at the lights, trying to understand what were are seeing, they start to slowly rotate in a clockwise direction. their original distances away from each other start to slightly change as well, distorting the imaginary shape these points of light created. after i shut my mouth, i realize that i should be recording this somehow and reach for my phone. my intention was to attempt a video recording of the lights. when i open the camera on my phone i accidentally take a rough picture of three of the objects. then i quickly change to video mode and start recording the four objects we are observing. i start zoomed in and the objects appear clearly and very close to a street light (from our perspective). this street light is only a fraction brighter than how some of the objects appear. note that i was recording on my samsung galaxy s4. this is a fairly good camera during daylight hours but just like any cell phone camera, fails to work in the dark. even the fact that my camera can pick up these objects show how bright they are. because of the light pollution the street lights around us create, no stars are visible, but the objects still are visible to us. then i zoom the camera back out(i'm not sure why) and take in the entire event as it unfolds. the quality of the video suffers because i am not always focusing on where my camera is pointing. the longer the video goes, the less time i am actually capturing the objects for i run farther up the street and to my demise, directly below a streetlight. the voices myself and my two friends can be heard with their exclamations. i actually hate listening to the video because at the time i was buzzed and sound like an idiot, trying to explain to my friends that the lights are no mere airplane. then i stop the video to run the very short distance to my apartment to retrieve my dslr camera and get my roommate to come out and watch. my friends all followed in pursuit of me and for the next minute i am scrambling to find my camera. in my frantic, very quick search, i can't find my camera and we all decide to run back out as see if the objects are still there. by the time we got back out to the street, the lights have all disappeared. the total time it took us to run inside and back out was less that a couple minutes. disappointed, we walk back inside and discuss what we saw. we all agreed that we have never seen anything like it and watched the video i took and looked at the photo multiple times. shocked and tired, we parted for the night and went to bed. the next day we went talked through the event again to make sure that we all saw the same thing and we weren't dreaming. to this day we are certain we saw a group of unidentified-flying-objects. they did not resemble a plane, helicopter, satellite, or any other air-born technologies that we are familiar to. to make it clear, there was no noise being emitted by these objects, for the night was perfectly silent. these objects must have been very large and far away, or closer and smaller than realized and perfectly silent. note that the area the lights appeared over was farmland and very scarcely populated. the lights appeared over a large wheat field of the palouse.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":73974,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.7355971,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01192016-0005","longitude":-117.1797277,"occurred":1433556000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1453181470000,"summary":"Four

from the 3 to probably 5 to 7 to 10 pretty quickly that were flashing in alternating sequence like you would see on a plane but the space distance between the lights would have only been possible as multiple planes horizontal from each other yet there was no way they were other planes because there was nothing visible where any of the lights were blinking when the light was off... even on the original 3 lights i saw.  this only lasted for about 5 seconds with all 10 blinking but then i lost them behind the view of trees on the side of the turnpike blocking my view as the road curved gradually back and forth.  the whole event lasted about a minute or more.  called wife while watching them.  the lights appeared to be somewhere between carlisle and mechanicsburg where they were up in the air. i am very familiar with watching aircraft activity in this area and have never seen anything like this before. pulled over side of road to find them again but could not.  i know i didn't see a mountain tower or other regular explainable aircraft or normal light in the sky.\r\n  when i was near home about 10-15 mins later i drove to another vantage spot to see if i might see them again hr i only saw regular planes and jets in the sky and the normal mountain tower lights.\r\n  i did not video or take pic because i was driving and felt they were also far enough away that they probably would not have showed up at all or at least not very well on my phone.

a buddy to get out of class. my friend was walking around on the roof while i was lying down. i was staring up at the stars when i saw a bright white elongated diamond shape appear out of nowhere. \r\n\r\nthe object looked as though it was coming through the atmosphere because it had a contrail but the color was nothing like a comet's trail; it was more of a pink color. the 'front' of it was the elongated, more acute angle (i.E. the pointier end of the diamond).  it traveled a short distance in a straight line before it disappeared. (approx. 2 inches if i held my arm straight up)\r\nthe contrail seemed to be coming off of the object and disappeared just as the object did.\r\n\r\nat this point i yelled \"holy ****! dude did you see that?\" just as i was saying this i saw another white diamond appear in the same area of sky. this time the contrail was red/purple. the object flew perpendicular to the first object's path. it seemed a little bit bigger than the first one, but i am not sure if it was the same object a little closer or if it was a second object. this object was visible for the same amount of time (1-2 seconds) before it vanished just like the first one. \r\n\r\ni wanted to make sure my friend saw it, so i yelled \"look up!\" and pointed towards the area as the second one was going by. by the time he looked up it had vanished. \r\n\r\nthen a third diamond appeared in the same area of sky! this time its path was parallel to the previous one; the flight path of all three basically made the shape of a capital 'h'. it was bright white like the others but there was no trail coming off of the object on this pass. it moved slower this time and it was much closer; i could actually see the diamond shape spin on its long axis! again, it vanished after a couple of seconds had passed.\r\n\r\ni asked my friend if he saw it too, he said \"yea, what the hell was that?!\" (more like he yelled in a panicked tone). of course, i had no answer for him. at this point i felt a wave of anxiety come over me and i wanted to get off of the roof as quickly as possible and go somewhere inside. so we both hurried down to the ground and went indoors. i asked him what he saw and he basically said it looked like a bright spinning arrowhead that appeared and disappeared. \r\n\r\nthe images of them have been burned into my memory and i have reflected upon that moment quite often. i am not sure if it was the same object slowly making its way through the atmosphere or three separate objects. i am also not sure if the brightness of the object was from the heat produced by an object entering the atmosphere, but that is the only explanation i can think of; it still bugs me that the third sighting had no trail but was still bright white. i simply do not know how to rationalize it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":73966,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.7518284,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01182016-0017","longitude":-82.6267345,"occurred":1349387100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1453141936000,"summary":"Elongated diamond decending, white hot with contrail changing color with each pass.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/73966_submitter_file1__FullSizeRender3.jpg"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":80,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":80,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1200,"locationName":"Saint Petersburg, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:93150"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have been in contact since i was 4 or 5 .

string of lights that looked like radiating stars in perfect alignment and spaced equally like on a kite string.  i took pictures for 20 minutes then my phone died.  i was shocked to see this and got my sister to look at them as i had never seen anything like this.  at first we thought they were airplanes arriving at the airport, but they never moved and then they glided down in synch following the arc pattern in the sky. they were white with various levels of brightness.  one in the middle seemed to be further away and then moved into alignment and was the same brightness.  the lowest one had a blue tinge in the center and shaped like an orb.  the top one was the same size and density as the bottom one.   they were stationary and in perfect alignment staying in place for 45 - 60 minutes then suddenly they moved down to the horizon in synch. that was about 12:20.  i am not sure how far away they were but think they landed.  they got brighter as they traveled down and then disappeared at approximately 3-5 degrees from the horizon. it could have been behind the hills to the east.  they moved straight down in alignment like someone was pulling a kite string. one after the other. the top light did not move until all others went down and then it glided down separately in the same alignment. my sister witnessed the entire event with me. i took the attached pictures from my deck but did not have my phone when they started moving.  there were 8-10 of the lights. i walked to the back of my lot to get better pictures but they were not visible at that angle.  after they came down i could then see at least two lights moving like airplanes.  when they were visible i looked for airplane lights in the sky.  at first i thought they were satellites, then drones, then i concluded neither.  the point at which i concluded i was seeing something unidentifiable was when i realized after they disappeared so quickly i saw airplane lights and they were headed towards that area.  my pictures aren't very good, but if you enlarge them you can see the lights. mystifying for sure.

18:50 i went on to my terrace, outside at the back of my house for a cigarette and to take a look at the starry sky on such a clear night. \r\n\r\ni initially noticed a very bright white flash, which i can only describe as what resembled a \"camera flash\", very intense white light lasting no longer than one second. it had an approx. elevation of around 25° from my standpoint and was observed above the roofs of the adjacent houses.\r\n \r\nafter the initial flash i could no longer see any object or reflection. somewhat perplexed as to what this object may have been, i continued to observe the sky in that general area. \r\n\r\nonce more, a bright flash was observed (though not as intense as the first) which seemed to show \"a flight path\" all be it, in a straight line moving from west to east.\r\n\r\nvery intrigued as to what this may be, i continued my observation with more passion. i could then very vaguely distinguish an object either emitting or reflecting light for a period of 2-3 seconds. it appeared as a dark orange to red, slowly appearing then fading into the night sky. the speed of the object was faster than i have ever previously observed from any satellite and i am certain (call it gut feeling if you wish) was no civil or military aircraft. there was no evidence of signal lights or such forth. \r\n\r\nthis observation was not so bright but visible with the naked eye, although this was in an urban area with somewhat light pollution from streetlights and the moon.\r\n\r\nat this point i then rushed in the house to grab my i-phone in the hope of capturing any image or video. as i returned i witnessed another bright flash and again vaguely seeing an object in a reddish-orange slowly come into view then again fade after about two seconds. \r\n\r\ni was occupied with my i-phone, getting it unlocked and the video switched on as again the object again came into view. it was seen as a vague reddish-orange light slowly appearing only to slowly fade after maybe two seconds. i could also tell the object was moving away at this point in an easterly direction. unfortunatly i was too slow with my i-phone to capture any image of this and i'm not really sure if this would have beed \"picked up\" by the i-phone camera due to the above mentioned light pollution.\r\n\r\ni then had my i-phone video switched on and pointing it to the general area as to where i last observed the object, taking into consideration the trajectory and speed the object was moving at. there were no further observations and i thought this strange experience was over. \r\n\r\nluckily, there came another two flashes which i actually managed to get on camera. this was the last i saw of the object, though i patiently waited and filmed further for some time.\r\n\r\nto be noted the video of the first flash @19 secs. doesn't really do it justice as this was faster to the naked eye. the light reaction time of the camera seems to make it slowly appear then fade. the second flash @32 secs. is more like what i saw with the naked eye. \r\n\r\nsumming the whole experience up i can only describe the objects actions as too fast and too low the elevation to have been a satellite. i have seen satellites suddenly reflect sunlight before but never to such an intensity and briefness (like i mentioned above similar to that of a camera flash) as this object, especially the first initial flash. \r\n\r\ni am sure this was no aircraft due to the lack of signal lights, sound and the general nature of the flashes, appearance of lights emitted from the object. this object was also not a drone, though there is no proof i certainly had a feeling the object was far away and for that it was simply too high & fast.\r\n\r\nmy only personal explanation to all of this was either a meteor or some space debris basically skimming on the upper atmosphere (similiar to that of a flat stone skimming accross water) due to such a flat trajectory. in my opinion this would explain the bright flashes and intermediate \"glowing\" of the object. \r\n\r\ni'm no rocket scientist but the one thing which certainly sticks out in my memory of this experience was the intial flash. for me this is a true ufo as i really haven't a clue and it remains to me unidentified.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am sending the video of course but also other photos to give an impression of the panorama from my little terrace.\r\n\r\nthankyou to anyone who takes the time to read this and take me seriously, my girlfriend just laughs at me !\r\n\r\n\r\npic 1 - between the lnb from the satellite dish

about sixty five miles from where this event took place,i had never been there. a co-worker of my mother decided that it was time for me to see the wilderness on top of the absaroka mountains. hell roaring plateau and canyon are a little ways north of the top of the beartooth hiway which winds up and out of red lodge. 4 generations ago, my family settled the foothills of the beartooth mts- a frontal component of the over-looming absaroka mt. range- boasting the largest alpine plateau in the lower 48. of course i always wondered what was up there and now i was going to get a chance to see. brian came to pick me up at an hour for which i had never risen. even though it was 4am, i was still glad i got to go for a cruise in brian's '76, step-side 454! after an hour and a half drive from billings and an embarrassing, top of the world, toilet-free defecation, we began our precipitous descent into the 9 lake alpine valley where, for three days, we were going to fish and camp. it takes a hour or so to mountain goat your way down to the valley and on the way, clinging to lichen, i could see from the top of the planet, down to the rippled homeland below. also, within that time, the weather had changed into almost every basic permutation at 5 minute intervals.  by the time we found suitable ground and set the tent, we had experienced snow followed promptly by 90 degree pure sun and back to extremely gloomy hail and fog followed by naked radiance,etc. i had never been to a place that so embodied it's name. i was beginning to have my doubts about the joys of camping in the wilderness. misery and existential vulnerability were creeping up on me faster than my imagination could populate the gnarled sub alpine trees with wolverines, bears and cougars. luckily, brian decided it was best that we have some mid morning cocoa and i sat in the tent wondering how i would survive this ordeal. brian carried on unpacking the two big packs we brought in when i heard him day the f word. i hadn't heard him curse before, but it made things better somehow. \"your not gonna believe this\" he says, \"i forgot to pack the fishing poles.\" oh wow, maybe i'm saved from this experience, i think to myself.  not two seconds later, brian says, \"how 'bout you stay up here and guard the camp while i jet back to town and get the poles\" confused and for some reason not wanting to appear afraid to stay in the wilderness by myself, i muttered something akin to \"sure, you bet.\" since time was of the essence, it wasn't, it seemed, just a few minutes later and i actually was alone in the wilderness. when i could no longer hear brian's scrambling,footfall echos, nature's very breath was loudly closing in upon the small green tent that hid me from the teeth of creation. for at least an hour, i trembled in abject fear knowing that at any moment i would either be struck by lightening or vivisected by a dire wolf. there was no doubt in my mind that i would die today until suddenly the sun came out and stayed out. it made the tent hot enough suddenly that i had to find the courage to get out and stand before the ravages of nature- just like, as a little kid, i had had to stand up to the monster in furnace room so that i could go to bathroom at night. i unzipped the door and crawled out on wet corsican mint. it was like i had been born into a blessed, perfect world where eider horns bellowed, where trout buttered and smoked themselves. everything i knew as a 5th generation montanan came back online. i was twelve, indestructable and the only human in one of the most beautiful and pristine places on earth. having long forgotten about the encroaching feral dangers of 5 minutes before, it was time to explore. now, the wonderland into which i was just born is a valley with 9 small lakes that lies beneath a snowfield aproned 12,000 foot peak. 10,000 years ago, the se end of hell roaring was scooped out by a manhattan sized glacier, thereby seeming to spill from on high to the foothills. i started there,  i made my way back up the valley towards the peak.  a tiny creek bounded down though lilies, lichen and mint connecting the lakes. all were surveyed for future fishing access. each had it's own feel. the 2nd from the top of the valley seemed to have the best fishing prospects. i had to climb through a boulder debris field to reach the elevated, uppermost lake. as i came out of the ancient, tiny trees and encountered the spill zone horizon, i was once again riven with a shock of deep fear. in front of me was a huge pool of pure black water. along the north edge, tumbled beneath a 1,000 foot granite cliff, boulders the size of buildings impaled the lake's merciless glass surface. i backed away from the edge, figuring that if i didn't touch the lake i should be ok. i explored the giant boulders on the north side. between the spillway and the mountain, the south edge of the pool was a beach of human sized boulders. after peering into the light starved depths between the buildings, finding it impassable, getting very creeped out, i decided to make my way around the south side to the snowfield at the bottom of the peak. the snow beach gently planed and melted down into what i had decided was hell's entrance. besides the primordial, ringing cliffs and the bald peak above, i was now standing at the valley bottom's high spot. i swore that i could see the curve of the earth as elevation suddenly drops out onto the great plains. the view of the length of the valley was mine; the day had become montana-perfect, not a cloud in the sky. feeling safe from the world's scariest lake, warming on the snow, pretending i was thor, i let my mind and eyes roam the valley which is technically a box canyon.  gazing godlike upon the glacially scooped far valley end, marveling again at how perfectly it rolls off into nothing, i noticed something coming up over the great lip. it was a small cloud. i've never seen a cloud move that close to the ground.  for some reason though i didn't really take direct notice of it until it made it's way a little further up the valley. from where i was standing, the cloud seemed to be coming up the valley stopping at each lake for a minute and then proceeding to the next. as i watched the cloud survey the lakes, i wasn't overcome with another wave of fear but a kind of stunned fascination. clouds don't do this kind of thing, do they? i thought that maybe it was just an odd alpine phenomenon, until it came up over the spillway to hell lake. it had meandered all the way up the valley for about ten minutes and then it appeared over the tiny trees, directly across the lake from me. now i see that it is definitely the weirdest cloud i've ever seen. it's perfectly disc shaped. it's about 30 feet in diameter, maybe 10 feet thick. while it looks like a cloud, i can't see any feature, misty or otherwise. the cloud, about ten feet off the ground, moves to the edge of the lake,stops and hovers. i'm still just kind of dumbfounded. then, it begins moving very slowly forward, over the water and a \"finger\" of cloud stuff reaches down from it's center to the water surface. now, i remember, i started getting scared. the cloud is coming right at me with it's finger dragging across the water. frozen, i stand there until the cloud is right above me and it's finger grazes my left side. with a gentle, static \"pop\" the finger retracts into the cloud.  i spin around to my left and see the cloud instantly ascend 2,500 feet over the peak behind me. this is the point where things got fuzzy and i appeared to have moved to my right, a quarter of the way around the lake,over to the human sized boulders-without knowing it. i had the distinct feeling that time had occurred without me noticing it. i \"came to\" with my whole body stuffed upside down into the boulders. i say \"came to\" because i felt like i had been sleeping and having a powerful and frightening dream, the kind where you wake up and have to remind yourself that your ok. i didn't know where i was. i remember smelling rock all around me and thinking that i'd be ok if i just stayed put. then, and this is really weird, i could feel a loving presence and hear a woman's voice telling me it was ok to come out. when i backed my way out of the small boulders the feeling of well-being greatly intensified and i found myself on my knees at the water's edge, across the lake from the cliff. i could feel a radiance of perfect love showering down from the top of the cliff, above the giant boulders. i could hear a voice in my head telling me to look, look up. there, on top of the cliff, straight out of a maxfield parish painting was a 500 foot tall goddess wrapped in impossibly colored ribbons of light- sunning herself. time lapse again and i'm back at the bottom of the valley looking out onto the plains. this point of the story marks for me what i can only describe as a massive knowledge shift. as i sat there, i was flooded with cascading fractal equations which somehow set permanent in me an absolute knowledge of the indivisible unity of all. i then remember hearing brians's echoing climb down into the valley and i made my way back to camp. i didn't tell this story to anyone until i was in college.
