about 500 feet ahead of me, and as i continued forward, it continued forward, until the road turned north, and i couldn't see the object any longer. i kept looking to my left to see if the craft turned north, but i didn't see anything. the craft was black and had smooth corners, with two lights on the bottom and one on the top. the white lights were extremely bright, but did not pulse. it was about 20-30 feet across, and 15-20 feet tall. i wondered if it was an aircraft, but there were no flashing red or blue lights, or wings. it was flying too low to be a plane, and i've never seen any planes fly in that east-to-west pattern over west hills road. the flight patterns to republic airport(which is fairly close by) are north-to-south, and i see the small planes or small jets fly by my house in a north-to-south pattern on a regular basis. the craft was flying just west of route 110, which is one of the most very heavily trafficked north-to-south routes on long island. even though it was a saturday night, i noticed that there was a lot of traffic on route 110. i don't know if the craft flew over route 110, or if anyone else noticed it. there was no one else on west hills road in

wooded area. i wondered if i had really seen the craft, since i don't have any point of reference in my life to compare the sighting to. i am totally amazed at what i saw, and won't forget

(now looking east) to look at the plane again.  my attention immediately went to a seemingly normal nimbus-type of cloud that was at a higher altitude than the plane.  as i looked at the cloud, i saw a perfectly straight line being traced/cut through the cloud as of something was flying through it but there was absolutely nothing there.  i wasn't sure what just happened so i just kept staring at the cloud and roughly 15-20 seconds later, the cloud had continued its normal movement and the perfectly straight line was gone.  at no point was there a visible craft or object but there was an unmistakable, perfectly straight line being made through the middle of the cloud.  it was like a vapor trail in reverse.  i have no meteorological knowledge and as such i have no idea if this is

had the same distance from each other and going in the same direction. beautifully parrellel. there was no specific sound, calmness really. the 2 objects kept moving ne but higher to the sky from the

video and it only did a few seconds so i just kept trying to take picture and zoom it as much possible to get a better view. it latest a few minutes. i actually called my mom to tell her and she said she was close so i was telling her i will go to her to show her and my dad. however, our connection failed. so i recalled and said i am coming but as soon as i said that i saw the 2 objects slightly move to the left and disappeared instantly. i wanted to share my experience with others because i am certain this was a unique ufo experience. i also felt an itch on my left and i saw like a line

a triangular formation of 3 identical spheres, also bright yellow, appeared in the same location and remained stationary for 5 minutes, never changing in appearance. all 3 dimmed simultaneously and went dark. seconds later another single sphere appeared in the same location and was once again bright yellow, glowing for about 2 minutes, then dimming and going dark. the entire sequence lasted between 10 and 15 minutes. when a photo was taken of the formation of 3 the moon could been seen clearly in each photo, but the objects were not visible at all in any of the photos. the sky was mostly clear with scattered high stratus clouds. no sounds were heard. a report was made with the hood county sheriff's office. a deputy came to confirm our sighting and told us he had received a total of 5

wife and i had just got home from the coast and she was getting ready to go out to the movies with her sister,  i went outside to call my dad to say hi and have a chat like i do every week,  i was walking around out the back of our unit complex in curtin act, it was around 19:30hrs when it was dark and there were storms around the canberra area.  i looked up to watch the lightning going off in the distance when i noticed a plane going across the storm clouds heading south west / westerly.  what really caught my eye was the bright light flying behind the aircraft, it was zig zagging in quick sharp movements back and forward about 100m of the back of the aircraft. i watched for about a minute in awe then finished on the phone to my dad, mesmerized by the sighting i realized i should get my wife i ran to the window and got he attention and told her to come out and look at this, when i turned to look back at the aircraft and the bright light the light stopped for a second and then shot off into the storm clouds. unfortunately my wife didn't get outside in time to see it.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the light behind the aircraft i thought it may have been another aircrafts front light until all of the zig zagging then i realized this was some sort of craft that we do not have the technology for.\r\n\r\ni was amazed and felt so excited because i have always been interested in ufo's and any unusual phenomena.  in my life i have seen many things i cant explain including ghosts and other ufo phenomena which i would love to share.","distance":"Over One

flew over my head in my backyard i heard them howling and echoing throughout the neighborhood i was amazed to even see them in person so i decided to pull out my camera to try get glimpse of the owls after 15 minutes of walking i never did find them but heard them on the roofs so i tried to put night vision on my camera to see if could get better picture that way but the snow was reflecting the street lights with an orange type light towards the lens as i started to look at the roofs and seen cloud moving that almost looked like a bubble and it was the only one moving so i watched until i seen a giant flying object that was so close to the ground with triangle shape with lights on 3 corners of the triangle and an arrow shape light on the front sides of the triangle flying object with a big circle in the middle that pulsed  red and flickered a  white light at the back side of the triangle i did not get good shot with my camera what made me upset about it i should of just kept my camera on its normal setting but i was panicking to get it on camera before disappeared i really really want to try get it on camera again but after getting it on camera i put it in my pocket without knowing it was still on i start walking towards home in the middle of the street and i hear the same noise the ufo was making through the sky and snow above the clouds maybe there was more so i pointed my camera up hoping to get another one but nothing came to the plate. i lost site by clouds and snow\r\nat the time i was looking for snow owls.\r\ni thought for sure it was a ufo.\r\nit flew out the clouds below it coming from north west and flew east above me. i felt exited i felt like i wanted to try signal them haha so i started to try film with the night vision witch was no help with

approx 20 mph. i noticed in my view up to the left through my front windscreen an unusual white, short sharp trail perhaps 5mm in length it looked but was well over a mile away in the sky looking towards the south east region. it started as very small white trail with a 45 degree angle. then the trail seem to change direction going vertical. at this point i felt that an object was causing this trail as the trail took a upside down very shape appearance.  which looked like it was caused by drag against whatever this object was. all i could see was the trail though and not an object. i felt this was very unusual. it then appeared to change direction again by which it looked like it was going back to the left of my view in the sky (almost like back on itself)which i have never seen before and still at this point i could not view an object just the trail which again had changed shape and drag looked like it was from left to right. because i wasnt able to undresrand what it was using logic i thought best to try and take picture. i took several pictures on the hope that with my camera on maximum focus i would capture some detail. reviewing the pictures i managed to capture something quite remarkable and i wanted to show it you today. you will have to zoom in the photo. it appears in the moment i have captured the actual object which has caused the the trail which i initially viewed. when you zoom in on the object it appears that it's somewhat of a transparent star shaped object which is slightly curved too. i have attached the image for you to view. my phone has recorded the exact location i was in too.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
