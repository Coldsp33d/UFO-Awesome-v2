(my daughter says she remembers opening the door and seeing both dogs in the laundry room wagging their tails )  i then don't remember what happened with the dogs.  did i let them come with me to the bedroom - did i let them freely roam the house . i don't remember - i remember going around my living room - and looking out every single window - and thinking wow it is really bright outside and a creepy dense fog was present.  really dense fog - like i could see it inches away from my windows 360 of my house like a blanket. \r\n\r\nnext thing i remember i am in bed. have no recollection of sleeping so i thought i was just laying there. it is actually really confusing.  my right ear hurt - it hurt as if someone had penetrated my ear with a hot rod.  there was dried blood in the lobe and i quickly tended to it like a normal earache.  at the time i \"woke up\" i was crying in pain - but at the same time my daughter next to me was like \"some one was in the room - they were holding me down - they were holding me down\" \r\n\r\ni seem to remember that i was lying on my side with my back to her but i was extending my hand awkwardly behind myself to reach out and pet her?  then i also suddenly remembered that my other daughter had asked me questions but she was asleep?   the timeline was off. - i didn't remember much of anything in order .   \r\njust a couple of days ago - i called the security company because i was waiting to see when someone would come out to fix my security camera that burnt out that evening.   turns out my doorbell camera is burnt out too.  \r\nas i was complaining actually taking the time to troubleshoot the cameras i noticed the last video recorded.   the indoor security camera was fried that night and recorded ---whatever it is -- it has large arms.  the light switch on the wall is 7.5 inches from the door way!\r\nthis is way too close to home - actually seeing something in your house is the scariest of

evening. then all of a sudden this red eye appeared, looking at the dogs and me. it was across the road heading west, i mean the eye was so clear that i could see a gold ring around the red

between me and my neighbors house. it stood there for about 30 seconds and when i started to raise my light, the eye disappeared. to me it looked like a lizard's eye. it didn't seem in wanting to harm us so i didn't chase it. my question is i've been hearing reports about bigfoot being dropped off or taken up in their space craft, suppose that's what the alien was looking for ? i have seen bigfoot in the woods behind our house. there have been others that have seen him also. my feelings about all of this ? it all started in 1970 when i was sitting in a lawn chair looking up at the stars and seen a little bright light go from one star to another. you would not believe what i have witnessed thru the years. people would say i was nuts and crazy. i don't care, i know what i have seen and

outside the house.  anna was getting ready to leave for home.  it was very dark, clear skies, no moon, and no wind. \r\n\r\nteresa and anna observed a small white light due south at some distance, possibly one mile away.  the object was traveling directly toward them and grew in size.  it traveled to the edge of our field near the tree line; a distance of approximately 600 yards.  it then made a sharp, 90 degree turn to the east and instantaneously turned bright red in color. \r\n\r\nit continued to travel east and immediately moved very quickly in an up and down zigzag-like fashion.  no sound was heard.  at this distance they would have heard a helicopter, but they insisted that they heard nothing and it was not a helicopter.  anna was still watching when teresa noticed to the southwest, high the sky, a set of three lights in a triangle shape.  the lights were traveling east.  teresa now called anna's attention to this.  suddenly, they both observed several more lights, approximately eight in total number.  all the lights were now traveling in many different directions.  again, no sound was heard.\r\n\r\naround this time teresa called me to join them outside.  when i

very low and near horizon, the height of which was the tops of the trees at the far end of the field.  it seemed very far off. it moved very slowly east, in a perfectly straight line.  stopped.  then

sun had already set, still light enough to see, but getting dark fast.  there was a slight breeze coming from the west.  my wife teresa and i both saw the object, although i saw it first.  we were walking our dog in the hay field heading east.  i observed a light rising to the east over the tree tops.  it was climbing fast and my first thought was that it was a small, private airplane that had just taken off from some nearby airfield.  yet, i know of no known airfields in the area; a fact i later verified while talking with a local resident.  the object was very bright, as if a large spot light was affixed to the front of it.  i could not hear it.  i could not see any flashing lights.  nor could i see any features such as wings.  the object was just big, bright and round. \r\n\r\nas the object climbed i was not viewing it straight-on, but at a slight angle.  it did not seem to climb very high and then leveled off.  it turned and headed northwest.  i could not tell you what its altitude was as i had no frame of reference.  it seemed twice as high as the nearby treetops and perhaps one mile away.  it was at this point i drew my wife's attention to the object.\r\n\r\nas my wife and i watched, it was traveling northwest, more or less paralleling the nearby road.  we were now viewing it \"side-on\" of the object.  however, it  struck me because it was still equally bright; in other words, there was no change in illumination even though we were now seeing its side.  it traveled slowly.  then it did a maneuver that startled us.  a very fast, very sharp \"v\" like maneuver.   angling sharply down to the left, changing altitude to about one-half its cruising altitude relative to the tops of the trees.  when it reached the bottom of the v it immediately moved sharply up, continuing its v-shaped flight path until it returned to its previous cruising altitude. it traveled a short distant and then did another \"v\" maneuver, but this one smaller in overall change of altitude. \r\n\r\nit continue to travel northwest and by now we were viewing its side and back; yet, it was still as bright as when i first saw it.  when it had flown about one-half mile it changed direction following the path of the road that makes 45 degree turn to the north.  we were now viewing it back-on; yet it was still very bright, no change in illumination.  as it flew further i caught sight of a solid red light from the underside of the object, but this was fleeting.  the object was now too far away and we quickly lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nthe total sighting lasted about five minutes.  by the time it was out of sight it was dark.  during our observation i thought that it may be a radio controlled plane or a drone.  my son is a member of the academy of model aeronautics (ama).  so, i know a little about radio controlled planes.  during our observation, the thought crossed my mind that it was such a thing.  but, this object was too large, too bright, and the operator would certainly have lost the plane because it had easily flown out of radio range.  could it be a drone?  that too crossed my mind, and i know little to nothing of drones.  a friend suggested it could have been a government controlled drone. perhaps, but i have no way to check this out.  can a drone make such maneuvers?","distance":"501 Feet - 1

january. i live in the country so the stars are very bright and with no clouds they are particularly clear. i noticed out my window what at first i thought was a satellite moving quickly to the east. i have seen many satellites over the years and something struck me as odd. first of all it was actually changing direction as it traveled and then changed its speed slowing down. the weirdest thing was when i pointed it out to my wife and daughter the ufo started flashing off and on in different sequences...This my sound strange but i actually believe it was communicating with me. i felt an incredibly strong pull to the object. then it vanished from sight. this isn't the first ufo i've seen. i have even had a day time sighting where it vanished after hovering then reappeared.The change in direction and flashing was definitely under intelligent control. there is nothing to my knowledge that acts like that. i have family and friends in the military and even engineers in aviation. i have a good understanding of what our aircraft both civilian and military can do. i checked the nasa web site to see if anything was in the area. nothing of course. i wish our government would come clean with disclosure. even better...I hope these visitors will actually make personnel friendly contact with me. i'm not a weirdo...I'm an educated business owner who makes a good living and raising a normal beautiful family. alien visitors a normal natural part of our existence that's being with held from the public... i hope those days of ignorance is soon over. i would be happy to take a lie detector test on either sighting. these past few sightings gave convinced me without a doubt that an advanced alien species is visiting us from another world...No question! i would be happy to discuss any of my sightings with mufon...I enjoyed our last phone conversation. thank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

and nobody had any pictures or videos to share.\r\n\r\nthe location of the object is also where birds are often seen circling, riding the updrafts which are always present, probably from the nearby river?\r\nwhich got me thinking about the landfill in tullytown (bucks county, pa)\r\nright on the delaware river, which is a half mile away. maybe the craft was interested in the landfill? there is currently a lawsuit against waste management of pennsylvania regarding noxious odors, et cetera, from their handling the site.\r\ni would also like to point out that military planes from joint base mcguire-dix often do training flights in the area and my home is in between flights coming and going from newark & ny airports. i didn't see any planes heading west during my observation so maybe they were directed away from their normal flight paths.?\r\nfinally today is january 14, 2016 and i haven't seen any ufo's since.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

used to exercise in the lake park with my girlfriend. that day, some park lights were off and the sky was unusually clear so you could see lots of stars. during a pause i took a look at the sky and noticed some rare stars that looked all messed up, like there weren't supposed to be there. i mean, i look at the sky all the time, i know some constellations and stars, i know how the sky of my hometown looks and know the difference between a planet, a star,a satellite, a plane and many other stuff that we may see around here. this was none of that. it looked like a bunch of new stars very, very far away and they were unusually red. so i kept looking and like a minute into my observation one of the lights started moving north (i think) and within a few seconds i saw it move like 1,5\" and then further and further away until it disappeared. the others didn't move. couldn't recognize them but can't assure that they weren't supposed to be there. they might have been just regular stars that my untrained eyed was unable to identify. but then again, i have never seen so many red stars together like that, so i don't think they were actual stars. i left 30 minutes later and they were still there. so that's it. i saw something that looked like a star in the sky move. and it kept me thinking all of this time, how big and fast has an spacecraft to be to be able to be so far away, (probably out of our planet and moon orbits) and still be seeing moving how many miles if i saw it move less that 2 inches in a few seconds?\r\ndon't know if this is going to be useful but i finally concluded that i had to tell someone.\r\nsorry for the lack of pics or video but my poor cellphone at the time didn't have a camera good enough for capturing such a

practically near my house has changed my life. after looking at this object for a few minutes i quickly walked home and that was it. i told my family about it but would have been impossible to see it from where my house was so i don't remember anything else about the incedence after that. i didn't feel threatened in anyway but the size of the craft i'll never forget. it was larger then the 3

hovered for 15-20 seconds and moved slowly and silently at a right angle across an open field toward me at a height of approximately 200-300 feet until it reached the power line.  there it hovered for approximately 30 seconds.  it then shot straight up about 400 feet in the blink of an eye.  it hovered for a moment, then it accelerated to the east so suddenly and rapidly that i could not follow it with my eyes.  the painter, who was on the roof, saw it as it crossed the field and exclaimed 'what is that!'.  my son, twelve years of age at the time, also saw it from another angle, across the street.\r\nat no time did the object make any sounds, emit any lights or exhaust.  \r\n\r\ni am an air force veteran of the korean war and am familiar with high performance air craft of the time. the
