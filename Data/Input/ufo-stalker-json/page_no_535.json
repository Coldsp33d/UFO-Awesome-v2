was 24 years old while looking at the night sky, as usual, when i saw 3 very bright light circles measuring one third the size of a full moon; however boasting a dark matter within each circle giving it the apparition of circular rings. the said rings were then joined by approx. 3 to 5 other bright rings forming a definite triangular image of spectacular nature. this all happened and witnessed by myself for approximately 5 minutes until the triangular formation sped off at extremely high speeds.\r\n\r\nduring 1974 and 1976 i experienced my first unexplained phenomenon within my home in the late hours of the night when i witnessed a ball of light with tentacles pass within my home's corridor.\r\nagain, i was not able to identify this

movie stated at midnight.  i live in the country with only farms around me.  i heard the clock strike midnight and when i went to put my cigarette out i noticed a weird light and looked up.\r\n\r\nalmost directly above the house a huge circular object was moving from front of house to back of house in straight line.  it was so close it felt like i could almost touch it.  it had lights around the bottom edge and they were blinking or pulsating in sequence.  that is when i noticed there was absolutely no sound coming from this object whatsoever.  it moved slowly but almost seemed more like it was floating.  i knew from living near an airport that for an object this size (200 ft around minimum) it was impossible not to make any sound at all and that is when a fair bit of fear started to come over me.  \r\n\r\ni have a big willow tree behind the deck, but because it was winter i could see it as it moved directly over the house heading north, then over the back field and beyond the trees.\r\n\r\nthe guy living with me at the time was sitting on the couch waiting for movie to start and i motioned for him to come over and hurry as there was something outside. but i was also trying to be quiet as i was scared, so he didn't seem overly interested.  however, when i became more insistent and said there was a ufo he finally came to back door and looked.  i believe he saw it just as it went over the tree line (only for maybe 20 0r 30 seconds)\r\n\r\ni never reported this as didn't have a desire to be labelled a weirdo.  i live not to far from an airforce base, so thought perhaps it was perhaps a secret aircraft or something.  i did search the web for pictures of spy drones, experimental planes etc. but found nothing that resembled it.

cloud formations.  laughing to myself i figured they were clouds seeded from chem-trail operations, so i took out my phone to capture the skyline with the clouds.  i was about to take the picture when my stoplight turned green, so i put down my phone and proceeded over the overpass.  once on the other side i looked back up at the sky to see an object move out of the clouds, and make a sudden 90 degree turn straight up.  i took out my phone again and was able to capture the trail of the object and possibly the object itself ascending, though that is not clear from the footage.  but the craft clearly did a 90 degree turn upwards.  i have worked with aircraft for the usaf and witnessed some interesting flight capabilities, but never have i seen an aircraft fly through cloud cover such as this and perform such a dramatic change in direction, in atmosphere.  within 2 hours of viewing the object there was another sighting over socal/nv skies, which was said to have been \"russian missile debris\".  are the 2 related?  after the sighting i felt a little on edge, especially after another event happened that same night.

north. the light was round and bigger than a house, the white light had a roundish ball moving around with in it and was metalic in nature and was the color of gold when melted, as it passed over i noticed some distance behind the light a bluish haze and in the haze 4 or 5 lines that were zig zaged lines, it looked like what you would think electricity looks like, like lightning bolts, or plasma waves, the lines were constant and not blinking or flashing. as was the blue haze not moving or wavering, as it was some distance to the north i noticed a small red light under and behind the white light and it blinked. i just happend to be standing out side looking to the south smoking a cigar as my wife does not let me smoke inside. the speed of this craft was incredible, the light was enormous, the propulsion system unlike anything i have ever seen, i worked at an airport for an aircraft co. i have been around planes, and are a passion of mine for years. there is some thing some

and as i looked out like i often do i noticed 3 very bright lights with the same illuminated appearance suddenly pulsate. i then realized they were moving very slow from the w headed e. the lights were positioned as if they were at the end points of a triangle. i then could make out that it was dark in color with the short end \"width\" of the craft estimated to be 300- 400' and the length to be 600' -700'. i immediately ran out to my front driveway to witness it be stationary and rotate on it axis without a sound. i then realize that i was watching something that is life changing. i will never forget this event. at this moment i was trying to video the craft when the lights dimmed and two went completely out. only one dim light was present as the craft rotated. i could still make out the shape because of its size. i was amazed as it slowly moved to the se where two commercial airplanes were heading e and ne just a few thousand feet above the craft. at that moment the craft just disappeared as i watched. i tried to view my video to see if i caught anything but there was nothing i could make out. at that moment i jumped in my car to drive to an open area near my home to see if i could view it again. i studied the area with no luck. this was an amazing moment to witness and confirm stories of ufo' s. the only reason i'm filling this report is that in the past 6 months i have witnessed other unexplainable events that i can't find answers to. in october 2015 my daughter and i were star gazing on a clear night and watched for a lack of terms the brightest burst of pulse lights at what i guess was around 70,000' or more. we watched for over a half hour several burst of lights that looked like they would build up energy and then send out a pulse of the brightest light. at one point we were watching 3-4 within 100's of each other. they stayed stationary for 15 minutes and then move. i brought my wife out to witness them so i didn't seem crazy. i knew they were not satilites or commercial aircraft. these were twice the altitude of commercial aircraft. these burst of lights happened the next night as well. i tried doing some research on this and couldn't find any documentary so i excused it until i experienced this triangular shape. i haven't shared this event with anyone. even my family. i certainly hope this triangular craft is our military, because if not....It's scary to think what or who's craft this is. thanks for your time. i can sketch this image if you find it helpful. i will keep the video for proof of date and time. maybe someone can do more with it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
