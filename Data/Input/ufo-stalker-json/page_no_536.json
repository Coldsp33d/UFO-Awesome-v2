 once i got to the park i rode out to the shores and noticed that the light was as bright but definitely further in the west than made sense. from the curvature of the shore line it seemed to be coming from downtown.  i immediately thought how could i see lights emanating downtown from the point of where i first noticed them? this is over 25 km; however it made sense that such lights if they exists would be used downtown.  i was still puzzled because i knew there was no festivals that night in montreal so why was the area so brightly lit up?\r\n\r\ni pedaled harder and faster because i was so pumped up on adrenalin and i did not want to miss the festival, but in the back of my mind i was just wondering what technology they were using to emit such a brilliant light.\r\n\r\nsince i had concluded that it was coming from downtown, i then presumed it was coming from place ville marie because this was often a festival venue, so i headed directly there.  when i got there i rode around but then realized that it was not there but essentially a couple of blocks away to the south over the chateau champlain hotel.  i thought this strange because nothing ever happens on their grounds. when i got there which was no more than 60 seconds i looked up and there was that light and steady dull glow in the sky.  i rode around the building a few times looking for lights from the ground shinning upward, but there were absolutely none.  the light was shining downward to the ground.  it covered the entire area and i had no explanation of why.  the light was coming from above the building.  i just kept looking up and riding around the building trying to figure out what i was seeing.  i noticed people passing by periodically and pointing to the sky but not more than that and they seemed not to be too concerned, just puzzled, then continued on their ways.\r\n\r\napproximately after a half hour of studying the light and trying to explain it to myself, i started heading north along peel street to go home but i kept looking back as i could not explain what i was seeing.  the light never moved or changed its intensity.  it was like an oval / roundish halo of light which hovered there without sound or motion.\r\n\r\nas i got closer to home i noticed that the intensity of the light had diminished some and again i found this strange because my house in relation to downtown was considerably closer, (less than 4 km) than where i had originally noticed it.  i could only conclude that the light was now in motion vertically and or horizontally.  i have no idea of which direction it seemed to have moved.\r\n\r\nalthough it would be considered as a mass sighting, i was alone for the entire event.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":73854,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.49817161548952,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01132016-0011","longitude":-73.58401231767887,"occurred":300924900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Quebec","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1452684127000,"summary":"I was ne of the city island when i noticed the lights sw.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Halifax","timeZoneName":"America/Halifax","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"H3B 2B6","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13330,"locationName":"Montreal, Quebec","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:93381"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Missoula","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I went outside to see if there were any fireworks going on.  many folks blow them up on new years eve.  i could see a few \"displays\" from my back yard. some to the south where the center of town is.  i also saw a few smaller ones  generated from the next neighborhood north of mine.  these fireworks were plainly visible from my backyard and were less than a mile away.\r\n \r\n    while scanning the sky i noticed what i first thought was a helicopter heading in my general direction. it moved from the ne to the sw. then it stopped and just \"sat\" above the hill just east of my backyard. it was totally silent as opposed to the helicopters which fly over.  as i watched it i could make out 3 lights. it seemed there were 2 on the top and the third directly below the other two. like 2 at the shoulders and 1 and the base between the feet.

shaped crafts, arranged into triangular formation. one at a time, each space craft moved very, very, quickly into space. they changed direction at speeds which no aircraft i know of could possible do. soon, more crafts came. they did the same as the others. then the last grouping of crafts formed a straight line, one at a time. forming a line looking like that which i have seen arraged in the formation of the pyramids in eygypt. they eventually lined up in a perfectly straight line, and all went out at very rapid speeds into space in the direction of orions belt. my son used his starmap app to find out this information. after the last orange orb lanched into space we noticed a black blob of cloud like matter moving very slowly across the tops of the houses in our neighborhood. this happened emediately after the last orb was out of sight in space. we continued to film the black cloud like object. it looked like a \"demon\" as my son stated. i believed it was a cloaking device. we continued to film the object, which eventually decended below the treetop levels and appeared to land within a few blocks from our house. when we looked at the film, we both realized the craft which was behind the black cloaking device was in fact very clearly a space craft. it was clearly visable. we were completely amazed to find the spacecraft was completely visable. every detail can be seen clearly. even the windows, the markings, the lights, the craft is so completely seen it is unlike anything i have ever seen in any program, show, news report, program, etc. what we have is the best evidence i have seen in my life.  when filmed, the cloak, the black cloud, until it was no longer there. we have very clear, concise, accurate, real time, documentation, of both the frontal, side, and rear views of this spacecraft. at one point, you can clearly see the craft coming out of the picture. in other words, the stop frame shows half of the craft visable; and the other side of the craft divided by a straight line, where half of the vehicle is covered in the cloud, cloaking device, and the other is visably coming out of the black cluod cover. these real time digital images are so clear you can see the front, side, and rear views of the space craft. when you blow up the image you can see the windows on the side of the craft, the markings on the craft, and a clear picture of the face of what many people describe as a grey alien. you can see beams of different colored lights emminating from the craft. there are no wings, no landing gear visable, and this spacecraft made no sound. it is clearly not a drone. our pictures, videos, are so clear, so complete, you can prove without any doubt that what we have is a real, moment-by-moment, documentaion of the entire actual event as it happened. the digital images can be enhanced; an will provide the best evidence of ufo sighting and documentaion i believe that have ever been shown. we are very afraid. we have backed up all of our evidences on numerous devices, we have provided these evidences to numerous people, and they will become public if anything should happen to either myself, or my son, or any of our family members. these digital recordings we have, have been shown to numerous others. they all cannot believe how accurate, clear, and distinctly, this evidence  provides proof of some type of ufo, spacecraft, government, or extraterrestrial vehicle. never-the-less, we really need your help in getting this information out to the public once- and-for-all. we truly believe we have the smoking gun that everyone has been seeking. we want this information out to the public, but we want to remain safe from government intervention. we have ensured our safety. all of the information will be made public if anything should happen to either one of us. please help us...! we are very fearful because of the proof we have. there were documented reports in our local news program channel 17 news in bakersfield ca. it only stated that someone gave them a picture of one single glowing orb in the sky. this is not at all what happened. we have frame by frame documentation with the very best digital cameras on the market. again, we have numerous back-ups, which have been given to many people and cannot be stopped from going public should anything happen to either one of us or our family members. we decided to seek your help first, then go public. we need to state, these crafts came from a location from the east. this happens to be a location where there is a very secretive military base here in california. never-the-less, this evidence will prove the existence of some spacecrafts that are beyond anything known publicly. please contact me at 661-863-7799. we are very willing to share all that we have, know, saw, and witnessed. after the sighting, we tried to track the landing sight. we drove to different locations and eventually know where we believe it landed. we will show you that location and our thoughts on what happed to the craft at a later date. the location would be very easy to hide the craft and move it by rail very quickly by the government. i believe this craft was dispatched, ejected, or abandoning its main ship, because of some type of failure. the other crafts were tracking, following, and staying with this craft, to ensure it safely landed, before they left. the craft that landed looked different from the others. why was it cloaked. when seen by the naked eye? it was invisable to the naked eye. when we viewed it on our digital cameras, it is clear, detailed, and can bee so clearly seen, one whould have to woder what type of technology could make this craft. i have 2 ba degrees, i am in a masters program at my local university, i have my teaching credentials, and both my son and i are both college students who are reasoned, well educated, and completely sound minded. the government would have a very difficult time discrediting a 4.0 graduate student with numerous honor awards and scholorships. we both want the world to know these crafts, beings, events, are real, and truly happened. we want this documented event to be made public, with are safety, and our families safty assured. again, we have taken numerous steps to ensure this does happen. please contact us a.S. a. p. and we both will provide you with all of our evidences once contacted and proper verification of your credentials are assured. please note, i do not give you permission to use our evidences until we are assured you will do what is in our, and the publics, best interest. once we are assured you are who you say you are, and will do the right thing, then will will gladly agree to allow you full discression to disperse our documentation, and evidence to the public. most importantly, that you will ensure our safety.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\nme.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

dark where we use a flashlight to find each other, kind of like hide and seek but in the dark. by the time of the sighting, only one other friend was still outside with me, while the rest went back inside as the temperature was getting pretty chilly. we were both standing between two bushes in the garden behind the house, looking out at the stars, since my friend would soon be leaving town to move to a larger community and this was essentially our goodbye for the next little while. \r\n\r\ni initially noticed the object, since the paranormal has been a large part of my life and anything unusual in the sky will immediately get my notice. more so, i'm used to how the sky looks behind my home, and this didn't match the regular stars in the sky.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed the object, it looked like a star, except it was travelling northwards at a slow pace, which obviously stars don't do. soon, i realized it wasn't a star, or a satellite, because as soon as it reached directly in front of us, it stopped. i pointed this out to my friend, who seemed transfixed on the object, and as i turned back to look at it, it blinked and grew to the size of a basketball, if i held it out as far as i could with one hand. i was suddenly very afraid, but i couldn't move my eyes away from the object. i was seeing a ufo, after all, something i had always wanted (next to a bigfoot sighting or sea serpent, at least at the time). \r\n\r\nafter what seemed like 4 or 5 minutes, the object vanished, or blinked away, as it disappeared from our sight completely. there was no trace left behind, and it hasn't been seen in the same part of the sky since.\r\n\r\nmy friend initially confirmed what we had seen the night of the sighting, but within a few days vehemently denied seeing the same thing as me, and continues to to this day. i know exactly what i saw in the sky, and while i admit that i was scared of being abducted as i went to bed that night, i wish i could see it again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then
