minutes to get there. we were driving up a slight grade with farmers fields all around us, so you can see for a long ways away all around us. we start going down the grade and there is a slight bend and you by a big long farmers field. as we were driving i was looking at the stars and all around because the night was super super clear, not a single cloud, fog, smoke or anything. we came around the corner and in front of us just a little bit over the tree lines and power poles a huge light appeared, it was a really big object, super bright blue and whitish light. it was going super fast and went a ways away for about 4 seconds or so than just disappeared in thin air, if something that big was in the air before i would have noticed it because the whole area was clear with fields, and i would have saw it going up the little grade. the object disappeared before it went out of the horizon. there was a super bright blue and white flames coming from the back of it with sparks coming off it too. it was shocking as it was so big, and was so close to the land going so fast and just appeared and disappeared. this is a very rural area so traffic around 9:50pmish to 10pm is very very rare and we did not see a car that night. after i pulled over looking out my windows to see for something else i could not see anything, but there was a white trail left from where the object was, it was not a smokey trail. it was just a somewhat bright white trail left from where it went. after a couple minutes to calm down because we were both left nervous and uneasy. we left and right after we left a few seconds down the road we drove through a super super thick fog, it took about 10 - 15 seconds to drive through, that was really weird too because that night was so clear without a cloud or anything. after we drive through the fog it just went back to super clear. a few days later on facebook people tagged me in a link, i clicked it and it was sightings of a fire ball from a satellite in halifax. halifax is in the opposite direction about a 1 hour and 40 minutes away if not more. the fireball sightings were also around 6ish pm and there was a video of it posted and it looked nothing like what me and my girlfriend saw plus we were in the opposite direction, looked nothing like it, and was hours after the fire all sightings. the object i saw was so big and so low too. i could see almost all the details to it because it was so low. everyone thought i was crazy, but i know what i saw. this has been bothering me ever since. i saw in pei a video of a ufo a guy had on facebook and said he contacted you guys so i thought i would too. if you need anymore information please let me know as i want to figure out if i saw a ufo or not. if you need more detail make sure to get back to me as well. thank you.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

on my deck by the lakeside (lake huron), and suddenly a bright orange burst of light broke through the low hanging canopy of clouds. it shone scintillating pulses of yellowish golden light against the clouds. even though it was around ten p.M. there was plenty of light on the lake, so i could see very clearly what transpired over the next eight to ten minutes.The light emanated from its top and was bright orange. my first reaction was total disbelief at what i was seeing, for i knew immediately this was no conventional aircraft. the craft hung over my head about thirty feet out from where i sat, and about one hundred feet above over the lake. it was a dull, very dull black diamond shaped craft, and no noise was emitted. i suddenly felt very nervous as it slowly changed direction and floated slowly toward me all the while descending. it was the dullest non reflective black i had ever seen and its diamond shape appeared to morph ever so slightly as it approached me. its orange ball shaped light intensified as it came nearer. at this point i remember being frightened and yet somehow strangely intrigued. it was a large craft about the size of a city bus. i stood up from my chair and focused my attention on it, and felt overwhelmed by its strange appearance. i've seen many planes, helicopters, ultralight planes, over the lake, and this craft defied any correspondence with anything i had ever seen. as i walked toward it on my deck it suddenly stopped directly above me, and my body began to shiver uncontrollably, and suddenly, it accelerated across the lake toward the western horizon disappearing within seconds. it was a mind boggling experience to say the least, and what it was looked both beautiful and mesmerizing. to this day i can still visualize the craft as if it just happened.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

so then i have followed the object making weird turns trying to get out of the city lights. once i have, i start to video the object(s), take pictures and film in slow-motion. the object(s) are hovering in the sky, not moving. at other times (not tonight) i have footage of the lights in the objects seeming to communicate. tonight's footage however i chased the object for about 30\r\nminutes trying to get a clear view once i spotted it. i then gave up and was driving to my house because my friend had watched the bachelor without me because i was taking so long. i figured i would try and see the object from the top of my garage. when i got to the top level, it was there or moving towards a certain spot were it hovered for what felt like 10 minutes. it didn't move. just shined. the craziest thing is that after a few minutes, the object started moving towards me. i was kind of freaked out and excited at the same time. this is when t was bizarre. as it move towards me, it was like the captain hooks ship on peter pan. it got closer, and as it did, the objects lights changed. to me, it was if the tipped over and became flat like a pancake. the perpendicular lights were now horizontal and the red, yellow and white was emitted from a now circular shaped object. i could not believe it was happening but i did not feel scared. i felt excited. i tried to look up to see what the middle was like. when i did, i couldn't see anything. after emitting glowing lights around the circumference of a circular object, the object gained speed and it looked as if it somehow had wings - one on each side emitting 2 perpendicular flashing yellow lights (now not as bright but similar to a plane) on each side. as i am reflecting on it now, it is as if there was more than one level in the object.\r\n5. after a previous sighting i had documented a little less than a month ago, i felt terrified and asked the universe to please stop. this was because i caught a couple of things while filming in slow mo that was super scary and i was confused about. this time i felt great, excited, comfortable but at the same time leaves with what does this mean and why does this keep happening and am i going to get obsessed again with finding the truth in what i have seen.\r\n6. i lost sight of the object because i could no longer see over the top of my parking garage because i was at an angle. \r\n\r\n***have more footage of this account and another. please, if you find this unusual, contact me. i just want answers and to not feel crazy.

father's \"near death experience\" many years ago could be connected to unusual and possibly paranormal activity around my parent's home.\r\n\r\nmany years ago, he had a \"near death\" reported \"out-of-body\" experience in the hospital.\r\n\r\nthe \"entities\" who \"saved him\" seemed to have put him on some kind of \"mission\".\r\n\r\nthese entities seemed to have continued to contact him through his dreams which he claimed to be in \"multidimensional space\".\r\n\r\nduring the last 12 months this apparent invasive contact by these entities with my father seemed to have become more frequent / demanding.\r\n\r\nseveral years ago, long after my father's \"near death experience\" i had multiple dreams that seem to pivot on a red gate.  i had never seen this area before; but for some reason i knew that the place was another part of the same city that i had been residing.  i remember waking up from these dreams with a \"bad feeling\" and being relieved that \"it was only a dream\".  but since having these dreams i began to be weary that something 'bad' was about to happen in the future that kept me feeling somewhat preoccupied about the need to be weary and 'cautious'.\r\n\r\nback to the much more recent past, a couple of years ago, my father began to daydream more as if his conscious mind was floating in some other dimension.  he would seemed to be \"spaced out\".  when he would come out of these \"day dream states\" he would either constantly talk about childhood memories in the past or his apparently more frequent contacts with beings in \"multidimensional space\" that gave him somehow a source of 'solace'.\r\n\r\nhe then became obsessed with writing about the notion that humans should become members of a \"bio-electric union\".\r\n\r\ni told him that it did not sound as if this entities sought to support humanity's \"best interests\" and that \"such a construct that he wrote about seemed to have no regard to empathy that is vital to our human bio-spiritual interconnectedness.\"\r\n\r\nduring this time, he began to switch into a \"dual personality\" involving violent / psychotic states. one minute he would be his normal quiet self, even sleeping, and then from time to time he would wake up with a wild eyed look like he was truly possessed.  \r\n\r\nin this state of mind, he would make gratuitous verbal \"out of the blue attacks\" at mostly me in the beginning.. but would soon eventually be aimed at my mom who remarked that she was \"too much out of tears to be able to cry anymore.\"\r\n\r\nmy mom shown symptoms of what doctors described as an unusual ataxia / aphasia condition literally overnight in which she began having difficulty to speak.\r\n\r\nwhen i once commented to my father on his new apparent split-personality persona that began to neglect / abuse my mom, he got this wild stare look again as if he was \"possessed\". he then charged me as i stood beside the refrigerator from the kitchen table. he then took out a kitchen knife pointing it toward my stomach as if he was about to stab me there.\r\n\r\nhe ended up almost cutting-off my little finger when i grabbed the knife to stop him that required me going into emergency reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation for six months.  he has denied any recollection of the incident to-date.\r\n\r\ni later began to look for another place to live that i eventually found, but elected to stay at my parent's home in spite of the anger and violence that was directed at me.\r\n\r\ni then began having difficulty sleeping in much of my parent's home due to unusual apparent electromagnetic \"humming\" noises like some kind of wasps in your ears that was accompanied by an an attempted paralysis that i would constantly need to shake-off while trying to sleep.\r\n\r\nmy father then began to become angry at my care-giving for my mom who had been an rn and very empathetic. \r\n\r\nmy calling the ambulance last summer when my mom was not breathing also made him angry.  he accused me of being an \"alarmist\". \r\n\r\nhe soon began to apparently find it easy to lie when he had abhorred lying and had once spoken of the importance of 'integrity' to him.  his personality started to switch like 'dr. jekyll and mr hyde'.\r\n\r\nhe then got the police to evict me from care giving for my mom the end of april 2015 with the support of my sister just after 2 am.\r\n\r\nluckily, i had already found a place but had not finished moving into it.  but, when i woke up tin the morning and began to drive out, i was shocked to see the very red gate that i had seen in my dream years ago.\r\n\r\ni last saw my mom at a \"neutral location\" outside my parent's home on 12 june 2015 when she had lost the ability to talk, speak and write.\r\n\r\nmy father under the apparent increasing control of some kind of non-empathetic regressive entities for weeks refused to not only allow me to continue to take care of my own mother under the police threat of trespassing nut to my further shock block all efforts by the police appointed social service agency to help my mom.\r\n\r\nthen some unusual cop who i nicknamed \"agent 666\" became determined to prevent me from seeing my mom who i have sought to resume my care giving.  \r\n\r\nhe came to my residence out of uniform to threaten me to stop contacting relatives about activities associated with my father's and sister's blocking of me seeing my mom and began to threaten the agency that had sought to facilitate contact with my mom.\r\n\r\nmy sister who had aspirations of power, ignored any abuse that i had reported about my father against my mom, and had began this whole charade in early january 2015 that i had allegedly started a \"domestic dispute\" while i had been cooking for my mom at the time.  she seemed to have \"hired\" this cop who has sought to block my mom and i seeing each other.\r\n\r\ni had been cooking for my mom, father and my sister who had been visiting from europe, and who had taken my parents out.  \r\n\r\nwhen she arrived back with my parents rather than being relieved that she did not have to cook; she went into a bizarre state of anger which began to threaten me -- which resembled the bizarre state of anger that my father would spontaneously launch into from time to time against my mom and i.  that's when \"my sister\" decided to call the police to make-up the story that i started a \"domestic dispute\".\r\n\r\ni also note that my mom's brother ignored the reports.  he has reportedly been a member of a \"lodge\" which may or may not be related.\r\n\r\nit appears that my father's mind has been substantively assimilated by some kind of psychotic alien intelligence that is actively working with other alien operatives on earth.  this alien activity appears to include my sister and the \"police detective\" that she hired and a senior-ranking judicial administrator who appears to have reversed the desire of a judge that was about to approve an emergency motion for me to see my mom. \r\n\r\nit appears that regressive alien operatives have sought to participate in some kind of plan to keep my now sick and disabled elderly mom (who can't speak, write or walk thanks to apparent alien operatives) and i from seeing each other for an \"unknown agenda\". in general, these activities suggest that regressive aliens in targeted areas of civil society may be seeking to \"pilot\" human hosts through their minds to then experiment on humans toward some broader take-over / control agenda.\r\n\r\n\"organized efforts\" to prevent my mom and i from seeing each other which appear to be affiliated to \"my father's\" 'near death experience' and subsequent contact by \"entities\" suggest a hierarchically-controlled command system that is substantively controlled by non-empathetic beings that conceal themselves in an apparent human form consistent with john carpenter's film \"they live\".","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":73809,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.324260407743736,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01122016-0003","longitude":-75.9132715732024,"occurred":1452567540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

outside so i used to smoke in my bathroom with the window open. i lived in the middle of a small suburban development but i had a clear view of the sky. after living here for almost 2 years it was not uncommon for me to see bright stars that seem to look like ufos or even actual ufos. so every time i would smoke out the window i would always keep my eyes toward the sky. this particular night i saw a bright ball in the distance. it looked like it was over a mile away. at first i thought it was a very bright star or even a planet but as i watched i could tell that it was moving slowly back and forth up and down. after about 10 minutes it began to change color and pulse. ranging from blue yellow and red is slowly got bigger.It wasn't actually getting bigger but moving closer. as it came closer i started to see a structure. it literally flew over my house and i was leaning out of the window to keep an eye on it. as it flew over i could see what look like a very strange and long stealth bomber type aircraft. the moon was very bright that night so i could tell how dark it was.There were lights at the front of the structure that were white. as it flew over i could see what look like a small room underneath the structure like the cockpit of a blimp. i could see what looked like windows but i could not see inside. i could not detect any type of landing gear but as it flew away i could see 8 red lights on the back of the structure. it looks like what you could imagine as stereotypical rocket boosters. as it flew byit sounded like a deep hum combined with a very low rumble but still very quiet. it did not cast a shadow. i tried my hardest to keep my eyes on it as it flew but i eventually lost it. i was completely in shock and didn't believe myself at first. the next day i recounted what i saw to my girlfriend at the time and the look on her face looks like she didn't believe me. she asked why i didn't try to take pictures. it didn't even occur to me to try because i was so amazed at what i saw. even if i had tried to take pictures on my phone i doubt they would have came out because i had a horrible phone at the time with a horrible camera.I have seen many strange things in the sky from that window but never anything like that before.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

plane. i could see it! it seem to adjust for gliding but had no known propulsion. stayed even keel, same elevation, same speed, same direction. first i said taradoctyle? but no visible head, letting my head accept what i seen. it seemed to be some sort of entity. and my searching the internet i came across mothman. with what i thought were light colored bags hanging down. now i'm thinking legs hanging down. with dark brown wings. but enough about what i think, there you go. that's my story and i'm sticking to it. lol!","distance":"101-500

at dusk time was around 5:30pm & looking over towards the canadian border i saw theses sphere/star shaped objects, one went flying east at a very fast rate, then another one caught my eye straight out in front of my view it looked like it was coming straight down to earth then stopped. i had dinner cooking on the stove so i had to run in & take care of that. i hurried as fast as possible then went back outside the 2 that i saw were gone. so then i searched around in the same areas & i saw another one flying east, this one was easier to see as it was getting darker outside. as a little time went on, i noticed that there were more star like things in the sky moving slow/hovering with small zigzag movement. there were a lot of them. soon after i was watching all this go on time was roughly 7pm & from the sounds of the thuds i counted 3 military helicopters, one helicopter flew low right over my house & it was so low flying just above my trees. this really freaked me out & i ran inside the house. i called my son & his girlfriend asking them if they would come right over asap. my son pointed out what also looked like a helicopter but it was silent. then after a little while we noticed two of these star like things blink lights at each other the one on the left was a little higher in altitude & the one to the right changed its color of flashing lights to a blue/white color moving towards the one on the left, it looked like it was warning the other one. as this was going on we saw one of the helicopters flying over head & went towards these things really fast. the ufo on the left took off so fast in a upwards n.W.Direction. the one on the right started flashing its blue/white lights brighter & faster, it also looked like some of the light shot out a little like lightning.Then it swooped downward a little then upward following the other ufo. in the n.W. direction. some of the other star like things would move a little bit but enough to notice that they were definitely there as the helicopters flew around circling in huge circles covering a large area of n. whatcom co. the helicopters hung around for a little while after they chased off the 2 ufos & then there wasn't much activity in the sky after the helicopters left & what i could see with my eyes was so high up in attitude it was difficult to see what was what. i did call 911 to report this & while i was on the phone i looked west towards lummi reservation/birchbay area & i saw one more of these things lower in altitude, it changed its light to blue/white color with the lightening thing & so quickly disappeared this was by far the most exciting sight i have ever seen in the skies. the next day i ran a post on a local site asking if anyone saw this & yes there were. one lady got pictures, i was so happy because i could figure out how to work my new phone. on sunday my son and i noticed a lot of chemtrails in the sky, i'm very curious if this has anything to do with this sighting on friday ?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then
