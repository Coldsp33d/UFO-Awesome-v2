(*) the magnet field and the shield covering the ufo. i believe the engine is something like zero point energy using and powering magnets, rotating them against eachother under a tremendous preassure .... . if some pros would check these pics, they would sure find a system behind these pics. thanks anyways reading this email, you may use these pics free.\r\n \r\n\r\nthe following(6)pics are reps. as follows:\r\n\r\npic 1: normal iphone pic. you`ll see some 4-5 ufos.\r\npic 2: same pic but coloured with sepia filter picasa3, here you`ll see 20 ufos.\r\npic 3: same picture but one object 600% increased.\r\n\r\nthe same procedure with pics 4,5 and 6.This ufo appears to be some/ appr. 11km (11000meter > 36000ft + some 65% angle) away my house.\r\n\r\nthe difference between pics 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 is that i tried to make a pic comparing the ufo size and a chemtrail airplane size. in this pic you`ll see clearly ufo, but you do not see the airplain !?, meaning that this ufo is at least 3-4 times bigger than the airplane.\r\n\r\nthanks for reading this brief summary,\r\n\r\ngermany","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:28:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":73791,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":54.330482700000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"DE-01112016-0006","longitude":10.130905199999999,"occurred":1394640120000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Schleswig-Holstein","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1452506081000,"summary":"2 groups ufos over northern germany.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"24103","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":669,"locationName":"Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:93502"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was going through videos and found this. we had a small kodak camera that was water proof and was like a phone we carried everywhere. our 4 year old loved to play with it. he unskillfully at times videoing videoing outside at a b-day party. there were tornado warnings and so we were standing looking at the clouds. he said to me, \"dad i see lights in the sky and pointed\" the way he said it was odd. instinctively i didn't doubt asking for the camera and started filming where he pointed. i didn't see anything as i looked and turned on the camera. i videoed a couple shots placating to him at this point and asking him to tell us what he saw. he can be heard in the video. \r\n\r\ntonight while moving our family videos over to the new computer i ran across three videos. but only recalled two i shot. the first in the series blew me away. there they were. he had caught them and was trying to tell me and i didn't ever check if he had actually filmed something assuming it not remotely possible. \r\n\r\nso all this time i thought he was pulling our leg. we have so many videos that i haven't began to watch 20% of them. i just film and download then say i will one day get around to doing something with them.\r\n\r\nin a way, i am kind of glad i didn't see it till now because he wouldn't been able to understand what was going on, besides how would i explain  it to him. i just found them and im going to talk to his mom on what tyo say. \r\n\r\nim really blown away. i couldn't sleep so i just had to share it. i just really cant believe he caught them on video. i would take a lie detector to this story and videos. so you tell me what he saw!!!

noticed two more large wide glowing (almost like yellow flames) in the nnw hovering and then dropping down slowly to just above the tree line, seemed about a mile away. getting closer they appeared saucer shaped (wider than tall but with no discernible dome) and were strobing red & white horizontally. they stayed fairly low and started slowly moving southwest (crossing the street we were driving on [this is when we got the best view]) but we couldn't catch up to them. they were getting smaller and farther away towards the sw. two more orbs appeared in the original nnw direction but were faint and star like. decided to turn back because we were tired and we saw a flashing orb (it almost looked like it was rotating) approaching from the south sitting at a traffic light. this is when i told my passenger to please take my phone and get a picture, but she didn't know how to zoom in. i poked my head over to watch it. it was an icy blue metallic color and round and it passed almost directly overhead. it flashed a few times and was very eerie looking and then my passenger saw it momentarily zip extremely fast across to another point in the sky.  we couldn't track it anymore as it had disappeared out of our view from the car once we started moving. we saw two more approaching white orbs on the way back in the east over the lake. i only have the one picture of the blue things

the factory.I noticed a bright sphere shaped object flying low altitude from the southwest.It flew in a circular path like a spiral at a good rate of speed exhibiting a nonballistic flight characteristic.Instantly excited i ran out front door to try to see object as it passed by.Looked northeast but didnt see object pass by.Looked around and saw object hovering over back yard.Rural location no street lights and completely  overcast.Watched object for about 5 minutes then ran in house to retrieve rifle with scope to view object.Looked through scope at object for several minutes.Sphere shaped object extremely bright light.Went to back yard to see better.Object didnt move at this point.Walked north to south under object to try and estimate how high it was from ground.Got on the other side of it quickly estimate object was hovering under 200 feet.Stood in yard staring at object with naked eye thinking i would like to see object more closely.Object then moved downward and toward me stopping and hovering around 20 feet from ground and about 50 feet from me.I had feelings of extreme excitement.Feeling i wanted to try and communicate with object i went to a windchime hanging on the edge of my duplex about 30 feet from object.I tried to mimick tones from close encounter movie on my wind chimes.After a few times was able to mimick the tone pattern and repeated it multiple times.Then i walked back toward object where i had been standing before.Object descended to about 10 feet and came closer to me about 20 feet away.Immediatly felt emotions of joy and elation.Object returned to previous position.No sound,no illumination of object on ground or surroundings yet bright enough to produce glare on my glasses lenses.Thought in my mind come closer i want to see you better.Again object immediatly came closer. slow descent same  path as before but got closer.Once again i was filled with feelings of elation.Object returned to previous position.I did a little dance and thoght come closer i want to see you up close.Object came within ten feet and more quickly this time.This time i felt overwhelmed and felt like i used to before i played a sporting event or went to the principals office,like butterfly stomach.Object returned about 20 feet off ground about 50 feet away.This repeated several times.Every time object came closer when about ten feet away from me i got overwhelmed with nervous anxiety.When i did object woul return to farther away position .Same flight path same position.Mosquitos were really bad and was without shoes or socks.Was getting bit badly and retreated to duplex for shoes and socks.Returned to back yard and i spotted object moving slowly away.Was over road about an eighth of a mile away.Thought in my mind for object to come back and immediatly it came back to same position above back yard.Thought in my mind come really close i want to know what you are.Object came closer than before iam 6 feet and it was even with my head and 5 or six feet distance from me.Extreme anxiety in my stomach to the point i could not take it.Object reacted immediatly and returned to distant position.Went through this a couple more times.Feeling wore out and overwhelmed i said goodbye did the chime tones again and went inside.Watched object slowly take a path over near road and moved away to the south.Looked at clock to check time about 2:30 am.Duration about 30 minutes.Went to bed exhausted.Woke up next day covered in mosquitoe bites but exhilerated from previous nights experience.Told my nieghbor about it laughed and seemed skeptical.The night after first incident went to bed around 10pm.Trying to sleep i kept hearing my windchimes dinging softly.Had bedroom window open hot humid and no air conditioner.Looked out at chimes no wind at all.Went back to bed a short time later heard chimes ding again this time louder and with the same pattern i had used the night before.Really scared me.Looked out saw nobody there and no wind thought neighbor might be pranking me.Laid back down and it happened again same pattern and loud.Felt scared and panicky.Put pants on and grabbed my pistol then ran around to back yard.Looked around and saw a figure standing near a friends dwelling illuminated in his back porch light.Clothing seemed odd with a very high collar.To much clothes for the heat and humidity of july.Could not see face or details of garments was to dark and shadowy.Felt agitated and said who are you what do you want.Figure just stayed there like it was staring at me.Thought my nieghbor might have put my frind up to spooking me as a joke so i approached the figure quickly.Figure turned and moved away from me to the east as i approached from the west.As it moved away in a line heading east about10 or 15 feet from the back of the back of the duplexes i quickened my pace to a trot.As i was catching up to figure it went past a window with its kitchen light on.Figure was similar highth as me around 6 feet tall and looked like it was wearing a high collar coat or robe.Figur moved out of window light and towards a large tree.I was agitated and said get out of here as i went past the lit window with my pistol extended in a firing position.I heard a gasp and turned to see my state trooper nieghbor drop her dishrag and plate into a sink full of water,iwas about 6feet away from her and could see by her facial expression and vocalization she was startled.I turned to see figure go behind a large tree and said i have got you now.When i went around tree trunk there was nothing there.I looked over to neighbor female state trooper and she was not in front of the sink and not in sight in the kitchen.Bewildered i went to my friends house where the back porch light was on went around front and  noticed through his window he and another of my friends visiting were asleep on sofa and a chair.Another nieghbor was working on his car in duplex next door and i asked if he had seen anyone walking around he said no.I walked on home expecting my state trooper nieghbor to call the sherriff or come see why i went past her kitchen window that late at night with a pistol saying get out of here.No one ever came over.I  didnt have a handgun permit and was worried i was in trouble.Didnt have a home phone to call anyone.Was really shook up by incident couldnt stop sweating almost shaking fear.Was trying to come to grips with what happened night before then this.Was really fearful went to bed later in fear.Two days later landlord knocked on my door and asked if i had seen state trooper she didnt go to work the previous day and no one could find her.Really sent a chill through me.I told my landlord what had occured on condition he didnt tell police.He was a coworker and honored my request.I did not want to be questioned about it for several reasons.The sherfiffs office knocked on the door and asked if i had seen her.State troopers ,local police and county deputies combed the surrounding countryside.The local paper ran a story on her disapearance.The larger news sources at the state capitol both tv and newspaper did stories about trying to find her.This was a state trooper and people were very concerned.My landlord knocked on my door on i think day 4 or 5 after her disapearance and said she was home.I asked what happened and  landlord said trooper woke up on the floor of her duplex with no recollection of what happened.I asked landlord to explain my experience of what i went through both nights prior to her disapearance to try to jog her memory.He came back and said she didnt want to talk about it to me and not to ask her about it or try to see her.I waited a week and when i saw her out in her yard i stopped and tried to talk to her.She did not want to talk about it and asked me to leave.The first night of my experience was wonderful a life altering experience in a good way.The second night was very scary.Wish i could of controlled my fears .Always have wondered what i could have been privileged to experience.Did my nieghbor get the ride of a lifetime.Wish it could have been me.After my experience i developed severe headaches and a itchy rash behind my ear lobe on right side.Some small bumps developed behind right earlobe over time but never got bigger,still there today.This happened over28 years ago in july 1987 not long after 4th of july.But remember it like yesterday.Never told about this event except to some family and friends still not sure i should be speaking of it.Still have fears of who was involved and what it might invoke.","distance":"20 Feet or

about, i was sitting in the back garden with my partner having a glass of coke. i was looking up at the sky as normal, watching the high flying airliners, which were coming from the east, i then clocked this plane coming out of the murky blue sky from the north, it looked very large as it slowly came towards us. i then noticed that it did not have any engines under the wings, the near it got to us i could see that this plane was not a plane at all, it was a symmetrical cross, i then heard the sound of engines ,but the noise was coming from a plane, coming from the east, and to my amazement the plane went under the cross, this is when i realize how high this thing was. the cross was about four times the size of the airliner and it was much higher, by this time it was right above us, it was white to grey in colour, had no marking or engines, the end of the wings were curved and where the four wings joined in the middle, this to was curved, it was dead smooth all over, and it made no noise, by this time a cloud had come along obscuring the view of the cross we waited for it to come out of the cloud but we never saw it again. now i have also made a discovery that has been hidden for over 42 years by nasa and carl sagan which i can prove and no english news paper will print please look at the nasa photo i have sent, i know about all the small detail about this
