did not reflect any light to the north of my location.  it appeared to almost absorb light,because there was 0 reflection.  it appeared triangular in shape with 3 white lights on each corner.  there was 1 red blinking light that flashed with a constant frequency that appeared to be in the middle of the bottom of the craft.  it was not flat, which could make the object appear different to viewers at different angles.  after passing in front is looked triangular.  when passing in front it looked rectangular.  it was way larger than any other craft i have ever seen and totally silent.  it left no trail.  i can't even begin to describe how large this craft really was, just enormous.  i called to my wife to make sure she saw it too.  she too looked at it and said it is huge and what is that?  \r\n\r\nit traveled in a straight line without veering.  headed almost true west from my location in a straight line.  as it headed out of sight you could see the red blinking light underneath, and two of the white lights on the back of the aircraft. we lost sight after it continued in the straight line of path behind a large group of trees. \r\n\r\nwhen i saw the object and afterward, i still have no clue what it is.  it moved slower than any aircraft, but much faster than any blimp.  i tried to capture a picture on my phone, but it did not capture anything present.  even the white lights

want to be contacted nor can i give anymore details about myself or what i witnessed due to security reasons. thank you for understanding.\r\n\r\nlast night, 07jan16, between the time of 19:40-20:00, i witnessed something that i can not explain. during my usual shift, i have a lot of down time between flight schedule where i like to relax and look for shooting stars. we have a really good view of the stars because of the lack of light pollution in this particular area. it was on this precise occasion when i had my sighting. as i was watching the skies which i do periodically every single night during my shift, i observed a giant black silent object of some sort that seemed to be gliding. the object was heading north to south at a steady speed. it took approximately 10 seconds from the time i noticed it directly above me until the time it disappeared over some buildings i was standing close to. the runway was not being used at this moment so there was no noise coming from any equipment, airplanes, and absolutely no noise from the object. the usual (and only) type of aircraft we have at this location are extremely loud, even at cruising speed. another bizarre thing to note was this object had no identifying lights. that would be a disastrous idea to fly in this particular airspace with no lights and would mean instant response measures and highly against the law.\r\n\r\nafter my sighting, i was dumbfounded. i told another coworker about what i saw with excitement and since we still had lots of time to spare before we had to get back to work, we watched the skies together for this mysterious object. sure enough, about 15 minutes later it reappeared in almost the exact same flight path as before, but this time it was moving slower and at an arc going north to southwest. i sighted it first and pointed my coworking in the direction and this person saw it as well. this sighting took approxomimately 30 seconds. it was not witnessed again. we have no idea what it was because it appeared to not have any engines due to its silence nor any positioning lights. i would estimate that it was between 150-200 feet wide, gliding at an altitude between 500-1000 feet. the night was clear at this particular time with a full view of the stars. the reason i noticed it at all was because it faintly reflected light from our location off of its belly, it was a slightly different shade of black than the sky behind it and it blocked out the stars as it glided. i wish i could give more reasons as to how i know it wasn't from where i work but i can't. all i can say is it's not from this location nor was there any indications that anyone else knew it was flying over. we did not report our sighting to anyone in charge for fear of ridicule.","distance":"101-500

no hum, no buzz, nothing of a mechanical or electrical nature. there was also no wind or downdraft as you would expect from a helicopter or any other manmade craft hovering in the air overhead. being camped on the desert floor, any disturbance of the surrounding dust and sand would have immediately filled the air, our eyes and begun choking us, which did not happen. at some point i recall looking to my mother and feeling fear turn to terror as i watched her looking upward in stunned silence, her eyes wide open and mouth agape but now bathed in a skin-bleaching bright blue-white light. i tried to get her attention. \"mom!\" but, reminiscent of some quasi-dreamlike state, i couldn't hear my own voice, and i don't believe she could hear me either. it may be, on recollection, that the apparent silence may have not been an absence of sound but a state induced by the craft itself. that unheard utterance is the last memory i have before waking the next morning in my cot to find we had inadvertently camped only a few hundred feet away from cemetery. there was an early-morning funeral taking place and it naturally felt awkward and intrusive for us to be camped so close by, thus we hurriedly ate a makeshift breakfast and left as quietly as we could. to be clear, the craft from the previous night had not been seen to leave, the memory of the encounter just seems to have ended with it there, hanging silently overhead, bristling with lights and blocking out the stars. there was no subsequent discussion of the events, nobody spoke of it on the drive home nor thereafter to my recollection and, for the better part of two decades, it was all but forgotten. \r\n\r\nthe incident had nagged at me for years.  i had rationalized the craft as being the suggested border patrol helicopter but always, at the edges of my memory, i wondered at the lack of sound or wind, especially as i grew older and more thoroughly understood how helicopters and other airborne craft operate. in 1997 my parents and younger siblings returned from an extended period living overseas and had moved to a nearby state. on a visit i thought to bring up the incident after a dinner. not intending to voice any suspicions, but rather to affirm my lifelong supposition, i asked my parents about camping that night and eventually worked the conversation over to the presence of a helicopter. my mother remembered the trip in good detail but had no recollection of seeing a helicopter or any other craft. my stepfather, however, started to become excited as the conversation developed, and when i finally asked about the presence of the helicopter he could no longer restrain himself.\"that was no helicopter, that was a ufo!\". suddenly all of the little lies i'd been telling myself to support a rational interpretation of the event came crashing down. \r\n\r\ni had considered making a mufon report years ago, but lacked any real evidence other than anecdote and, coupled with the fact that i wasn't even sure exactly when the event had occurred, i decided to leave it alone believing that the my anecdotes surrounding the incident could in no way contribute to our understanding of the ufo phenomenon. two years ago i received a digitized copy of our family photo albums from my mother. i'd just had a child and i guess she felt it was time to pass down the legacy of our recent lineage. in the mix of hundreds of other photos were a handful from the day of that fateful trip, each photo printed with the month and year it was taken. sadly, while it appears a camera was in my mother's possession, i don't think it occurred to her at the time to take a photo of the craft. given that there is at least some data to now cross-reference with other cases, i submit this to you in the hope that, as the age of bulk-data analysis matures it may somehow, at some future time, contribute to our understanding of what was and is taking place in our skies.

couldn't hear any sound from the object.   hill on the right obstructed my view as i drove north. there were quite a few other vehicles on the road both going north and south at the time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stayed overnight in the back of the pickup, jan 4. i woke up at midnight, got out to relieve myself and let the dog out of the cab. it was a clear night and i gazed at the stars for a few minutes, then put the dog in and went back to bed. i woke up again at 0400 and got out to check on the dog and start a generator for a little heat. generator did not start. during this time i noticed a roundish object far in the distance towards the south/southeast (est 150-160 deg azimuth). the object was about the size of the moon, nearly round but with blurred edges, and a yellowish/orangeish color. it was low in the sky, roughly 5 degrees. there was a thin and scattered cloud cover as you could still see some stars. at the time, i felt it was odd – the colors and the direction of this object. i was cold and wanted to get back to my warm sleeping bag. i decided it was a waning moon rising, even though the direction was off. i got up a little before dawn at 0715. as i walked to the restroom and back i saw another round object in the sky, similar to the one at 0400 in size and direction, except that this one was white, more round with a slightly more distinct edge and much higher in the sky (est 30-40 deg).  the cloud cover had increased since 0400 and it was definitely getting light as i could see where the sun was going to rise. i said yeah it’s the moon and mostly forgot about it till a few days later. i got to thinking about what phase the moon was in and realized the full moon was 11 days past. \r\ni know my directions at this location even in the dark. i have been coming here off/on for about 20 years, both when i lived to the north in great falls and later in the south at roundup. most of the time it’s been for ice fishing. as usual, we were parked on the northwest side of the reservoir, which lies north/nw of and between two mountain ranges. i was looking across the reservoir and between the two ranges. that means i was looking south/se. i saw where the sun was going to rise – just north of the big snowies and this was 30-40 degrees east of the 0400 object. pre-sunrise azimuth was 107deg at 0730. i checked on the moon phase and position for 1/5/16. the moon was waning (bright on left) with 20-21% relative brightness. at 0400 the moon was at 3 deg altitude and 126 deg azimuth. at 0715 the moon was at 25 deg altitude and 167 deg azimuth. \r\nthe altitude of the objects are similar to the moons altitude at 0400 and 0715 and so is the azimuth for the 0715 object. however, the azimuth for the 0400 object is greater than 30 degs south of the moon. there are only a couple very small towns in that direction. it was not the glow of city lights, although a spot light could possibly have made that image. i don’t recall ever seeing a spotlight shining in the sky anywhere in predawn hours.  \r\nthe other thing that struck me is the fact that the moon on 1/5 was only a thin waning (bright on left side) crescent with 20-21% relative brightness. the objects i saw were more like a 80-90% waxing (bright on right side) moon, much brighter and more distinctively round. i never saw a waning crescent moon the morning of 1/5. at 0400 the moons azimuth would have placed it behind the big snowy mtns, so i would not have seen it. at 0715, i feel the cloud cover and predawn light in the sky would have overcome a thin crescent moon. one last thing that seems to eliminate my mistaking the moon for another object- the direction the object traveled between the two times i saw it. i looked in the same direction each time i saw it- towards the south/se. if it were the moon it would have passed directly overhead on its path (heading to the northwest), but we all know the moon moves from east to west, or southeast to southwest.  according to the moon calculator, the moon on 1/5 would have reached its peak altitude of only 28 deg at 0830- only 3 deg higher and only 1 hour and 15 minutes after i last saw it at 0715.  even a full moon this time of year only reaches a maximum altitude of 61 degrees, but this object, had it continued on its path would have reached nearly 90 degrees. even if the objects i saw where not the same object, the fact that they were more full circle than crescent makes me believe they were not the moon. \r\ni did not focus long enough on either object to see it move. i just assumed it was the moon, although “things” did not make complete sense. i sure wish i would have looked at these objects much longer to determine what they were. i also could have taken some photos if i had brought my camera.\r\none last point to consider. this area of montana has nuclear missile silos, a lot of them. from west of great falls, to north and east of lewistown and south to harlowton, there are 200 silos and 20 launch control facilities. we drive by many of these sites on the way to ackley reservoir. according to wikipedia, most or all nuclear missiles have been retired from these silos, but i am still researching the status of these facilities. one of the witness testimonials on the sirius disclosure site is retired air force officer robert salas. he was a commander at the oscar flight launch control facility (malmstrom afb) in 1967 where he describes an event with a ufo that caused 8 missiles to become inactive, simultaneously. this scenario also occurred at an adjacent facility (echo flight) at the same time.     m.N. 1/8/16\r\n","distance":"Over One

loading them into a van. i glanced up and saw a very bright round white light moving approximately northwest. i had initially been facing north loading the dogs in side of van and had turned to right (east) and noticed the object up above and to my right going over the fort gibson lake eastern area about where wildwood or hulbert landing is.\r\n\r\ni hurriedly loaded the dogs in the van. i immediately knew this was the same type of unknown object i had seen on october 9, 2013, a few weeks before and at a location nearby and across the lake to the west. it was also moving at approximately the same speed and the same altitude as the previously observed object.\r\n\r\nthis time, there was a small private airplane, which i could hear and see, including the blinking lights, to my north within a mile or so.  i estimated this airplane at 500 feet altitude. the very bright round white light continued northwest and to the south of the airplane and passed between the airplane and me. the object was approximately 75% the size of the airplane, which was approximately the size of a single engine cessna. the airplane was proceeding approximately eastbound and undoubtedly the pilot saw this object just to the south within hundreds of feet.\r\n\r\ni reached into my van to retrieve my binoculars in my backpack i had used for birding that day. when i looked back up from van the object had vanished, perhaps blinked out or accelerated and disappeared. there had not been enough time for the object, at the current rate of speed, to have disappeared over the horizon or a tree line. this gave me an eery feeling, especially since i had seen this exact same type of object so recently at a nearby location.\r\n\r\nhowever, i was able to confirm the approximate size and altitude

night using google sky map app with a google nexus 7 tablet observing and identifying stars, planets, galaxies, etc. i was also using the flight aware app to see which, if any, aircraft were in the vicinity. facing north, i noticed a very bright light to my left (west) on the horizon above tree line coming towards me. i dismissed at first and thought, \"i'll go to porch (nearby) to retrieve 50 power binoculars in a minute after i look at something else, then look at that plane\".\r\n\r\ni hurriedly looked at some other things with google sky map, saw the very bright object to the left was steadily proceeding eastbound, and grabbed binoculars from porch. i was thinking i would begin to hear a sound, such as a gas or jet engine from object, but it was quiet except for very light approximately northerly breeze through some nearby trees.\r\n\r\ni went back out into yard to approximately the same location and looked again at object which was much closer now and approximately to the northwest of me. still no sound or flashing lights expected from an aircraft. all i could see was a bright round white light steadily going approximately eastward. it was the brightest object in the sky. my first thought then was it was a balloon of some sort.\r\n\r\ni looked at the object with my binoculars and all i saw was a closer image of a bright round white light. the light appeared to be emitting evenly as in no change in luminescence anywhere on object. i thought i might be able to see a structure of the object from reflection of the light on the object as i have seen on airplanes flying over at night (e.G. a portion of the wings or fuselage).\r\n\r\nthough frustrated because there was no true basis or frame of reference to estimate altitude or size because it was just a bright round white light, i estimated the object was 500 feet in altitude and about the size of a single engine aircraft such as a cessna. i would later be able to confirm this estimate with a second sighting nearby on december 16, 2013 which was about two months later and about 5 miles away. i will file a report on the second sighting after this one.\r\n\r\nstill watching the object proceeding eastbound, the steadiness of the speed led me to doubt it was a balloon plus there was hardly any wind at ground level. it was a calm night. while i was still wondering if it was a balloon of some sort or even a drone, the object made a very clean, arcing turn to the north without changing speed. still no sound, change in shape, flashing lights, or any other visual clues could be seen. this ruled out a balloon as it turned into the very light approximately northerly breeze.\r\n\r\nthe object was now proceeding away from me northbound until it disappeared over a tree line. i looked at the object several times with both the binoculars (50 power) and my eyes. there was never any change in speed or appearance, always a very bright round white light moving at a steady, brisk speed even during the one 90 degree turn i observed. i have no idea what it was and had never observed such an object in my years of observation. \r\n\r\ni have experience observing the skies from years of 1) observing and identifying planets, stars, constellations, galaxies, etc., 2) the habit of looking up at sky during daytime to observe and identify birds, 3) visually identifying and tracking planes both daytime and nighttime with a flight app, and 4) flying in small aircraft in earlier years and knowing the altitude. i also have observed \"chinese\" lanterns floating overhead at the same location during 4th of july, which were quite easy to identify with a scope or 50 power binoculars.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

or take a few minutes), my girlfriend observed a downward arcing object as brilliant as a flare the size of a basketball appearing in the sky several hundred feet in the air just to the north of her then changing course straight downward and disappeared into a farmer's field.  the event happened very quickly as the object was traveling at incredible speed.  this occurred on tuesday morning and that evening she told me about what she had witnessed.  wednesday after i was off work, i asked her to show me the exact location she last saw the object - we had received a decent amount of snow on monday (1/4/2016) and i was hoping there might be visible signs in the snow where she last saw this object disappear in the field since no further rain or snow had fallen yet.  the vanishing/crash/landing site of this was not the location i was expecting from her verbal directions in our previous conversations. even though she was west of conrad on m12 driving eastbound when she saw it, the objects path - arc and downward decent traveled from west to east.  the location of disappearance was east of conrad and north of m12 several hundred yards into the field.  the field has some gently rolling hills and the object could of easily descended below one of these hills and out of her view from the road, giving her the appearance of simply vanishing into the field since it is still completely dark at 5am.  the next evening (roughly 5pm) when further investigating the location in the field, i discovered that the area had just recently (within the last day or two) been disturbed by heavy earth moving equipment. i believe my girlfriend saw what she saw.  i am not sure what to think of someone bulldozing and grating in the location she pointed me too.  - note:  you can not see the earthworks from the roads (neither conrad nor m12) until you are standing at the top of the tallest hill in the field.  i took several videos of the of the earthworks and can provide that to someone at mufon upon request.    note:  not sure what a \"crash recovery site\" would look like with a small object, but this scenario has crossed my mind.  this was one of the main reasons to submit this report.  this is fresh and you guys might have the equipment to test for things i can not.

 that one is the west facing kitchen window where i have a breakfast nook and that's where i usually sit most of the time until late at night when i go to the living to raise my feet and legs.\r\n\r\ni have another window behind the sink which is about 4 feet in height and close to 6 feet in width, and that is on the south wall of the house.  the windows in the kitchen allow me a view close to 180 degrees, and since the breakfast nook seat which i use is about 3 feet from the window and at its center, that spot gives me about a 130-140 degree angle view of the outside (and the deck/porch light is right above the main entrance door outside, illuminating much of the deck and weakening before reaching the southern end of the front, western wall).  i have about 2 acres of lawn area which is mostly west, southwest and south, and is rectangular in shape, covered by a treeline in each direction, and the rest of the land which is close to 50 acres is heavily wooded. \r\n\r\nlast night i was reading in the living room, and around 03:30 am, i went to the kitchen to make some tea.  as soon as i got to the sink, i turned the water on to fill the percolator, and while waiting, i looked straight out to see if there were any wild animals and whether there were any stars as there were no clouds that night.\r\n\r\ni noticed a light on the sw side, barely above the treeline (it wasn't right above the treeline and seemed probably at least 4-5 miles away, the treeline only helping as a reference in determining the angle of the light source).  first i thought it was one of the few stars that are large enough to clearly see with the naked eye and that appear to blink.  however when my eyes focused better on it, i realized it was probably a good 10, maybe 15 times the size of the largest star.  i checked the time on the oven to the left of the sink, and it was 03:32 am.  i put the percolator aside and went straight to the breakfast nook to get my binoculars (i keep them there to better see birds that are attracted by the multiple feeders i have.  i did not have any lights on in the kitchen btw as the downstairs of the house has an open floor plan with no walls, and even though the entrance to the kitchen has a closet on one side and the stairs/basement door on the other, it still has about a 7 foot wide opening which still allows the reading light i had on to produce enough light for me to see where i am walking without turning on the kitchen lights (and there is the porch light that also gives enough light through the western window).\r\n\r\nwhen i found the binoculars and was back at the sink, it was 3:36 am and the light was still at the same exact spot as where i had first seen it.\r\n\r\nthere seemed to be 4 lights which kept pulsating but then, they would blink up one or two at a time, and the colors would be different, and those changed from regular light white to yellow, red, green and blue, systematically coming on one oe two at a time clockwise starting with the top right (when 2 at a time, the rop and bottom right first and then rhe left 2), and none of them would go out until the 4th light came on, and then they would all go out (only out for a fraction of a second and maybe faster than 1/10 of a second).\r\n\r\ni'm still trying to move in to my house which i purchased the last day of february last year, and still have no clue as to where my cameras are;  my phone takes really good pictures so i actually never tried to specifically look for my other cameras.\r\n\r\nby the time i got to the living room and back, the oven clock indicated it was 03:43 am.\r\n\r\nhowever it turned out that the phone camera is really not good with small sources of light at night time as it would most times just catch the exact time frame when the lights were out, so it would show only a black sky.  yet, i still managed to get a few shots even though the camera had a very hard time focusing on a tiny spot in the horizon.\r\n\r\ni also tried filming, and even though that seemed to have worked better than taking shots, i had weird grainy noise that kind of interfered with a smooth picture.  it was instant noise as i hit the record button, and not something that showed only when i played back the recording.   basically i had little white dots coming on and off constantly all over the screen as if i were getting electromagnetic interference  (the light source was quite far away, and i can't see how that would be responsible for the noise).\r\n\r\ni ran back to the living room and grabbed  my tablet to see if that would record it any better but by the time i got back, the light was gone. the oven clock showed 03:51 am.\r\n\r\ni stayed there until 4:05am and then continued reading my book in the kitchen.  i checked probably 5-6 times an hour until the sun rose but didn't see the light again.\r\n\r\ni also have no cell phone reception where i live and no phone companies that can install a landline.  even satellite internet isn't available but i have a very weak wireless adsl connection for the internet and have access to my email at all times even though i can only use a cell phone only when i am in bangor.

i note the time, but nevertheless everything else burnt itself into my memory. at the time i was a teenager living in a small village surrounded by large fields.\r\nfrom my bedroom window to my right i could overlook a large part of our neighbours yard. closest to me was a hedge, then the dog kennel and then came the driveway and the neighbour's house.\r\nall in all i would estimate a linear distance of 40m from my window to the house of the neighbours. \r\nour neighbours had a dog which was allowed to run free on the property at night.\r\non the outer wall of their house facing me was a light with motion sensor which, when switched on, was rather bright and illuminated a good part of their yard.\r\nit was very common to me to see sae the light funnel on my wall of my bedroom.\r\nthis motion light which lasted for a couple of seconds would go off when  the dog walking about.\r\non one night, i was lying in my bed not sleeping. i think it must have been after midnight because everbody was already asleep\r\napart from me and was worried as it was school next day. \r\nas i lay looking around my room i saw the neightbours motion sensor light go off.\r\nafter a good few moments i wondered why the motion light would not switch off again and i thought maybe the dog keeps moving in front of it causing it to trigger constantly.\r\ni got up and looked out my window to check.\r\nin the middle of the yard stood a very bright object. \r\ni didn't really understand what i was watching there but i felt curious. \r\ni would describe it as follows:\r\na round /perhaps saucer shaped object with a diameter of approx. 3 to 4 meter shining extremely bright allover.\r\naround its rim were different coloured lights blinking (green,red,orange, yellow)\r\ndue to the brightness i cannot estimate the height.\r\nit was hard to recognise anything around it just like the area around the object was faded out by the light that it produced.\r\nstill it was not hurtful to look right into it.\r\ni opened the window slightly and listened for any sounds, there were none.\r\ni could see that the motion sensor light on the wall of the house was still on.\r\ni tired very hard but could not detect any movements whatsoever.\r\ni would have expected to see or hear the dog somewhere but there was nothing.\r\ni watched it for roughly 20 to 30 minutes. nothing else happened apart from the object being \"parked\" there.\r\nafter a while, all lights went off. suddenly it became pitch black.\r\ni stared at the point where the object was but i could'nt make out anything also the motion sensor light was off.\r\nmy eyes needed to adjust for a moment due to the sudden darkness.\r\nit was just gone. i even scanned the sky but there too, i couldn't see anything.\r\ni stood at my window for another few minutes but then decided to go to bed.\r\n\r\nthe next day i also went to the neighbours and showed them where i saw the object. to my best knowledge i cannot say that there as anything unusual to the grass and driveway. they laughed at me....\r\non the picture you see the arrow is pointing to my window and the star is the position of the ufo.","distance":"21-100
