guess was we were near area 51. the lights grabbed the attention of everyone onboard. it was fairly cloudy and these lights would pierce the clouds even when we were in them deeply. i figured a reflection from solar panels at first. but the blinking was synchronized and penetrating. shortly after we became parallel to the lights, which appeared to be below us or near the ground, the pilot turned away to put distance between us. he then re-altered course after awhile. too me it seemed like a correction to resume. but we were 30 min from landing so i'm not sure. i didn't think to take video earlier. the video you see is towards the end of the sighting as the plane moves away after the course correction. let me know if you know what it is. thanks.","distance":"Over One

horizon in the same direction. idk how high it was. maybe over the tree line, may be thousands of feet. i got in my car to drive home and headed north on davis i see a star like object that looked like a very fast moving low altitude satellite moving east to west. i called my husband and told him to look outside bc the front of our place faces west. he saw it too.Thing is, i had this same experience back in october. even weirder is last time this happened a man in a black new ford suv sat in front of my neighbors house and would not respond to me until i mentioned to my friend getting the tag number. her threw the car in reverse and went backward to the end of the road. well, yesterday i had a man in a older model black ford suv. when i walked out my door he bolted. he had texas plates. maybe its all coincidence. i do live next to an airforce base and directly in between 2 major army bases, both only an hour from here. just strange

and expressing that i wanted to see them one day. kept seeing them in the sky, like they drop out of extreme speed just slow enough so i could tell it was a ship then speed up and keep going. \r\n\r\none night at like idk 1:45am when i was walking home from a friends house i was thinking yet again more benevolent based thoughts to the others/extraterrestrials i had seen that green light in the sky zip over head. when i had gotten home i was so hot from walking in a sweater, i went straight downstairs to cool off and idk maybe like 20min after i got home and was sitting there an over-whelming tiredness came over me.(this isnt the first visit, but most i remembered from one and also when the implant was received)i remember waking up from my mind being blank/just seeing black in my dream state and when i woke, i was like propped up like and sorta leaned/pushed back on the couch, remember my back had a slight jar to it so i sat up slowly and when i did, i seen the one i call the \"hat-man\" i felt something like a warm vibrating sensation in my abdominal region like all the muscles were sort of flexing in some strange way.(2am-ish) i didnt care on what he was doing i was more wondering like why he was there. he tweaked his head a lil but did not take his eyes off on what he was doing/operating. i blacked out just a few sec after he ratted me out for being awake lol, then woke back up idk 10min later again from seeing blackness again, this time i was sitting straight up w/perfect posture. i was think like i wonder why he was here.. then idk few min go by and i start to feel like im being watched (the hallway light was still on) and i look over and see this being standing there in this robe that is made out of like vantablack u can see the atoms flow in it/static blackness robe. i could move just not my vocals and yea i still freaked out and astral projected myself and was saying \"im not ready yet\"\r\nidk few moment after that i think i blacked out again and the one i call the hat-man returned and said are you ok? and was like yeah but was sorta disoriented feeling i suppose, all the lights were one when he came back/i woke. (i think the being was wearing the robe because of the cfl lighting, think it may burn their skin or something.)i talked to hat-man for a while and was about to walk around the corner into the darkness to face them and then i lost my courage cuz he had started to head back to me. i feel like he said some important things to me but i cant remember think its locked away in my sub somewhere. anyways at the end i asked him what the implant in my ankle was for and he said \"its for them\" and i looked at him like what? and he said \"its for you and for them\" and was i like ok =] lol. he said now lay back down in a calm matter(chill personality/vibes)and i said ok and layed back down covered up(remember seeing him putting everything back the way it was) and just b4 i was bout to black out i sat up super fast and was like wait! he said what? i said will i remember any of this?? he said maybe, it depends. i just shrugged and was like ok and continued on going back to sleep. and then i woke not to long i dont think after they left. i know it was dark when they first arrived but i know it began to get light outside when they were leaving, 4hr maybe more/less. i think the part of me talking to him is buried somewhere within my brain cuz when i woke i was very dehydrated.\r\n\r\nthere are other events that have came back to me in a sort of rem sleep ive

cars and 18-wheelers passing, not to mention i also live about 15 minutes from the airport so i'm used to hearing planes as well. \r\n\r\nlast night was different though. i woke up a couple minutes before it happened in a short coughing fit (it's flu season and i'm getting over it now) and laid in bed in silence with my dog before i heard what, at first, i thought was a helicopter approaching. i say it sounded like a helicopter because it was almost a pulsating whirring instead of a steady building of noise like an airplane. but my heart started to race because it seemed like it wasn't passing at all and instead was getting closer and louder until i certainly thought, at the volume it was at, there's no way it couldn't be right above the neighborhood. \r\n\r\ni couldn't bring myself to look outside and see; for fear of seeing anything other than a plane or helicopter, and instead i laid there holding my breath waiting for the noise to subside. after about two minutes or so it did but not without me trying to justify in my head what would have taken it so long as any other aircraft takes only seconds to pass no matter how close it sounds. i'd like to add that i also grew up on a military base so i'd consider my ears incredibly accustomed to the noise of training exercises and transport at all times of the day but i couldn't shake the feeling last night that it was something i had never heard here before.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

only when i was going thru the days images, i noticed what seemed to be a mark on my monitor screen. after trying to remove it the old fashioned way by licking my finger and scrubbing it off i realized it was in the image and i blew it up only to notice an object in view of the moon.\r\n\r\nthe object seems to resemble a hat shape, likely metallic, and what i would call a disc with an elevated dome of sorts. it does not look to have many attachments at all.\r\n\r\ni was immediately shocked by what i had captured, however, with my kids there i asked them \"what do you think this is?\" they all respectively said they thought it was a \"ufo\" or \"spacecraft\".\r\n\r\ni am unaware whether it could be military, dimensional, other-worldly... my only certainty is that i have never witnessed anything like it.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, this was a still image, however, there was no object in the two subsequent images, meaning it was either faster than the shutter speed on 3 burst, or it was there and gone, disappearance.. not sure.\r\n\r\ni was utterly afraid to report this object, i did not want to be subject to ridicule, i did post it on my fb page and shared it with some friends and family, who have all encouraged me to report the sighting and get my story out there. my children who were reviewing the images with me all witnessed the finding. there were 5 of us in

couple of these orange objects in the sky.I had not been drinking for the record! i first noticed that they were not blinking like aviation lights. we live in the city and are constantly having air traffic in our area, yet there seemed to be a lack of it in this time frame. they looked like orange-red candle flames traveling from the north to the south. they kept coming one after another. it looked like a huge ship was passing by at a low altitude. all of the lights seemed to travel at the same speed and distance from each other, not passing or deviating from the path. the only thing that seemed to differ some were the altitudes of the objects, but not by that much.\r\n excited, i called my wife to come see these objects. we now had 3 people observing this. this lasted about 20 to 25 minutes. it was from about 12:15 to 12:40 am. the sky was overcast. but i could see fireworks coming from freedom park area which is maybe two to 3 blocks away. so it seemed that there was a low ceiling of visibility lending me to believe that these objects were definitely under the radar. we realized that there were so many that we should start counting. we both determined that three were at least 25 to 30.\r\n\r\ni have now witnessed 3 events. the first was a pulsating violet/blue orb around crowders mtn, nc in which i was in awe and then a few years later a white orb and a tr3-b in dallas, nc. which made me and  my ex wife feel fear and we ran and hid. these were both in the nineties. this event i didn't feel anything but awe. i think most of what i have seen was exp. military crafts in my opinion. nc is home to fort bragg/pope air force base as well as camp lejeune and cherry point. i took some pics on my verizon revere flip (dumb)phone...A total of 4 pics. for such a crappy phone it picked up a white sphere. and also the orange flame but when it took it seemed to look like some other images of craft that i have seen on the web. i will try to upload these
