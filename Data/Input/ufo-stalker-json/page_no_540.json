were more brilliant on these objects, they were coming from the east in a straight line formation at a gradual speed,then stopped and hovered for approximately 3 to 4 mins.Then they moved in formation horizontally and vertically at a slow steady speed.They then separated slightly then in unbelievable speed shot to the north-northeast.These objects were in the same area as i witnessed before.Not sure what to make of it but since the first sighting i have been woken up 4 times by a bright blueish white light coming through my bedroom window and when i look out the window nothing is there,has

light due east in front of clouds.\r\n3. landing aircraft.\r\n4. grew in size over the course of 5-10 min. rectangular. ratio approx. 5:1. sharp 90 deg. corners. luminescent yellow with a fuzzy/crawley background similar to a tv that has no input. red,green,and blue dashed lines in front of the yellow.(yes, the primary colors) dashed rgb lines ran right to left/ left to right that would also switch place with each other.( a green dashed line would run to the right with a blue run to the left with a red dashed line run right. then they would switch place with each other.) only three lines of rgb. one above the the other.\r\n5. puzzlement.\r\n6. selfridge angb dispatched two f 106 delta dart. they flew in full after burner toward the object. about 2-3 miles out, the f 106's went mach 1, and just as they flew beyond visual range, they went mach 2. this was apparent by the sonic booms they produced. within 30 sec. to 1 min. after the jets second sonic booms, the object seemed to blink out, and was gone.\r\n\r\n on the the boat that day, was my father, stepmother, brother, are guests,(recently retired usaf),lt.Col. boe yodel(f 4 phantom pilot with 3-4 vietnam tours), his wife, and i. my father stopped the boat, so as we could observe the object. 100 ft. or so from us was a macomb county sheriff's boat, with two deputies observing the object, along with hundreds of people on the shore observing also.\r\n\r\n we landed the boat about 5 min. latter at our usall dock, which was located within 200 ft. of the entrance of selfridge angb. the gates were barricaded by the post mp's with displaced rifles.\r\n\r\n i was at an air show at selfridge angb in 1994-5 with a friend of mine. while looking at the parked aircraft we went into a hangar that had an f16 on display that was mounted on three tripods and lowered so as people could see the top side of it, and in attendance was a usaf tech sgt.. my friend and i asked some questions about the f 16, then i asked the tech, sgt. as to how often does selfridge have to dispatch aircraft to investigate ufo's, to which he just smirked. then i started to describe what i had witnessed back in 1970. as i was describing the object, he stopped me and said that he was on the base that day himself with his father who was in the air force at the time, and stationed there, and that he had witnessed the object. \r\n\r\n years later while living in texas, i drove to roswell n.M.. while there i stopped at the roswell ufo museum and purchased 3-4 copies of \"incident\" magazine, and in the back of one them, there was 1-2 pages of people's various sightings. one of them describer something very similar to what i had witnessed. \r\n\r\n i was 12 yr.S old when i saw that thing over the lake. i'm 58 yr.S old now, and still don't know what it is that i saw. it could not be described as anything mechanical. my father was in the luftwaffe during ww2, and inherited his interest in aviation, and grew up during one of the human race's greatest era of space explorations. when i look to sky, i do not see ufo's everywhere, and i know that a bright point light in the sky is venise or if it's moving without blinking, it's a satellite, and discount 99.99% of what i see on the internet. \r\n\r\n i'm hopping that your organization might help me with my search for an answer.\r\n\r\n thanx.\r\n\r\n

been really large because it seems to be partially behind the chem trail left by a jet. there is an electrical pole in the pic. i thought maybe it might be a light of some sort extended up from the pole, but when i looked again during the day there is nothing there so whatever i picked up in the pic was up in the sky. i've never seen anything like it before. if you have an idea of what it could be please share. i'm very curious about it. i have seen unidentified objects twice before years ago and it didnt look like this. i used an app called picsart to brighten the photo. i thought that

alone in my car driving east on steger road(a two lane road), between 25-35 mph with my windows rolled up. i believe the sky was mostly overcast that day. as i was calmly enjoying the drive, looking around at the scenery, i happened to notice what looked like a medium-sized plane flying off in the distance, going in the same direction i was going, paralleling my path on steger road. i watched it for a few seconds, then curiously asked myself, \"what kind of plane is that?\" as i kept watching it, it suddenly began accelerating ahead of me. that's when i said to myself, \"that's no airplane; that's a ufo.\" i knew that planes don't suddenly accelerate like that. at that moment i rolled my window down and took my cellphone off my waist to try to take a photo of it. but by the time i unlocked my screen and turned on the camera, (which took me about 5 seconds)a thick row of trees were blocking my view of it. there were no cars in front of me, so i quickly sped up because i knew there was a huge opening beyond the trees with no homes or buildings to obstruct my view. it would allow me to see the craft and hopefully get a photograph of it. it took me about 6 seconds to reach the opening. but to my shock and surprise the craft was completely gone; nowhere to be seen. the open field was near my destination so i pulled into the parking lot, got out of my car with cell camera in hand and stood there for about a thirty seconds staring across the sky in disbelief while at the same time hoping that the craft would reappear so i could catch a snapshot. but unfortunately, it

has been coming in since 1993, the only change it makes is the time in which it comes in. 6:50pm, it's in close, i took two 35mm photos using an olympus 35mm camera with a shutter speed of 1/60th a second, using 400 speed film. tonight the skies are clear with multiple craft flying in various directions. the five star can only be seen on clear nights. a small white blinking craft flying parallel to hwy. 174, flying south to north. a second white blinking craft flying north to south, parallel to hwy. 174, beneath the five star display. the second should appear in the two photos i took. no sound from any objects. 7:30pm, five star display has stopped coming west, it has stopped short of hwy. 174, which runs directly in front of my home. same pattern since 1993. at this point two other craft appear coming in behind the five star display. both are flashing red, blue, green, and white. they are far apart, directly in line with one another. coming in from the east, going west and lower than the five star display. since 1993, i've witnessed these two having the ability to travel from one horizon to the other in less than five seconds. they can also vanish and re-appear else where in the sky. after those two, there will be two others coming in from same direction, same pattern, the four make up a square shape in the sky, behind and lower than the five star. as the four get closer, they get higher in the sky. \r\n8:00pm the five star is now going up into outer space, i know this cause the objects are getting smaller as it goes up. the four behind go up as well. these objects defy the earth's rotation. there's an underground lockheed micro-wave base about two miles from my home, going toward walnut springs. i believe these objects has something to do with that base. i believe the five star display is some kind of space station. i have named the four behind as guardians, for i believe they are protecting the five star and are armed with a laser weapon. last month this display was coming in around 9:00pm and last summer it was coming in around 3:00am. it always stops short of hwy. 174, slowly climbing higher, as morning comes it disappears. at 8:00pm i took one more photo on a roll of 24. since it's been cloudy, soon as it clears it all will be visible again. when the roll is finished, i'll have it developed and get it to your director larry weeden of harker heights chapter / section 9. every night here in morgan, the sky is full of ufo's. everyone here ignores them, not caring to find out what they are and morgan is a small unknown town, so no one pays any attention to what goes on. that's why there's so much activity here, they go un-noticed.

evansville, indiana.  upon passing the railroad tracks, i noticed what appeared to be a basketball-sized purple orb move from right to left in front of me to my 2 o'clock position.\r\n\r\norb appeared, at that point, to be just above the top of the trees that surrounded the small, grass-strip airport there.  the  color was a dark purple and the orb, from that distance, looked like a plasma ball.  when it moved, it moved very smoothly and consistently.  it did not seem to bounce around.\r\n\r\nas i got closer, the orb started moving west, away from me, and went over the trees to the east of the airport.  i pulled into a parking lot on the north side of allen's lane and was able to catch a short video as it disappeared.  i was facing north in the parking lot and looking west.  orb disappeared at my 8-9 direction.\r\n\r\ni sat there for a minute or so and, just as i decided to leave, the orb appeared again, this time at my 11-12 position, just above the trees and appeared to be much farther away, possibly as far as st. joseph avenue and mill road intersection.  according to the distance measuring tool on google maps, that would have put it approximately 1.3 miles away.  this time, i took a second, 7-minute video of the orb rising, lowering and moving around until it disappeared.\r\n\r\nwhen it disappeared for the 2nd time, i waited about 10 minutes and then left the area.\r\n\r\nfast forward 2 hours.  i went to pick up my wife and took her to dinner.  i told her about the encounter and, when we were returning, we came over mesker park hill (just south of west diamond avenue on st. joseph avenue) and there it was again, directly north of us.  we were about 1/3rd down the hill when we saw it and it was well above the height we were.\r\n\r\nthis time, however, the orb looked different.  in addition to the spherical plasma ball, it appeared to have two plasma ellipses, one at the 10 o'clock position and one at the 2 o'clock position centered on the orb.\r\n\r\nwe had to stop at the stoplight crossing diamond avenue and it appeared that the person in the truck in front of us saw it, as well.\r\n\r\nwe pulled into the rural king at 2800 n st joseph ave, evansville, in 47720 and parked in the north eastern corner of the parking lot where we took another video that lasted 1 minute and 42 seconds long as the orb appeared to remain at it's height, but traveled north above or paralleling st. joseph avenue until it went out of sight.\r\n\r\nat no time, during either encounter, did i hear any noise coming from the orb.  during the first sighting, i was parked in a very quiet area.  i did not get the feeling that this was a drone as it did not seem to wobble or waver.  it moved excruciatingly smoothly and very fast, at times.  i'm not one who is up on modern private drone technology, but the object i saw avoided the trees, powerlines and buildings and travelled anywhere from 1-3 miles requiring a line of sight for control to be from 1/2 a mile to 1-1/2 miles.  but even then, the controller would not have been able to see the drone when it was behind the trees or buildings around the area where i first saw the orb.\r\n\r\nplease note, i do have three videos on my cell phone, but all are larger than 20 megs (the 7-minute video is over 800m).  i get an error message when i tried to email the videos to myself that i cannot attach anything larger than 20m.  if i can get directions on how to overcome this (no, my  phone doesn't have a removable memory card), i'd be more than glad to share them.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

in front of it, and to the right of us are sliding glass doors. it was around 8:45 at night and i happened to look out the window and saw what i thought was a small airplane about to fly over our house. i then said \"look, there's an airplane about to fly over our house!\" i put my son in the seat and opened the door to get a better look at it. it was very quiet, and was moving very slowly.. i instantly realized that it was not an airplane and called my husband over to see it. i said, \"i think it's a drone?? but it's too big to be a drone, and it's a diamond shape, that's so weird!\" it had four white lights. two bright wing lights, a nose light, and i think a smaller light in the back. i feel like it was the size of a couple of cars, or the size of a small aircraft that seats two people. my husband began to think that one of our neighbors must own a drone, but i said- there's no way someone could buy a drone that large for personal use and fly it. it looks like someone could ride in it. i bet it's a government drone. i called two air force bases, and they both said they did not have any unmanned drones like the one i described. i did research to try and find drones in the shape and size like the one i saw, but only found this one that really seems to match the description of what i saw: the us navy’s x-47b drone. i called two local air force bases and they denied having any drones. there was a slightly rounded curved  bottom that i could only see via the shadows that were made from the nose and wing lights that would correspond with the x47b drone, but it's just really bizarre, the whole thing. none of my neighbors saw it, only my husband and myself. how frustrating that i did't get any videos or photos of it, it was so close!!!

running, then about 1 minute after the explosion as we crossed the playground something stopped us in our tracks. as we turned around to see where a sudden light source that came out of nowhere was there was something hovering about 20 ft over the same basketball court we just seconds earlier ran across. we sat there staring with our mouths wide open, nobody said a word. then all the sudden after it hovered for a few minutes it was just gone. there was no noise and no air coming from the object. the light was way too bright to see the size or shape of the object. i always thought it had to be a government technology that the public doesn't know about because it was there because of the explosion that took place right before the sighting. the funny thing is that none of us there that
