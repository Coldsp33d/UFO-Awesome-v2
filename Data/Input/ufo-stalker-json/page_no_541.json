(later i had a single beer). as we pulled onto wynngate dr. we noticed fireworks from the next street over to the west. my wife needed to use the bathroom, so i let her go ahead into the house while i watched the fireworks. just as i exited the car, which was pointed almost directly east, there was a loud boom. as i came to the back of the car, i noticed some lights approaching from the nw. the fireworks did not continue, but the lights drew my attention. a set of 3 light were moving in a straight line. they were moving with the short end of the triangle leading. i thought at first someone was playing with chinese lanterns. i changed my mind almost instantly and figured they were drones. but as there was a little wind that morning and the lights were not having trouble staying in formation, i didn't know what was going on. the lights sort of pulsed on about a 1 or 2 second schedule. they were an orange color, about the same as the stop hand signal at crosswalks. the lights stopped at about dead west from my position. as i watched them i realised what i was seeing was not natural. i started taking pictures with my phone, but only got the last 2 lights. then another set of lights became visible thru the trees to the west. there were 3 lights, again in a triangle with the short end leading. i looked at the first set and watched as they appeared to  begin to rotate on their axis. as the nearer light passed light on its right, it began to fade, it was gone in about 2 or 3 seconds. the other lights in that formation also faded away. the other set of light stopped slightly to the north of west and after about another minute, they also faded out. \r\ni went into the house, told my wife what i'd seen had a beer and went to bed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":73688,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.00237557173177,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01062016-0006","longitude":-85.10493453772686,"occurred":1451606400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1452073939000,"summary":"2 sets of lights in triangular formation. 1 following the other. both moving backwards.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/73688_submitter_file1__0101160011.jpg"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":10,"maxtempi":50,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":9,"meantempi":48,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":7,"mintempi":44,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":10,"maxtempi":50,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":9,"meantempi":48,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":7,"mintempi":44,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"30240","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"LaGrange, Georgia","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:93685"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Cocoa","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On 1/1/2016 we were outside and saw a craft come from the west.  it flew over our house.  it was about 200 feet in the air.  it was triangular in shape, it glowed a yellow color and had white lights on the corners (3). \r\n\r\nabout a minute later we observed 2 more crafts come from the west flying in tandem.  they flew over the house and headed toward the direction of the other craft.  \r\n\r\nabout a minute later a forth craft came from the west flew over the house and flew toward the other three crafts.  \r\n\r\nwe watched the four crafts fly into the atmosphere gaining speed as they reached the indian river where they ascended into the sky and disappeared. \r\n\r\nthe crafts were a glowing yellow cover with white lights at the 3 corners.\r\n\r\nthey emitted a red glow from the bottom of the crafts.  when they were several miles away the red glow seemed to get larger from underneath the crafts and it looked as though it exploded before they disappeared from our view into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\na friend said he saw flying objects a few days before in the same area and field investigator stacey jones came with him to talk to us on 1/3/2016. we tried to upload the pictures and videos of the sighting to stacey and it failed.  she came back 1/5/2016 and now has the pictures and videos.

1992 it was a tuesday night about 9:00pm. i was at a friends place. he lived on the top floor, floor 16 of an apartment building facing south west towards the lake. we noticed the passenger jets over the lake from time to time circling to land at the airport. we noticed one light out over the lake that seem to not be moving at all for a long length of time. it looked like one bright white yellowish light. after some time that same light while staying in position turned into 3 lights in the shape of a triangle. the triangle looked dark black with 1 light at each corner that had a dull but bright white yellowish light. south of the apartment building by the lake there used to be a large coal burning power plant. the triangle eventually started moving with no sound following the power lines to and around the station. it disappeared after 10 to 15 minutes of following directly above the lines. minutes later the triangle re appeared 50 foot or less ascending from below us on the 16th floor slowly then it stopped in front of my friend and i. it made no sound, there was no wind. it almost seemed like everything around us stopped at the time. i remember my friend took a few steps forward and put his hand out as if to try and touch it. i remember yelling no don't and that point the triangle let off a very intense bright blinding light. we both screamed in fear and ducked down to the ground in a ball like position. after getting up and realizing it was gone we ran inside. both his parents were home at the time inside. we were both panicked. we briefly told his parents what happened. they never saw any light or even heard us scream i remember them saying. \r\nyears went by my friend never spoke about it again until last year after his father passed away. he looked at me and recounted what we saw. he said it still scares him so he doesn't talk about it to anyone. my self on the other hand felt the urge to tell people from time to time.\r\nsome friends and parents about what i had seen. of course i don't know what i saw most people just think your crazy or a liar. but i know what i had seen. i still remember like it was yesterday  \r\n\r\na few days after this event took place. i was riding my bicycle home from a friends house down the street from where i lived. i looked up it was about 10:30 pm clear night also. and i saw a red orb looking object following me down the street just above the tree line. it looked like lava or fire but it was round smaller in size maybe the size or a small car or a large beach ball maybe and it made no sound at all. i kept pedaling as fast as i could to get home. i told my parents also about what i had seen. my self at the time only being 12 years old. a week later floating over the trees near the time of sun set i noticed the same looking orb floating over the tree line over our house and street. i yelled for my parents to come see it. as soon as my dad came out to see the object it quickly moved away from us quickly to the west and disappeared behind the tree line. my dad saw it moving away he said to me. he couldn't tell what it was. he only saw it for a second or 2. once again this orb made no sound.\r\n\r\nthanks for  your time.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was told to give my most recent sighting above which i did \r\nmy sightings are from my past and unfortunately i have no photos to give, i’ve been wanting to report my experiences for the past so many years but just never did, but do to recent events in my life (not associated with ufos) and inspired by the show hangar 1, i thought it’s time for me to sit down type this out and send it. now i have had many sightings over the years i use to smoke and spent a lot of time outside star gazing, since i’ve quit smoking i haven’t had any because i’m not outside as much looking up.\r\n\r\nmy first experience that i remember was back in 1988 late fall early winter time during the evening around 7 or 8pm, i was 17 years old and i was a passenger in a friend’s car on our way from harrisonburg va to charlottesville va, we were on highway 33 going over the mountains when we both noticed a large v shaped object hovering low directly over the  median strip between the roads, both of us looked at it but neither of us said anything until we were a few miles past when i finally said “what the hell was that anyway” but then we quickly dismissed it and went about our business. \r\n\r\nnow it was not long after that event that i started experiencing what i would later come to find was called sleep paralysis were my mind was awake and fully aware but my body was asleep almost paralyzed feeling and i would struggle to try to move and if i could just as much as flick my finger then i would wake up from it! during these episodes i never heard anything unusual but there was a feeling of not being alone, this would happen randomly through the years sometimes once a month other times nightly for a period of time, every time i would awake from it though and see nothing i would be in my bed, lights out room dark nothing unusual. during the years as this went on i lived in virginia then back to indiana then virginia again down in florida for some years and then finely back in indiana \r\nnow as i said i came to find that what i was experiencing was called sleep paralysis based on tv shows where it was talked about and was describe as a nature occurrence just as i decried it to be so therefor i never associated it with any type of alien abduction experience.   \r\n\r\nthen i’m going to say around 2007 or so when i was 36 one night as i had over the years had a another occurrence of sleep paralysis except this time it was completely different this time i could hear for a moment what sounded like hollowing wind and then it was quiet and as usual i struggled to wake from it but this time when i opened my eyes i was not in my room or bed instead i was in a well lit room with a being standing over me just looking directly at me! and all i remember thinking was wow you look a lot like the artist rendering i’ve seen over the year not quite but almost! nothing that i remember was said i just saw what i saw then my eyes closed then when i was able to open them again i was back in my room in my bed!  but what i had just experienced felt and seemed to be more than just a dream, if it was just a dream then it was the most realistic dream i could ever imagine having…one thing that did make me wonder though was the fact that when i did open my eyes and i was in such a well lit room the light did not hurt my eyes in any way that was the only thing that made me feel that it must have been some kind of dream…\r\n\r\nnow even though as i said that there were no words spoken, no conversation of any kind i was left with this feeling that i was allowed to open my eyes and see what i saw because this was my last time, they were done with me! and ever since then i have had no more sleep paralysis episodes at all, eight years now!  had them regularly for almost twenty years now nothing for the past eight.\r\n\r\nnow also on top of all this over the past so many years since my first sighting i have had at least eight other ufo sightings one involved what i would consider to have been a large mother ship followed by many smaller ships. that one took place here in indiana once again eight or nine years ago during the summer on a night when we were having a meteor shower and was witnessed be me and four other people.\r\n","distance":"Over One

original filing was not accepted b/c the site wasn't taking new ufo reports at that time. my first report was very long and detailed. now years later, i wish to refile my sighting simply b/c i can not stop thinking about what i saw that morning. quickly, i was working as an inventory manager for usata tmde near letterkenny army depot outside of chambersburg pa. i was the first at our duty station as usual that morning 0445. since most gov't operations run on coffee, that was what i did first, plug in the pot to preheat it. there is a small window near that area facing east and it was at that time i noticed a light to the ne. maybe not unusual since harrisburg international airport is in that general direction. it takes 6 minutes for the coffe pot to heat up enough to brew coffee. so i went to my office to check email etc. after about 6 minutes, i returned to the break area to make coffee. while the coffee was brewing to noticed the light i saw earlier appeared to have moved maybe a click or two toward what to me looked due west. takes about 2 minutes for the pot to fill and i grabbed a cup and walked outside smoking area to get a better look at the lights. i could tell it was moving but very slow and slow to the ground but still maybe 25 km (clicks)out. i watched it for maybe 25-30 minutes before i started to get a little freaked out by what i was seeing. it was coming slowly toward our bldg low in the sky and absolutely no sound. the 3 lights flashed off and on in no order and in no change of bightness. at that point, i decide i go get my camera from my truck hoping to get some pictures. the thing just kept coming low and slow. hoping to get a good prespective of size, i took the first picture as it past next to the bldg 50yds to due north. as it flew over that bldg, maybe 1-2 clicks out it sped up 2x climb and banked sharply to the north. it then leveled off maybe 2-3x the original height slowed down and continued to fly back in a general north to north east path. the whole sighting was over 45 moinutes in duration. i did pull the sd card from the camera but sadly the camera is a piece of junk and the pictures were not clear at all.I have been around a lot of aircraft. i have worked on patriot and hawk ada systems, and have held a high security level access. honestly this \"thing\" does not fit any known aircraft in my opinion.

high altitude plane, kind of wondering where they were going. i noticed how brilliantly clear it was and found orion and started star gazing. then i noticed to my left (east) how it seemed as though the stars were blinking out, almost like something was passing between my line of sight, then noticed, for lack of a better word, a \"flash\"; almost like a mirror catching moonlight..And thought \"hey, it's the space station\"..Best way to make sure you found the space station is too look a little ahead of where you thought you saw it because it moves so dang fast...Then...I just don't know how to describe what i saw. the best way i can describe it is like looking at something that is hiding from you and you catch that perfect angle and it's revealed, almost like it was cloaked..This massive ship, that's what it had to be. i've never in my life seen such a thing. it was almost boomerang shaped, but not such a harsh bend, if that makes sense. there were no external lights, it was the color of dirt almost just brownish, with these black, i don't know, maybe exhaust vents? that were oblong, i can recall seeing about five of these black..Things..And the entire ship, the whole of it, looked textured some how. i don't know. you know how you see a plane in the air and you can make out the metal is smooth, this was far from smooth. it was so high in the air, how could i even tell that it was textured? with no lights how could i tell it was brown .. it's not like it was flaming red or flashing lights .. it was dull and massive and almost seemed like it was creating a haze of some sort. not one sound came from it. even high altitude planes you can hear the hum as it passes, there was nothing coming from this thing. i lived on biggs army airfield for four years, as a refueling station for all us military forces that have pilots, i have seen a lot of what the us military has to offer, from a dc10 to a stealth (which are quite noisey unlike most people think), a blackhawk to a few prototypes that came out of nv to refuel .. i have never in my life seen anything like this. the silence of it, the size and the fact that i do believe it was \"cloaking\" and i some how just caught that perfect angle. may sound crazy, but i have never seen something so intentionally try to hide. my mind is blown. i want to know what i saw. how could it do these things?
