year old daughter getting ready to shout happy new year.  we have a large picture window looking out in to the back yard.  our yard is maybe 15ft wide then there is a brick retaining wall that is 5 ft high and on top of that we built a 6 ft wood fence for privacy from the neighbors.  behind this fence are two houses standing side by side.\r\n  sporadically through the night there were numerous fireworks going off.  so out of the corner of my eye i see this super bright glow and i turn all the way around and the glow is slowly but steadily gliding over the top of my neighbors roof.  i instantly thought it was maybe a firework but as i looked at it, it wasn't falling or going skyward and there were no sparks or fire trail or noise that i could hear.  \r\n  i yelled \"what the hell is that?!\" and i ran all the way across the house to the front door with my phone in hand trying to get to the video recording option while i was running down the hallway.  for some reason in the back of my mind, i knew it wasn't anything i had ever seen....I almost thought it was a toilet paper roll on fire just because of the size and the intense light coming from it.  it was brighter than any light i had ever seen.  it's twice as bright as the street light in the video.  i was trying to hear a noise come from it like a drone sounds like but there wasn't any.  there weren't any flames coming from it, it just had the illusion of being on fire.  i honestly don't know how else to describe it.\r\n  i don't neccessarily believe in ufo's but this has changed my mind a little.  it kinda freaked me out honestly.  i couldn't hardly go to sleep that night. then as i watched the video to make sure i really got it recorded, i noticed there is something else in the video.  is it my phone acting weird?  i don't know, its never done that and i have taken thousands of videos. \r\n  it looks like a mini flying object.  it wasnt a bug because we don't have anything like that here and especially in the middle of winter.  it definitely seemed interested in the orb.  i don't know.  \r\n  i just have a gut feeling that this was as real as it gets.\r\n","distance":"101-500

grandson were taking trash out to deposit in the trash bins that had been placed at the front curb.  clouds of an approaching weather front were slowly moving from the southwest toward the northeast.  in a break in the clouds i saw a yellow-orange light.  it was bigger than a star and slightly bigger than planets seen in the area.  i couldn't tell if it was moving slowly or if it was stationary and looked like it was moving due to the motion of the clouds.  i put my finger up and pointed to it to gauge movement.  it appeared to be moving slowly toward the north-to-northeast.  then it dropped what appeared to be molten orange material that was almost the same size as the light itself. at first i thought maybe it was dropping flares, but they did not fall far from the main light before disintegrating into smaller pieces or distinquishing.  it dimmed and appeared to diminish in size as it dropped the \"molten\" material.  several times it appeared to dim and go out, but then would get slightly brighter again, but never getting as bright or as large as originally seen.  it slowly veered east-to-northeast and disappeared behind a small mountain behind our house.\r\nit was difficult to estimate the altitude but it appeared to be within the cloud layer or beyond.  the total time of the sighting i would guess to be about 2 minutes.  when it disappeared, i looked at my

mountain pine ridge area of cayo district, belize in the sse sky at about a 15 deg elevation. then i spotted mars. the orb was somewhat larger than observable planets, was white, brighter than sirius or saturn, and instead of shimmering like planets, flashed intermittently the colors red and blue, with red predominantly at the top and blue beneath. the orb would remain stationary and for about 10 % of the time would move erratically, unlike any known aerospace vehicle. in the first sighting, it fluttered downward like a leaf, then upward and to the right, held its position for another few minutes, then repeated the fluttering, held, then faded out.\r\n\r\nsince that sighting, more frequent observation of the sky has been made and up to three of these orbs have been spotted at the same time, in positions s, sse, and e, at elevations varying from 15 to 45 deg above the horizon. as of the fourth quarter of 2015, every time i have looked for them, i observed them. they are commonplace. neighbors have confirmed my sightings and several other people have observed them with me and noticed their movements. \r\n\r\ni first thought that saccadic eye movements might account for the motion, but by obscuring the orb with a stationary object, they would move out from behind it.\r\n\r\nthese orbs have no surface details other than the flashing colors. they appear to be miles away, the central one being at least over or beyond belmopan, about 20 miles away from where i observe, and in its direction. they move within certain soft bounds, remaining in roughly the same position in the sky, on average. total range of motion in both dimensions is about + and - 3 deg.\r\n\r\ni live on a jungle hilltop where any artifacts in the sky such as airplanes are infrequent.\r\n\r\nthe regularity - almost predictability - of the occurrence of these orbs leads me to suggest that others in the region observe the night sky for them too.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

cloudless, bright blue sky and very cold (-10c).  the wind was blowing in a westerly direction.  event took place in oshawa, ontario, canada.  \r\n\r\ni was driving home from work on the 401 (major east/west freeway in ontario).  i got off the 401 at the bloor/harmony exit and proceeded north on harmony road (i have driven this route home for the last 12 years).  harmony road is a four lane road (two lanes northbound and two lanes southbound) at this point and there are residential homes on both sides of the street.  the traffic was heavy as is normal this time of the day.  as i approached the intersection of harmony road and olive street i came to a red light and stopped.  i was the first car in the right lane at the intersection.  as i was stopped my eye caught something bright at the top of my windshield and i looked up at it.  what i saw next was very puzzling.  as i'm not sure of the exact size of the two objects i can only tell you what it \"seemed\" like to me.  to me the objects appeared to be about 6 feet long and about 3 feet wide.  the best idea of a shape that i can give you is they looked like box kites.  they were both very, very shiny.  almost like a bright chrome reflecting the sun.  however only parts of the objects were reflecting the sun, other parts were translucent and you could see the the sky through the material.  to me it seemed like these objects were about 200 feet high, maybe 200-300 feet away from me.  generally they looked as if they were hovering above the intersection.  the object that was closer to me was about 10 feet lower than the second object and they were about 10-15 feet apart.  i was watching them for between 1-2 minutes.  i have my cell phone with me and wanted to get out of my car, but as there was a lot of traffic behind me i didn't want to hold them up (i really regret now that i didn't take pictures). when the light turned green i made a right turn (so i was now driving eastbound on olive street and the objects were now behind me and i was driving away from them).  i just couldn't believe what i had just been looking at.  olive street at this point is a two lane road with residential homes on either side of the street.  as i was driving east on olive street i just had a \"feeling\" that i should look up into the sky.  when i did this i was shocked to see another ufo that was completely different  than the first two that i had just witnessed.  at this point i'm driving so i can't look for long periods of time at this third object.  again, it's difficult to estimate the distance, but i would have to say that it appeared to be anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 feet up.  it was circular and white, with a dark blue line that appeared as a circle inward from the outside rim.  there were four objects that look something like mechanical arms or large rods that were jutting out from the object (if the circle had corners there would have been one of these rods at each corner).  i have a sunroof that has an inside cloth cover.  at this point i pulled the cover back and looked directly up at the bottom of the object (still at the same height).  to me it seemed as if the object was not moving.  olive street ends at townline road and i had made up my mind to stop at this intersection to see if i could get a picture of this object.  when i got to the intersection ( about 20 seconds since i had first seen this third object) i stopped the car and looked up and the object was gone.  \r\n\r\nwhen i got home i told my wife about my experience and i then called the durham regional police.  the woman who was on the phone i told her a little of what i had witnessed, but had really phoned to see if anyone else had called in.  she said there were no other reports.  she then patched me through to the oshawa airport which is a small airport about 10 minute drive from where i witnessed the objects.  the man at the airport said they had no strange aircraft flying around, but took my name and number and told me he would call me back if anyone else called in.  he did tell me that he has had several calls about ufos over the last several months.\r\n\r\ni really, really regret not taking any photos.  i have to mention that i'm very familiar with all kinds of aircraft in the sky.  as i mentioned i live near a small airport and have seen lots and lots of aircraft flying in daylight and at nighttime.  also our area has a police helicopter and have viewed that flying around many, many times.  while this object was similar to a box kite, it was like no box kite i have ever seen before.  the area where i witnessed the objects is about 4 miles from lake ontario.  this really freaked me out as i have no idea what i was looking at.","distance":"101-500

located in northeast scottsdale called rio verde. i have been wanting to take a drive on that particular road because of it's lack of light posts. as we approached the i17 loop going north to flagstaff, i saw several oddly shaped lights hovering above downtown. initially, i dismissed then as being commercial aircraft but the longer i stared, the more i noticed the weird shape and color of the flying objects. they had the color of a burning flame: bright yellow,orange, and red. it seemed as if someone had painted several small streaks of colors onto the night sky. i caught a very short glimpse as i was driving away from the lights so i was unable to record them, i asked my cousin to take photo or a video of them but it was too late as we were facing north and the lights were out of our view/reach. the lights just seemed to hover and maybe move slightly but for the most part were stationary, the brief moment i saw them. the moment i realized what i was witnessing, i began to feel excited for the phenomena i had encountered but i am saddened that i was unable to capture evidence of the objects. i attempted to find other testimonies such as myself via facebook but i didn't get as many as i had hoped. only another person besides myself and my cousin came forth validating what we had seen and she claimed they appeared and disappeared rather quickly.","distance":"Over One
