drawn to look up because of a flashing.  i saw what looked like a very high airplane, but could see it was much higher than the planes i'm accustomed to seeing in the area.  i was facing south, and the lights were a bit east of due south.\r\n\r\nall in the matter of no more than 4 seconds, i caught a first flash.  then at what would have to be a very fast speed, i saw it flash again at several degrees higher distance than the first flash.  that second light also flashed for only a split second, and again, after the same interval of time, i saw it flash a third time.  if the first flash was 40 degrees above the horizon, the third flash was about 50 degrees.  all of these flashes were in a perfectly straight line.\r\n\r\ninstead of blinking out like the two flashes, this third appearance of the light remained on at the same split second that it made a hairpin change of direction, shooting off at approximately a 5 degree angle from its original path.  this shooting off was back in the direction it had come, so it was shooting off lower in the sky than from where i saw the first light.  the light was steady from the third flash, on through this streaking off on the hairpin turn.  this exit was brief, it covered a few degrees in the sky and blinked off.\r\n\r\ni stayed on the porch, checking myself about what i'd just seen.  i confirmed that it wasn't a plane, since it behaved unlike any seen before in the area.  i considered whether i maybe saw two objects, one flashing three times and going off, then with another object, like a meteor, somehow making this hairpin streak from the exact location of the third light.  that didn't seem at all likely.  it had looked like one, continuous and self-contained, organic event.\r\n\r\ni waited for a couple of minutes before going inside again, in case i would catch sight of the light/object again - i saw nothing more, so finally went in and told my wife what i'd seen.\r\n\r\nit was all relatively unspectacular, the light(s) being at such a great distance, but the impossibly tight turn, that sudden change of direction obviously makes the behavior of the phenomenon classic.\r\n\r\ni do wonder if i'll see a report somewhere of someone else in the area seeing the same thing.  i'd very much like to know.\r\n\r\nthanks for reading.  happy to report to mufon - not a breathtaking event, but it was, i do believe, a ufo, so wanted to do my bit and report it.

to change in number, orientation and even appeared to merge back together. the pattern of lights consisted of 1 to 4 separate but equal sized lights. there were definitely no sounds associated with that of a blimp, plane or helicopter. the lights were able to hover and were obviously under intelligent control. i photographed the light objects with a mediocre h5 sony camera. i believed that all i would see were some blurry lights on the computer monitor. much to my surprise, there was also a clear outline of what appeared to be a craft. the apparent craft also seemed to have a propulsion system. the propulsion system seemed to be emitting a white energy or light. there were other strange objects in the digital image that i could not detect in the field. i can only explain the phenomenon as some sort of electrical disturbance perhaps a little like connected, irregular loops of dancing energy. these energy loops were irregular in shape and appeared in different colors. these energy loops were visible on both sides of the craft and the red light objects. i thought these light loops were the result of camera movement. then i rationalized that if movement had produced the colored loops of energy, then why were they different colors? why did the craft and red colored lights remain in sharp focus?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

thought to my self that was odd wonder what they are up to do to the speed of travel and tight formation. their elevation was high i thought maybe if i took out my phone i could zoom in on my camera and maybe see a little better. as i took my phone out and pointed in their direction i happened to notice something dark over a building in the direction the jets/planes path was. i snapped a few photos and was amazed to see something in the sky over the building in the photo. i don't know what the object is. and at first thought is was a spec on my lens. i aimed the camera again zoomed in and could see the object again!!!!!! i couldn't believe what i was seeing and it was moving, almost dancing in the sky. so i snapped a few more pic. thought to myself no one is ever going to believe this so i hurried up and switched to video. began to record the object and was amazed to see it move in a erratic way. the object almost seem to disappear for a moment.  then after about 15 sec of recording in a flash of light shot off and up. i was amazed at what i saw and began shaking. i wasn't not shaking from the temp outside being 30 or so degrees outside i was in awe of what i had just witnessed.
