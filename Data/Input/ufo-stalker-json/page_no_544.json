i had opened my back sliding glass door to let my dog go out into the back yard, that's when i noticed the object.\r\n\r\n our house is situated on a hillside, and we have a partial mountain view of the opposite side of a small valley. \r\n\r\n 2) the object was huge, (estimated 1000' high x 500' wide), rectangular, square corners, and bright neon  green in color. \r\n\r\nit resembled a rectangular neon green sheet of light coming down from the sky to the ground.\r\n\r\n the object came straight down at a high rate of speed from a very high altitude in the sky , and landed on the side of a large hill, about 4 miles from my location.\r\n\r\ni estimate the time of the decent of the object, (sky to ground), to be approximately 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n when the object came just above to the hill side ground it stopped and the bottom area  of the \"rectangle\" instantly turned into an upside down \"v\" shape. \r\n\r\nthe upside down \"v\" shape changed in color into  multi colored vertical stripes of red, yellow and purple on each side, and then the entire object just disappeared, leaving 2 bright white illuminated orbs.\r\n\r\ni immediately drove my car to a location, off of the side of highway  us395 about one third of a mile from the location of the orbs on the hillside, so that i could better observe the now 2 objects moving on the side of the mountain.\r\n\r\ni carry a pair of binoculars in the trunk of my car, and used them to observe the orbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe two white orbs were then moving along the ground of the hillside at a high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nthe orbs moved in a sporadic pattern covering the entire hillside for about 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n i would estimate the speed of movement of the orbs to be about 100 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n i don't think the orbs were actually in contact with the surface of the ground of the hill side, but i think that the orbs were actually hovering very close to the ground, as their was no visible dust coming up from the ground.\r\n\r\nafter about 10 minutes, the 2 bright white orbs came together, and merged together, got much brighter, then went dark and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni then went back to my home.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

unfamiliar lights pulsating in the pitch black sky. he ran inside to grab my mother; they saw 5 red/orange lights arranged similar to the dippers, one white blinking light hovered between them all. these red/orange lights, from our perspective, were round and large compared to all other star in the sky, but not as large as the moon. the bottom red/orange light faded away within seconds. the second light shortly followed. my mother ran inside to grab me. at 7:05pm i grabbed my phone and i walked outside to start taking pictures and videos. i saw three red/orange lights in the sky at different heights. the lights moved from north west to north east. the three lights pulsated a red/orange glow. the light closest to west pulsated and descended while fading out until it was no longer visible. then the next light closest to west raised, and lowered itself to be at the same height as the light closest to east. when the two remaining lights were lined up, the light farthest west faded and descended until it disappeared seconds later. the last remaining light shortly after also faded and descended until it disappeared. the white blinking light remained underneath all of the pulsating red/orange lights during the entire time of the event, while moving back and forth from west to east. my father, mother and i were all very shocked. we were freaking out, what we saw was unbelievable. my mother kept asking \"did that just happen?\". my father said that in all his life, out of the 15 years he has been going into our back yard every night, he has never seen anything like this. we are still astonished. these lights were not airplanes, helicopters or any other type of familiar aircrafts. they were unidentified flying objects. they disappeared in the sky one after another. these were no aircrafts; they were ufos.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path

i neared the outskirts on the east-side of the city. as i continued east, the light did not deviate at all, which made me think that it could not be an airplane, as it did not do anything but get brighter and brighter. as i reached highway 1, i pulled over as the light continued to approach. i got out of my car, just as the light passed the highway, and saw what was behind it. it was a huge ship that was moving very slow as it came over the road. it stopped moving forward and then turned in my direction. it seemed to be at least 600 to 800 feet long. it passed over me, moving at about 5mph. the shape was very odd, as well. it was like a flat deck, with pontoon style on it's sides. there were octagon-like windows on the sides of the pontoon structures. these windows were bordered around with rivet-like bolts. i could see in the windows, but nothing appeared in them. all this time, there was no sound of engines or anything else coming from the craft. at no time, was the craft any higher then about 500 feet as it continued along. other cars had by now pulled over and people were outside of their cars, looking at this craft. the craft continued about a half mile from my position, then stopped, and turned again slowly and continued it's path to the west. even as it made it's way towards the city, people continued leaving their cars to look at it. it then approached the city of calgary and i lost sight of it. this craft was visible to me for approx. 20 minutes. i expected to read about it in the local newspapers in the next few days, but nothing was ever reported. i had to be at work in a local rural town, so i did not have the time to report it. the vision of the vehicle has never left my memory, and i can still see every part of it every time i close my eyes or even think of it. i know it has been 40 years, but i am hoping that maybe someone who was there might see this report and remember it as well as i do. i have never seen this shape listed in any peoples description before, but maybe someone else might recall this same shape. \r\n  ","distance":"101-500

12-26-15 and 12-28-15 those nights when i just laid down to go to sleep something out of the ordinary been happening to me twice the same exact experience. now as i'm trying to go to sleep this clear vivid vision takes over my mind set. mainly on the date 12-26-15 around 10:00pm! i just laid my head down and about 5 to 7 minutes in my rest state a clear vision took over where as i could not control what i was thinking. now what i'm about to tell is true to the best of my knowledge. this vision and not a dream was like i was looking out through something or somebody else's eyes. it looked like a screen or maybe a helmet i was looking outside of and it appeared that whom ever or what is was flying possible a vessel of some sort over a planet or a enormous rock. now the planet or rock had a reddish surface almost like the surface from the desert when the sun starts to go down during our summer months but more of a reddish color. the vision i was looking out of was flying just straight and below was hundreds of  thousands huge like insects creature mimicking spiders. now these insects or spiders creatures seemed to have six legs instead of eight legs like our spider species. the surface had a certain definitions and cracks in them that i can draw out if i could do it on my computer. the landscape also in the vision far ahead was a large like mountain almost like a volcano that erupted many years ago. i marc frazier open my eyes and the vision was still there i lifted my head up and tried looking around in my bedroom but i was still stuck in that vision all around me. i could not shake this what i was seeing! this seemed to have been going on for about 2 minutes and slowly faded away. but one thing for sure is that i was not dreaming this at all. i know the difference between a dream and what i seen on both of those days mainly on that monday(12-28-15). for the next few days i tried to go to sleep and think my way into the vision again if possible but i could not do it.I telling you this because the older i get the more things that i see clearly more than other people. but definitely those were huge like insects spider creatures their color was a darkish grey color they might have been the size of our elephants on this

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In the summer of 2004 my wife and i lived on a rented farm about 5 miles se of marshfield, wi. we were outside in the late afternoon feeding horses and showing a horse to a couple who stopped by. it was a dark, cloudy day and it looked like we were going to get a storm. clouds were very low and dark. all four of us were standing next to the barn, my wife and the couple facing me, me facing them (south). i was asked a question and mid sentence, during my reply, i saw a large metallic object very slowly emerge from a low cloud behind the three people i was talking to. i stopped mid-sentence while all three of them stared at me as to say \"well\". my wife gave me the embarrassed \"pay attention\" look. it came about 1/2 way out of the cloud, then reversed direction and very slowly slipped right back in and was then hidden by the cloud.\r\n\r\ni went back into where i left off with my sentence, then let them talk a minute or two while i digested what i had just seen. as soon as there was a short break in the conversation i told them that i had just seen a ufo, and of course, they all thought i was nuts. i don't think my wife thought i was a nut, but the couple that stopped by were not people i knew and they very much looked at me like i was crazy.\r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes later the conversation was still gong on, but this time my wife and the couple were the ones facing south, when all of a sudden all three of them said, there it is and pointed over my shoulder. by the time i turned around, it was already gone and had tucked back into the cloud. we all spent the next couple of minutes saying things like wow, that was weird and chuckling a bit. i am sure that since we did not all know each other, we all felt like keeping our thoughts to ourselves. i know my wife and i did. the couple left shortly after and my wife and i still talk about that day from time to time.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was disc shaped and looked to me a bit like brushed metal, no windows, doors, lights or anything other than a metallic disc. it made no noise, it moved very smoothly and deliberately. i used to work for an aerial photography company and i am always aware of elevation when i see something in the sky. this object could not have been more than 200 or 300 feet up and was very clearly visible to me. i knew instantly that this was not something ordinary.\r\n\r\nit left me with a very eerie, nervous feeling that i was not just being watched, but that at least for those few minutes i was being watched in some weird way and on some kind of level that i do not ever recall feeling before. even now, after all these years, i can still remember that eerie feeling....A bit like feeling invaded and certainly a feeling of helplessness if they wanted to do something to me.\r\n\r\nfor the life of us, we cannot figure out who it was that stopped by to look at the horses that night. my wife clearly remembers seeing the ufo and remembers not only my reaction to seeing it, but the couple's reaction as well. she has absolutely no memory of what the actual ufo looked like though, which she finds strange and confusing.\r\n\r\nto be honest, the idea of reporting a ufo never even crossed my mind. who would i ever report it to and why would i bother? the subject of our

enjoying the day. it was probably around 3 or 4pm est, sunny... but puffy clouds of different shapes and elevation. when i noticed this object, really far up... dipping below and above the cloud. it was so far up, but we both watched this object for about 2 minutes or so... before it rose above the cloud and didn't appear again. because of the elevation of this item, it was difficult to make out much detail at all. but after talking with my friend about the object, we decided it was triangle shaped.. and had possible lights of the orange spectrum (could of been just reflecting sunlight)... we couldn't make out the location of the lights on the object. but what caught our attention was the ability of this object to stay at the location in the sky and only rising and dropping above the cloud line in a stationary position. (though it is possible the cloud itself was what was making the object seem to rise and fall)and it just stayed stationary. the most astonishing thing is, you could tell it was metallic because of the reflection from the sun, a silver like color. i have ruled out satellites or known man made craft, just because of it's ability to hold it's position for a couple of minutes in the sky before rising above and out of sight. i live in a very rural area, where i can barely see my neighbors house in the distance.\r\nalso something that may be of interest,  hours away from my location is a base....  and often we have f-16's flying over head...  sometimes several at a time.  the ufo we seen stationary at the cloud line, and was much higher than the f-16's training flight

often do for occasions such as this rare one.  there is eug airport to the north and to the west of our location and an area called the 'wetlands' almost due west also from our location.  the wetlands are a preserved site critical for bird migration in this area, so there is always something to look for and see, and that is what i do when i look to the west.\r\n  i saw birds and watched closely and i could see the white tail feathers and head of something.  i was not sure what kind of large bird i was observing, but i called my wife to have a look, as she too is very interested in large birds.  as she, my wife, came to the window, i went for my dslr camera, and by the time i came back, she was outside watching what was an eagle coming towards us from the west and passed over near by and flew away in a southerly direction.  i commented, that if there is one, then there is another one, and speculated that we may see more later on.  that was at 10:25am according to the digital photo time stamp of captured images of that first single eagle sighting.\r\n  at 1:11pm later that same day, my wife was outside in the back patio when she called for me and bring the camera.  she had spotted two eagles approaching from the west as she looked over the roof of the house to the west.  i managed to capture several images of the pair of eagles as they flew towards us and again headed off in a southerly direction unknown due to being in the back of the house as the large birds were still further to the west from our location.\r\n  after watching the pair of eagles fly out of sight, we went back to what we had been doing before the activity with the eagle sightings.\r\n  i later that same day looked at the images i had captured with a dslr camera (nikon d3000), and looked closely at each photograph and noticed something in one of the frames.\r\n  an object, that appears to be oval in shape and white in color, with the possibility of a shadow, shows up in image dsc_3614 that depicts a pair of large birds in flight facing away from the camera.  one large bird on the left of the frame appears to be to the upper left of the frame and the second large bird appears to be to the lower

major railroad in the core of the city as usual you can hear all the traffic from the city sirens, traffic in general trains ect. off to the south east i could see what appeared to be a hot air balloon which is quite common during the summer months at this time of the morning. i looked away for what i thought was about a moment looked again and this object i thought was a balloon with so much closer whiched seems impossible as there was not much wind that day  and this got my attention the next thing i know i'm aware of all noise surrounding me went away in a very eerie dead calm & am now looking at this object just ahead & above me, so immense and distinctive i'm standing in awe! i had no feeling of being scared i'm just standing there stunned  looking at what can not be and the lack of any sound, not just from the object but any noise,  it's like i'm the only one in the world watching this, that part disturbs till this day as many people should have also seen!\r\n as for its description it was round in shape but definitely not smooth that had vertical huge panels which tapered off to a smaller  transition on both top and bottom, it did not move just hung in the air stationary. i remember thinking that a 747 would look like a kid's toy next to it in fact could very easily land on top of it. as i'm standing there dumbstruck and wondering where is everybody  else is , others should  be seeing this and when i turned away hoping others are witnessing  this, that is when it was  gone & all noise of the day returned. \r\n i have had a number of sightings of ufos over the years since the age of about 13 but nothing like this, did time stand still or was i in another dimension- don't  know.  i do however understand people who do not want to come forward, i have told just close family  and been so ridiculed \"oh yes randy your the choosen one ha ha\" or a girlfriend  who says she will leave  if  i continue,  btw i am now 56 yrs old.\r\n again  please  do not

field.  i could see it while i drove into the farm yard as it had just stopped and just hovered there.  i parked and went into our house and woke my dad and mom.  i asked if they wanted to see something strange as i was not really familiar with what it was.  my dad came out on the porch and we looked at it for awhile.  i went and got my binoculars and looked at this object.  it was very clear in the binoculars and was discredited shaped with a rim separating the top and bottom parts.  the top part had portholes spaced around it and looked larger than the bottom part.  a band separating these was slowly spinning going clockwise and you could see this motion very clearly.  after about 5 minutes it slowly started moving toward the east.  i asked dad should we follow it so we got in my car and started following it.  after about 5 miles it climbed higher about three times the height it had been.  it started to spin very fast in place until it just looked like a blinking light.  suddenly it sped off out of site leaving a red light like when you move a glow stick very fast.  the light it left was in a soft circle and it looked like it went very high or out of the
