i had stopped to look at the stars and i saw what seemed to be just a star although it was abnormally bright and shone blue. \r\n my husband was walking into the house when i realized it wasn't a star, i urged him over and he returned slowly whilst looking up to the sky; the blue light flew over head very slowly and the silhouette of the thing was barely visible, i thought it was a drone because the silhouette of it was t shaped, it passed over head and disappeared.\r\n\r\nsecond occurrence: \r\n\r\nmy husband awoke earlier than usual to get to work early and i was going in early with him, while i was getting ready for the day he went outside to take our dogs to the bathroom and felt the strange sensation of being watched, when he looked toward sthe direction he sensed the \"watching\" from he saw the blue light in the sky and it rocketed off abruptly leaving a blue tail streaking behind it and then it was gone all together. \r\nhe came in and told me, we were on edge however we got ready and started out journey to work. as the sun was coming up over the hills and we were chatting and talking there was a strange sound and before out eyes there was the same blue light and it streaked across the sky at supsonic speed leaving a faint trail of blue behind it as it rocketed towards the sun coming over the horizon. we were speechless. \r\n\r\nthird occurrence: \r\n\r\ni spent my day home off work and was doing chores, being goofy and watching movies with my mom and spending quality time with her, a nondescript day and nothing to cause alarm, however around 3 in the afternoon when we were in separate parts of the house i heard to me what sounded like thunder but while it happened i was looking out my window, it was breezy and cloudless sunny day. my mother thought it was a tornado, pretty common in our part of the country. my dogs were outside on their leashes so they could go potty and they were both freaking out, howling, whining, and running back and forth at the edge of their leashes. \r\n i ran outside to get them in case it was a tornado, i left the front door open as usual so my two dogs run inside, my big husky got away from my grasp and ran towards a huge mess in the driveway that was not there, he stopped at the edge of the driveway and glared into our forest, the hair was on edge on his back and he was growling. \r\n i ran over to grab him and saw the mess that was not there before, we had truck tires stacked that we needed to take over to the shop to get put on our vehicle and the tire was across the driveway next to the treeline and it was steaming, steaming like a cup of coffee steams right after you pour it. i grabbed him and rushed him inside, i could still hear the weird thundering sound surrounding our county, but then it went away. \r\n\r\nfourth occurrence: \r\n\r\ni went out with my parents for our weekly, evening bible study and came home with my parents, while our gate was opening i could see a silhouette standing by the backdoor of our house, i thougth it was my husband, he had decided to stay home because he was sick, i pointed at the silhouette and asked why my husband  was standing outside waiting for us, my mother saw saw it too and said she didn't know why, we came through the gate and went around the small corner of our driveway and the silhouette was gone. \r\n when we went inside i found my husband was asleep in our room, i asked him why he came outside and he replied that he had been asleep for 4 hours.\r\n so now i must further explain this last occurance, my husband is 6'3, he is a tall guy who is very muscular, however the following day when i was showing him where i saw the silhouette i got chill down my back as i realized whatever i saw was 2 feet taller than him and almost double his width in shoulder and arm shape. \r\n\r\n\r\nfifth occurrence: \r\non 1/1/16\r\nwe had a bbq with our family friends and the evening consisted of fireworks and bonfires, however after everyone left my husband was sitting at the kindling fire pit with our husky. i had gone inside because of a severe headache and he was alone. \r\nour dog was on edge my husband said, pacing and growling at the tree line beside out gate entrance to our ranch, he wandered off and would not return to his usual commands. \r\nmy husband used his typical, advanced-skill whistle for our husky, an abnormal sing-song sort of whistle that is very difficult to copy, as the dog came running back to my husband there was something by the gate, two acres away mimicked the whistle in its entirety. \r\nthe dog sat beside my husband and was deep guttural growling in the direction where out gate is; my husband whistled a complex whistle again, and it was mimicked back at him.\r\nmy husband rose from his seat to come inside and whistled at our dog to follow, and there was a third mimic of the whistle, only this time it was much louder. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":73560,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.7294431,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01022016-0009","longitude":-99.0702562,"occurred":1450310400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1451732062000,"summary":"A week of strange occurances, ufo in the sky following us, and then weirdness around our house.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":17,"maxtempi":63,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":8,"meantempi":46,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-2,"mintempi":28,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":17,"maxtempi":63,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":8,"meantempi":46,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-2,"mintempi":28,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"78003","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16,"locationName":"Bandera, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:93929"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Fortuna","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving home from work, around 11:00pm, 1-1-2016, then noticed a very bright orange/red ball of light in sky to the north west. first thought it was mars, but it was moving slowly, no trail, traveling north from a higher degree in the sky to a lower degree, then figured it must be a plane, but light was not blinking nor were there other colored lights like planes have. it continued in a northerly direction. stopped in store parking lot to get cell out to take pictures, one still zoomed and one short video but too far away for any details.  went in to shop, it was gone when i returned to my car.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":73559,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5843753,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01022016-0008","longitude":-124.1387303,"occurred":1451606400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1451718804000,"summary":"Orange/red flairlike ball moving north from higher to lower in the sky.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/73559_submitter_file1__20160101225909.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"95540","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Fortuna, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:93930"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Basingstoke","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My partner was leaving the house for work and i was kissing him goodbye at the door when he looked up to his right and said \"no way\" i looked out and saw a massive saucer shaped craft hovering in the air stationary emanating white light from the centre of its circumference in sequence from windows;

westward trajectory. it very bright and of an orangish/golden hue. i had first assumed it to be a new year's eve firework of some sort, but it continued for several minutes, moving across the clear sky in a huge arc. when the light had reached directly east of my location, it dropped back in a half circle, slowing slightly, before  rising very high into the sky. i was craning my neck to look up at the object, which had risen to approximately 75 degrees from the horizon. it then hovered, perfectly still, the golden light unblinking, for nearly two minutes before the light dimmed to a faint

wind. on the way back to the emergency room i took a drink of soda as i walked between two buildings.  as i did this i noticed a huge v-shaped craft flying very slowly over me in a northerly direction.  it was a completely silent craft with a dull black and smooth exterior surface.  there were no rivets, windows, or panels that i could see.  the craft had 5 large, dimly lit, and round lights as i would initially think they were. there was one at the nose of the craft and two on each of the arms that formed the \"v\" of the craft.  the lit areas were almost as wide as the craft and i could see the stars and sky through them.  they were however not a constant lit area because they shimmered like a mirage does on a hot asphalt road.  that is when i thought they must be the propulsion devices of the craft.  the craft moved approximately 40-60 mph and i'm glad it did because it gave me more time to view it.  as i came out of the area between the two buildings, and into an open parking lot i noticed a security officer and called to him to look up.  he began cursing over and over until i had to tell him to shut up because i wanted to see if i could actually hear the propulsion device or any other sound the craft made.  nothing, not a sound, no wind, no heat, no magnetism, nothing.  the craft headed towards the vertical face of a mountain behind the place i work.  i thought to myself \"it's going to crash into the mountain\".  that's when it disappeared, blinked out, gone.  i do not remember how i got back inside the building of my job.  this incident has

the driveway, my daughter exclaimed 'what's that?!' i looked up and saw an orange light in the sky flying from left to right, on a steady path. it was closer than a satellite would be, so i said it was probably an airplane. we watched it for a few minutes and got into the truck. then i kept watching it, because an airplane doesn't look so bright, nor does it look orange. at least, none that i've ever seen. i tried taping it with my cell phone. of course it looks a bazillion times smaller on my cell than it did with us just looking directly at it. as it flew by initially, it seemed higher in the sky. but as time went by, it seemed to be larger in appearance. like it was getting closer to the ground? even though it was still quite high in the sky. then suddenly it looked as though a flame was coming off of it, or under it. or a reflection of light was coming off of it? i can't explain it the way i saw it... and unfortunately my video doesn't do it justice. not one bit. i have no idea what it was. anyway, all of a sudden it stopped and just kinda sat motionless in the sky. then it started backtracking its 'flight path'. i thought that was kinda weird. it was too bright to be a helicopter. and planes don't do that. we don't have a military base nearby or anything weird like that around. it was a bit unsettling so i kinda grabbed my kids and we ran back into my parents home. kinda silly. i know. we stayed in there for a minute or so and went back outside and it was nowhere in sight. so we took off towards home (which would be in the 'left' direction from their place. as we left the neighbourhood and got onto the main road, my daughter claims she saw it on my side of the vehicle, tree-height, maybe 5 houses length away from the main road.  my parents live in a fairly wooded area on the slight outskirts of town. now, i can't confirm that sighting since i didn't see it myself. i dunno if i'm wasting anyone's time with this, but someone told me to report this to mufon and see if someone could enhance my video and picture, to see if they can see anything of value. i'm not sure it's possible, but it can't hurt- right?? anyway thanks for your time!

(this would possibly place the lights a few miles east / northeast of birmingham, al since we are located roughly 15 miles northeast of the city.\r\n\r\nwhen i noticed the lights, they drew my attention because they were much larger and brighter than any stars showing in the sky at the time.  the color of each light was also different than a star, appearing to be either a yellow/orange or orange color.  initially i believed it could possibly be some type of lanterns in the sky based on color and the time of the year (new years), but they stayed in that same tight triangle formation without wavering (like the lights were connected).  it also appeared that the triangle formation was rotating (the upper two lights appeared to rotate clockwise with the left light moving further away, all while maintaining the triangle formation.  i assume it is very possible that we had 3 lanterns tethered together forming a triangle, but with so many triangle formations reported over the years, i thought this worth a look and was very odd..  i have never seen anything like this in person before.\r\n\r\nduring the time i viewed it, the three lights moved very slowly east, and as i mentioned above, the formation appeared to be slowly rotating.  picture any triangle shape rotating slowly in a three dimensional space, with all corners staying at a consistent distance, and this is what i saw.  it appeared as though the upper left corner/light rotated away from me because of the shape changes of the formation, and the way that corner/light appeared to go a bit dimmer than the others when the shape changed. (you can see this in the last few pictures taken).\r\n\r\nfeelings while seeing the object was i guess complete surprise.  i have witnessed some fairly odd things in the sky over the years that may or may not have an explanation (could have been satellites, etc), but this was definitely something i have never seen before with my own eyes.  seen it on tv and other reports/videos from around the world, but never in person.  i'm still a bit in shock from what i saw.\r\n\r\nthe sighting lasted roughly 3-4 minutes probably, with the shape disappearing behind some fast moving clouds moving in from the south / southwest.  after the clouds moved in, i haven't seen anything else in the sky.  i was able to capture 11 pictures using my iphone 6, rear camera (sorry the quality isn't better, but phones don't take very good night sky pictures..)\r\n\r\nthis was also witnessed by my wife, mother, and daughter.  all viewed from the side of our front porch.","distance":"Over One

the object was higher in the sky well above the trees but i perceived it to be only feet above the road at treetop level of just below treetop level. we drove directly under the glowing area of the object and i looked at it carefully as i slowed the car. the glowing portion of the object was very obscured and displaying multiple colors. i think the best way to describe it would be as if you were looking through a lens shrouded in a mist which refracted the light into a rainbow of colors. my observation was that i perceived an appendage or mast that protruded from this area of the object and i believe it was generating the mist that shrouded the rest of the object, there looked to be a lot going on with changing shapes, patterns and colors. again i believe the object was only 20 to 30 feet above us at this time. i pulled our car into cherrywood dr. and my son and i exited to get a better look however the object was gone. my wife at this time expressed concern that a man on the sidewalk

of the neighbors fireworks and also noticed flashes of light to the northeast as if more fireworks were being set off. was watching in this area when i noticed a yellow-white object, with yellow-orange perimeter come into view beyond the corner of the house near a pine tree. it was just there! my first impression was a fireworks mortar that had been fired in a northerly direction. instead of exploding it got brighter as if it was an aircraft landing light making a coarse correction for an approach to geiger airport to the west of spokane. in relation to the pine tree it hadn't moved much from where i had first seen it. then it made a clock-wise hook to the north, which gave me the impression it could be a helicopter. but, then it just faded like a dimmer switch being turned down, leaving a dull gray light like a bulb on a dimmer switch, but it still had the yellow-orange perimeter. then it just faded out. i was still watching the area, wondering what had just happened, when i noticed what looked like a strobe at great distance in that it was very dim, in the same area. i mentioned to my wife what i had just seen, that the light had just disappeared. i continued to watch the area and observed the strobing light three or four more times when the light came back, again like a dimmer switch had been turned on, after about 30 sec. the impression it gave me was of a helicopter turning on its axis or possibly a quad drone doing the same. it stayed stationary for about another 30 sec. so i called my wife over to see. we watched it together for another 30 sec.Commenting on how odd it was behaving and the odd color as it was not the color of an aircraft landing light nor as bright.10 or 15 sec. later another similar light appeared below and behind the first light. they both stayed stationary for another 10 to 15 seconds then started moving in a southwesterly direction. at this point i stepped outside to see if i could hear anything, but all that i could hear was the fireworks. i thought with the proximity of the lights, if it was helicopters i should have heard the rotors but again all that i could hear was the fireworks. as they were moving southwest across the peak of the house i lost sight of them near the spruce tree in front of the house. i went back inside and went out the front door hoping to see them again. i briefly saw the trailing light before it went behind the spruce. i went back inside to the west windows but could not see the lights again as the west neighbors trees were in the way. again,no aircraft sound as they

gatineau/ottawa around 0:15 on jan. 1st local time. saw what i thought was jet fighters with afterburner (could explain speed and brigthness/color even through clouds. i'm used to planes landing here and it didn't look like a typical landing path, or a typical plane with lights on. three bright orange lights traveling fairly quickly (vs typical planes) one after the other with maybe 30 secs/1 mins seperation between then following the same path. was able to see all three at one moment. coming from the west, going east/southeast. consistant speed, maybe twice or three time as fast as typical planes assuming same altitude. the fact thatvit was noiseless was the first hint that it wasn't your typical airliner. i've seen many planes using the same flight path before and it was completely different. very bright through clouds and too fast without noise are the only indications that it wasn't a typical plane. assuming rockets or jet fighters but can't explain some factors.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
