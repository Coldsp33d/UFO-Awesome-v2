riverside ave overlooking downtown and most of san marco. at around 10pm est, we noticed three bright red/orange orbs fly just over san marco from south to north, following the river. the objects flew by one by one on the exact same path and altitude about 1 minute apart for each orb. they disappeared at the same exact spot, right directly in front of us. the objects appeared to be probably about 1000-1500 feet msl and varied their speed and path with each one following the same path each time. these orbs originated from behind our vantage point from around the lakewood area and followed the south bank or the st. john's river. \r\n\r\nfast forward to just after the midnight new years eve fireworks downtown, we saw the same three red/orange orbs pop up in san marco, around the public school building area. they were about a minute apart. the first one flew up and over the river to the north, then hovered, then descended, then hovered and then flew back towards the south and then started to ascend again and then slowly moved back towards the north while ascending then the orb appeared to move towards the east and put towards the arlington area (which is confirmed by another sighting that was reported on mufon by a couple in arlington). then as the first odd was making its was up and towards the east, another one appeared from the same area in san marco and did almost the same thing, but didn't change directions as much and slowly rose up to the northeast and then to the east towards arlington. at about this time, the first orb disappears in the sky. then, about a minute later, a third orb appeared in the sky and followed almost the same path. at about this point, the second orb disappeared way up in the sky to the east. the third orb eventually disappeared toward the east just as the other orbs had. then, about 15 minutes later, a fourth orb suddenly appears over san marco and changed directions a few times and hovered, got really bright then dim and

than the other orbs. \r\n\r\nthese orbs have been seen in the same area several nights before as well. two night ago, we saw a red/orange orb hover over the main street bridge area for several minutes. the orb flew very fast from side to side up and down but was perfectly controlled and was very fast. at one point, the orb flew in front of the main street bridge so i could tell it was between my vantage point and the bridge. it stayed in the area for about 10 minutes and then disappeared.

valley, it had rows of white lighted windows. i decided to get a better look at it so i walked to a curve in the road that was open and had few trees. as i reached the curve there was a man shaped vessel . it had a head it had arms and legs, the torso was shaped like an oil drum. the arms were gripping branches of the tree, the head had an open mouth, i could see inside of it, there were 3 small figures the light of the interior illuminated their bodies and faces.(yellow)there were circular ladders that surrounded the inside of the head structure. the figures were using a manipulator to grab limbs. they pulled them inside the vessels head, i could hear the branches breaking and snapping, the figures were harvesting the buds that were just emerging. it was a maple tree a norway maple. there was the smell of fish ether. i had a prior encounter two months earlier so i wanted a chance to understand the technology of the vehicle(s). so i stood there on the road looking intently at this harvester for at least 5 minutes, they stripped the upper limb tips in that short time. the vessel slowly floated away as if on the breeze sounds came from the interior from the figures and their tools, but the vessel made no sound at, it was silent. i couldn't follow because of mountain terrain, i was so elated by this encounter i was astonished by the human like structure of the vehicle, its arms were very mechanical and looked much like steel tubes with hydraulic lines and rams attached to them. there were green lights flying around the valley one of them was easy to follow after, it was over a cow field. i entered the field to follow the green light. it quickly disappeared into the woods at the top of the field. i looked up there was moonlight, i noticed two small vessels that were balloon like structures they seemed to be made of cloth. they were illuminated from within, they floated on helium i think, they were moving against the wind, they followed me for 15 minutes as i walked up the hill to the edge of the woods . one of the balloons looked like a stingray it was shaped and colored to mimic a stingray. they floated overhead and disappeared over the hill that i was climbing. i was attempting to retro engineer what i was seeing. these encounters lasted just over an hour. i returned home excited about seeing the figures with their elongated skulls. the obvious display of mechanical structure intrigued me deeply to get even closer. after making it home i made some drawings of the harvester to try and figure out how it worked. i went to bed for the night. in my sleep i was awakened by a grey. his big eyed environment suit was off. he was about 4 feet tall, he had gold colored eyes, the same size as our eyes, at once he said blue streak and pointed, i saw the blue streak, it was a proton or something, in the air, it lit up then went out . the grey gave me a tour of the vessel they were in. the fuel cells they use look like blackberries, they are power balls, also known as a screaming weenie, the machine that filled them looks like an octopus or a squid, the tentacles are suction cup check valves. when filled the fuel cells move around on their own with the force of fluid tension. he took me to a place in the vessel where there is little gravity, there, the mantis men do their work. they taught me how to build a runaway magnet motor that generates electricity. it is a ball and socket  arrangement or magnets with the opposing poles forced together. the ball inside of the socket housing spun ay screaming speeds, a contactor touched the ball sparks were present at the contact point, the grey said white streak, and we all saw the white streak, without their spacesuits they look just like us but have elongated skulls and a greyish color to the skin, they have no head hair. we shared a volley of puns and an idiom. it was a lesson in the path of the prophet. they allowed me to watch a sodium peroxide thruster test. this is when i realized that the vessel i was on was huge, over one mile wide and thousands of feet tall, after the test i have a lapse of memory , i just remember sitting up in bed, with the vivid recognition of what had just occurred. i made drawings of these things at that moment. the magnet motor had gyro.Flywheels inside of it to sustain or help sustain magnetic flip, i have spent many hours trying to design one based on what i learned about theirs. after this occurrence, i managed to make progress on something important i managed to crack the bible code, this led to an increase in my understanding

following christmas in florida with our children and their families.  we departed seatac airport for home which is about 100 miles away near leavenworth, wa.  we needed gas so we stopped at about 8:00 pm in woodinville, wa just off of hwy 522.  while i was getting gas and my wife was in the car i noticed three orange orbs/lights moving from north to south and approximately over hwy 522. i think the movement of the lights is what drew my attention to them.  at first i thought they were airliners lined up on final for landing at seatac airport which is about 25 miles to the south of our location.  i also considered the idea they were flares launched from military aircraft but realized the military, navy, wouldn't do that over populated areas.  furthermore, there is no military training areas there due to commercial air traffic.  i looked closely at the lights as they drew near me and saw the lights were definitely orange with no hint of the lights being aircraft position lights.  the fact that the lights faded away and didn't continue in a straight line towards seatac airport also convinced me they weren't aircraft.  there was no clouds or fog in the area obscuring my view of the lights at any time. they were maybe 2000 agl and flying slow as the video shows.  the orbs moved behind a leafless tree that was near my location which caused them to disappear momentarily as a branch blocked the view.  when they were in the area where the tree blocked the view of the lights they would individually fade away leaving a black night sky. two of the lights turned to the west before they faded away.  the sky was clear and stars were visible.  all total we saw six orbs but could only see three at a time as the trailing orbs were below the horizon.  about the time the lead orb would fade away a third trailing orb would come into view.  the video concludes when all the orbs have faded away.  in the video you hear my wife talk about the tree and that she thought they were aircraft.  you can hear me talking and saying they aren't aircraft as aircraft position lights are red or green with white strobes or flashing beacons.  i'm a retired commercial pilot as of only a year ago although i still fly privately.  my wife has since changed her opinion as to them being aircraft and now feels they are ufo's of some sort.  i knew i was looking at something strange that night and thought they were ufo's.  i've heard people talk about lights like this on the coast to coast radio show hosted by george noory. since my wife listens to the radio show with me when we are driving she wasn't shocked but found the lights interesting, especially the fact the lights were equally spaced apart and disappeared into thin air.  in my 36 years plus working as a pilot i've never seen a ufo or strange lights like the ones i saw last night.  of note:  when i first started refueling a saw a helicopter about 1/2 east of me.  when we finished filming the orange orbs i pointed out

flickering and fading out.  there were no clouds in the sky, it was clear and cold and you could see every star, but it dissapeared completely as it neared the moon.\r\n\r\nwe both agreed immediately

remember a feeling to the air, like a crackle with no sound. about half way to the light, i said, \"it's just a truck parked at the side of the road.\" we looked at a truck sitting silently with it's

Bay","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This sighting was in the late fall early winter of 1974 i believe. i would have been 11 years old at the time , i am know 52, 3 friends and i were playing hockey on a homemade rink in our friends backyard. it was a cold and clear, crisp evening. it was quite dark as well. the rink was located directly behind my backyard. as kids at the time we were skating and playing on the small rink when one of my closest friends had said, hey whats that? we looked to the direction he was pointing and it was toward mount mckay which is approximately a 1,000 ft plus ancient shale mountain that is visible throughout the city. we lived only about 3 or so miles from it so the view was excellent.So what we all witnessed was bright deep red rectangular lights going around an oval pattern, fairly rapidly in sequence. when the lights went around the back they would disappear briefly and reappear on the front view able area again. the shape the lights went around on and off in sequence was oval disc like. we could not see the object, just the lights encircling it, in what appeared to be in the center circumference of it.As kids of that age we did not know what it was or even think of the word ufo.We did not know anything about that stuff back then. the lights appeared digital and very precise in speed. this object was positioned on the left of the mountain which seemed to cover approx 1/3 of the mountain top. mt. mckay was quite untouched and still is to this day mostly.It sits on indian land and it has maple syrup trees, and a small ski area which is not at this location of the sighting. some people used to say that it is skiers torches but that is not the situation here  this was something large ,and appeared intelligently controlled, since we did not have that type of technology then, especially that big.\r\n\r\nthe other thing that is interesting is that area had the city's drinking water supply from loch lommand which in the 70's was considered to be one of the best drinking waters of its time.Whether that is relevant or not is unknown. so while we watched these lights going around the object my friends gave up and started playing hockey again. i remained in the middle of the ice still staring at this thing in amazement. my friends told me to move or start playing which i did. i then looked up again less that 2-3 minutes later and it was gone. we did not see it leave. the next day there were supposed reports to the radio station and so on from numerous people. we talked about it at school the next day.Apparently some witnesses seen the object take off rapidly into the night sky. nothing ever became of what we saw, or at least as far as i know.\r\n\r\n i never thought about it at all for many years until one evening in my early 30's there was a show on tv called town meeting from seattle. they were talking about ufo sightings. a person on the show reported seeing a craft with red sequential lights very similar to what we saw in the mid 70's as well. after watching that it brought me right back to that evening where we saw what we did.\r\n\r\n to this day i have almost been haunted by it when i think about it and wish i would have watched it until it took off. i went back to my hometown 8 years ago and went to the library with my son to try and locate a newspaper clipping about the sighting. i spent around 2 hours and gave up due to time constraint which was disappointing that i could not locate anything. i still believe there is a record of it there or somewhere. i have told many people about this experience since, and stood at the base of the mountain from a distance and got big goosebumps.It is still to this day quite haunting , the thought of who and what it was we saw, which i know was a large disc shaped object.\r\n\r\n this is an absolutely true event which i have shared with stanton friedman by writing to him and now mufon which i should have a lot sooner! i want to ask if this type of craft with these similar lights have been reported to mufon especially from the 70's around mid north america?\r\n\r\n to this day since i have been an avid ufo buff and have seen most shows from back to sightings that was on fox i believe all the way to mostly everything to date they have aired in my area to date since the 90's. i rarely hear or see any stories reporting the red sequential lights we saw though, which i find odd.\r\n\r\n i have had 3 more different sightings since that time 2 orbs,a black triangle, and something high up like a satellite but upon further observation i watched it change direction and proceed in an opposite direction. it is mainly due to my dedication to amateur astronomy & stargazing with high powered binoculars i have had for many years.\r\n \r\nthanks for allowing me to share my experience.I hope the picture of the mountain turns out adequate.If not i retrieved it from the net.","distance":"Over One

my attention. my first thought was maybe it was a drone, but as i got closer and came to a stop i could see that it was rather large(4ft or so) and much too fast and erratic in its flight to be any drone easily available for public. then as the train started to pass another object, similar in flight characteristics but different in design (this one had appendges). they seemed to interact almost playfully hovering and almost touching while the train passed, during this time i got several pictures. as the train was gone (a few min.) they each shot off in different directions rather quickly and abruptly. a block away i pulled in to the lot where i waited for my girlfriend i noticed one of the objects hovering about 100+ft in the air near me with a solid light . the past month have made me a serious believer in ufo phenomena as there has beein increasing intensity of sightings so i wasnt totally freaked out but this was the closest i have gotten and documented.Later that night i got up to use the bathroom and noticed a large very bright apparition through my window about 75ft in the air, it hovered for around 5 minutes and slowly moved out of sight in a linear path. i took photos of
