saw the 5 orbs form the pyramid or triangle shape.  he yelled for us and as i got to the door i saw them leave it and form a straight line vertical to the horizon..They moved so fast it was unbelievable in ways i've seen no aircraft do. then 3 just simply vanished.. by then i was getting my phone camera out. i think we were just all in such shock it took a minute. i took a couple of photos as they took off at lightening fast speed straight off. i took a couple of snapshots and some 4k video that is way to big to upload. not the greatest video because i didn't start it until late in. my 7 kids (21,18,16,13,10,7,and 4), my dad, my brother and i were all talking about the whole darn that hung and my kids were so excited i had to tell them to cut it out. so that we could see if there was any sound, but it was silent except for the passing trucks at the 123 bypass a few miles away. on a still night like that we can hear a helicopter for many many miles but these didn't move or look, or even sound anything like one of those. we see those around a lot so we do know what that would look like even a at night. i'll be glad to pass it on the 4k video the file is huge though and i only got the tail end with 2 of them. when i zoomed in on the one it looked triangular and flashed white and red it seemed. the clouds that night were everywhere. it was by happenstance that it was open long enough to see it. \r\n\r\nlater in that same evening when amother brief window opened my brother called me (they live about 22 miles from us)and asked me if i could go out and see any light since he was seeing something very odd anything his house. another light behind the clouds brighter than  the moon in that same vacinity, and some odd green strowning was all i saw before the clouds moved back to fully block anything at all. sorry if this runs on it is late and i'm only reporting it because my brother said i should do it. i did try to upload the video but it is to large for my phone to handle uploading apparently!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

apartment complex parking lot, when i noticed a bright orangey-red star-like light in the sky. at first i assumed it was a plane due to how bright the light was, but it was unmoving, pulsating, and the orange color didn't look like the typical red and green seen on everyday aircraft/drones.\r\n\r\nas we continued to drive into the parking lot, i kept watching it. the light began to move slowly, across the sky towards us. i told my friend to stop the car, and we watched it carefully. we were both confused as to what it was because it didn't really seem like a plane or drone (despite us living near a small airport). \r\n\r\nit finally reached a spot almost literally right above us underneath some clouds that were illuminated by nearby city lights, and both of us saw a distinct round/disc shaped object. the light we saw was actually rotating around the edge of the disk shape. the object continued to move behind us and was eventually obstructed by the treeline. the object moved no faster than 10mph, and was completely silent.\r\n\r\nhaving witnessed odd lights in the sky before, and just chalking it up to drones or satellites, this was the first time i'd ever seen something that distinct, and the fact my friend saw it as well reassured me i wasn't coming to an entirely wrong conclusion. neither of us felt particularly scared or alarmed, it was a very confusing, almost

incredibly bright lights moving towards my direction. lights were moving parallel to highway 31 from the north towards the south. object was moving so slow and lights were so bright it made me stop instantly in my tracks.Could not see the body of the craft but could tell it was large and was curious of how it was moving so slow without falling.\r\n\r\nthe three bright lights/object were heading behind the roof tops of the homes to my left so i went and got into the van, pointing north, waiting for it to reappear on my side of roof tops. well, that took a tiny bit longer then expected, it either slowed down more or stopped for a brief second but finally crossed over the roof tops back into view. \r\n\r\nonce the object was in my sight again i could start to see the bottom of the object and it started making a banked turn..... yes banked. looking at the bottom of the object was a complete surprise, it was totally lit up with multiple large bright lights, and i could see a perfect triangular outline of the object. i will try to attach some drawings with this report, if they scan properly. funny thing is while coming at me i saw no outline at all. color of the large lights were incredibly bright white and the smaller ones were incredibly bright red.\r\n\r\nnow the object is moving west, slightly southwest, pretty much at the same pace as it was originally, which was still very slow. looking at it from behind it had a rectangular shape, to guess, i would go with around 15-20 feet thick. there was two lit up areas in red that were rectangular in shape to the right and left of the center rear end of object. craft continued off to the west actually towards my girlfriends work, which made me snap out of it, jumped in the van and followed it towards her job till it went out of sight beyond the skyline. someone else had to see this thing fly over our town, i had yet stopped to ask an officer if there was any reports, or mentioned myself. crazy thing is my phone was laying on center arm of van and i never thought to grab it for a video, was kinda froze and amazed. takes lousy videos anyhow, like most others you see but it definitely would have caught lights on the bottom.\r\n\r\neverything about that craft looked from out of this world, my question to myself was the banked turn?? that did come across to me as man made. moving so slow anything man made would have fell out of the sky and made some kind of sound. the lights were so huge the weight alone if man made would have taken incredible power to lift causing sound (plus its just the way they appeared). drones that may not make noise could not carry that weight, plus there was a solid dark surface that was strange, darker then the night sky around object. have not seen or heard any other reports of this since it happened, would appreciate if anyone else seen this? to say something to what they may have seen. another thing most man made lights cast a beam, like a deer spotlight, these did not and they were huge and bright. thanks for your time. this is my second sighting in this area, or ever, first one in august and yes other people i met around here have been seeing unexplained lights in the sky themselves. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s),
