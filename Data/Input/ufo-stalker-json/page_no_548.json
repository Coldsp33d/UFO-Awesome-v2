because it was still dark but moonlight would light the top of the tree line, so i got to where i thought the light was and i got out of the car and looked up over the trees and there was a craft roughly the size of an airliner.\r\nit was silent and had wings in a steel look bent back and down but bird like with a body that looked kind of like the egyptian needle with hieroglyphics running down the body and a pointed front.\r\nwhen i realized this was not anything i knew i panicked and my heart was pounding out of my chest then i jumped into my car and drove away as fast as i could and never looked back.\r\nwhen arriving to my sore that i worked at i called my mom and told me to call the police and i called the local police department and they said they have had calls and would make a report.\r\nsince this took place such along time ago i'm not exactly sure what month or year, but it is my best guess i was 19 or 20 and i'm 60 now.\r\ni told my family and some friends at the time

9:45 in the evening, when we spotted an orange red object that was maybe five miles east and south of our location. we watched it moving in what looked to us like a search pattern, and it was moving slowly,  changing directions and altitude multiple times. when it was north and east of our location, it appeared to 'pull the light cloud cover around it'  cloaking itself from our sight. it wasn't even a minute later, that two more of these objects appeared, also south east of us. these looked like they were duplicating the pattern and altitudes of the first one. here was a slight difference, the two paused several times as they were going north. when they reached the area here the firste one vanished, they moved upward into the clouds right where the first one had gone. we could still see three faint red/orange points of light in the clouds, then all three winked out like a light switch being thrown. it's not the first time we have been outside at night enjoying the air and seen glowing spherical balls of light south east of us. the ones we saw during the summer months stayed south of us, and moved east to west, then shot straight up. there was no sound, that we could hear while these objects were moving around where we could see them. we plan to get a digital camera, so that we can get poof, our friends think we are nuts, but we know what we have seen more than once.\r\n\r\n    we plan to keep our eyes open and skywards, becase it is exciting to spot one of these red/orange spheres, then see it do something amazing (like take off at extreamly high speed, or

some of their machine function on static electrical sound wave vibrations that exibit a forward crawling vibration wave pattern. this was confounding because nikola tesla made a similar discovery.

scanned the contents of my study room it was a column of red and blue lights the size of a pin head. it looked at every thing that was related to the bible codec cyphers that i had obtained. the book

green light in the distance.  we continually watched the light because of the color.  as we got near the outlet mall, the light became 4 distinct bluish green lights in a horizontal line.  i thought it was a communication tower because it did not move.  as we approached the where hwy 53 crossed 400, i could see that the lights were too high to be a communication tower.  i then got excited because i thought it might be a blimp.  after about another 2 to 3 miles, we saw the object off to the right.  it was not 4 lights but two sets of 4 lights that formed a \"v\" shape.  i pulled off the highway at a clearing.  we watched the triangular object for about 1 or 2 minutes then it rotated about 90 degrees and moved towards us.  as it moved over us we could see every detail of the object.  it was a dark black or gray metallic object.  it had a smooth surface on the bottom with a reddish pipe like tube around the bottom.  there was a round portal like thing in the center like on a submarine.  on two sides there were chambers like a large ship has. i could see depth, but i could not determine how thick the object was.  the object moved towards cumming, ga.  this event took around 5 minutes from the time it rotated and started moving.  two days later i noticed a blister like bump on the end of my nose that bleed when i washed my face.  i didn't think much about it until the friend that was with me said the same thing happened to him.  this scared me because i thought of radiation poisoning.  a few days later the blister was gone.  i have no doubt that what i saw was not from this earth.  it would take antigravity to hover something that large that made no noise or had not wings or rockets.  recently the other person that was with me passed away.  i will go to my grave

coconut creek, florida.  i had to pick up my friend \"d\". we arrived at school and hurriedly walked up the very long side walk until half way and i noticed a very bright light in the sky. i told my friend \"d\" to look up and check it out. we stopped and stared at this bright light which was covered by clouds and it was not moving. it just hovered over the school. i started getting worried that maybe this thing was going to beam us up or something so i told my friend lets go. we continued on walking with our heads looking up the rest of the way until we reached the doors of the school. all of a sudden the door opened and my teacher grabbed my arm and said your late, i said look up in the sky and just then it disappeared. he saw it. we kept talking about it for awhile and then began our day when someone from upstairs called down to our classroom and asked if anyone had seen this glowing bright object hovering over the school. \"d\" and i said yes we saw it when walking up the walkway. we called the newspaper and they came out to the school to investigate and the whole school went out to the fields behind the school looking for any proof. after searching for about 15 minutes they found or so they say they found ( i think they planted it there) a weather balloon and that was the object that the school had seen. i don't think so, it was too bright to be some stupid weather balloon. i'm just glad that my friend and myself did not get taken or hurt. what i can't believe is that they tried making the whole school look stupid by saying it was a weather balloon.\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]\r\n\r\ni'm sorry i have no pictures from the 70s. we didn't have cell phones back then. i do think that you can find the newspaper article in the newspaper of broward

outside into the front yard looking to the sky, we kept walking toward the sidewalk looking up, it was daylight but close to dusk when we saw it hovering over our house the house next door and the driveway between them. it was round and it had large round pulsating lights around the whole bottom of it. we were froze but not frightened, i don't know how long we stood there, i don't believe we were  talking at all while we were staring at it. then it made no sound and lifted straight up into the air. we stood there and stared at each other for what seemed like several minutes after ward

nothing.\r\nwe never reported it, i was only in 7th grade but my mother and i talked about it on and off for the rest of her life because i just wanted to reconfirmed that i had seen what i'd seen and

good friday. about 7:00p. there had been these strange mamatized clouds in the sky all day long proceeding the sighting. i've never seen clouds like this above norman before or since then. and i had lived here 25 years before this. it was warm, and mom wanted to walk around the yard and talk as she often enjoyed doing. there was strange silent cloud to cloud lightning going on by now. it was just about to be dark,twilight. but still plenty of light to see the object. when there was a flash of lightning directly over head, it made no sound but something made me look up in the direction of it. this is when i first saw it, it was a flat black, boomerang shaped object. it was completely featureless, no lights, and completely silent. in fact when it flew over, things suddenly became extra quiet, no birds, no wind, nothing. and i new from the vary first moment i saw it that i was having an authentic sighting. this area is in the middle of a residential area. what was it doing here? is what i remember thinking. i saw it for about 45 seconds as it flew over moms house going from n.E.E. to s.W.W. it was shaped like a boomerang but it was pointing to the s.E.E.In opposition to the direction of flight. it was about 45 seconds before i could get mom to see it. but when she did she exclaimed, what is that. she does not like to talk about it, but she saw the object for about 45 seconds before it flew out of sight. it was about 125 ft. high or skirting the bottom of the clouds. i have no pictures but could draw the object. the total time of the sighting took about 1min. 15 seconds. i saw the object the whole time, mom only saw the object for about 45 seconds.

at the south side of my home. on top of the mountain, i see eight white lights gathering to form a circle. they sit for about 5 seconds in a circle, then by the speed of light, two lights go south, two lights go east, two lights go west, and then two lights in a very slow speed go north in alignment. as i watch they continue going north until they reach the mountain area north of us. at this point it stops. the light in the front beams a light down, in which it was so bright that i could see the light threw all the trees, about a quarter mile distant. months later i encounter my new neighbor, in which lives about a quarter mile up the road. she states to me \"did you see that white light a few months ago?\" i replied \"what do you mean\". wanting to be sure that she was talking about the same thing i was, and i didn't go making a fool of myself. she then went into description, in which was what i saw. she stated, \"it was very close to our house\". boy did she feel relieved
