highly trained/experienced in observation. i was dropping off my dad following a road trip back from a wedding. i was driving my vehicle southbound on main street in manchester. just before (~250 feet) the onramp to i-384 east, i noticed what i initially thought was an airplane flying over my position northbound directly above main street. it seemed to be extremely low to the ground for an airplane considering the lack of proximity to an airport, and was flying very slowly. the speed-altitude abnormality and strangely positioned lights prompted me to stop my car in the middle of the road and get out (the road was devoid of other vehicles). i looked up at the airplane in awe for 1-2 minutes. it was hovering/flying in a constant path at a constant speed and altitude in complete silence. upon closer observation, there was a triangle shaped, completely blacked out aircraft with three yellow-white lights equidistant apart from each other close to the corners of the triangle. directly underneath the triangular aircraft was the image of a 747 (i believe) airplane. it appeared to be a real object except for how low and slowly it was flying. it remained directly below the triangle-shaped craft and did not waver at all from this position as if they were moving in complete unison or even attached to one another... based on the perceived size of the image of the airplane, i would guess that the aircraft was at approximately 500 feet altitude. based on that altitude, i would guess that it was flying at approximately 25 knots (~30mph). if the craft was larger than i perceived it, it may have been much higher in altitude and faster in speed, but the image of the airplane would have been way out of scale if that was the case. i stood in awe and just watched the craft pass overhead on the same trajectory, trying to make sense of what i was looking at. i would have filmed the whole event but my cell phone was dead at the time from the long road trip. i served 8 years in the marine corps as a scout sniper, 2 years of which i served as a combat instructor with the air force. i served on three combat tours and am extensively trained and experienced working with different types of aircrafts from many different countries and i have never in my life seen anything like this. you may feel free to contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss the event further.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

singer's parents farm, just outside kansas city, ks. the guitar player, keyboard player, and myself went outside for a smoke break at around 8pm when we noticed a bright light off in the eastern sky. as we watched it grew larger and we realized it was coming directly at us. when it arrived directly overhead us, we could clearly see that it was a craft, triangular or delta-wing, shaped - hovering silently about 50 feet above us. there were two globes hanging from the craft, one from each \"wing if you will\". one of the globes was a bright white light and the other was dark.\r\nwhile we watched it hover silently, the guitar player went to get his camera and just as he was coming back out the craft darted off at an incredible speed, toward the north (toward kansas city). we continued to watch it and saw that there was an electrical storm that it was headed into. as it drew close to that storm, the other globe under the craft started to glow evenly with the other globe. it entered the storm and disappeared.\r\nwe concluded among ourselves that the craft must be powered by some sort of electric/magnetic power that it can replenish from our electric storms.\r\nnow it has been a long time since the sighting, but i recently met up with my fellow witnesses a short time ago and verified that, yes indeed, we were all witness to the event.\r\nthe following morning we were packing the equipment into the van when we heard a deafening roar. we looked north toward kansas city  and saw a passenger jet taking off and rising to cruising altitude. now this was miles away to the north.

around a mountain and headed down we saw a round disc-shaped object with lights going around it hovering over that basin area.  other people were already there stopped along side of the road and were watching it.  we stopped at the area that would have been the top (north side) of the basin.  at first i thought it was one of those airplanes that used to have messages scrolling on them but when we stopped i saw that was not the case.  the ufo was on the east side of the basin and moved silently towards the west side.  it then moved back toward the east side.  i remember it hovered on the east side for a while, but do not recall if that was before it moved to the west side or after.  after about 10 minutes or more the ufo took off, kind of slowly but not as slow as it had be going over the basin, over the south mountains.  we got back in our car and my mom drove on down around the basin.  i kept an eye on the ufo and saw that it hovered over the mountain for a short time, but then bam, it took off in a westerly direction and up real fast and was gone.  shortly after that we stopped for the night because it was dark.  we checked all the news stations to see if there were any reports of it since so many people saw it, but nothing was reported.  i put below that there were 10 witnesses. i really don't remember how many people were stopped at the side of the road and then there would have been others traveling on the interstate that could have seen it and did not stop.  there were four of us that saw it.","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 10:15pm saturday night (10/03/15), the train was going by at our camp site. i was standing up on a table watching it, and noticed a bright red light down the road from where the train was coming from. at first, i thought it was maybe part of the train… until the train had passed and the light remained. it was a bright red sun looking light, and seemed to be about 10-15 feet off the ground. i would estimate that it was about ½ a mile away, if that.\r\n\r\nmy first though after the train left, and the light remained, was that maybe the bright red light was part of the track. we had driven down there previously that day, and i didn’t remember seeing anything on the tracks that would light up, but it made the most sense. that’s when things got a little weird.\r\n\r\nthe red light started moving in a circular motion, with some erratic side to side movements as well. my dad said it must be someone with a laser pen or something, but there was no laser that could be seen coming from, or away from, it. it looked like a red orb sun thing. after about 15-30 seconds of the moving, the light ascended about 30-40 feet up in the air and continued the same movements with still stops in between. the movements were fast, and smooth, and was absolutely mesmerizing to watch. that’s when we knew it was not something that could be explained rationally.\r\n\r\nthe light ball descended back down to about 10 feet off the ground, and would vary between remaining perfectly still(hovering) and movements (circular, with erratic movements back and forth occasionally). i snapped a photo on my phone when i thought about it (not sure why it didn’t cross my mind earlier, i was just drawn to watching it move). my dad tried to flash his flash light at it in a sequence, in hopes we could communicate somehow i guess. the light got a little brighter, and almost looked like it was moving towards us… then the light went out, and a dark object shot up in the air. this whole time there was not even a hint of sound (except the initial train passing), and we were in the middle of the desert with no other noise pollution... so we should have been able to hear something.\r\n\r\nthis event immediately had us scouting the skies for anything else strange. about 2-5 minutes after the first light disappeared, a second light could be seen in the sky. it had the same kind of circular movements, mixed with the erratic side to side movements, however was more of a bluish/white light instead of red. the second light seemed very high, and the movements were large, and unlike any aircraft i have seen or heard of… even experimental. the large movements were very fast considering how high up it was. i took a video of the second light, which shows the movements clearly (though it’s a little dim). after about 5 minutes, it too disappeared and no other lights were seen. we went to bed, and i noted the event the next morning on my phone so i would not forget the details of what we witnessed.\r\n\r\ni consider myself well versed in astronomy, and have had my eyes to the sky since i was a young boy. i know the difference between asteroids and satellites and am familiar with how different planes look and move in the air. i also know what a chinese lantern is, and looks like in the sky. i keep up to date with all technology, and read up on any leaks or rumors on possible future aircraft or technology. this is like nothing i have ever seen, and i have no rational explanation for the movements, speed, and the utter silence. i do know that i felt calm and at peace while watching it, and at no time did i feel scared or threated by it.\r\n\r\nmedia notes:\r\nvideo - the light of the orb in the video is dim, and small, so watching it in the dark is the easiest way to see it unless you zoom it in. it also looks to be flickering in the video, though was solid when watching in person.\r\n\r\npicture - when zoomed in, the orb appears to be spinning and looks almost like a sun or something.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

dreaming. i tried to go back to sleep when some sorta telepathy began. i was told i had been \"chosen\". they said they werent going to hurt me and to lay still. a vision was forced upon me of who i was dealin with. it was 7 foot tall beings with beaks like birds and pale faces and dark black eyes in military uniforms with matching hats. i started feeling vibrations and painless tingling sensations all over my body from head to toe. after about an hour a voice said it is done. i jumped off the futon and went to my 2nd story apt balcony. a ship about half the size of a airplane was hovering. it basically looked like a space shuttle from the usa except it had no visable engines or propellers. it made a turbine like whining noise and flew off into the night. i went to the dr for an mri and x ray and this is what they discovered. lets just say i am different. i have emailed the feds but no one seems to care as i havent been extended a courtesy response to an email let alone contacted for an interview. i weigh 310 lbs and i am not fat. with my lil snack belly i should weigh 210 -220 tops. this is electronics all over me.","distance":"21-100

got up on my knees to look out the window. there were beings floating down from a glowing ship. they were landing in a field across the road from our home. i couldn't figure out how they were floating down so i assumed they were standing on swings ( i was 4 i didn't understand how they were floating). the beings were small and i assumed they were children. i heard a noise and assumed it was my mom so i quickly laid down. the next thing i remember is waking in the morning.\r\n\r\nin the morning i quickly dressed and was trying to get out the front door. my mom wanted to know where i thought i was going. i said i was going across the street to play with the children. my mom opened the door and pointed to the empty field and said no children lived out there! (we lived in a very rural area) i explained what had happened that night. my mom laughed and said i was dreaming.\r\n\r\nthis encounter was never spoken of again. eventually i had forgotten about the whole thing. i walked into my mom's house in the 80's and my mother was telling her friend how i had witnessed aliens landing from a space ship. i called her into the kitchen and asked why she would tell people about that event. i didn't want people to think i was crazy. my mom said that her friend had seen them too.\r\n\r\ni've never told anyone but my mom about this. it's taken me a long time to even admit it happened. i don't know why. i was watching ancient aliens one night and your show came on after it and i was thinking \"wow! i'm not the only one\".

was sitting in my den in my basement apartment at my computer desk looking out the only window in this room, the view is up and to the southwest, the reason i looked out the window at this moment was as if something got my attention and i immediately noticed a group of reddish orbs directly in my path of view out the window, they were also moving closer to our location as if to go straight over the house in a northeasterly direction, this is a residential neighborhood with houses everywhere. i knew right away these were not airplanes or helicopters, i have observed aircraft all my life, so i know the difference. i have also witnessed multiple unidentified flying objects in my life, both, with and without fellow witnesses. i yelled at my wife to come look and she saw them right away also. we immediately decided to run upstairs and outside to get a better look, i grabbed my digital camera from the den in the process. once we got out into the back yard which is on the east side of the house we could see the orbs starting to spread out and then go straight up into the cloud layer, they were not moving very quickly, i say this in comparison to some reports which describe the off and gone in a flash occurrence, this group did not seem to be in a big hurry, at this time there was one straggler still moving under the clouds and headed northeast over the city, i started taking pictures of it with my 12 megapixel vivitar digital camera, nothing special but it works. once the final orb had moved up and out of sight i noticed my neighbor to the north staring up at the sky and he asked my wife what was that, she responded to him, those were ufos. he seemed a bit shocked, i do not know if he has seen ufos before and he has not mentioned them since.\r\n\r\nmy feelings and reactions were, how long were they looking at me through the window before i noticed them, did anyone else in the rest of this city see them, will they come back, also, for me it was like here we go again, what is gonna happen next, and i have felt like this sighting has altered my conscience since there are so many reports like this and now it has happened to me, again.\r\n\r\nnote: the orbs never did seem to change color or size, just their positions in the sky as they seemingly were making themselves known to anyone in this city who happened to be looking up at the sky at the time.\r\n\r\ni do not know if you can a good image from my digital shots, i know from watching your tv shows and others that you may be able to analyze them.\r\n\r\n<<<<\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet

objects, i was unable to grab a phone or camera, but i did get to the best location i could to observe as much as i could.\r\n\r\nthe objects appeared as bright fireball type things with large trails after them. sort of like a shooting star but traveling at much slower speeds and appeared to be much larger than a shooting star. at first i wasn't sure if they were fireworks, but upon observing the motions i determined it could not be fireworks. from my location, this appeared to be somewhere either just south of downtown denver, or somewhere further south east maybe over centenial or aurora.
