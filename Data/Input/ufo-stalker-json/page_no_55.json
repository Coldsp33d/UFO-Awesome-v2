craft hovering less than 100 yards south of the seawall at an observed altitude of less than 500 feet. the day was overcast, and the cloud cover was low less than 1500 feet.\r\nlooking south east, just below the clouds, i spotted this large object,off towards the beach, a dark metallic black grey aerial vehicle, reasonably large, having a shape that was not spherical, nor did it appear to be any of the usual military aircraft/helicopters or military equipment that normally frequent the area. i observed it hovering directly above the beach, just south of the shoreline. it was not causing the water beneath it to spray (for instance if it were a propeller driven helicopter type) and i first thought it resembled a military hover craft , but not at that altitude. it was perfectly stationary hovering above the tree line as i drove past it on the highway.\r\n\r\ni kept looking at it as i passed it and could see the details of the external structure clearly. it was greater than 12 to 15 feet in thickness/height, and over 40 to 60 feet in width, having a rounded shape akin to perhaps a saucer or maybe an elongated teardrop. the external sides had many empennages and intricate pipework, railings, though there did not appear any sort of external antennas. i could not see any windows or ports as the sides of the vehicle were totally dark grey to black, dull and non reflective. it had some resemblances to the millenium falcon, and some to the service vehicle depicted in the district 9 movie as far as the external appearance of it. that is to say it was not sleek and or smooth on the surface structure. it looked more utilitarian.\r\n\r\ni kept comparing it against every known military vehicles and aircraft i am familiar with and kept coming up with nothing resembling it. i thought it might be a special ops team (airforce) doing some exercise using a blackhawk type)but there were no rotors, and there were no ropes or operators on the ground.\r\n\r\nonce i had gone through my list of possibilities, i could only conclude that it was  some sort of  alien service craft, observing/surveying the  south beach traffic as other vehicles and myself , passed it accordingly.\r\n\r\ni told my grand daughter, who was in the car with me  to look and see the flying saucer on the beach and she observed it as well, i opened the moon roof to see it as i passed directly in front of it.  as we passed, i regretted not having a camera to photograph this thing, because i had never seen anything so different hovering so close to the highway like it was. it remained perfectly stationary and motionless the entire time we passed it, i felt like i could have pulled off the road and walked up to it had i taken the time to stop. then, i realized we were running late, and had to keep on to our destination. when we returned a few hours later, it was gone.  the actual date and time can be verified with respect to the holiday on ice show, other than that, its purely my personal visual observation that lead me to believe that this craft was not commercial, or earth based military in origin. it was , without question one of the most bizarre  space craft type obects i have ever seen.  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

were watching our new tv and i took a break to go out and look at the sky from the patio. it was between 11:30 and 12:00 pm. the house has a fantastic view of the bay of mattinata.  i looked up over the house and saw what looked like colored glitter caught in a blob of water or gel.  the blob had an outline and the glitter moved within in as it undulated across the sky from e to w.  the glitter was multi-colored and each piece moved on it's own but stayed within the general shape. i saw pieces of glitter go up/down, backward/forward.  it blocked out background stars as it passed.  i yelled for my partner to come out and look at it as i'd never seen anything like it before. he came out, was shocked by it, ran back into the house for his camera.  i went to the upper patio on the house to get a better view.  by this time, the outline was headed over the next mountain and past mattinata.  when he came back out with his camera, it was too far away to show up in pictures.   he has seen it twice since and one of the times is the video i've included. we tried to explain it as space junk or something caught in orbit and reflecting light, but that doesn't make sense as it was moving in the other direction the next time he saw it.  i sent this to the italian center for ufo studies (cisu) and they wanted me to answer more questions, i told them i would, but then they never contacted me again.  so i thought i would send it on to you.  i'm not saying it's extra-terrestrial, i would just like to know what it is.

january 9, 2018 at approximately 7:00pm. while in master suite bathroom, i saw a very bright, flashing light up in the sky, outside the large picture window at corner tub. i walked to the master bedroom french doors that leads to outside side patio where a hot tub spa is located.\r\n\r\n i stood in open doorway trying to comprehend what i am seeing. it was the brightest thing in the sky and ‘hovering’ and blinking, but never blinked off, but always staying a bright color. at times the color was blue, at other times the red, and sometimes a little yellow, but the prominent bright color was blinking crystal clear bright white. \r\n\r\ni kept watching it, not believing what i am seeing. it stayed in one place, but it would slightly move upward and little to the side. it was constantly blinking and very bright. it was far away, so i did not hear noise. it was there for approximately 2-3 hours. \r\n\r\ni immediately called my mom that lives next door and asked her to walk outside and look. she went outside and said she saw something also, she only stayed outside for a minute because it was cold.  then i immediately called my sister, that lives in georgia. she walked outside, but did not see anything because trees. then i immediately called family, that was in florida visiting family and sent them video and pictures.\r\n\r\ni have been constantly thinking about what i have seen and had to do a painting of it.  i am intelligent, never smoked or never any drugs, happy, hard-working farm and engineering occupation.  \r\n\r\ni have looked every night at the same time to see if it has returned, but has been cloudy and still have not seen it again yet. \r\n\r\nthank you for your time.\r\ni have video, but would not attach to my email because too large. i can send video

just returned to the area after visiting family in socal. we were sleeping in a jeep cherokee 2 door,1987 model. \r\n\r\ni awoke suddenly because of a bright light. i am very sensitive to light, and my brother is not. i sat straight up, staring at a bright white light above me, about 15 feet above my head. my first reaction was that it was a cop. no other vehicles were around. it was not a cop.\r\n\r\ni immediately glanced at my brother who was sleeping, relieved that he was there. the light came from directly above the jeep. it was shining through my metal roof. the roof did not have a window/moon roof/ sun roof. the light appeared to function differently than most lights because it was shining through the metal jeep roof yet was not painful on my eyes. \r\n\r\nthe light was coming from an object, about 20 feet long and rectangular and hovering directly overhead. it was definitely purposely hovering over my jeep. i looked around and nothing was missing, first looking at my brother, then at my belongings such as an iching book and a bundle of sage in a conch shell. everything was where it was when i fell asleep. \r\n\r\ni thought about waking my brother but decided not to. i noticed my hair was moving from a wind coming from the object above me. it made no sound whatsoever. just a light, and wind. i could feel the wind on my face, though it was not blowing very hard. i felt sort of stunned but not actually afraid. it felt like i was being scanned. i sat there staring straight up at the object above me for about 5 minutes. then it flew away so quickly i could not see where it went, but it seemed to ascend and practically disappear all in a second. it left very quickly and noiselessly.\r\n\r\nafterwards, i was still stunned. it took me a long time to fall back asleep. i told my brother about it in the morning, asking him if he saw it but he said he was sound asleep.\r\n\r\ni have never forgotten this incident and have told a few people about it but felt compelled to report it now that i can without feeling stigmatized due to recent news disclosures.","distance":"20 Feet or

house to get additional witnesses. myself and two other people viewed the object through binoculars, i was also able to view the object through my telescope along with another person. the object is sphere shaped and appears to both reflect and emit light. i can't say with any confidence the size or altitude of the object but it did appear to be rather high. \r\n\r\nas i was viewing the object through a telescope the two other witnesses were taking turns viewing it through binoculars. we noticed that it was moving in a small circle and at the same times a portion of the object was pulsating rapidly like a strobe light and at the center of it was a black hole. after about five minutes the pulsating stopped as well as the object. i had a good view of it through my telescope, crystal clear and close, it was amazing to look at. the sphere was perfectly smooth and had a bluish white glow to it. it reminded me of the glow from an incandescent light bulb. we were talking about how strange it is and wondering what it could be. one of the neighbors viewed through my telescope and said \"i don't know what to think of that, it does not look like anything from this world that i have ever seen.\" after about ten minutes of the object remaining motionless it started breaking up into smaller parts starting at the lower section of the sphere and moving up.It formed four separate \"arms\" made up of smaller parts that arched up and around the sphere and met into a point above it, and then it was gone. it was hard to believe what i had just seen. i think about it often.\r\n\r\nthis is an unusual event on it's own. but, what makes it even more unusual and unique is that it's not the only time i have seen it. i have seen the object multiple times at the same location, around the same time of the evening, and the same time of the year over the past several years. it's definitely strange and one of the most amazing things that i have ever seen.I have had other impressive sightings of the object and have recorded them in a journal. i just chose one sighting that i consider to be one of the best.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":89538,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.089541166077474,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01132018-0012","longitude":-86.7298204676472,"occurred":1470944700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1515870879000,"summary":"I

the west, and it moved in a straight line appearing from the west ( above the rooftops on street behind) and travelled in a straight line across the sky and disappeared over my neighbours house to our right side. i'm familiar with identifying aeroplanes as there are flashing lights and often take the same route. however this light travelled across a section of the sky which i'm not familiar with seeing aeroplanes travelling. also the light was way to big and bright to be a plane. it moved faster than the average plane would fly and there was no noise from the light that could be heard for sure as there was roadworks being done on the motorway overnight 100m down my house. it stayed bright consistently not changing at all in any way. the event lasted around 2 or 3 mins in total, and
