2 videos were taken at my mom's house while we were chatting in the backyard, during our christmas dinner. the first one was around 01:10am on december 25th, 2015. by the way, my mom lives in itaipuaçu - which is a small distric of the city of marica, located in the state of rio de janeiro, brazil.\r\n\r\nit is important to mention that we first saw this phenomenon on december 25th, 2015. then, again on decebember 27th, 2015. however, the first sightseeing (dec 25th) was only a white blinking light. video is attached.\r\nthat's what really caught our attention - looking at this white blinking light in the sky. it kind of looks like the morse code - i am not sure though.\r\n\r\ntwo days after the first contact with this phenomenon, and out of the blue and around the same time (12:40am), this red and green light started to fall from the white light. \r\n\r\nat first (first video and continuing on the second video), we thought it was a ballon, but since the phenomenon was strange to our previous knowledge of flying objects (like airplanes, helicopters, drones, etc) we started to wonder why this bright white light was blinking like that. besides, you will be able to see on the second video how other lights are \"ejected\" from the white one.\r\n\r\ni need to mention that i am into spirituality and truly believe in other forms of life outside of our planet. with that said, my reaction was based on joy and surprise - since i had never seen anything like this in my whole life. my family members were actually joking about the phenomenon, but some (who were skeptical at first) started to wonder what was that unidentified flying object. \r\n\r\nthe video made on december 25th had the object descending before we lost sight. the video on december 27th had the object disappearing in the sky (as seen on the video).  \r\n\r\nlast but not least, this strange object appeared on the sky practically in the same location - it was located in the same place at 333 degrees (nw).\r\n\r\nthere are a lot of videos on youtube showing ufo's around here (in itaipuaçu, rio de janeiro, brazil). it's important to say that this is an area of low density population, surrounded by forests, mountains and the ocean.\r\n\r\nany other question, please don't hesitate to contact me. \r\n\r\nplease, reply with some feedback.\r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n\r\nlessandro encarnacao\r\nwhatsapp:

provincial park, pine point trail to be exact, getting our engagement photos taken. we were there for the majority of the day and left when it began to get dark, roughly 7 - 730pm. our return path to winnipeg took us down highway 15. as we came down 15 heading west into the city, shortly after passing the perimeter i glance ahead as you always do when driving and i see a pulsating red light in the sky. i thought absolutely nothing of it as it looked exactly like the pulsating red light you would see on the top of a cell phone tower which is also relevant because the height of the light was also matching that of a cell phone tower. we continued our drive down 15 (now dugald rd) and it was maybe a minute or two later i happen to glance over to my right (compass north), it dawned on me this should be the general area where that pulsating light should be, only i didn't see any such tower. i glanced up through the windsheild and what i seen made me slam on the breaks in the middle of the road. it was an equilateral triangle shaped craft, all black except for the pulsing red in the core and blueish-green lights on the tips of the craft. there was one or two cars behind me that swerved around me, surprisingly not honking their horns. i pulled over to the shoulder immediately and got out of the car. i stood there looking up at this craft as it hovered in a stationary position for a few seconds before it very slowly started to move down dugald rd in the direction we just came from (east). i watched on, and so did my fiance from the car, as it slowly made a greater distance between us. after a few more seconds of watching it i jumped back in the car and sped up to the nearest intersection to u-turn and chase this craft as long as we could. by this point it was an incredible distance away so we pulled over and watched as the pulsating red light ascended higher and higher until we could see it no more.\r\n\r\noddly enough the next day we found out that the building we seen the craft hovering above is named 'superior technologies'. this is not my attempt at some cheap humour, it is simply the truth. if anything, i feel this would be some humour on the occupants part. i have enclosed an image of the building it was above. thank you.","distance":"101-500

looked more like the thing the astronauts used to land back on earth after going to the moon or the machines the people of india have ancient pictures of. it didn't seem to be moving. it's color was the darkest black you could imagine. the sky was clear with no clouds and no planes in sight. as i was coming up to exit 27, i stopped on the ramp. the car in front of me stopped also. the object started moving north west and it seemed to be creating heat waves around it and seemed to be even darker black now.I decided to drive up the hill in front of me to get a better view of the object. it took me 15 seconds or so to get thru the parking lot and go behind the buildings. when i stopped, i got out of my truck. the object was gone. from my vantage point i could see for miles in the direction the object was moving but there was no sign of the object. the total time that elapsed from the first sight to loosing sight of the object was around 5 minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

walked out to my car parked on the street in front of the house.  i heard what i thought was a jet flying low coming from the east.  air traffic is not unusual as i lived near detroit metropolitan airport. this noise got very loud very quickly and seemed to be heading right for me.  it also seemed like it was following the exact street path. i was both frightened and intrigued.  i was scared something might fall out of the sky on me, but had no time to react and run or hide. as the noise peaked overhead, it was almost unbearably loud and sounded like an engine of some sort, rumbling. i covered my ears. i felt the vibration.  it blew the treetops as it passed and i could not believe that i didn't see anything. it continued west away from the detroit river, but the sound faded in volume and duration much more quickly than when it built up and approached, almost sounding like it was ascending rapidly. i stood, bewildered and searched the sky for something, anything, that would explain the sound. i then looked at the house and noticed my roommate in the open window. we both were quiet for a moment, looking at each other in amazement. finally, i asked him if he \"saw\" that, he said yes, and then i corrected myself and asked if he heard it. he confirmed. he said he did not actually see anything either.  i looked up and down the street for anyone else who may have experienced what we did. i saw no one, (which i thought was weird because this was a really, really, loud noise)and things seemed normal. i shook it off explaining it away to myself as an airplane, and got in my car and went about my day. there were no reports on the news to my knowledge of any airplanes having difficulty at metro airport that day.  it felt like something different.  it has always bothered me.  the sound alone made me think this should have been something huge i could see. it almost seemed like whatever was there was invisible or cloaked.  the trees moving with the noise

t.V. it had just finished raining and the clouds had mostly disperesed. we heard a helicopter outside that sounded like it was flying around the cucamonga peak area. i remarked that it was probably the news hovering over the 210 freeway. the news than came on and the helicopter pilot mentioned he was more south over the 15 and 60 freeways. around that time (we could still hear the helicopter but we just figured it was police) his dog kept acting odd. i left his house and decided to take a walk down the pacific electric trail. the pacific electric trail is a hiking/running/biking trail that runs through rancho cucamonga. i headed east. i could still hear the helicopter and when i could fully see cucamonga peak and the surrounding foothills i looked in the direction of the helicopter sound. i figured it had to be searching for something since it was already going on being around the area over an hour. i saw a blinking red light which was attached to the chopper but the chopper had no other lights including search illuminated. it was going back and forth in multiple directions. i then realized that it had to be chasing something. i figured an off roader running from police. i didnt see anything on the surface but noticed a light in front of the helicopter that seemed to be going in between the trees on the foothill east of the peak. i was dumbfounded. at first i thought motorcycle but the light was moving too fast. then it seemed to clear the trees and i could see a dense ball of light heading east across the front of the foothill. i could see the red beacon light of the chopper and saw and heard it following the object. the object went from east to west then over the hill all while the chopper followed. it skimmed the top of the hill and went west and shot straight up the face of the peak and kept raising. thats when i saw the movement of another dense ball of light. the chopper then went straight up after the ball of light. the ball of light then came back around and leveled out and both it and the helicopter went east towards san bernardino where i lost visual. i didnt see where the other one went since i was following the chopper chase. \r\nthat

on cold spring road in milwaukee, wi at about 68th street i noticed , to the s/w, one orange light. i thought it might be a plane. it appeared to in the atmosphere at about 5000 to 10000 feet. within seconds i saw a second light about 5 degrees lower and to the left.  they appeared about plane or helicopter size at that distance. the color was predominately orange with small flashes/pulses of red and white. they moved between 30 and 40 degrees in the sky.\r\n\r\ni watched these for about three minutes.  they stayed in the same general area, did not fly in formation.  they move independent of each other, never got really close to each other but were obviously together. they moved sparingly and hovered about 40% of the time.  i watched as we  drove, at times losing sight do to tree/building obstruction, but did re-establish visual. they did not \"blink out\" but were just gone after i came out from behind an obstruction. the total time was about 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nthey seemed to far away to be drones.  maybe helicopters in the distance, however the color was something i've never seen in the sky before outside of the 4th of july.  they were to far away and vague for me to say \"yes, these are ufo's\", however that would be my best guess.  i was excited during and after the event.\r\n\r\nmy wife did not see the objects. she was driving and we were eastbound.  the lights were s/w. my thoughts on reporting is that it's not a strong case, however it may confirm others in the area.\r\n\r\nwhat made this interesting is that on christmas late evening in 1982, my wife and i had an experience (unreported) where our cars lights and radio went out.  it just lost power on the way home from relatives in the late evening. it was on a deserted interstate close enough to a wayside to roll in. we slept there the entire night and have very little recollection of it. we actually joke about maybe being abducted but have no effects of he incident. the car was fine in the morning.

francisco (though the city is not visible from this vantage point) and saw two stars about as far apart as either side of orion's belt, perhaps slightly further apart. the lights were horizontally arranged, on the same plane, and white. the two lights maintained a perfectly even distance from one another during the entire course of the event.\r\n\r\ni observed both lights move in tandem, slowly to the south. the movement was steady, and scaled upon a backdrop which appears two or so miles away, they moved at least a half-mile. as a distant object, the actual object's movement would have been a much greater distance in that interval of time. i can only give comparison given my surroundings. the lights ascended, in perfect formation after moving to the south, and ascended slightly, a few degrees of arc. the lights faded from white to a fainter blue hue over this short period of time, as if they were moving up and out, and the formation was no longer visible. the lights indicated either a solid object, or two objects locked in complete tandem. it would have been an enormous object, and could have been out over the ocean beyond san francisco, or in the upper atmosphere. once again, the lights were as far apart as either side of orion's belt, perhaps even further apart. there was no blinking or typical atmospheric distortion. it looked like two stars light years apart at even magnitude simply moved across the sky together horizontally, and then moved diagonally and away until they were unable to be seen. the disappearance was gradual, but very quick. the formation caught my eye immediately. i was looking at the stars, as i often do, and two stars in a horizontal bar formation moving across the sky is definitely out of the ordinary. both lights ascended and disappeared from view at the same time.\r\n\r\nplanes from the oakland airport and san francisco airport are seen at regular intervals, and an occasional drone and helicopter. not only was this further up in the sky, but further away, and the light pattern of planes is utterly different. i am also able to make out the body of a plane, even in the night. i've already seen numerous typical airliners since the event. the object was miles away, and the further away the lights were from me, the further apart they would have been, so i am not able to estimate a size, if it was even a single object. my speculation is that the span of the object, if solid, would have cast a shadow over downtown san francisco.\r\n\r\nit would have been impossible to film or picture, but the event would have perplexed anyone. i've never seen anything like it. no substances were involved in this sighting.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
