it is hard for me to reach for my camera, start it up and point it in the right direction and zoom.  i nailed it this time!  i know my v520 good enough to know you cannot hold down the zoom button.  you have to slowly ease into it for the cameras auto-focus to kick in.  this orb was less than a quarter mile away so it was very close.  i could not zoom in as much as i wanted but i was able to stabilize and slow down the footage.\r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?  i was on my side yard.  i had my video camera and telescope at the ready to see another ufo.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object? sky fishing from the east. i saw a fast moving object.  i first thought it was far away, but i realized it was close.  i reached for my video camera and tried to keep a cool head.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?  i knew it was an orb the second i spotted it.  it was moving very fast. too fast for a bird much less a balloon.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.  it headed west from the east.  it stayed at a consistent height.  it just moved very fast. it was elongated, not round.  i think the front was a little flatish.  \r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.  i usually miss it because i am too slow to react.  it leaves me with my chin hitting the ground and i am angry that i missed another speeding orb. my friends and i see objects like this all the time but they are not as fast so we can capture them with our telescope.  we invite you to come with us so you can see them with your own eyes. if you've never seen a ufo, you'll flip out.  we are located in the los angeles area.  la ufo channel.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?  i kept one eye on the object as i pointed my video camera towards the object (i have a tracking system).  i simply lost sight of it.  i was

five of them to be precise, but only managed to caputre one in photo and video.\r\n\r\nwas visiting a relative on christmas day and at dusk, late evening, i was taking a cup of ice water out to place in the cup holder of another relatives car for them, as they were about to leave. i noticed upon walking out the front door a column of five round red lights in the distance but thought nothing of it at that moment thinking it was aviation warning lights on a radio tower. having finished what i'd gone outside to do i looked up again to discover that the lights had moved, three of them were now in a position forming the points of a triangle with two positioned centered vertical beneath. i ran back in to tell my family members to come check out the ufos and to grab my camera.. which was apparently already in my pocket.\r\n\r\nwhen the first relatives came out the formation had broken up and two of the lights zoomed off (direction unknown as i was fiddling with my camera when that ocurred). by the time i had gotten my camera turned on, and configured for night shot, there was only one of the objects still clearly visible, which is the red-orange colored object in the rather poor quality photos and one video i managed. the vertical line in the images is due to a defect with the still image pick-up sensor on the digital camera.\r\n\r\nthe objects appeared roughgly due south from the location i was at. the other four objects originally seen along with this one went traveled off in what appeared to be south and southwest directions, was rather hard to tell due to the patches of heavy cloud cover and rain. the one that stuck around and got imaged dropped down to just above perceivable tree top level and then traveled east - southeast on a level plain before it vanished.\r\n\r\nthe location of appearence would place the objects as having appeared over the southern edge of pickens county or northern edge of anderson county, pending what the actual distance was, which i'm personally thinking was between a half-mile, but no further than three miles simply due to the heavy clouds and scattered rain storms which were moving through the area at that time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

were in a shadow so friend #1 said look up and i seen a big circle shaped airplane with a back fin fly over us making no noise other then it cutting through the air and friend #1 said that was a ufo and i said so and then it took a couple seconds to register and i look at him and i said that was a ufo so i started running and calling for friend #2 to come of hiding game over this is not a joke so he came out we told him a ufo just flew over at low height and friend # 2 didnt believe me and friend #1 so i said either way im leaving so we got a little distance away and i pointed out the direction it flew over us we noticed blinking lights ironically red white and blue the colors were and we watched it for 20 mins and it looked like it was just hovering there in the distance so friend #2 said that does look weird but i still dont believe u guys so friend #2 wanted to cut through a trail through the woods that seperates the neighborhood we\"re in and where we live but i said im not going through the woods and we get abducted so i said lets walk down the road further and go down a side road that leads to hihgway and walk down the highway back home so as we got down to the side

there it goes thats what we seen as it was flying towards us and friend #2 said pretty much forget that i believe u guys now and took of running down the road towards the highway and so did i as i was running i got a real bad cramp in my side about 20ft from where i started running and i had to stop running so i looked back and seen friend #1 still standing there looking at the craft and it was getting closer but very slowly and i started yelling his name a couple times and he finally responded what i yelled run he said he couldnt move i yelled his name and said run now and he turned aroung and started running towards me inwich i was closer to the highway and inwich i figured if we get abducted or whatever people will see on the highway and as my friend got closer i noticed it started flying the other way it did 180 degree turn without stopping or slowing down and we got to the highway we met up with are other friend down the highway we went back to my house told my mom and brother they checked are pupils thinking we were on lsd or drugs and friend #1 and 2 were crying cause they were scared and i wanted to go back and after that we seen it flying low over the woods between the neighborhoods for the next 2 weeks every night me and my other 2 friends  but what made it weird was anytime we had other friends waiting to see it over the woods it would never come as soon as they would leave we would see it and it was like it had to be me and my two other friends are the only ones that can see it and after it all i felt amazed by it wondering what would happen if i got abducted or i feel bad that at one piont while calling for my friend standing there i wanted to see what would happen if the craft got over my friend would it of beamed him up i asked him what happend and he said he couldnt move like he was mermorized or something ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

yeah right and around that same time i observed the passing car with two people in it and the driver in that car was pointing in the same direction as i was. i assume he was telling his passenger the

galaxy s5. shortly after sundown i noticed a solid white light hovering at several thousand feet over the ocean. it was then slowly tracking west and decending. it stopped at a couple hundred feet above the ocean, descended, ascended to the prior height, decended again, reascended, then slowly decended into the depths.... a dark helicopter was circling the area after then headed south. i was suspecting that it was a planned landing. after the incident i discovered an anomaly in the photos...An orb like i've never seen before. there are 4 bright orbs within, as well as a silloette of a humanoid/light being with arms out on the bottom 2 bright orbs. the only reason i belive this is not a digital anomaly is because of what i witnessed after the pictures were taken during sunset. i was too enthralled with the encounter to get the camera out and it was far off and darker then. this orb with a flat bottom, domed top, and inner orbs is glowing like a sundog illuminated through the clouds. i didn't see it at all until it looked like a bright unchanging point of white light, smaller in comparison to the orb. \r\nsince 1993 i've had dozens of sightings of all types...Big, small, metallic, glowing, emenating auras, day, night, twilight, etc.\r\ni lost an hour while living in lake tahoe along with an entire household. clocks, watches, battery or plugged in. all off one day. i was spotlighted on the back deck the first night i entered that house in tahoe donner. everyone who went in that house had experiences of being watched. the time lapse was 4 months later...\r\nit's been 16 years since then and lately i'm witnessing all kind of new phenomenon. daytime high elevation metallic orbs, a satellite height ufo (solid white) moving 3 times as fast, all the way across the horizon west to east, but faded on a light as bright and as big as the moon (through aresol haze) on and then off in 5 seconds just once as it passed near overhead. early morning, 4 am. then 40 minutes later another on the same west to east path but no illumination 2nd pass, again moving triple or more than satellite speed. i believe in devine intervention through our collective consciousness.... i've had some amazing intuitive experiences lately. i am hopeful that these light-beings are here to witness the atrocities in place on this beautiful garden planet. if we all realize the potential conflict within and make peace with ourselves first, then we can reach peace on a global scale and work together on harmonizing the balance. war cannot bring peace. teach love. unconditionally.... only love can conquer a demon. be peaceful. stay at oneness. promote positivity and conciousness through actions. this is the message i'm getting...\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

personally observed a countless number of circular shaped impressions like probable ufo landing sites on the ground which mimicked farming industry activities in may 1998.  i observed the aforementioned while flying onboard a usaf military airlift aircraft as a space available passenger with other active duty personnel and their family members from charleston afb to elmendorf afb, anchorage, alaska.  \r\n\r\nat the time, i was an active duty usaf staff officer specializing in air battle management/air weapons control and airborne/ground radar & communications command & control planning and operations for a numbered af headquarters.  i was on authorized military leave going to a former colleague's sister's wedding in anchorage, alaska. \r\n\r\nwith my intense curiosity, i visited the flight deck while flying over the northwest united states to ask the flight crew specifically about the vast number of unusual circles on the grounds below.  i had been looking out one of the few small aircraft cargo/passenger cabin windows and saw what appeared to be a countless number of unusual circular patterns on the ground. i was literally shocked by the facial expression and response of the pilot and co-pilot when i asked about the circles.  they turned to me and looked directly into my eyes. they were visibly like in a state of shock (wide-eyed) by my questioning them about my ground observation. the pilots then almost simultaneously said in a fearful and foreboding tone, \"you really don't want to know!\"  i took the strong hint of warning and immediately left the cockpit area with saying another word.   i can't image what type of farming or crop growths which required circular patterns.  another consideration was that the circles appeared similar to that of individual or groups of water treatment facilities.  \r\n\r\ni wish i had a camera to take pictures of what were the same size circles in various patterns covering an area which i believe we're several states. but, i would have probably been admonished and/or told i was violating security protocols while onboard a military aircraft. regardless, this left an impression permanently etched in my memory.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

the sky caught my eye while driving west on shadow valley drive. i slowed the car to a near stop and watched the object for about 45 seconds. i noticed it was shaped like a diamond and that it was nearly transparent. the red color of the object was continuously fluctuating as does a star. it remained primarily red but also appeared orange and yellowish as it would \"blink\". i resumed my drive home and approx 2 mins later was driving southbound on harrison blvd toward the south ogden area. i still had a visual on the object, and when i drove to a more open area, i noticed a second, identical object hovering about 100-200 feet below the first object. as the two were hovering a third identical object arrived from the east and i estimate it was traveling around 400-500 mph. i base this estimate upon the many air force planes i have witnessed throughout my life, having lived outside of hill air force base for over 30 years. as quickly as the third object arrived, it came to an immediate and abrupt stop, 20-30 feet from the first object. i watched the 3 objects as best i could while driving and at last sight, all 3 objects had begun traveling quite slowly to the northwest. i turned the car around to try and get a better idea of where they were going, but could no longer see them. i was debating on making this report when i noticed a friend of mine on facebook had posted a video of one of the objects that he noticed sometime after my sighting. i have not asked for his permission to add his info to this report, or i would have included it as well. i'm sure i can obtain a copy of the video if it is needed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

over the expressway.  i could not believe my eyes but there it was in plain sight just off to the left above the west end mall exit sign.My uncle and his girlfriend also saw the spaceship as well as a former co-worker. i wonder to this day if anyone else saw it but were too afraid to talk about it.That sighting took place 36 years ago and still haunts me today.I do not have photos for i saw this from my car while driving.Another note that i want to mention is that i was so astounded that i got off at the next exit and went back to get another look and just that quick it was gone or either cloaked itself and rendered itself invisible.My co-worker who is now deceased said that it did make the evening news. to this very day every time i have to travel that route on i-20 i always without fail look up\r\nat the very site in which i saw the ufo. one final note worth mentioning is that while trying to satisfy my curiosity about who else may have seen it,i ran across a testimony on the internet in which this man and his wife while traveling from jacksonville to atlanta also said they saw the same possible ufo from their  plane. the clue to me was that it was on the same exact date

them in the back seat, closed the door and looked up. i noticed two very bright lights in the sky above my parents garage, to the east. these were very bright and stationary. no noise, no pulsating or anything, just bright steady orange/red light.\r\n\r\ni watched these lights for about a minute. initially, i thought to myself these could be planes taking off from the waukesha airport as i have noticed this in the past growing up here at this house. then i thought to myself--can't be. the lights are the wrong color and not moving. the landing lights always shut off eventually or the plane flies by overhead. i watched these lights for about a minute. then ran into the house and got others to come out.\r\n\r\nmy brother-in-law came out first and was immediately shocked. we watched the left light fade out and disappear. it was if the light was traveling at a very high rate of speed away from me. it faded and then could no-longer be seen. the light to the right did not move or change brightness. i ran back to the house as the kids were not coming out--i wanted them to see. as we ran out and down the yard, joe (brother-in-law) said the light moved abruptly sideways (to the left i think--would be north--he would have to confirm). as we watched the light then began  to fade as the first one did. i told the kids and joe i thought the object was traveling away from us at a high rate of speed. eventually it disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe kids were scared when they saw the object. i have to admit i felt like my hair was standing on end. \r\n\r\nmy sister and wife kept saying someone is flying a drone or something. i was thinking we just witnessed very rare secret aircraft and the light was afterburners as they were flying away from us, or this was something not of this world. joe thinks this was not a plane as we know them. i have to agree, an afterburner that bright would certainly be noticeable, and if not by me, by many others as this area is close to the milwaukee and waukesha areas. i have witnessed many air force fly-bys with afterburners. they usually look blue/white and are very loud. i have seen them at night as well, this was not a conventional after burner. \r\n\r\ni went back into the house and looked at a website called flight aware.  there were no aircraft in the area for a 100-miles or more. there was one that would have been west of my location flying north-west.\r\n\r\ni looked around in the sky for a while afterward. nothing. i looked on the horizon to the west, i could see the radio towers several miles away with their flashing red lights--defiantly not one of these.\r\n\r\nabout 20-30-minutes later my wife and i left for home.","distance":"Over One
