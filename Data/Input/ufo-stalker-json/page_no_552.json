very bright red and blue lights in the sky in about the same location as the earlier light, which was now to my south appearing to be over i-10 in westlake about 2 miles away. the red and blue lights appeared to be side by side each shinning outward in opposite directions like colored search lights. the lights looked too large to be on any known aircraft at that distance, and did not blink or strobe like aircraft lighting. the red/blue light appeared to be stationary in the sky. then, the lights did a deliberate move to the west; and without stopping or turning the light started moving back to the east with a 360 degees change in direction. and then, once again the object appeared to be sitting stationary in the sky. at this point, i ran inside to get my video camera. i videotaped about a minute as i watched the object in the viewfinder it appeared to just fade away? the video was not great, as the video was skaky and i should have turned on manual focus, instead of letting the auto focus distort the image. i will attempt to attach a still shot from the video. during the few minutes i observed the lights in the sky, no sound was heard from the object.","distance":"Over One

to the county outside the city limits south of kansas city to a new home development that was being built. so there was new home construction. this is important as you will see. i was 5 years old when we moved. either that year or the following year, my grandparents came to visit us. it was a beautiful sunny summer day. the sky was blue with a few white puffy clouds. grandfather and i took a walk south on holly street from 97th to 99th street to a ravine a few yard south of 99th street. we looked down into the ravine and there was a shiny, silvery disc-shaped object that seemed to be floating a few feet above the ground making a humming sound. it seemed as if the object was made of three pieces, a top (like a dinner plate turned upside down), a ribbed center section that seemed to be spinning independently of the top and bottom plates, and a bottom (like a dinner plate turned right side up). but i really can't be sure if it was just the center section or the whole thing that was spinning. there seemed to be several small people there. i was not afraid, but i was very excited and happy to see them. i pointed at them and said something to grandfather, but he seemed to be in a daze and paid no attention to me. the next thing i remember we were standing in front of my house a few blocks up the street. my grandfather was still in a daze. i can remember trying to talk to him about it but he seemed to be unresponsive. i was very tired after that and went to sleep on my parents bed. i remember thinking about that before i went to sleep wondering what had happened. before i went to sleep, i remember thinking that i had seen some plumbing sticking up out of the ground from the construction. and that is what i told myself that it was. i did not remember all this until i was in my 40's running around the track. then the whole thing came flooding back. there were many other personal consequences i suffered as a result of this event. for example, when my parents took me to see the fairy princess, she was wearing a silvery dress with a wand. i was terrified and ran through the department store and hid inside a rack of clothes. i was terrified of needles and getting shots. at night, i surrounded myself with stuffed animals for protection and when i looked at the window in my bedroom i thought about being on a flying carpet and flying through the sky. i never understood nay of this until that day on the track when everything came flooding back. after that, i had constant, nightly dreams of ufo's, abductions, being in spacecraft. seeing aliens. these dreams went on for years. about 7 years after that day on the track those dreams, thankfully, went away. i also have a lump in the crook of my right arm which i never understood till that day. it's still there. but that is a whole other story. i could make a drawing of the craft. that is crystal clear in my mind. but i have no way of putting it on my computer.

these odd blue light caught my eye that was almost pulsating but was very noticeable. these objects looked like stars that is until they were moving in all types of directions not fast but it looked as if they were descending and then asending upwards as well as other directions such as left and right. there was a little bit of cloud cover as well which the blue light that came from these objects made the clouds pulsate blue. when i saw the blue light without the clouds it was very distinct as if you cloud see the light itself, imagine a helix outlined in blue light as if these objects were scanning the sky for some reason. we watched for awhile from the street, i personally started getting an uncomfortable feeling so i suggested lets go back inside. at first we laughed it off but then we both decided lets just go back home. never seen anything like it, i know for a fact it wasn't an airplane because during this exact time a plane did go over and we could see it and hear it and id it from its blinking lights. whatever we saw was moving like nothing i have ever seen in the sky, plus emitting this blue light from these objects as if they were scanning the sky or something, it was basically pulsating at times and the clouds made it blurring as if the clouds turned blue but when we saw the same light in an area with no clouds it produced a very distinct blue light as i stated earlier that almost look like a helix of some sort. \r\n\r\nwhatever was producing these lights made no sounds and resembled stars yet they had three lights almost as if you could imagine three stars bunched together per object forming a triangular object that was emitting this blue type of light that would pulsate and then retract/repeat itself as it moved in an odd fashion.\r\ntoo be honest i don't know what to think, as to what we saw but it was definitely not an airplane nor an actual star.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

returned from san francisco to sacramento.  i dropped my friends off at 25th st. and 5th ave. i was driving east on 5th ave.  up ahead, a person was trying to park his car and not doing too well.  i sat at the stop sign at 27th and 5th ave. to wait until he was done before i drove by him.  while i was sitting there for about 15 seconds, i noticed three small lights directly to the east, about a quarter of a mile ahead, fairly high in the sky.  at this point they looked to be the size of golf balls and were a pale orange.  a storm was coming in and there were clouds in the sky but also big patches of clear sky.  i was confused because at first i thought they were lights on a radio tower as there is a law school campus there (mcgeorge school of law).  however, i drove about 4 more blocks east on 5th avenue and came the the stop sign at franklin blvd. and 5th ave. now i could see that the three lights were orange orbs and were moving west.  at this point they looked to be the size of tennis balls.  i sat at the stop sign and watched them as they made a slight turn towards the north so that they were now traveling northwest above highway 99, a freeway that cuts through sacramento.  they weren't visible long before they disappeared into a cloud.  i turned onto franklin blvd. going north and then made an immediate right back onto 5th ave. so i was again heading east on 5th ave.  i crossed the bridge over highway 99 and got to 34th st. and 5th ave., right in front of mcgeorge school of law.  at this point, 2 more orange balls came out of a cloud headed on the same path as the first three.  i opened my window and listened for any sounds.  just like with the first three, there were no sounds.  these two didn't stay visible long.  they also went into the clouds after turning towards the northwest, basically the same direction as the first three.  i began to drive east again on 5th avenue.  i only got one more block when a 6th orange ball came out of the clouds. this one was lower, brighter, and appeared to be the size of a softball.  at first, it seemed to be heading right for my car.  i had stopped and again put my window down.  it flew overhead just to the left of my driver's side of the car.  i could see this one better.  it didn't turn towards the north like the others and there were no clouds suddenly at this moment.  i was in a dangerous neighborhood and needed to keep going, so i drove slowly east, looking over my left shoulder every few seconds until i got to where 5th ave. meets broadway.  here, i stopped again and watched it for a few more seconds. it appeared that it had stopped moving and was hovering right over downtown sacramento, about 2 miles west of 5th and broadway.  i finally just drove home and didn't look back again.  when i got home it was about 12:25 a.M. sunday, 12/13/2015.  i called the sacramento non-emergency police number and told the dispatcher what i'd seen. i asked if there had been any other reports and he said \"no.\"  i could tell he wasn't impressed.  regarding my feelings,reactions,and actions during and after the sightings: when i first saw the three lights, i felt confusion because i drive that route often and have never noticed \"radio tower\" lights.  i felt intrigued when i saw that the three lights were moving.  i did not feel scared.  i felt disappointed that i didn't have my camera or phone with me.  when i saw the second two, i felt amazed because i thought that there were only the first three.  when the sixth one came out of the clouds, it was different.  i felt some fear because it first appeared to be heading right for my car, only fairly high up.  i felt awe as i watched the sixth one go by.  when i got home and was getting out of my car, i did feel some fear and for a couple of nights after that, i was afraid to look up at the sky.  i also felt disappointment because i realized that i will most likely never seen them again and i knew that most people would not think that it was anything other than helicopters or something. one person mentioned drones.  i googled \"photos of drones flying at night\" and none of the pictures on google even come close to looking like what i saw. among the pictures on google of drones, i did see one photo with three orange orbs in it.  because these were supposed to be photos of drones, i clicked onto it thinking that i'd found the explanation to what i saw.  imagine my surprise when that picture turned out to be not one of drones flying at night, but it was a picture of orange ufos seen in oregon a few years ago.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

attraction for halloween, but after looking a bit longer we noticed there were points of more concentrated lights at each corner, so the light source was coming from above, not the ground. they maintained a square shape, and looked like 4 lights, but occasionally a light would travel from one corner to another in a random fashion, so there may have been as many as 8 lights total. they were ahead of us at first on the left, but as we approached the main intersection of hwy 43 with hwy 31 the lights were keeping pace with us. my daughter snapped a couple of photos with her phone. we crossed the intersection and the lights were still pacing us, as they continued to do for several more miles. then i looked back over and they were not there. we were relieved, but a few minutes later they were slightly ahead of us, kept pace for at least 5 more miles, then disappeared.

leaving to come home, i saw 25-30 circular lights in the sky overhead. instantaneously, and only for a second, i thought there must be some type of fireworks show going on. however, the lights did not disappear. at this point, i did not believe there was anything other-worldly about them (i just thought it was unusual and i wanted to see what these things were). i pulled the car into the nearest stop (a hess gas station). my 2 children and i got out of the car and saw what now only seemed to be about 10 -15 fireballs in the sky directly over our head. i knew then that this was something spectacular as these fireballs seem to move deliberately in pairs of two or three and at a very slow pace. they emitted no sound, but they definitely moved in patterns that were not random and there was an ebb and flow to their movement. again, all these fireballs seemed to be grouped together in packs of 2 or 3 and seemed to be interacting with one another. as they went over our head, they seemed to suddenly disappear. by the time i got my i-phone out to take a video, only a couple remained in the sky. i am attaching that video so that you can get an idea of their movement, but unfortunately they appear smaller in the video than what we saw with our own eyes. the entire sighting took less than 5 minutes, and by the end of the 5 minutes, both my children were anxious. consequently, we got back in the car and headed home as i did not want to unnecessarily frighten my children.\r\n\r\ni watched the news that night looking for a report on what i saw (i even suspected there might be some breaking news on it as this was over downtown raleigh, a very public place). however, there was no mention of it. i even e-mailed my video to the local weather guy (a friend of mine), but he did not comment on it. i just let it go until it came up today in a conversation with a friend.  it was suggested i report it, so that is what i am doing now.","distance":"101-500

in the night sky. as i looked up into the sky i noticed one star which didn't look the same as the rest of them.  it had a golden yellowish hue to it and was visible to the southeast across the lake.  it wasn't the whiter color of the natural stars.  i looked at this light and said to myself that is no star and as i thought and wondered what this thing was it began to move closer to my current location.  i remember thinking i am not afraid and just having a feeling of curiosity about it.  it moved in a straight line across the sky absolutely silently.  i heard no engine noise saw no red or green lights like you would see on an aircraft.  it was a solid golden orb which had three very distinct radiating points of light from the center of the orb which tapered to a point.  so the light was wide at the point where it left this orb and narrowed to a point like a sword at the end.  i watched this thing move silently and wondered what sort of mess the government is playing around with now.  sorry i have never seen an alien and personally believe that the government is behind ufo sightings.  so i have never seen anything like this and yes i used to work for an airline so i know what planes look like as well as blimps and helicopters.  i recently watched the geminids meteor shower as well and this was none of those things.  it moved far to slowly and silently so all i can say is it was a ufo.  i watched as the thing moved into a low hanging cloud and i didn't see it after that.  i reported it on my facebook the day after it happened but simply wrote it up as a golden light seen in the sky.  i have since deleted my facebook page so confirming the actual date will only be possible if facebook holds onto old files.  there was another incident which occurred a few nights later as i was out swimming in the lake.  i was floating out in the water and gazing up at the stars as i floated on my back and i very clearly and distinctly saw a silvery-white flash of some ellipse shaped object above and to the north of my location.  i figured at the moment that it was merely a meteor yet i knew that it wasn't because it didn't streak across the sky it was a stationary object which flashed once in the night sky.  after i wrote it off as a possible light anomaly of the retina it did it yet again.  this time it had moved more to the east but not more than 200 feet from the previous place in which i had seen it the first time.  so when i say it flashed i must say that only the object itself lit up not the air or space around it as you would get with a camera flash.  when it flashed it gave the clear flash of the entire surface area of whatever it was that was up in the sky.  in other words it the object itself lit up without lighting up the area around it.  i have never seen anything like this before or since.  it looked like what people describe as a flying saucer.  my joke is that for all i know it was george bush flying around on a pleasure cruise in some secret military technology.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
