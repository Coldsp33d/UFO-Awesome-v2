 i saw the one they say was a missile on november 7.  it looked like a helicopter with a spotlight on it right over my front yard when i saw it here in los molinos which is northern california.  looked like it was gonna land out front.  then i ran for my binoculars and when i came out it had moved west and was going straight up and it looked like a missile to me with the binoculars.  but that's a whole other event. sorry.  anyway, about five minutes after the fireball flew over, what looked to be a chemtrail plane flew over where the fireball disappeared going from south to north leaving a thick chemtrail  behind it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":73297,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0295683,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12222015-0015","longitude":-122.0920166,"occurred":1450742400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1450827754000,"summary":"Fireball flew overhead","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"CA","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Los Molinos, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:339"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Fernley","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Fernley nevada . 6:30 pm app. took dogs of in front yard.  saw the light approaching from a great distance to the north west of me.  heading south east.  extremely bright, bright, large orange solid light, it was so bright i could see the trail of something behind it being illuminated a great distance behind the object.    i watched it from one horizon to the other north west to south east. took less that 2 minutes. i did take a short video but it was so high up you can see it but cant see the clarity.  i think it may have been a rocket, or missal, a very large very fast missal. if not that then a ufo.  after it passed over my position it became extremely bright and white.  i believe it was out of the atmosphere.   i waited to hear any sound as i knew how high this thing was and there was no sound.  surprising for its speed and size.    i would not be making this report without merit.  this was something  large fast and way up there. i am sure other people saw this thing and would think you will receive other reports.

11 night and i wait on him. as i first opened my back door a half-ball that was a real dark blood red looking to my right just floating towards my house from the s/e. going towards the n/e.At first i thought it was a plane or chopper but i did not see any of the lights they have on them or any noise coming from it and the half-ball was just above the tree`s floating along making no sounds .As i went out the door more, i then saw a very white cloud to my left that had black lines though it going around the cloud like a strip but faded at the edges and it was the only cloud in the sky ,it was very low to the ground which i thought was strange.It also was just above the tree line.And it looked to be over the river.I saw no other clouds or stares out.At first i thought i was just seeing things.Then as i watched the half-ball starting in the front of the ball away from me i saw a fast white light flash then soon as it went out i saw another light flash behind the ball soon as it went out i saw a light closer to me in front of the ball flash i kept looking also to my left to see what the white cloud was doing.It had gotten bigger round then before and closer to me .Just when i thought i was just seeing things again.The lights flashed the same as before again and as i looked to my left again.The cloud had opened up like a big funnel,and the half-ball floated to the front of it and in a blink of an eye it was at the other end of the cloud funnel no bigger then a car from being bigger then my house before.I kept watching it to see if it would come out the other side but it did not .As i kept watching the cloud it just closed up the closet to me and in a few seconds it swilled all together and just disappeared.I sat there for a while to see if anything would show back up.But that was it.All i can say is i saw a u.F.O and i saw it go into what i feel and believe to this day was a worm hole.And yes i have not reported it till now.For one i don`t want anyone making fun of me .And i wanted to see if anyone else had reported seeing what i did.I saw nothing on the news or in the papers or on one of your t.V shows.No i did not tell my wife.She is a no-believer of

outside i looked into the sky and thought \"what a bright star, must be a planet\", but something was off about it. it was bright yellow with a hot white center and it didn't twinkle, but rather it pulsates ever so slightly. i was completely in awe of it. there was indeed an airplane in the sky, but this light did not come from the commercial airliner i saw. i didn't see the plane until after the light had vanished. it was in the sky to the west. it was very bright and lighting the neighborhood up slightly even though it appeared to be very far away. after vanishing i saw a commercial airplane in the sky where it had been, but then it was in the south sky and the airplane was still off to the west.  i tried very hard to explain it away like maybe it was ball lightning, but the research i did on that just doesn't add up to what i witnessed at all. i've seen spacecrafts\r\nbefore. i'm a septic of all things, an atheist even, but i know there are beings out there. i've seen it too many times. the evidence is right in front of me, i can't ignore what is physically there. i saw a chrome like spacecraft once and my wife was with me and she saw it too, it got very close to the top of our car on a country road. i feel like i'm being watched. i'm really not paranoid, this is something that's happening to me and until now, i've never reported it for fear of being called a lunatic.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

manitoba (canada)\r\n\r\nsighted on saturday, august 1951\r\nshape: disc | duration: 30 minutes\r\n\r\nnote: i originally sent a letter containing the following information to the center for ufo studies, box 1402, eviston, illinois, usa c/o dr. j. a. hynek in the late 1970's or early 1980's. i never received confirmation that the letter was received.I have included the following account of my 1951 observation. place: brandon, manitoba time: saturday morning(7 am), summer of 1951 length of observation: approximately 30 minutes description of object: saucer shaped, wingless aircraft, 4 ft. to 6 ft. in diameter, 2 ft. to 3 ft. in height, bottom half: black, top half: clear canopy with a 1 ft. square black box centered under the canopy, no insignias on the craft. speed of craft: varied from 0 mph to max. of 5 mph propulsion: no sound, smell, light or visible means of propulsion description of observation: me and another 5 year old boy (cannot recall his name) were playing catch with a ball in front of fleming elementary school located in south west brandon, manitoba. the craft was first observed by the other boy when he missed catching the ball that i had thrown to him. i asked him why he had missed the easy catch and he told me to look over my right shoulder into the sky. the object was first seen as round and black, about the size of a quarter, against a white cloud. the craft slowly descended until it reached about 30 ft above us and about 30 ft to the west. the craft was tilted on a 45 degree to the ground. it leveled off and stayed motionless for a few minutes. it then began to move at about 5 mph directly over our heads until it stopped across the street a few inches above some power lines. it wobbled slightly as it hovered in this position for about 30 minutes. during this time i threw a rock at the craft but was unable to reach it. i shouted to the other boy to notify some adults residing in the nearby houses but he did not want to leave the area. i started to feel afraid, thinking it might be a russian bomb, and crossed the street to a park about 50 ft away from the craft and sat on the grass without taking my eyes off the craft. the craft hovered a few inches over the power lines. after about 20 minutes the craft started to move at a right angle ne away from the power lines at a speed of about 5 mph and ascended over my head, disappearing into the clouds. when i arrived home my father was angry. he told me that i was away from home for several hours and that i should learn to tell time. i was unaware that i was away for that length of time. the next morning, just before sunrise, i was visited in my bedroom by a man in black standing at the foot of my bed. i heard a sound, which woke me up, like many bees buzzing. small, lit dust-like particles were swarming at the foot of my bed. the particles converged forming the image of the man in black. at first he was translucent, ghost-like, and wore a black suit. he then became solid. he had white hair in a pompadore style. he did not make a noise but moved his right arm in a slow upward motion of greeting. a whiteish, blue light was emitted from his direction. i was so scared that i hid under the covers of my bed in terror. i must of finally fell asleep and when i awoke everything was back to normal.","distance":"21-100
