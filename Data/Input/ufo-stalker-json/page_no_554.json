after the craft had moved very slowly over me a very short distance, it took off extremely fast and slightly to the right of the path it appeared to be on when it came.\r\ni became completely hysterical, screaming as i ran into the house. i yelled at my mom and dad screaming we have to call the police the government, somebody, everybody, anybody. nobody believed me, they did their best to calm me down and told me it must have been a plane. they were wrong! it was no plane. it wasn't shaped like a plane. it didn't sound like a plane and it didn't move like a plane in maneuvering or speed. my dad went out to look around and said he saw a transport plane out there in the distance. what i saw was long gone even before i began to run to the house. i never knew who i could share this with all these years. family or friends never believed my story, but i never forgot it to this day. i have no pictures of course- it came and went unexpectedly. i can draw a picture of it, but don't know how to summit that. i would never believe in ufo's had i not seen one for myself. i have never had any other experience since then. i don't remember my street address where this encounter took place, but could look it up from school records if i had to i'm sure, i just don't know how to do it.

looking up(like i always do)in the area of jupiter, and saw a [dim star} flash of white light in my field of view. i moved my eyes over to where the flash was and saw another flash. now i'm looking right at them.In the area of 7 o'clock of mars i saw 4 more flashes,(not timed, 5-15 seconds between flashes} all stationary. i held my arm out, pointing finger extended, the flashes were fingertip to 1st knuckle away from 7 o'clock of mars. then the flashes changed color to (not sure)and moved closer to mars 3-5 o'clock of mars and i saw 3 more flashes. again not timed,1st flash 5 o'clock, fingernail distance away from mars,2nd,3 o'clock closer to mars, 3rd flash almost over mars, maybe another flash after that, not sure, i had to blink. then i had to go back to work.\r\n   i've spent a lot of time looking up over the last 20-30 yrs., i've seen many interesting things. this was not a helicopter. these flashes were not in earth's atmosphere or orbit, they were very very far away. this is not a joke or a hoax, and not my imagination. i couldn't find anything on line that could confirm this. i was hoping maybe your organization could find a telescope that might have been watching mars that evening. if yes, please send me a video of this event. i want to see that again, because i think i saw just the end of this event      thank you for your

harvest time in central illinois, in the afternoon i had dropped off my semi in a soybean field for the farmer to fill up. about 10 pm my brother went with me in the pickup to go get the semi. it was a nice clear dark  night. prob 70 degrees no wind. the field was near the end of a one lane road only 5 miles off the highway. several houses scattered around the area. the terrain is nearly flat with many trees and wooded areas around. this field was in a clearing of trees about 150 acres. as i turned left off the road into field my semi was 100 feet ahead. just as the pickup turned into the gate we see giant lights straight ahead thru windshield. i freeze and stop the truck. there were 10 or 12 of them, in a straight line shining bright white light. it was double length of my semi, which is 70 feet, and was lighting up the semi and ground surrounding it. it was very close, about treetop high. there is no other equipment left and no crops standing. were out in a flat empty field. whatever or whoever behind the lights was apparently checking out the semi truck. within a minute or 2 of us pulling up the lights went out in pairs, starting at each end about 1 second apart until it was dark. just like each pair was on a separate switch and you flip them one at a time. the lights were similar in color and brightness to stadium lights in a football field and appeared about that high up. there was no sound, so moving air felt. we never saw a structure because the lights were too bright for our eyes to adjust maybe?? now when thinking back it seems very strange that we didn't see these lights as driving up the lane. we would have had a clear sight and at least would have seen the glowing. as we pulled in the field the lights were already there-they didn't light up or appear after we were there. then after the light went out i asked my brother'did you see that?\" he said \"yes\". i pulled on up beside the truck pretty shaken up. i didn't see any marks in the dirt. i climbed up the trailer and looked at the bean piles with flashlight but didn't see any footprints or any disruptions in the piles. they were rounded up nice and clean just as they should be. it was eerily still, or seemed that way at least. the semi started normally. no idea what this was. i watch alot of ufo programs these days and haven't heard anybody describe similar sightings to mine. but i know what i saw and have become a believer without a doubt. if it were our own secret government technology, what possible reason would they have to be checking out an outdated 1979 semi truck in a field loaded with soybeans? my primitive imagination suggests simply it was genuine curiosity. maybe they've never seen an old 2 cycle v8 diesel engine free of any electronic control and were trying to understand how it works. lol who knows. i kept this to myself because if i tried to tell this story to anyone they would immediately suspect i was smoking crack. crazy how successful this subject has been covered up. possibly the being themselves are able to manipulate humans. maybe they are already controlling everything, and created us to begin with. haha--we are designed to be incapable of comprehending anything beyond our own reality, right??? anyways i feel better sharing. maybe this will help another case somewhere thanks","distance":"21-100

latge glowing blue shere desended over the top of one of the nasa goldstone satalite dishies thar was rotated directly upward. the shere lit up the entire area to the point it caused shadows to be cast. it was roughly 10 - 11 pm on a clear sky with no moon. the exact day i do not remember. this was witnessed by well over 1000 soldiers. the shere desended then hovered over the dish for roughly 30 minutes. then elevated directly back into the sky until it could no longer be seen. the event itself caused mass communication messages to be broadcast over every frequency that the units involved in the training exersize. until highercommand ordered all communicate to be stopped. the messages were wide from people jomig about an alien invasion to people stating it was the end of the world. at one point people started preaching scripture. when the event began the airspace was clear of traffic. by the end of it there were high flying jet aircraft and low flying helecopters in the area. many poeple joked about this as it was a not so average occurance i this area. when asking about it later most people would just ignore it happened. others just didnt want to talk about it. some would write it off as a training event. the area itself has many unexplained issues. unmapped airfield that aircraft land but when you get to the area there is nothing. a supposed abandond camp established durring ww2 for japanese americans that were detained. a path cut through the north mountian range into a no fly no trasspass area that has heavy military ground fortifications around a group of buildings not on any maps.  \r\n\r\nwhile i was there i looked for some of these things. i was assigned as the s3 air shop in the plans and operations forone of the units and part of the job was putting together the maps for the area for training. also durting the exersizes i was one of the radio techs that monitored multipul frequencies. i have been all over the training areas an still remember many details. if there is anyplace that needs a look in should be here. the combined military control is the air force. army and the nasa communications center. the area of control scales 6x4

door and through the living room window ne from nanaimo bc. the area i had visibility of would be north of vancouver, canada, at least 26 miles away as that is how far it is to the mainland coast. \r\n\r\nas i was laying in bed i noticed what appeared to be a jet contrail fairly high (obviously to generate the contrail) originating from the ne and heading sw, a path that if followed would eventually lead somewhat over my location. the smoke trail was against the clear blue sky, although there was a low cloud bank this morning in question at what i would guess was 800 feet and lower (my residence is approximately 500 feet above sea level (measured by engineer)). i thought that this was an odd path as i have never seen an aircraft with that orientation. note that vancouver airport (yvr) is near the area in question (but not in my observable view and estimating some 50 miles from where i would say the 'object' was) and i watch aircraft take off and land on a regular basis. for an object to generate a contrail like i was witnessing i speculated it must be fairly high and neither from vancouver airport (yvr) nor going to it. i then mused it's point of origin, following a straight-line-guess would be somewhere in mid british columbia to northern alberta.  \r\n\r\npuzzled by this i got out of bed to go look at it with binoculars. using bushnell 10x25's i located the object and came to note that it appeared more of a smoke plume as left by a rocket launch than a jet contrail. while the column of smoke did not extend to the ground (or lower cloud cover as in my view), it did taper to nothing on the earth-end of it. on the higher point, where one would expect to see a rocket (for this kind of smoke column) there was simply a mushroomed-headed cloud end-point. at no time was an object ever observed, nor was an aircraft visible in the observable airspace.\r\n\r\ni then placed my binoculars down to obtain a second set of 15x25's. when i looked back through the window, raising the binoculars to my eyes, there was somewhat of a blink (as if a camera flash had gone off) and the smoke cloud/contrail was no longer visible. it simply vanished. this is hardly how i would have expected smoke/contrail to 'dissipate'. it was simply gone.\r\n\r\npoints to note:\r\n-at no time was an airborne vehicle (terrestrial or other) ever detected in the viewing area\r\n-at no time was the contrail/smoke cloud changing in size or orientation\r\n-the sun was south of the smoke trail, lighting it as one would expect with bright white and variants of grey\r\n-viewing distance guesstimate: 30 to 50 miles from me\r\n-length of smoke cloud guesstimate: greater than 300 metres\r\n-width guesstimate: from minimal to nothing on the terrestrial end of it, gradually growing to what i would guess as 100 metres before the \"mushroom head\" which was probably double that (200 metres)\r\n-all the while my wife was in bed playing on her tablet and while amused at my commentary, never actually shifted her position to look and verify it existed\r\n\r\n\r\n**this literally looked like there should be a rocket on the end of it heading skyward, but as a canadian... well there ain't no space program... or rocket program... or anything really....\r\n\r\ni can include a sketch given time (i just saw that was an option below)","distance":"Over One

to the right. i then assumed it was some kind of plane, but as the minutes passed, five to ten, then ten to fifteen, i realized that no flying object i had ever seen stayed in relatively the same place for that period of time. as i continued to watch, the object made some strange movements diagonally up in the sky, then over to the left and diagonally down again and continued to hover. judging by the intensity of the light it emitted, the object had to be humongous, but a distinct shape could not be made out because it was so far away. i'm guessing it could easily have been miles sw of my location. at one point during my observation, the direction of the light moved ever so slowly from shining to the west to the east, until i could see just a sliver of light, which makes wonder if it was disc-shaped. slowly it came around until i could again see the light fully, which appeared like the largest and brightest star i had ever seen. in the end, i observed this object for over one hour, until it had moved so far to the west that i could hardly see it from where i lay in bed. i fell asleep before it disappeared from the sky.","distance":"Over One
