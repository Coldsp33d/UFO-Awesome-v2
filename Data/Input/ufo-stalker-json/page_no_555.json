building and saw this prominent orange orb moving in the sky. i had had a couple beers earlier, but can assure you i had my wits about me.\r\n\r\nit caught my eye because i had seen orbs like this before in ct a few years earlier. it looked very similar to the orbs i'd seen before because of its color, size, and movement. that event, however, was different in that there were more identical orbs making even stranger motions in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe event lasted only a minute. i took out my phone after a few seconds of staring in disbelief, and incredibly, my phone said it's memory was full and wouldn't let me take photo or video. i looked up a couple times in the process of trying to delete memory from my phone, and i saw it slowly progressing across the sky over my head, but when i finally got my phone's camera ready, it had faded away and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni looked in the other direction but did not see it re-appear. for a couple minutes, i kept an eye on the same spot in the sky where it initially appeared and did not see anything else. i noticed the distinctive lights of airplanes in the sky after the event, which were clearly different from what i'd just seen, so that reaffirmed the reality if the situation. the object's flight-path was straight, oddly sluggish, and it eventually, and slowly, faded into the black of the night sky, around 80 degrees from the horizon.\r\n\r\nit seemed like it was flying at a similar altitude to airplanes that i've observed regularly flying around the city. \r\n\r\nthere seemed to be the slightest outline of a light orange rectangle inside of the orange glow of the orb, too. it seemed far away and difficult to make out, but it looked like two squares connected to form a rectangle, or just a rectangle with a line running through it, dividing it into two equal squares. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

star like object that was jetting back and forth, stopping on a dime, then up and down and then went backwards again, then finally took off out of sight at crazy speeds.  since then we, well mostly me, have been paying attention.  i have seen many “moving stars” but none as fast as that first one.  so i kind of gave up until last summer on calm evenings and nights i began to hear what sounds like pulsating emp’s in your eardrum coming from across the lake in the miles of uninhabited sand dunes.  when it first starts out it almost sounds like you can hear your own heartbeat but as it peaks in intensity it is clear for about 10 minutes to the point you can point at the direction it is coming from as sounds travel great across a lake.  i have pointed it out to mother and girlfriend and they are just as baffled. it started last summer and haven’t heard it because i have not been outside much lately, especially at night.  also the fall time is almost always windy around here, which blocks out noise well, but the other night was calm and i went outside and seemed like the sound has even grown in intensity since last summer.  just think someone should check it out cause it is unlike anything i have ever heard and doesn’t go with any technology i know of.\"","distance":"Over One

myself decided to check out the meteor shower that was supposedly going to be the biggest of the year. we left calgary, alberta heading west out of the city towards canmore/kananaskis country. we stopped a few places a couple mins off the highway each time and watched the meteors until we went to our final location down the highway a bit more. we watched the meteors for another 20-25 mins and were almost ready to leave because we were really cold. we wanted to see one more meteor before we left, when my friend saw a couple over his shoulder which drew our gaze to the west/northwest direction. we stared in that direction waiting for another meteor when i thought i noticed a white light in the sky move. i stared at it for another 10-15 seconds and thought maybe i just imagined it when it moved again. i kept my gaze on it thinking it was maybe a satellite, but it couldn't have been because it was completely still until it moved up and down again. i quickly brought it to my friends attention and as soon as we both started watching it, it started moving up and down and side to side in a very sporadic way. shortly after we were staring at this light he noticed two dimmer lights, one to the left and one above and to the left making a perfect triangle with the bright one on the right hand side. all 3 danced perfectly in sync with each other when we both noticed you could see the outline and the shape of a triangle/pyramid floating in the sky. it was around 9pm so it was pitch black outside and the moon was covered by fog/clouds so there wasn't much light in the sky. even with it being so dark we both easily noticed a different shade of black to the sky exactly where the pyramid was floating, we even looked away multiple times and back and could easily recognize the full 3 dimensional shape floating in the sky without hesitation. we were both in awe and kind of freaked out at the same time but could not stop watching it. i pulled my phone out and tried to capture it but it was so dark outside and the object had to be roughly 5-10 kilometers away but from what we could tell the size of it was huge. we watched it for roughly 1-2 minutes moving around, until it stopped. we then watched it for another 3-4 minutes before deciding to leave as we were freezing cold at this point. we talked about it on the drive back to calgary, and we both noticed how it was definitely a 3 dimensional object as one of the faces we could see was pointing south and the other was pointing east and we were facing north-west looking at the direct corner of it.","distance":"Over One

i had no phone to record and i just watched. \r\nas it retraced about half of its course, it suddenly stopped, started becoming silver, glowing like an ice cream cone and just started dropping down

issues with mental illness or drugs..So..\r\n\r\ni awoke to noise outside our apartment window..From my bed, which i shared with my wife, i saw blinking or pulsating yellow/orangish lights outside..They appeared to be 30 or so feet away..The noise could be described as humming or vibrating...The object was not in my sight line.  the light it was putting out was bright, but not affecting our room..Sort of aimed past it or just getting lighter and brighter.\r\n\r\ni had a strange sensation and felt unable to move, react or respond...Almost like a paralysis.  i felt myself being lifted off the bed...I remember saying something to the effect of \"uh oh, here we go...\" and suddenly i dropped.\r\n\r\nlater, i just believed it to be a dream..That type of dream is common, i have read.  i wrote off the lights as the garbage men (not sure how i came up with that one) and realized i could not have been \"levitated\" out the window (which were open) due to the screens.\r\n\r\nbut at some point, i read about people actually finding themselves outside after some type of contact, and they had screens, too.  then the garbage men theory i had somehow come up with to rationalize my memory of the noise and lights made no sense...They never would have worked at night like that.  the last bit of information which made it even stranger was relating it to my wife...She said when i made the comment in bed, she reached to comfort me and i was up 12 to 16 inches in the air, but dropped when she grabbed me.\r\n\r\nso there it is...For some reason, she is uncomfortable talking about it and refuses to rehash or discuss it anymore.  we did relate the story to a small group of friends about 12 or so years ago, during a discussion about strange occurances...But this is the only other time i have shared my story.","distance":"21-100
