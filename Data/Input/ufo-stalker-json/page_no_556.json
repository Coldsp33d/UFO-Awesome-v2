sky was relatively clear with a few scattered clouds; there was no fog that night.  i was east-bound on higbee drive at gayland drive when i noticed a white object in the sky to my north and stopped my vehicle the study it when i realized that it could not be the moon. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be a self-illuminated sphere that was a consistent shade of bright-white across the object.  initially, it was stationary and motionless; i observed no detectible movement by the object.  at the time i estimated that if it was a helium-filled balloon it would have been at a distance of 100 yards from me, about 3 feet in diameter and about 100 feet above the ground.  after observing the object stationary for about 3 minutes it started moving due west at a slow rate of speed, perhaps 3 to 5 mph.  i made a u-turn and followed/paralleled the object.  during this movement the object never seemed to vary its speed or altitude and i did not see any change in the illumination.  it moved about 600 feet and stopped again.  about 60 seconds after stopping, the object began to drip molten metal.  i assess that it was molten metal because i could see sparks fly off the dripping material as it fell.  i have never seen burning plastic or any burning/molten material other than metal throw sparks in the same way.  it continued to drip molten metal slowly, but steadily for about 30 seconds before stopping.  after a few more seconds the lighted sphere began to dim as if someone was turning a rheostat/dimmer very slowly and evenly.  it took about one minute for the object to go completely dark, to the point where i could no longer make out the outline of the object against the dark night sky.  during this time it took the object to completely dim it did not appear to change altitude or move.  it appeared to be completely stationary.  \r\n\r\nthe total time of this event was about 7 or 8 minutes, perhaps a little longer.  i had my windows down during this event and heard no sounds that were unusual or out of the ordinary.  at one point during its transition the object crossed the path of at least one above-ground electric power line.  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet,

neighbor was a good mile away. the nearest towns were muncy and montoursville. the closest city was williamsport which was about 45 min away. \r\n\r\ni was 10 years old. my bedroom was on the 2nd story. when i layed in bed i could see directly out one of the windows in my room onto the green hill that sloped down and then up to cow pasture and high hill. i could also see a solitary pear tree in our front yard about 10-20 yards from the house. \r\n\r\none evening i was woken up by a vibrating sound. i opened my eyes and i saw a huge black craft hovering above the pear tree. it was so big that i could only view part of it through the frame of the the window. it was sleek, black, and it had colored flashing lights on it. \r\n\r\ni sat up in bed and stared. i was frozen. i'm getting goosebumps as i write this so many years later. i knew immediately that it was a ufo. i had read about ufo's in books at the library. \r\n\r\nthen there is a period of time i don't quite remember. \r\n\r\nthen i remember being downstairs. my mother was asleep on the recliner. i woke her up screaming \"mom there's a ufo- look!\" and i ran to the window and opened the blinds. there was nothing there. \r\n\r\nmy mother told me to go to bed, i must have had a bad dream. i tried to tell my parents again the next day but they didn't listen. \r\n\r\nfor years i told this same story over and over again at parties or to random people but i could never tell it with confidence because i had no proof. \r\n\r\nthen one day 15 years later i was at a friend's house hanging out. i went to the restroom and sitting on the toilet was a magazine that read \"williamsport wave.\" the year read \"1992.\" i was shocked. on the cover were drawings of the craft i saw. it was the mufon journal. i came out of the bathroom screaming \"you are never going to belive this!!!\" \r\n\r\nmy friend had picked up the journal randomly at half priced books. he didn't know anything about it- he just thought it looked cool and it was $1. in that journal i read other accounts that matched with mine. the sightings even trace a flight path directly through the middle of nowhere that my family lived. \r\n\r\ni finally

on sky discovery one of the people said they saw a cigar shape craft. this made me think of what i saw many years ago here in new zealand. you may or may not need this info, tho i thought i would put here for you any way.\r\n  i was working on my parents dairy farm. it was spring time here,the year was between 1978 to 1980, tho i can not remember the exact year now. i can not remember the exact month tho would of been between late september to mid november and i had just finished feeding the calves and was walking to the house on the drive way. it was just on 7pm. it was a very clear and dark night full of stars. i always looked up at night to see if any thing in the night as ufo's had been seen years before, if you want to know about this one get in touch and i will tell you tho i was even younger then.\r\n as i was about to turn towards the house i looked up and right above my head and going over our house was this big cigar shape craft. i thought it may of been a space craft, human made, tho i was not sure as back then i thought all ufo's were of disk shape.\r\n this craft was moving slowly and silently in the night moving north or north east. what stood out was the four lights in the shape of triangles, one each end of the cigar shape and one each in the middle, top and bottom.\r\n the bottom triangle light was wide base and pointing at the top, the normal way you would draw a triangle, the one above it was like up side down with the wide base at the top and the point pointing down to the bottom. the two on the end were also pointing inwards with the point and wide base on the outside ends of the craft, if you can understand what i mean.\r\n as for the colour of the lights i can not remember sorry or if they were flashing or not, i feel they were flashing tho not sure sorry. some things are clear as in my thoughts while some finer details like the light colours are not.\r\n i know this is a very long time ago and you may not want this, i just thought you may want to put on your records.\r\n years earlier there was another sighting of a white light late at night moving slowly a long the mountain here then slowly going over the top and out of sight. my mother talked to a lady the next day who lived at the end of the mountain who also watched it, her dogs were barking crazy. she went outside and heard no noise, just the white light moving slowly.\r\n  my mother rang the airport in rotorua the next day to see if there was any helicopters out the night before and was told there was none out, tho she said they rang back an said there was. this we did not believe as there was no noise at all and dogs do not normally bark at a helicopter.....\r\n i do remember my mother telling me of another sighting of a bright yellow /orange light over the lake tho she did not say much more than that, all these sightings were very long ago, i do not live in that area now, tho not far as the mountain, mt tarawera, is still in sight from a different view at times.\r\n i have always thought there is more out there than just us humans, i do hope they are friendly, not like us humans who will kill all that lives on this planet with animals and

tower light, though it seemed higher in the sky than that could be. tried to look below it and then saw a very faint red light going down,spiraling towards the ground, and i wondered if i was then seeing the reflection from a tower structure. that didn't seem possible at that distance at about 8:35 pm at night. suddenly the light started moving down and north and i really had to crane my neck to see what was happening. it seemed to get just above treetop height and then flashed and disappeared, like it was moving away from me. \r\n\r\ni felt taken aback and heart started beating faster when i realized that it was not anything i could explain and was clearly not a red tower light.\r\ni looked to the southeast and saw 3-4 radio towers in the distance and they were very different from

the first time in many years.\r\n\r\ni was parked by lake erie; there is a park behind the willowick police station. i just happened to pull in and thought i would sit there and look at the lake and relax.\r\n\r\nit was something like 5:30(ish) in the afternoon, it had been a pretty clear day and turning into a clear evening.\r\n\r\nbefore seeing the object i felt a little... i really don't know how to put it, off..  like lets say you are looking through a camera and you zoom out, maybe so things are like 20-30 feet further from you.. now imagine this effect all the way around you (really strange and i don't know how else to explain it). with this came the feeling that you would get if you were around a bunch of high energy transformers that would make your hair stand on end, but without the hair standing.. just the sort of feeling of energy, again sounds really strange and even more stupid typing it.\r\n\r\nthen i noticed off to the left maybe 30 degrees from my looking forward the object. it was not huge but not small. i had lots of feelings at that moment. primarily how in the heck did i not see this until now? did it just appear? did it fly in? was it there the entire time/ i don't have an answer to that.\r\n\r\nnow for more strange stuff. at first it appeared as if the object was sort of oval shaped. it had a glowing blueish light around the entire bottom edge. now i don't know if it turned and that exposed the true shape (more like a triangle-ish shape but with curved no pointy corners or if it changed shape. \r\n\r\nlet's just say it turned because that is what appeared to have happened; then it began moving across the sky more towards dead in front of me, but away at the same time. it was moving at a good pace but nothing record breaking. as it moved away however it became more and more faint (as in transparent) until it just was not there.\r\n\r\nwhile this was happening and i would say the whole thing lasted less than 5 minutes i felt like it was just me and this craft and nothing else existed. this feeling i am sure was because i was so taken by what i saw that i did not realize my surroundings.\r\n\r\ni want to say the craft made a humming sound but i am not sure that it did. it almost felt like the hum was inside me???? like if you are in an airplane that low level hum that just resonates through your body, if you know what i mean?? like that but very quiet and i was not in this thing.\r\n\r\nnow as i said this all took place over what i would think to be about 5 minutes, i was sitting in my car maybe 5 minutes before it started and a couple minutes after it was gone. i live about 15 minutes from this location, and i drove straight home.  another odd fact i got home at 8:15.\r\n\r\ni have not ever been to a site like this and while i believe life forms exist in many places outside of our own planet it is not something i really give any thought to. i mean we are here so i am sure there are life forms elsewhere thinking; i wonder if there is anything out there.\r\n\r\ni don't know what to make of this and i am equally sure it is nothing. so the question is what in the heck was it?","distance":"101-500
