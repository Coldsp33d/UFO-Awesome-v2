work the morning of december 1, 2015. i didn't start work until 9:00am, and had arrived shortly before 8:30am to the parking garage...I had some extra time...So i figured i'd get my phone out, send a snapchat to my friends back home, and show them just how dark it is in alaska at 830 in the morning. the stars looked unusually bright and stand out-ish to me for some reason that morning, i felt compelled to take a photo before starting the snapchat. when recording the snapchat, i am panning from the left, where you can see the moon in the top left corner, and moving to the right, away from the larger buildings, towards the water. i was watching my phone screen while i was recording, so i only saw one ufo dart across initially. it moved so fast, my eyes could hardly perceive it...It almost seemed like a bug that flew across my screen, and maybe i was just really tired. oh well, put the phone away and lets go to work! i didn't check my phone again until i was at work, and i replayed the video and immediately saw more ufos. i replayed the video over, and over, and over, trying to make sense of what i was seeing...And then i found i could zoom in while the video was playing, and it confirmed any doubts i had. upon zooming into the video, the ufos become more clear in definition and in pattern. to confirm i wasn't looking at light refractions either, one of the ufos even darts behind the top of the sheraton building, disappearing momentarily behind the building, and then reappearing again. i was the only witness to this event and even i did not believe what my own eyes had seen, it took me around 12 hours of watching the video to fully accept that i had just witnessed ufos, and weeks of re-watching it to come forth with it. when i looked at the very first photo i took, the photo before i recorded video, you can see multiple ufos hovering over downtown. the clearest definition of the ufos i found was in taking \"screenshots\" of the 9 second video clip and zooming in. the ufos appear to have clear, definitive patterns, shapes, and lines. they are glowing brighter than anything i have ever seen in the sky. i lost sight of the objects as soon as they were out of my iphone camera's line-of-sight.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then

ago.\r\n\r\nshe and her sister live in chaiyaphum province north east thailand\r\n\r\nabout 20km from her house a large mountain range starts with mountains going up to almost 2km in hight.\r\n\r\ntoday during night time she and her sister witnessed a glowing large object that appeared to be stationery in the air far above the mountains.\r\n\r\nthe object they described as being horn or v shaped which they couldn't really tell because it was so far away\r\n\r\nthey said it looked like it was on fire and the light even at that distance was very bright.\r\n\r\nwhen they ran inside to get a camera phone the object was gone when they got back outside.\r\n\r\nat that moment my girlfriend contacted me in the netherlands and she appeared to me as rather shocked of what she just saw.\r\n\r\ni tried to figure out what she saw and that led me to believe they might have seen the giant v shaped ufo from the phoenix lights event years ago.\r\n\r\ni looked for a picture on the internet and found one they said looks almost exactly the same as the object they seen.\r\n\r\nthe object either had redish fire color like lights or in my opinion it could have been moving through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend said that the object appeared not to move but considering the distance and angle of view it might have been moving up slowely without them noticing it.\r\n\r\nthe

incredible speed and disappeared. at first i was stunned and just stood there trying to take understand what i just saw.I know what i saw was real,i haven't told anyone about this not sure what i should do about that. i also experienced a ufo while in the usaf by the gulf of mexico on several occasions i notified base authority's which at that point classified what i saw ss top secret and i received top secret clearance as well after background check. at that point my work was kept top secret along with my new position with the usaf.Details not available after that point. that was in 1976 at kessler air force base bilox mississippi. this episode brought back uncomfortable feelings. was stunned to see this again,all i can say at this time. world is changing rapidly and the majority of people have no clue what is going on behind the scenes....No evidence to support this as of now may possibly send in evidence of drawing but not now.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

headed relatively fast towards west, seemed to be quite high up in the air, and i couldn’t hear any sound. (i was in a car so that may have been the reason.) the two objects were close to each other and kept the same distance and configuration. they were both identical in appearance: oval, dark in color, somewhat metallic looking. at the time, i and the driver of the car had no idea what they may be. they didn’t look like anything i had seen before, and i couldn’t think of anything known they could be. they went too fast for being a balloon. they were definitely not birds. it was daylight so they were not obviously planets or meteors. they were not civilian drones since they went fast and continued over the mountains. they did not have the shape of any airplane i have seen.\r\n\r\nthinking back now, it is possible that they were two helicopters and we didn’t see the rotors or any of the things normally protruding from helicopters. it’s possible, but it does seem unlikely that we wouldn’t have seen any of those things and the perfect oval shape of both objects didn’t fit the shape of helicopters i have seen. it is possible that they were military drones flying in perfect formation and with no visible or audible form of propulsion. i don’t know if military drones comes in a perfectly oval shape. it was certainly an odd sight.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":73155,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.729014500000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12152015-0001","longitude":-116.37325560000001,"occurred":1449910860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1450142971000,"summary":"Two oval shape objects heading west.

quadcopter. i flew south over the river and over a lake formed by a sand and gravel pit then turned north and flew back over my house. i cut out some of the video, added some music and showed the video to friends. no-one  noticed anything unusual. later as i was examining the video to see how i could make another one that would be better i noticed a fast moving object heading almost straight at me from 12 o'clock ending a short distance to my left at 9 o'clock. this object appeared white in color and flew a straight line while in the video. the object appeared extremely fast moving. this observation deeply concerned me and i showed it to my wife and a close friend that i have a great respect for to get their opinion. both stated that it looked very unusual to them. my friend asked \"what the he** was that?\" \r\n\r\nthe object appears in the video over the far side of the lake. the lake is right at 700 yards across at that point. i was shooting at 30 frames per second and the object is in view for 6 frames. adding a 7th frames to ensure it was past the near shoreline i calculate that it took 0.233 seconds to travel the 2100 feet. if my math is correct that means it was traveling at approximately 9,068 mph or 11.92 mach.\r\n\r\ni am including a clip of the video that shows the encounter and i cut the frame out where the object was closest to me. there is a screen shot of that plus i used filters in photoshop that helps remove blur from an object (high pass and unsharp mask). those are also included.\r\n\r\nthere were white seagulls flying around the lake at the time, but in the video, as well as physical observations since, i see no behavior that resembles this observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or

straight up into the air, which i thought was pretty cool. when i went in the house and told my dad and uncle about what i saw, they told me it was swamp gas. being 8 years old what did i know. however that night while my brother and i were sleeping on the sofa bed, something woke us up. at that time there was a person standing next to the sofa bed. as this scared me and my brother, i stood up on the sofa bed which made me about 6 feet tall, which would have made the person about 7 or 8 feet tall,  i still had to look up at the person. at that time not knowing who this was i told my brother to run to our dad's bedroom and i followed him out of the room. i could not see the person's face as he was wearing a hooded robe  that covered his face. i have never had another encounter.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Backstory:  two or three nights prior to the incident, my friend (i'll call her \"a\") and i drove to pick up her niece from her boyfriend's house.  i drove my car.  we picked up the niece and on the way home, \"a\" suggested we take another back road that was a shorter route.  this particular route was done a lonely country road through a very rural farming community.  we approached a railroad crossing and just before i drove over the tracks, i saw the silhouette of an airplane flying directly above the treetops in front of us.  i stopped at the stop sign to watch what i assumed was a military issued plane** flying at an alarmingly low altitude (barely above the treetops). the strangest thing was, the plane's engines weren't running--there was no sound.  i turned off the car engine and poked my head out the window to better be able to hear and i was really confused as to how this military plane** could possibly be flying so low without any engines running and not crash?  we all watched the plane as it flew over a patch of pine woods, until we could no longer see it.  we all thought it was strange, but nonetheless, we didn't dwell on it and we went on with the ride home without thinking any more of it.\r\n\r\n**it should be noted parenthetically that we didn't actually see any identifiable markings on the plane that would authenticate it as being a u.S. military aircraft.  i make that assumption based on the shape of the plane being consistent with other u.S. military aircraft and its dark color.\r\n\r\ntwo or three days later:  my friend \"a\" and i are, again, in my car.  we were heading out of town to look for jobs.  we decided to take a back road through the woods and farmsteads, since it would connect us quicker to the highway than the normally traveled route (not the same road from a few nights earlier, but around the same area).  we'd used this road before with no incident.  it was a perfectly clear day, around 1:00pm or 1:30pm and the weather was warm and bright.  we were both very eager to apply for jobs that day.  \r\nthe road we traveled was a dirt road (red clay) that cut through some very isolated terrain.  to our left was a single farm house and an expansive corn field and to our right was a pine forest.  we had only been driving this part of the road for about four minutes (we'd just passed the farm house) when i saw what looked like the same military plane flying out from over the pine woods to our right.  it was again flying just a few hundred feet above the tree tops with no sound.  this time, i immediately stopped the car, shut off the engine and we both exited the car and stood in the middle of the road, in the middle of the day, to see just what the hell was going on.  again, we were so perplexed as to how this plane could just glide smoothly without any engines running and manage to stay at the same altitude??  the plane glided (like a hang glider) over the outer edge of the pine woods, along the edge of the road, headed in our direction.  as we stood and watched, i barely noticed a flash of white somewhere over the pine wood, just on the other side of the plane.  i didn't give it any attention because i was so transfixed on this plane with strange flying habits.  \"a\" suddenly asked, \"what is that thing?\", to which i dismissively replied, \"it's probably a bird\" (there were large white crane-like birds in the area).  my friend shouts, \"that's not a f*cking bird!\"  \r\ni take my eyes off the plane to take a look at the white object (i was a little irritated that she was distracting me, while i'm trying to figure out what this plane is doing).  just as the plane veers back over the pine wood, this \"thing\" flies from over the tree tops, directly beneath the plane and out into the clear, right above us.  the plane has now disappeared over the tree tops and out of sight and we never saw it, again.  it was (this is the best i can describe it) a white object that was shaped like a dumbell or a peanut that was turned on its side, horizontally.  it moved at a slow, but steady pace and in a straight line, from right to left.  since it flew just below the plane, i could tell easily, that it was about the size of a standard yellow school bus (approximately 30-35 feet long).  it had no markings, no windows, no seams, no rivets, no hatches, no engines or exhaust--nothing--just a solid object, colored white, that was low enough that its appearance could be easily determined.  as we watched (neither of us spoke for the next ten minutes), the object changed from a solid white to silver (like mercury) and reflections of the pine trees and corn field could be seen on its surface!!!  after a few moments, the object (still moving steadily, but painfully slow) \"changed color\" again, this time, however, it turned \"opalescent\" and seemed to shimmer in hues of pastel pink, blue and white.  that's when it became completely transparent, like glass, and only a faint outline could be seen.  it bears repeating that this was a perfectly clear day with not even a single cloud in the sky--not one.  the object \"shimmered\" back into view and was again, opalescent and then, silver colored, then white, again.  this pattern repeated itself for the duration of the sighting.  the object has now made its way across the dirt road and over the vast corn field.  all of a sudden, from the left of the sky, there was a white \"cloud\" (i use the term loosely, because while it had the same color and texture as a white cloud, it was smooth and almost perfectly spherical, like a cotton ball.  the cloud seemed to literally appear out of nowhere.  the object, still \"changing color\", approached the \"cloud\" and entered it.  the cloud and the object were roughly the same size, the \"cloud\" being only slightly bigger as to barely accommodate the size of the object flying into it.  the object never emerged from the \"cloud\" and within a few seconds, the \"cloud\" itself just faded out of existence, as though it was never there.  the sky was once again empty, clear and blue.  i snapped out of the slack-jawed trance i seemed to be in and immediately knelt down and drew the peanut shaped object i witnessed, in the dirt, with my finger.  my friend, now crying, said, \"that's what i saw, too\".  from the time we saw the plane and stopped the car, until the time the object and the \"cloud\" disappeared was approximately ten minutes.\r\nwe were both effectively scared and confused by what we saw and at the idea that whoever was flying the military plane had to have seen that we were watching this phenomena unfold and they might come back for us, having seen something we weren't supposed to.  we got back in the car and i drove her back home.  i, too, went back home and didn't leave my house again for almost a week.  during this time, i told my aunt about the incident, just in case i suddenly went missing.  please understand, that i'm not a conspiracy theorist, nor am i a paranoid person.  in fact, i would normally condescend those that claim to have encounters with ufos or the \"men in black\".  after this, however, i have respect for those people. i won't claim that what i saw was extraterrestrial because i don't have enough information to come to that conclusion.  it could've been some secret military weapon or experimental aircraft, for all i know.  i do know that whatever we saw, it was not normal and i'm pretty sure it was none of our business.  i was thirty years old that summer and my friend was twenty-five.\r\n\r\ni no longer live in south carolina, but i am still connected to this young lady via facebook and about once a year, i send her a message asking her to remind me that i'm not insane and that we really saw what we saw.  she always replies that, yes, we did see it and that no one believes her when she tells the story.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately, we did not have a camera to take pictures or video.  this occurred in 2008, before the advent of the smart phone.  i can't prove to anyone else that what we saw was real, but i know it happened and so does the young lady, \"a\".  the events transpired as described, without any embellishments or assumptions.  what you've read is how it happened.  i'm willing to take a polygraph.\r\n ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
