approximately 30 minutes for me to get home. i stopped on hwy 153 for about a minute to check for damage to my car because i had run over a piece of debris that looked like rubber from a tire off of an 18 wheeler that was in the road. i didn't see any major damage that would prevent me from driving home so i got back in my car lit a cigarette and continued on my way. as i turned onto webb rd from hwy 58 i noticed what i first thought to be an airplane. it had several lights 3 were brighter than the rest and one on the left side was much smaller and blinking. i thought to myself wow that plane is really low and it was pretty far from where i generally see them as they approach the local airport. as i kept driving towards it i realized it wasn't moving. so i thought it must be a group of 3 helicopters. i thought this for a moment because helicopters are the only things i know of that hover like this or move slow enough to appear to be hovering. also there were 3 main lights pointing straight out almost like head lights on a car. and having lived on and around a military base for about 5 year's i know they sometimes fly in a v formation of 3. however i quickly dismissed this idea because there were 3 lights on either side of the central light that were dimmer. as i drove closer i saw that the lights were not independent of each other so i thought maybe they had put up a new cell tower on hwy 58 and it just appeared to be above the apartments. but as i got even closer i slowed down because i realized it was a solid black triangle that connected the lights and it was hovering just below the tree line about 50 feet above one if the apartment buildings. i saw there was no pole or anything else keeping it up. it was just sitting there. the 3 main lights looked straight ahead like headlights on a car and you could see the mist swirling through the light. the smaller lights on either side were more like ambient light than headlights. by this i mean the type of light u would see given off from a window as you drove past a house at night. the blinking light was even smaller than the secondary lights but appeared to be the same intensity. all the light was pure white in color. the object itself was black but not black like the way we color things black, it was the definition of black. a total absence of color. it was almost like what i would imagine looking into a black hole would be like. there were lights on in the parking lot of the apartments but they were not reflected on the craft and did not light it up. it was as though it absorbed the light. at this point i was passing it with it on my passenger side.  as i continued to drive past it i saw that it was a little less than one story high triangle shaped for sure. and about one third the size of the apartment unit it was hovering over. i also didn't hear any noise coming from it. my window was down on the driver side because i smoke. it was below the treeline but again about 50 feet above the apartments. as i realized what i was looking at i said out loud what the f***. i started to stop but there was a car behind me that appeared to be going way faster than me. i was driving about 12 mph at this time and the usual speed in this road is 35 i think. i continued to try to see it but lost it as i went over the hill and the trees obstructed my view. anyway i  sped up to get home quickly to check on my children. they were home alone while i was working and i only live a few blocks from where i saw it. once i got home i gathered my children and raced back to show them. i wanted witnesses to justify that i wasn't completely crazy. but as we went back i saw it was gone. i have gone past there several times since and there is absolutely nothing in the parking lot or that can bee seen from that road that could possibly explain what i saw.

ruins that day with two other friends. also, august 1st, was the day of the blue-moon. i took many pictures and recordings with my cell phone that day in various areas around the ruins, as hundreds of people did. i did not see nor hear anything out of the norm that day. just took beautiful pictures of the ruins.\r\n\r\nthe following morning i woke up and  picked up up my cell phone  -samsung note 4- to review the pictures and footage from the day before, my trip to chichen itza. there was one video recording i took which really stood out. what i captured is probably some of the most clear ufo/extraterrestrial technology evidence ever recorded on film.\r\n\r\nthe recording is of me standing near the center of the ball court where mayan priest would play the ball game of death. there are two straight solid walls, one to my left and right. both walls have one ring six meters high where the ball had to go through. i hit play to start recording and spun around to take a 360 degree recording of the ball court and took 23 seconds of video/audio. between the 1 and 2 second mark i captured a boomerang shaped object fly out of the wall near the ring to my left which was no more that 25-30 yards away from me. once the object exited the wall it changes size and shape. the object then flew over our heads faster than the speed of sound as it changed shape. \r\n\r\nthe wall -  the wall is solid but the object came out of the wall where there was a really dark stain on the wall, similar to what they call desert varnish at the grand canyon. you can see a gray \"v\" shaped object traveling from a distance inside the wall and get larger as it gets closer. it almost looks like the \"v\" shaped object is flying in space behind the wall. the small \"v\" shaped object then exits the wall, almost as if it crossed a portal or worm hole. as if the wall was hollow.\r\n\r\nonce it exits the wall - once the small \"v\"shaped object exits the wall it seem to turn towards the wall and slow down, almost like hitting it's air-breaks. at the same time it hits it's \"air-breaks\" the object flips and becomes much larger in size and turn from a small gray \"v\" to a large black boomerang shaped object. the object then flies over our head much faster than the speed of sound. i use the word \"flies\" loosely as it looked like it was tumbling or coming in and out of space/time/reality.All this happens in .5 seconds. when you do a frame by frame on a high end computer, there are 10 video frames of the object. in 8 of 10 frames the object changes shape. see the attached drawings of all the shapes it takes. \r\n\r\nthe footage is high resolution and  you can see the details as clear as day, especially when you see the footage in 3d. you can see the texture of the object, even the light of the sun reflecting off the metal surface. you can also see a reddish-brown membrane type of material, as well an antennae, the antennae has a ball at the end.  i asked many locals if they have ever seen any birds, bats or insects which look or fly as fast as the object captured on film? every single one of the locals said \"no\" and followed up that i had captured evidence of an extraterrestrial craft. it looks almost like a drone. it breaks many laws of physics, it does not make a sound nor cast a shadow.   \r\n\r\nthe video has been copy righted and cannot be

ask her if the dogs were in that night and she had said no they were outside all night and then i didn't say anything because i thought they would think i was crazy!!!!Whats its in my mindis the site of the reflecting eyes staring at me all these years what's really weird is years later i had an xray done on my head for an unrelated incident and the doctor asked me in a really weird way if i was ever shot in the head and i don't know it just came over me that what they saw in the x-ray was related to maybe what i seen on the steps that day and i never spoke of it again i just left the doctors

north carolina i  and towards the west southwest at about 30 degrees from my position in elevation i saw 3 red   lights in a triangle formation move in a straight line across the whole skyscape going e/ne path. completely silent, very high elevation , perhaps at the altitude of a jetliner cruising at its max altitude. but the things that struck me immediately as this being a ufo are 4 key points: \r\n1.) 3 red lights that did not pulsate, flew in fixated position and only three red lights, no spotlights, no green , blue, yellow, or white lights blinking as you would see in all other aircraft.\r\n2.) completely silent, no trail of any kind, \r\n3.) moved across the entire skyscape afrom one side to the other as far as eye could see in only approximately 5-7 seconds.\r\n4.) viewing with powerful binoculars,    this is what i found very strand and interesting, approximately 25-35 minutes later if not sooner a , what i gathered was a military helicopter from the sound and formation of the lights was seen 1/2 mile or so up in the north sky slowly circling and intermittently hovered for a few minutes here and there with its spotlight on and facing horizontal from chopper looking straight out most of the time as if it was searching for something or possibly had made some kind of visual or contact, though i followed the spotlight in its direction, i could not see anything. but why this is so odd is that the spotlight was pointed straight out from the helicopter even with it occasionally lowering the angle and raised in the angle but it definitely was not as if it was a police or news chopper shining a light straight down to the ground looking for something, this hellicopter spotlight actually remained searching up in the sky itself hovering much of the time wit light pointed at something definately observing or searching, seeming like at times it was definitely in contact with some kind of target at times, though i never did see anything other than the three reds  lights i saw about 30 minutes earlier at apparently high altitude.\r\n one other thing about the helicopter,   though it was dark and i could not make out any defined surfaces, lights on both its port and starboard side extended out much farther than a normal helicopter almost as if it had small wings on it as an apache attack helicopter does for instance , and the noise it made was unlike anything commercial it was much more quiet though it was some distance away.\r\n\r\n i would say those are the main key points of the sighting. this is a legitimate true claim and ufo by definition. i do take great interest in astrophysics and ma stargazer whenever the sky permits it.  and have no gain in reporting such a thing i have read about sighting the three red lights and triangular aircraft i believe there's supposedly a military craft that's classified. is reported to be able to maneuver with these characteristics that i witnessed so that definitely gives more credibility to that theory but of course it could be something not from this world but it definitely is strange and a possible response to it by this helicopter made it even more strange from people who happened to see something in the night sky. this definitely was a very unusual and rare glimpse at something as a civilian.  the tries to see things that aren't there i literally saw this thing and at the very least if not aliens and all that jazz it was some kind of very high tech advanced aircraft developed by what i would guess might be the united states since it was passing over our air space when i saw it. very interesting sight i won't soon forget. thank you very much for taking the time. \r\n\r\n-

(between pecos and eastern) and then noticed the small cloud again forward and off to my left.  the little cloud looked approximately in the same place as before and about the same size and shape.  now my interest was really peaked.  i pulled over to the side of the road, and clicked off five more pictures using my smartphone.  i could not see any detail, since the sun was again shining in my direction. i did not review the images, and i proceeded home.  \r\n\r\nonce at home, i looked at the pictures in more detail.  what i saw was really surprising.  two of the pictures show a whitish sphere adjacent to the cloud.  the last photo i snapped shows an arcing contrail like image that appears to start with the approximate location of the sphere, and ending in the cloud.  using approximate angles from my memory and two locations, (and assuming the object was indeed in the same place), i can triangulate the cloud to be approximately located over sloan.  this places the cloud about 7+ miles away from my first location.  \r\n\r\nat the serene location, five pictures were taken over a 31 second period.  the first two photos, show only the small cloud and nothing else.  the next photo is 6 seconds later, and shows a spherical object colored just the same as the cloud.  the next picture two seconds later shows the object a little closer to the cloud.  the last picture, 19 seconds later, shows a contrail like arc entering the cloud.  so, in summary, first there is no object, 6 seconds later there is an object, and then 19 seconds later a contrail like arc going into the cloud.  \r\n\r\nas the photos show, the cloud was changing shape a little during this 31 seconds, but this change is slow, which makes it hard to account for these spherical artifacts on the photos.  if the arc photo was taken before the two orb photos, i would have assumed that the orb was just a spot of cloud.  but in fact, as the time stamps show, its just the reverse, the orb appears first, then the arcing contrail appears last.  it's hard to imagine a little ball of cloud shearing into a distinct contrail like pattern and arcing in such a distinct way.  also, clearly evident in the two photos is that the spherical ball moves closer to the cloud in two seconds.\r\n\r\ni haven't learned all the modes on my camera phone, as i now know i could have done a better job getting many more pictures, or even a video, but maybe next time!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
