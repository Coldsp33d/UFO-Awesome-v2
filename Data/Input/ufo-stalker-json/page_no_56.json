ready for summer.  it was a clear dark night, almost a half moon or just after, with no traffic noise.  i was looking up and thinking about pruning my palm tree and other trees to reduce leaves in the pool, (direction of focus was upwards for about ten to 20 minutes.  while looking to the east over my house, i saw what was either a hanglider size at the smallest (if it was within 150ft), or extremely large aircraft (if it was more than 500 ft, football fields size or larger), jet black triangle fly completely silent from east to west. \r\n      it’s hard to explain but the visual cues were not normal.  if it was low, some city street lights or building lights should have illuminated at least a little or reflected some kind of light.   if it was that low, some kind of sound should have been heard.  it cast a larger shadow over me and the white poolside concrete as it flew quickly over.  i first thought it was a hang glider but there was nothing hanging under, it actually looked like a two dimensional triangle the entire time.  it looked like it was moving around 50-70mph if it were at 150 feet above me, or way too fast, and too large for anything above 1,000 feet.  \r\n     it definitely wasn’t a bird, a kite, frisbee, or a drone.  there was no color to it, i just saw the triangle shaped absence of light between the stars and me.  it moved at a constant horizontal speed and did not change direction until i could no longer see it.  the only thing other than black that i saw, was when it flew over a brightly lit parking lot/shopping center about a thousand feet west sw of me, and it was a faint orange/amber reflection from the orange lights from the parking lot.  that was kind of confusing because that would mean it was too low for an aircraft and i should have been able to see at least some profile of the vertical axis.  i still saw a 2d-looking isocoles triangle.  but no sound other than like what you would hear if someone threw something close to you like a quiet whoosh.\r\n     if it was higher up, it would have been too massive to be anything like a a normal aircraft, almost like an aircraft carrier or cruise ship size.  it would also have been moving past the speed of sound... going by air show experiences only, and no sonic boom or contrails behind it.  \r\n   there is no place even remotely close that someone could have jumped from a stationary object to hang glide over.  there’s no one i’ve even heard of that has a hang glider within 50 miles either.  the guest building is the hospital about two miles away, at five stories.  there were no aircraft, balloons, anywhere in the sky that night, or for at least 10-20 minutes where i was looking up.  there is lemoore naval air station about 30-40 miles to the west, but they usually never come to the east.  there were no lights coming from it either.  there are commercial jets that fly overhead at night, but usually always north to south or south to north, but they could not be mistaken for this object.  to put it quite literally, it was like someone threw a black, 20-30ft, paper airplane, from the east, and it flew just about 100ft over my head with not making any discernible sound other than air moving quietly by it.  \r\n     so, to sum it up.  nothing tall enough to glide from nearby, drones were not popular yet for years after this time (also not personal drone shaped or sized), clear and dark sky except the moon and stars, with no other aircraft, birds, kites and a silent ambient environment.  the only way to have voa better view would be to have viewed it though binoculars or telescope.  it looked like it was mostly 2 dimensional, moving to fast if it was higher up, too quiet for the apparent closer distance, did not move or change shape with respect to appearance excluding direction of travel (west to slightly sw).  it had no lights shining from it, and only a glint of city lights from the bottom.  travelled at two or three miles or way more of it was at airplane height.\r\ni was not drinking, or doing, or under the influence of any drugs or alcohol, prescription medication or diagnosed  (or not) with any previous or current mental conditions or hallucinations.  i just happened to be looking up at the trees and sky on that night at the right time.  i haven’t seen anything like it before or after, and really wasn’t all that exciting other than the missing obvious visual and audible sensory cues of distance and size.  i don’t think anyone would ever even notice it unless they were looking for it or at least looking in the sky.\r\n\r\ni don’t have the best vision, but it’s definitely good enough to not need glasses at night to drive, and my right eye suffered moderate trauma 25 years ago when i was 8, but my vision had adapted very well.The only problem i mildly have, is objects like a baseball or similar size object coming directly at my face, or directly away.\r\n","distance":"101-500

rural town of about 500 people. i lived in a house in one of the most rural area. there were maybe 6 other houses in a mile radius and woods surrounding everything for\r\nmiles. although i have also witnessed things in shelby nc which is the closest town. i saw a fireball fly over main street. the things i have seen out there went on for the entire six months i've lived there. it started off as small star like objects blinking and fluttering. one night i noticed about 15 of them in the sky. some of them splitting, joining and ejecting other similar objects. these objects would defy physics appearing to skip parts of the sky. other times i would notice a cluster of lights in a triangle formation bobbing and hovering in complete syncrosity. i've also seen small orbs of light moving through bushes in the early hours of the morning. also, almost every morning before dawn a bright almost search light like object would appear in the sky and start rotating. it even stayed above me for about a mile and followed me to work. i've also seen what almost appears to be a meteorite, a small fire ball like object shoot down the light pole and onto the ground in an l like fashion, it had a blue flame for a tail and then vanished. i've also seen similar objects jump off powerlines, jump onto the ground and zip off, and another time i\r\nsaw a small red light about the size of a bird zip around the corner about 4 feet off the ground and disappear. another time, i went out to walk my dog in the brush behind my house right before the thick woods started and saw a small bright white light on the ground that quickly shot up into the sky and started doing manuvers i didn't think we're possible. another time, my wife said about 4 am she saw a bright white light in the window between the tree by my house and an abandoned trailer. she said it was so bright it light up the room and it was on the ground. she thought she might be seeing the moon but she went and looked out the other window and it was on the other side of the sky. she said she didn't know why she didn't wake me up because she was terrified and she was somehow compelled to fall back asleep. i had told my mother about this crazy stuff and she didn't believe me until she came to visit. she saw everything. she saw how they would follow behind me when i'd walk my dog behind my house almost as if they were watching me. there was another time i was outside and i was talking to my wife. she told me to turn around and look, there was an object i had noticed minutes before and thought it was a star but it suddenly lit up\r\nbright blue, the air suddenly felt like all the heat was sucked out of it, temperature dropped aprox 35 degrees, any dogs in the area started barking a lot and it started moving towards us in a falling leaf like pattern. i ran in the house. not long after a black pickup truck with its lights off rolled past my house. which is something i have seen after other incidents, along with a man in all black on a black quad wth its lights off rolling up to my house. also, upon moving in before these sightings intensified there was a deer carcass with its spine exposed, most of the skin around its head still intact and the entire torso missing. it was there for about 4 months but one morning after a night of seeing all this stuff, i walked my dog and noticed it was completely missing. i've also seen numerous formations of 2 and 3 lights moving silently across the sky, or even just hovering and wobbling. on these formations there is always one light that is brighter then the others wether it be the 2 or 3 light formations. there is some very strange stuff out in lawndale nc. i advise anyone who doesn't believe me to go spend a night out there just looking up, if you don't see anything your either blind or don't want to believe what your seeing. it happens almost everynight. i saw things for the majority of the 6 months i lived there with multiple witnesses. i believe they are hiding something in the woods out there. i have photos and videos upon request","distance":"20 Feet or

see if there was a reappearance of the objects. i was headed west towards location of first sighting when four glowing orbs (2 pairs)were observed several miles ahead, low to the horizon. as i drove towards the four glowing objects, two of the orbs shrank and disappeared. the two remaining orbs hovered for about 10 minutes, then they too disappeared. approximately two minutes later the pair of orbs appeared again and seemed to move towards me. as they moved closer, they became larger but distance away was still difficult to judge. then suddenly, they disappeared and when they reappeared seconds later, they were headed in opposite direction and very far away. i got in my car and tried to get closer to them. after about 5 minutes of chasing them, they disappeared. i waited a few minutes, but the orbs did not come back. i got in my car and headed east back to my house but was curious as to whether they would show back up. i drove to where my car was parallel with the mine and got out of my car. looking to the southwest, the two orbs were back and seemed to be heading back in my direction (east). but once more, they slowly disappeared. again i waited a few minutes but they did not return. the entire sighting lasted approximately one hour.\r\ni found this experience to be very exciting as the second sighting was of the same kind of objects i had seen the first time. i was unable to get good video or pictures this time as i was using unfamiliar equipment and the excitement of the sighting caused me to forget how to use them. i will be better prepared the next

(around 8 yrs. old).\r\n\r\npuerto rico around 1971\r\n\r\nif my memory serves me right, my grandmother, sister and myself had gone to a church function that evening. while the adults sat and talked, the kids, including myself had gone out to run around the neighborhood. i don't quite remember how many kids there were, but i do remember that while playing a few of the kids got scared of some lights we were seeing in the sky, started crying, and ran back to the house where the prayer group was gathering.\r\n\r\ni specifically remember telling my sister and a classmate to hold off on going back. i was extremely curious and unaffected by what we were witnessing and had moved ahead of them.  \r\n\r\nwe watched the lights dance a bit then they seemed to slow down as we ran out unto a field. the fear really set in with my sister and classmate when the brightest of the lights seemed to get closer. it then broke out into 3 lights and formed a triangle. then, just as quick as they had split they came back together in an up and down line. the top light shot straight up and out of sight and the lowest of the ball of light seemed to drop very slowly. i remember that i couldn't see where it landed because the trees in the distance blocked my view. i am not certain what happened to the middle light.\r\n\r\nwhen we returned we tried to tell the adults what we had seen but they weren't phased by it. they laughed and kept on discussing whatever it was they were talking about.\r\n\r\nthough it has been many years i still think about it. i don't remember if we heard any sounds coming from the objects nor if they had a specific color. but, i do remember they moved strangely in the sky and seemed to be intelligent in some way. \r\n\r\n\r\n

noticed what i thought was a airlpane passing over, heading south. it seemed to be a bright red with what looked like it had a dark center. i looked for other lights that usually are seen as a airplane passes over. i could see no wings just a fuzzy shape. i saw what appeared as a smaller red light by the bigger light. it occured to me that this was probably just an airplane after all. but the overall impression i had was that what i was seeing looked odd.The object looked fuzzy to my eyes. the sky was clear. the object continued to move now heading towards the south. as i watched the object it appeared to grow slightly dimmer, still red. as i continued to watch the object it appeared to stop and then hop to the right a noticeable amount. the object continued south then hoped again. this time to the left. then continued south again.The object did this again then proceede south. it seemed to vanish like some satellites due when they pass over head. i started to go back in the house and noticed that it now appeared again where i saw it last. i called my daughter and she came out, i pointed out the object to her and she said it looked like a jet to her. then the object jumped again to the right and she saw this. she said that no jet can do that. then the object just vanished.  i am and have been an amateur astronomer for many years. i have seen many many odd things
