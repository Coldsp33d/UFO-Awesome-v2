driving back from carter county, tn into sullivan county, tn. we we traveling down chinquapin grove road right around 6 pm. at first i saw them to the left, as i was sitting in passenger seat, but at first it didn't strike me as odd. shortly after that i saw them on my right, just above holston mountain. there appeared to be several of them and it appeared as if they flew in sets of two. one set was traveling side by side, while another set hovered over the mountain, but they were not side by side, one was above the other. they mostly resembled christmas trees and were flashing and they were in the sky and did not have the mountains or trees as their background. each set of two crafts, were not quite the same color. one appeared orangish-red, one appeared bluish-white, for example. we knew they were either suppressed government technology to alien in origin. each one flashed alternately and their position/distance from each other would change, but they flew in twos for the most part. at one time, it seemed like we witnessed three sets on them in different areas of the sky either moving in a path to hovering, but not completely still. other people had to have seen this in the area. we stopped  alongside weaver pike and got out pf the car to get a better look and there was a helicopter with a spotlight coming through the area flowing one of the strange double christmas tree craft. we did see one flying at a low lever and did have the same type of sound that a jet airplane would make, but much softer for the given distance. they were not conventional aircraft, as those would have to have a green light on the right wing and a red one on the left and a white light on the tail. these appeared nothing like that. the whole incident lasted 20-30 minutes.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

disappear upon my entrance. however, upon second thought, the object was clearly meteor like in that it had flame and sparks coming off of it. the center of he object was a glowing reflective silver color. the best description would be like a ball of mercury. the object seemed to be very low to the ground and had flames as well as sparks coming from it as it shot swiftly across my yard. my feelings about the siting were as i stated above. i thought it was perhaps an alien ship of some sort but then thought it could be some type of meteor because of the flame and sparks coming from it.

december 10th at 11:15 in malden or revere mass.. i am a believer of ufo's and et's. but i firmly believe i am not jumping to conclusions.I watched it fly west then stop and hover. so i walked to my best vantage point possible, by this time it decended straight down. so i was actually starting to think this aint right. so i took my phone out at this point but didn't get anything good on the camera or video recorder.So i'm at the back of a cemateary watching it hover sighlently. i then tried to record it again. my phone was low at 25 % and as soon as i recoreded it again it beeped saying it was low 15% and could not record due to low battery, then totally died and shut off . it useally tells you ten than 5 than makes a noise when it dies , it would usually take mins. this took seconds and did not go through its low battery functions. i proceeded to watch it accend, decend, go west, east and hover in impossible 90 degrees diagonal movements. i was stunned, it has been my dream to see what i saw. i always pictured jumping up and down, but i was astonished and keep saying expletives. i have a solid knowledge of planes and helicopters and air crafts my dad was in the air force, and i'm a sky watcher. no plane could ever move like this, the g force would rip the piolet in half. it made no sound. it was one red and one white light side bye side. i could not make out the craft just two circles like this oo. during this i saw planes, stars, and the i saw what i believe was a large black hawk helicopter, very low appearing to land. which i have seen before. some were over there is a base or airport or something in that general direction. maybe logan. but that is more east and have routinely seen all sorts of crafts go that direction. when it moved it wasn't so fast u couldn't see it but it was fast and stoped on a dime. then i heard what sounded to be a jet or two going that direction but never saw them. then a couple mins later it decended straight down and landed. it was dark and to far away to see it but i swore i saw a red light on the ground. so i tried to get closer two it but the only way was through a forrest and it could have been miles away. i was unarmed and had no flashlight so i did not proceed but i am in the mourning. waited to see if it would go back up for a few mins. it didn't i went home. i don't know if it was et ufo or a government ufo, leaning towards the later. but it was no plane, i don't think a drone it would have to have been like a war drone for that size. hellicopter is possible but no noise and don't think a helicopter could have made these movements...Sorry for the spelling, i'm very excited and had to report this right away..I want to know if anyone else saw it or knows anything about it, or did i just witness something out of this world. ..Thanks  ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Kansas city, missouri\r\n\r\nevery night, from the time i was 2-4 years old, (about 1950-52) i was \"visited\" nightly by several \"beings\".  they always \"appeared\" in my bedroom at night.  always, from  across the room, they would wake me up.   i would feel their presence and would hear them call my name.  after i woke up, they would always take me somewhere and bring or send me back before sunrise.   they always spoke to me without moving their lips.     \r\n\r\nthe most memorable one was one that i called \"the little guy\", because he was a tiny bit taller than me.  he always talked to me without moving his lips.  as a child, i didn't understand how i could hear him so clear without him \"talking\".   \r\n\r\nat that time in my life, we lived in an apartment, on the second floor.  we had a multi-frequency, long ranged radio that sat cater-corner in the dining room.  i think it was a philips or philco. (which i still have in my possession).    every night i would go to the bathroom, somewhere about 2-5 am-ish.  he would always step from behind the radio.  then we would always exit by going down, like it was a hole in the floor or like the floor wasn't even there.  i have fleeting memories of sitting while he talked to me.  (without moving his lips)  :-)   he taught me and \"showed\" me \"how our quadrant of the \"uni-verse\" was formed\", logic, mind over matter, how \"everything\" was alive or had \"life\" and so much more. \r\nas a child, i didn't fully understand the full meaning of \"everything\" having life !!!   so, i took it literally,\r\nand would talk to everything, dolls, pencils, plates, furniture, etc.   (i now \"over-stand\" the concept.  \"everything \" is made of atoms and atoms are the core of all things..... therefore everything has \"life\").   \r\n   \r\nat four years old, i was telling the adults in my family about how my older sister could use \"logic and \"mind over matter\" to get rid of her headache that had her screaming from the pain.   his \"visits\" continued for years, until i was about 9 or 10 years old.  \r\n\r\nhe was my height and looked humanoid, but he had a cone-shaped, hairless head.  his skin color was light brownish.    \r\n\r\nit was the last \"visit\" from a being that i called \"the lady\", that caused me to ask them all to stop coming to me.  ( i thought \"the lady\" was my aunt, who was still living).   late one night, as usual, \r\n\"the lady\" appeared across my bedroom, like she always did.  this time she asked me to follow her down the hallway, to the living room.  (she, too, always talked to me without moving her lips).  when i got to the living room, she told me to straighten the rug that we kept in the center of the room.  this was significant because this rug was soft and very flexible. therefore was a major chore for us little children to keep it straight and it usually took myself, my older sister and my younger brother to accomplish this task.   soooooo, with her urging and encouragement, i walked to the center of the rug, straightened all four corners.  i walked back to the edge, off the rug, turned around, thinking i would be in trouble for messing up the rug.   when i looked at the rug, it was smooth as glass and i was in shock.  then she told me to place a newspaper in the center and to put a framed picture on top.  once again, the rug was smooth as glass..... not a wrinkle in sight.   i was amazed!!!   and confused!!!   i turn around to ask her \"why\", but she had just vanished!!!   she was wearing a beautiful light pink full length formal gown, like she aways wore, and had brownish skin tone. \r\n\r\ni went through the house looking for her and saw my mother, who was sitting at the dining room table.\r\nshe questioned me and i told her i was looking for aunt nette.  (my mothers younger sister).  mom said that aunt nette wasn't there.   but i insisted that she had just been in the living room with me.  mom looked in the living room and there was the perfectly straight rug with the newspaper and the framed picture in the center.   that didn't make her believe me though.    the next day mom took me to the doctor, who told my mother that i was hallucinating and that i had a fever.   :-(\r\n\r\nfor years i was teased by siblings and cousins to the point that i would go hide somewhere and cry.\r\ni felt unhappy, confused, \"different\", like a freak and ashamed.  i couldn't understand how they could be \"not real\" when i had spent so many years being \"taken\" by them every night, learning from them and coming back just before the family awakened in the mornings.  even though i couldn't wrap my brain around the \"hallucination\" thing, i was then confused about the reality of my \"visiting friends\".\r\nso, i asked them to stop coming to me.    \r\n\r\nsooooooo, needless to say, i never told my family or any one else about \"the little guy\" or any of the \"other\" beings that visited me at nights!!!!  \r\n\r\ni now believe that there was a portal in that apartment that led them to me.   i'm still searching for the purpose. i never saw a space ship.  only those beings, standing in my room.  sometimes there was 3 -5 beings.  other times it was just \"the lady\".   \r\n \r\nmaybe the purpose was for me to share with others like others have shared thru mufon.  i feel like it's time for me to tell my story.  i've been hiding waaaaay to long.   \r\n\r\ni'm convinced that these beings were from another planet or planetary system, somewhere in the\r\n \"uni-verse\" and they wanted me to know that they are real so i could help others!!!  \r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n   ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":73059,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.123629604804364,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12112015-0001","longitude":-94.5508701722572,"occurred":-628646400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1449793237000,"summary":"In the early 50's, beings visited me every night, for many years when i was a child an took me to teach me.

object in the sky headed towards my direction. he said at first he thought it was a blimp and made a low humming sound. but due to its size and outline he said it wasn't a blimp. so along with my 7 year old son i stepped outside to see if i too could see it. i did! it was massive! it moved too slowly to be a plane and went in a straight line. it had 5 very bright lights. 2 on either side, one in front. the lights on either side were very very bright therefore letting me see a triangular type outline. the lights did not blink, just very bright. it moved over my house then disappeared in the distance nw. we checked to see if any blimps or planes were in our area that night and there were none. also on 12/4/2015 while riding with my father on hwy 13 at dusk around 5:15 pm north out of town we both saw a very bright star like object sitting stationary in the north eastern sky. while watching it another light seemed to intersect with it and disappear. almost as if it entered the brighter object. after it \"entered\" within a few seconds the lights disappeared. very strange lights and happenings occur in this area yearly at about this same time. december seems to be a great time to see

affected since living on a farm in troutville pa.  my grandpa had a working animal and many acres of gardens.  my first recollection was a circle cut down in the corn field he blamed the amish,they wanted his property,and hated them forever after. they now own the farm.\r\ni've had 2 children removed from me, i've had jobs taken from me when trying to make reports,accused of taking drugs. hospital records vanish.  my right hand partially removed from damage from the lights.  something done to my youngest boy,that's now at 16 started having seizures.  been followed,been diagnosed with a rare blood disease that only my aunt has ever had.  i've been given knowledge i don't want.  i don't want contacted,bad things occur.  i know why they are here,i know when they started coming,i know things i have no way of knowing that are so complex it's crazy.  i've been subjected to this since i remember.  the memories come and go,but never leave for good.  my family,friends or priest don't even know. i've lived to doctors about injuries sustained.  i have a piece of rock that was changed after an incident,when my hand was damaged.  i had needles stuck in my wrist.  my youngest child is being used for something i can't even explain to him.  my husband,who was policeman of the year in 2012 his entire memory was erased and lost his job,the doctors could find nothing wrong and diagnosed him with ptsd,which is carp.  we lost properties we owned and rented.  when i watch that show and people talk about seeing lights,i'd trade places in a heartbeat.  there are tunnels underground,under water and people know about them, people i think related to scientology and mormons.  mercury is what they want,not gold,they can make gold.  it is stored underground in asia,china to be exact i think.  the agenda is almost hitler like,in the sense they are and have been for a long time preparing a most useful race.  i was tested at an early age with an extremely high iq.  i don't know if that's why i'm targeted.  but i will continue to be targeted,because of my son.  when he's 21, i will be taken or disposed of.  i tell my kids if anything happens to me,they will always be able to talk to me by looking at orion and i will hear them.  i know that,don't know why because i converted to catholic to try to end this.  if this gets to you, i will be frightened by people who will stop me and make me nuts.  to the point that if i don't stop something tragic will happen,like every other time.  but they are preparing us and our planet and themselves,because our world is as close to theirs as there found. their technology is advancing rapidly,faster even then ours.  they have many vehicles with which they travel. the large ones carry many of them to show their people what their world will be.  they first have to be adaptable to all portions of our planet,so they can utilize all of it.  our planet is smaller and our sun will last long.  theirs is dying.\r\nyou will not get to the truth because people willing to tell you will suffer,as will their families.  they have 2 of my offspring and have done something to my child.  he's different,i don't know why.  we won't know.  they will have all of our dna and we will and are willingly giving it.  they are evolving us much faster than regular evolution happens and have been for tens of thousands of years.  they don't share our spirit,our personalities,our \"souls\". they want to have that and they want to feel things like us.  they have brains like an octopus has but live ages longer.","distance":"21-100

a cool day and very overcast. we had a bad practice, so we were not talking and were basically sulking. we did not have the radio on and were just riding in silence. we were approaching the local lake and was crossing the land dike and as we were crossing the bridge, we both found ourselves looking up and to the left of our vehicle. for some reason we were stopped, or at least driving at a walking pace. we saw the vessel and is was about 50 feet from us and about 50 feet up from us. it was shaped like a triangle with rounded corners. it appeared to be around 3-5 feet thick, it was dark gray with a pattern that appeared tile like. there was a circular light in each corner on the bottom of the craft. as i said earlier, we were riding in silence, this dude was within 50 feet of us and it was totally silent. it seemed soon after we really focused on it, it flew over us, up the lake, over the trees and made a bank to the right, turned up and was gone. so from the location of hovering to out of site was about 1/4-1/2 mile and it took less than 2 seconds. that was simply amazing. as it was going away from us, the back was covered with a green band of light which was rectangular and covered about 90% of the back end of the craft. still, no sound. as the light disappeared over the horizon, the next memory i have is \"snapping out of it\" about 2 miles down the road. i suddenly realized that i was driving, but i had no recollection of how i got there from the sighting location. as for my buddy, he will not even discuss the event with me, to this

outside my apartment being loud, decided to go see since i have a new car outside and i live in a pretty busy city..Went outside, on my porch on the third floor and watched the teens stand on the side of my car when realizing they weren't doing anything i decided to listen to them as they got louder in excitement and confusion. i looked up into the night sky and noticed a very big light in the distance that was brighter than any star or any aviation craft i have seen in my life. the object was still as if it were scanning the area. the object was out to the west and eventually started to move very slowly north after a few minutes. during this few minutes it did change from a white color from first being seen to a very distinctive purple color, during this few minutes it changed multiple colors from green to what appeared to be a light show of multiple colors of red, blue, green and purple, all with in a second. once it started going north, i videoed as much as i could until i couldn't see it no more(due to a roof of a neighboring house). at that time i stopped for a second and just thought what it could be. i then thought wait i may be able too see this from the back of my house. i went to the the other side of my house(which was on the other side of the neighboring house) and the object was there where it went west briefly and came back east toward me video.. now in the video on the back side of the house there was a tree outside my window where it appears in and out and almost blinking, it wasn't it was the branches of the tree making it appear that way. the object then started to go south again and rite before it did it turned to a big bright red in which it stayed that color the rest of the time. once it went south again i had to go back to the front of my house to continue to film. the last video is just over 30 seconds long when a plane out in the distance came into picture. and thats when the object kicked into gear and left the sky. after the object left there was a lot of activity in the air (planes flying) where all this took place. you can my reactions and emotions in the video as i tried my best to describe what was going on.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

in tennessee. i had just got home with my parents from a school board meeting. i belive it was in october but it may have been later in the year. i remember it being cold. we got home around 10 pm.\r\n\r\nas soon as we got out of the car my mom pointed up in the sky and asked \"what is that?\" dad and i looked up and saw a large object (around 100 feet long and 30 to 40 feet wide) slowly gliding across the sky above our house. it made no noise at all, and had two large bright white lights at the front of the craft. it was bullet shaped, larger and rounder at the front, slimed slightly and curved out about 10 feet in the back. the very end was vertically flat. the lights in front were the only lights we could see. the entire craft was a dark gray.\r\n\r\nas we watched my mom told me to go in the house and call my aunt who lived close to us and see if she could see it too. when i picked up the phone it had no dial tone. i hung up and tried again and there was still no dial tone. \r\n\r\ni went back outside and we watched the craft glide out of sight over the treetops. my parents and i went into the house and found the phone was working fine. (this was a time when phone lines were strung between poles instead of being buried.)\r\n\r\nthe entire sighting lasted about 3 minutes.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":73035,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.871237328255646,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12102015-0016","longitude":-83.00685306417786,"occurred":275961600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,  Missile","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1449754602000,"summary":"Saw large ufo in 1978","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":17,"maxtempi":62,"maxvism":11,"maxvisi":7,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":58,"meanvism":8,"meanvisi":5,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":17,"maxtempi":62,"maxvism":11,"maxvisi":7,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":58,"meanvism":8,"meanvisi":5,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"37727","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13585,"locationName":"Del Rio, Tennessee","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:817"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Orangeburg","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was taking my two sons to school on october 30, 2015.  we had just pulled out of the driveway (still in our neighborhood) when my younger son (he's 10) says he sees an object flying back and forth faster than anything he has seen before.  we drive further ahead to a place where our view is less obstructed by trees and my older son (14) i both see the object.  it appears as a white cylinder.  we pull over and observe.  it goes back and forth at an extremely high rate of speed.  about 30 seconds after we first see it, two other similar objects join the first.  they make the same type of back and forth movements and the 3 objects form a triangle (not touching, but a triangular formation) and stay stationary for a few seconds then move quickly apart.  we could not tell how far away the objects were nor how big.  the moved faster than any aircraft i have ever seen and they were not balloons.  the could have possibly been drones, but again, the speed was something i haven't seen before.  at least one object stayed in the area until i returned from the school (approx 20 mins) and then moved out of sight at a more normal speed.
