when i park my car it is facing in a southerly direction. it was almost completely dark as i got out of my car. i closed the car door and looked into the northern sky as i usually do when i return home. \r\ni have always enjoyed scanning the sky and have had the opportunity to see numerous, \"shooting stars.\" i also like to observe planes in my area and watch the different directions they eventually take. i am about ten miles due north of the \"piedmont (greensboro) triad airport and about fifty miles northeast of the charlotte airport.\r\non this particular evening as i closed my car door and looked into the northern sky i saw what appeared to be a jetliner in the usual flightpath which i watch. i leaned back against the back of my suv and decided to watch this object to see where it may be headed. after approximately 7 to 10 minutes watching this object i realized, as it got closer, that i did not notice the usual blinking of any kind of lights. this was very strange and kept my eyes fixed on it. as it drew closer, i thought i was observing an airliner coming at me and on fire. i immediately got on my cellphone and called my brother-in-law to tell him i was watching what i really thought was a commercial airliner that was engulfed in fire. we stayed on the phone as i described to him what i was seeing. he asked if i thought it may be a meteorite and i told him absolutely not because of the time i was spending observing this. then it all of a sudden turned sharply toward the west. i kept watching it until it finally disappeared from my sight. neither of us could give a reason of what i had just observed. \r\ni watched the news closely that evening and also the next day. there was no mention of what i saw in any news sources. when this object got close enough to me i was actually frightened that i was watching a plane which was engulfed in flame and getting ready to crash right before my eyes. \r\n\r\ni am a retired, career firefighter from marlborough ma., and this is not the first time i have observed strange things in the sky. i had three incidents when i lived in marlborough and the first incident happened in 1965 and witnessed by my first wife and also my then, sister-in-law, returning home from dinner one evening. the next incident happened somewhere around 1975 on a cold january day after a snowstorm had hit the northeast. i was by myself and making an oil delivery into a 5,000 gallon tank. i was outside around 1:00 p.M. and the sky was 100% clear. the third incident happened i think around 1994 and my second wife was with me and we both observed something strange. the first incident happened around 9:30 p.M. and completely dark. the third incident happened at dusk.\r\n\r\nthis is the very first time i have actually shared these incidents in this way.\r\n\r\nyours truly,\r\npaul j. gauthier\r\n","distance":"Over One

cloud but didn't think much of it until i got out my truck then i looked and i notice it wasn't clouds, it had a structure shape squarish almost like a building floating in the sky with a definite blue haze aura or something with a dark blue color illumination below structure. i looked around for others who may have pulled over to view it, but cars kept driving not seeing it. i spotted it coming off exit but didn't think it was anything but low clouds until i got out to rest, then i noticed edges. stood there trying to see it better for couple minuted then edges seem to buzz, crackle electric effects for couple seconds. then i was able to see how large or was. like a single story office bldg, no lights but definite blue area aura below it. very dark area,in sky due to clouds. object was beneath cloud cover and about 500ft+ off ground from mountain side. i'd say solid 15min hovering, rotation, tilting then it slowly moved upward away path on side of mountain into cloud cover high up. very large. like bigger than luxor bldg but sqaured off areas. metal grey surface has grooves curving patterns on side. could not see topside. pattern of line grooves like fish hook pattern or semi swirl patterns. didn't look like a ship, more like a bldg floating. could have had better view if there was noon light. there look like a possible object behind next to it, i noticed when it started to ascend i saw a second blue aura further back, like miles behind it but too far to see object. i felt curious like trying to solve a puzzle feeling, body feeling was shivers from cold weather. cars kept driving by the whole time. i had a good fix on it with my eyes so i know it was not cloud shapes that low. no sounds expect a buzzing crackling electric noise for couple seconds and a humm. it rotated slowly. what made it interesting was the tilting as if it was trying to focus or position itself like a satellite dish allignment. but aiming it toward the mountain side, not the sky. blue aura stayed constant throughout sighting. ascending path was nw low angle upward into cloud cover. blue aura diminish once it took flight. structure was squared with many squares on top and bottom. sides were large and had swirl grooves or decrotive patterns. i say decrotive as it seem to be artistic instead of mechanical. again, very large bldg like floating. got back into truck thinking my phone camera would have been nice to take a shot but probably too dark. my head feels like i need caffeine all the time up til now. i had only one other encounter when i was living in honolulu. i saw smaller structure but same metal look and shape falling vertically that almost hit hotel front of aka wai. i was sitting on tailgate of my truck bed in harbor lot. that was

seen it was the next year .Again it was summer around the same time at night.We first seen the light in the trees as we got closer to it it got so bright it was hard to see.As we got closer to it a logging company made a path in the woods so the trees were gone and at that time we could see the ufo and the bright light on the bottom of the ufo.Every one in the car started screaming.I was sitting behind the driver telling her to turn the lights off and stop.At this time the people in the car started yelling at the driver to go.What i seen that night at this time is....A ufo at the back of a house with a very bright white light on the bottom the light was about 15 feet wide and the ufo was about 30 feet wide it looked like a gray metal.I didn't see anyone or anything.At some point the light dimmed and the ufo flew towards glidden and the straight up.The people in the car finally stop yelling. i was asking the driver why she didn't stop.......She told me it was dark out and she didn't want to get her car hit by another car....It was so bright at the time it was as bright as day.Another lady in the car said you will see things like that at night.Nobody wanted to talk about what happened. the next day one of the adults told me never talk about what happened to anyone.Well a few years later in the summer we were up at the lake and i was talking to someone that had a cottage on the other end of the lake and she asked me what was going on over by me the night before. i asked her what was she was talking about.She told me someone at her place went outside late at night and he seen a very bright light in the area i was staying at.All i remember from the night before is i went to sleep around 10 pm so i could go fishing the next morning. \r\nas the years went by

was on my way to work and got off the number 5 bus at the stop across from the safeway. i was waiting for the light to change when something caught my eye in the sky as it was reflecting light off what i assumed was the wing as it turned. as it is a high traffic area for both small and large aircrafts i didnt focus to much on it while i walked to the sunnyside train station. i walked to the station and noticed that the object was infact not a plane or helicopter (i am an avid aircraft watcher) when i first saw it, it was just hovering and it stayed like that for about 10 or so minutes tell a helicopter flew close to it. the helicopter seemed to disturb the craft as it darted upward and moved away from the helicopter(nw direction after upwards). after the helicopter got close (i am unsure of what kind of helicopter it was) and the craft moved away the helicopter than did a 180 and went back the way it came. once the helicopter was gone the craft went back to its orignal spot. it once again hovered there for about 5 minutes. once again the same helicopter came back and this time the craft took off south. i watched it tell it disapeared behind buildings. all of this happened in like a 20 minute span or so. i seemed to be the person interested in it as i was not alone at the train station but no one was paying attention to the sky. the craft also made no noice. when the

light in the sky. the light flashes green, red and white lights. i want to believe that it is a planet or a star, but it moves its position in the sky from diagonally across the street, to directly across the street, above the house across the street. i have taped this light on my iphone and ipad and i also have pics of it. a few weeks ago on either 11/2 or 11/9( it was definitely on a monday) i went out to have my last cigarette for the night. i stepped out onto the porch and saw this thing come flying across the sky. whe i was looking at it, i remembered, my mouth dropped and i kept saying to myself, what the hell is this? what the hell is this? but, i say this thing because i really don't remember what it was that i saw.  i was on the porch and there is a small parking lot in front of the house, then street. i don't know how to estimate how far away it was, but this is a residential neighborhood and it was right in front of me! it was flying at the altitude of the top of the trees, i think. all i know is that it hit a point in the sky and it exploded. the sky lit up and blue and white sparks flew down from it. if it was actually lower than the tree top( even though this incident is recent, since i experienced it, i have been having a hard time recalling the specifics. i am actually working with a hypnotherapist to recall what the object was)there are power lines there, but the power in the area was not disrupted. when it exploded, i ducked thinking debris was going to fly towards me, then i ran into the house. i was so afraid that i ran in with a lit ciggsrette and that is a no no! i asked my coworker if she saw a bright flash of light from outside but she didn't. i had to go back out and quickly put out my ciggarette and i hurried back inside. i peeked out the door to see where the object either exploded or went into another dimension but everything seemed normal. the energy in this area is very weird. when i'm outside smoking, i always feel like i'm being watched from above and a few years ago, i captured some very weird images in this area.(i attachd a pic of something weird. maybe mufon can have it analyzed)  true story and i'm not crazy.

park. on the evening of november 3rd 2015 i had taken some recycling cardboard to the car and was returning to the lighthouse. the sun had recently set but the lighthouse wasn't yet cloaked in darkness. i thought it looked wonderful and had lifted my phone camera to take a picture of it. i was facing west towards lake michigans shore. as i held my hands up to get a steady shot, i saw a dark object fall down the south side of the lighthouse tower. it crossed the roof of the keepers quarters between two dormers and fell to within a few feet of the gravel road/parking lot to the south of the lighthouse. the object then flew directly at me in an eastward direction dipping up and down very quickly. the movement drew my attention but i luckily continued my photo and pushed the button to snap the shot. just after the photo snapped it flew past the right side of my face so close i felt a slight breeze and heard a whoosh'. i didn't have time to turn my head but because of of my position i believe it flew directly over a sand burm and flew off east across the dunes toward hamlin lake. i had no idea what i'd seen until i dropped my hands and saw the image i had captured on my phone camera. because i read and research strange phenomenon i knew immediately what i'd witnessed. i believe i observed a 'flying rod' also known as a skyfish. it was dark colored in the distance but showed up as golden in my picture. i had the distinct feeling it had flown in off lake michigan, circled the tower light, and dropped down towards me flying in a west to east direction. by this time of year there aren't any insects larger than a fly in the air and the sound it made was a whoosh.  no buzzing, no flapping but a whoosh. i've lived in michigan my entire life and have tended to the light every year for the last 10 years +/-. i'm well acquainted w the flora and fauna of the area and have never witnessed anything like it. i'd swear an affidavit to all the above and would take a lie detector test as well. i have the picture in my possession as i report this and will include it in this report.","distance":"20 Feet or
