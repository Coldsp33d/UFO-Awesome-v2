my dog for a walk. the sky was mostly clear aside from some distant clouds. i really enjoy space and the night was dark so i was looking up at the sky trying to find stars and satellites etc. at this point i am maybe a quarter mile down the road from my house, if that.  \r\n\r\nheading west down the road i noticed a bright light in the distance that i immediately thought was some absurdly bright star because of where it was on the horizon and how bright it was. but as it approached i then thought it was a strange airplane, because i could see red and blue lights to the side of the original bright light. i was confused because it looked at first like someone had mounted a huge flood light on a far away airplane. but as it approached, with my now heading east returning to my home, i realized it must've been the size of a minibus, possibly larger. first i was very curious and then i realized that this could be a ufo.\r\n\r\nat this point it is headed directly over me and i am starting to panic. i was under a street light and my dog was also starting to get uncomfortable, so i grabbed him and hid in the shadow of a pine tree. the craft flies right over us, thus how i was able to get a good look at the bottom. the bottom looked like it had some sort of jet on it? they were too bright for me to see the real shape so i drew them as best i could.  the craft itself seemed to be hovering, the air around it shimmered as though heat was being given off. i am a poor judge of feet but it was maybe 500ft up? the way i described it to my mother was that on a very windy day i probably could've flown a kite up to that height. it looked to be a dark grey/light grey/black and the jets were an orange color almost. it also had jets on the back. jets probably isn't the right word for it but i have no words to describe them. they could also have been heat vents now that i think about the structure. \r\n\r\nso this thing hovers/flies over us, heading east. it's not directly above me but only slightly north. i am terrified and hiding in the shadows, a human in a craft at that altitude would definitely have spotted me in the light. it keeps heading east, moving very slowly. eventually it starts slowly turning south and i'm starting to worry it's coming back for us because of how strangely it turns. but thankfully it corrects itself and continues south, towards downtown milwaukee, almost looking like it's following the milwaukee river.\r\n\r\nat this point i'm in panic mode and as soon as i felt it was a safe distance away i ran as fast as i could back home. when i checked the clock here it was 10:44.

the backyard and went back to see if i could see the owl again.  that's when i spotted the triangle.  it seemed to be completely matte black, and had no lights on it.  i wouldn't have been able to see it had it not been low enough to the ground for the street lights to slightly illuminate it.\r\n\r\nwhen i first spotted it, it was parallel to the ground with one point in the direction it was traveling.  i'll call this the nose.  the nose seemed to be slowly pitching down though it's altitude and path did not change.  to me, it seemed like gravity had no hold on it, and it did not appear to be powered up (but what do i know about these things?).  it moved slowly, maybe highway speeds, but almost certainly under 100mph, though its difficult to judge without knowing exactly how big or far away it was. \r\n\r\nit seemed to be mostly flat with some detail on it.  the object was a solid equilateral triangle with a height roughly 15-20% that of one of its sides.  the tail edge was broken up in a manner similar to the picture i've attached.  sorry for using a \"classic\" tr-3b image, but what i saw really did look like what you get when you plug tr3b into google.  however, in regards to the attached image, what i saw did not have a pyramid shape, the tips were more rounded, and it appeared to have \"greebles\" (for lack of a better word) on the surface.  as far as its size is concerned, it was larger than a cessna, but much smaller than the c-130s that fly around this area.\r\n\r\nas far as the other bullet points listed:\r\n3: i thought (and still do think) it was probably some top secret military air/space craft.\r\n\r\n5: survival instinct triggered my fear response at first.  never seen anything like it, but that quickly dissipated into pure elation and joy.  i've been looking at the skies for years trying to spot something i couldn't immediately explain, and there it finally was.  the whole event lasted a matter of seconds.  i could have hit it with a green laser pointer, but that probably wasn't a good idea.  it might have a bigger laser, after all.  my pocket flashlight was too small to reach it, and neither my cell phone nor my dslr would have been able to focus or pick up enough light to get anything.  which brings me to...\r\n\r\n6: i lost it behind some neighborhood trees.  like i said, it was low and i only spotted it because of a clearing where the neighbor's house is.\r\n\r\nin closing, i got the distinct feeling this was a man made object.  i really have nothing to base that on, except nothing about it screamed \"alien\" to me.  maybe i've been jaded by years of sci-fi movies and tv.  anyway, feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  email is best.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

got my glasses and ran back out to the porch. one of my friends was up for the weekend, and he was asleep,in the back room. i didn't even bother to wake him at that point because i didn't really know

there was four of them, white, in a circle on the bottom. and then i saw a huge dark triangle  sillouette probably 200 ft across the widest point of the object. it was moving really slow and low. slow enough i could see the outline perfectly and the lights were not as bright as what i saw in the sky looking at the star. but he lights were inside a circle on the bottom of it and a blinking strobe on

urge to take my 2 year old son outside for a walk to look at the stars. we left our apartment complex neighborhood and followed a path that lead into a darker more secluded area with walkways and no street lights. this area is about a five minute walk from our apartment. there are walking paths that follow alongside a small flowing stream and trees. just a nice area to view the sky away from lights and buildings. i was carrying my son in my arms and walking when suddenly he says daddy look and points up, not directly above us, but up in front of us. i looked and pointed as well. what i saw shocked me. it was barely visible. i could barely see it, but could notice a very very large wide v or chevron shaped craft just hovering completely still. it was a very clear night no moon and the stars were clear. this thing blended in with the stars. it was completely still until a few seconds after we pointed at it, then it moved from east to west toward the rocky mountains directly over us. i could see the stars in the sky through this craft. almost as if it were glass or transparent. i only could see 7 orange yellowish circular lights under it as it flew over us. the lights were faded to the same brightness as the background stars but were much larger. the transparency was exactly like the predator in the predator movie with arnold. we could see just barely an outline and it somewhat distorted the stars in the sky above it as it moved. it moved in a solid straight path eastward. it was completely silent. no sound at all. it was hard to tell the size and altitude but i would say it was flying low, really low. like 500 or less feet maybe even 100 ft. i mean it was right there close gigantic in our face. it was bigger than our entire apartment building. we kept pointing and starring as it passed over us. it was hard to see when it was hovering, but easier to see as it moved over us and it faded as it kept moving west. eventually it just blended in with the night sky the farther it flew away. there was no emission no smoke or exhaust or afterburners or fire of any kind. absolutely no sound at all the entire time. no blinking or flashing lights. only the seven circular orange or yellowish lights underneath it. i couldn't really tell if there was more of a shape to the craft but i could kind of see it was a very wide v or chevron shape because of the transparent distortion of the background sky and the lights underneath. i was frightened and so was my son. we just got out there and after seeing this we were both ready to just go home. i felt very frightened more than anything, because of the size and the invisible stealth like qualities with no noise so close almost felt like we were being stalked. i also found it spooky that i had a sudden urge to go out there at that time. i have had a few other ufo encounters in the past few years. this was the scariest one. i was excited to see it, but it frightened me and my son.\r\n\r\nnot sure if we just happened to stumble upon some sort of secret military surveillance drone or if it was something else. even though we were both scared after witnessing it, i continued to walk further down the path and i also noticed headlights driving on the path that no public vehicles were allowed. as we went further i was also aware of 2 suvs that seemed out of place just parked with their headlights on the side of a rd to our right as we went further down the walk way. there was also this green laser like dot i could see moving away from us as we walked. i became fixated on it wanting to know what it was. it was far ahead of us but in the obvious walking path area. it could have just been some person with a green laser or a very bright green light of some kind. and maybe the suvs were just there parking to go to somebody's  house. i just had a strange sense about it all. it just did not logically match any known craft.  very spooky!","distance":"101-500 Feet,

an object which i had seen two nights earlier. i observed what i thought was a star (both on the first and second night). it caught my attention, because it was overly bright. it twinkled like a star to the naked eye and hovered and stayed in the same position for quite some time on both nights.\r\n\r\non the first night, i periodically viewed the object, went away and then returned later to look at it again. i noticed that there had been movement to the right in my field of view when i returned to look at the object, but movement was imperceptible while standing looking at it. during my last viewing on the first night, i thought that the object was going to move behind the line of houses, however shortly before reaching the line of houses the object faded and disappeared. due to this sudden fading i thought that it must have been a chinese lantern. however, when i viewed the object on the second night, i changed my opinion.\r\n\r\non the second night i decided to try to video the object. unfortunately, i could only use my mobile phone to video the event, nevertheless i was astounded at what it revealed. i was disappointed at the quality of the video. a combination of the following affected the quality, resolution, low light, camera shake and foreground lights.\r\n\r\ni took video footage with both standard resolution and also 4k. even though i filmed with 4k, i still got camera shake. the object was too far in the background to see properly. so i did the following, i viewed the video on my mobile phone, zoomed in, tried to progress the video a few frames at a time to try and freeze the object and eventually during one of the freeze frames i couldn't believe what i had captured. it wasn't a plane and it wasn't a helicopter. if it was a drone, i've never seen one like this. i saw, at first, three defined white lights in a compact triangle, moving the video forward i noticed four defined white lights in a compact square. forwarding again i noticed four compact lights, but this time the four defined lights appeared on a blurred, diamond shaped background; a square on a diamond. the object continued to alter in this fashion.\r\n\r\nwatching the video it is difficult to identify what is going on, so i froze the video and took a couple of screenshots which captured the lights as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nthe object had disappeared by the time i turned in on the second night, but i didn't witness its disappearance. to date, it hasn't returned as far as i know.\r\n\r\nthe object was viewed through a window, but no reflections interfered with the viewing of the object. i would recommend using some advanced video viewing technology to help to stabilise and isolate the object, to assist definition and to allow single frame advance to view the changing shape of the object. the video does not show the object in view until 1 minute and 29 seconds in and it appears in the sky above and to the right of the street light.","distance":"Over One
