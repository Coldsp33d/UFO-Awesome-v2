7'-main body-specifics of beam were not comeing off body but apx.75 feet from body then were lit by unknown-i could not see \"arms\" projecting out.Very strange light,orange light in a perfect round

move water in the area of this thing! i have never been so sacred and said i was going to run over anything (gray or white) with my honda 90. i went to canal off crossroad as beams went back over my head apx.60' this time as the \"potato\" went downcrossroad,north 2 to 3 mph. there are things i have left out and will tell you in more detail. as beams came threw barn walls. also they reappeared 3 months later over my house in another location, only they were at about 1500',cars on highway 99 were stopping and looking (or photographing). thank-you.J. ahlstrand","distance":"101-500

that. i looked up and seen 2 dark objects flew past 250 to 500ft over head. no lights of any type. it was completely silent for the most part all you could hear was them cutting though the wind/air..

detection these things were heading i guess that's what it was i say to myself.. this is were you gone think i'm crazy these objects are just seconds away from being out of sight now the are over the gulf now they make a turn back to the west and one stars glowing orangesh red then the second one starts glowing. they keep heading west untill over the marsh they seam to be running the tree line right at the marsh the one speeded up and went out of sight. but the other slowed down and looked as if it came to a complete stop and was hovering and started to move up and down like a yoyo it dun that for about 30 to 45 seconds and then it started getting real dim then on a down stroke it went out or somthing .I set there about 2 more hours but nothing i get up and head back to the house .After i get back home i think i could see it though the trees i could see somthing .So i jump in the car  ride back down to the river but it was gone i did see a light though the trees but can't be a

down after spending most of the night \"looking for ufos\" (i had seen one the november prior (1974) and was anxious to see another), but tiring of looking at the night sky, i decided to rest the remainder of the drive home. not two minutes went by when my mother and my brother started shouting. i popped up to see what the yelling was about, and mom explained that there was a bright blue ball in the sky on the driver's side, traveling the same direction as us, and that it descended in a zig-zag pattern out of sight beyond some trees about a half-mile to our left. these were trees that lined the trinity river bottoms that lay between our car and our destination, which was our house located along these bottoms.  this trinity river formed the northern border of our land.\r\n\r\nthe made-for-tv movie about betty & barney hill had *just* been aired in the week prior, and having seen the movie, mom was especially upset, convinced that the same creatures that got the hills were now coming to get us. she calmed down and was able to sleep but not for awhile. the sighting was very exciting but also upsetting to her. later, she was mostly fascinated by the color of the object, that it was \"the most beautiful blue\" color she'd ever seen.  she talked about how beautiful it was until she died. she was always convinced that it was among the kinds of things people were seeing a lot of in those days. we heard a lot of other stories.  as much as people out there might keep such a thing private, there's also plenty of sharing of stories, so there tends to be more of an open mind toward it than you'd think. country folk out there love a good legend, be it ghost or ufo.\r\n\r\nthe incident that night was the second sighting by our family in just two months. the nov. prior -- nov. 19 1974 to be exact -- my mother, my grandmother, and i saw a different object -- amber-colored, bright, and shaped like a saucer on its edge -- that moved at a high rate of speed across the northern part of the sky at dusk.  i was a young boy of 10, and i made a \"flip book\" out of one of my mom's old check books, to draw how the object skipped like a flat rock on water as it moved. \r\n\r\nin the area where we lived, our family had - i would count - five fairly dramatic sightings of various objects, all different, and spanning the period between the 1950s to the 1970s. of these, a daytime sighting by my great-uncle, a well-known peanut farmer in that area -- involved a silver sphere that was seen to descend at just about the same spot where the big blue ball also seemed to have come down.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
