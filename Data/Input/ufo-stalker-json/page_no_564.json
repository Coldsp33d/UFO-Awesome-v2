near detroit metropolitan airport. it was a cloudless day and the sun was high in the sky. temperature was about 80 degrees. beautiful day. the event occured in the year 1993. i was at work at a youth facility and decided to take a break so i went outside to the parking lot and sat in the shade on the ground against the building. while i was sitting there i watched commercial planes coming in for a landing as the facility was near the approach path of landing aircarft. i was trying to see how many airline companies i could name. i could see the insignia on the planes quite well. that's how low to the groud the planes were. suddenly the planes stopped approaching the run way. they had been approaching on the order of every 2 mintes but suddenly there were no planes. i thought this was very odd so i looked in the direction the planes had been coming from and to my amazement i saw two large gray spherical objects on the same flight path the planes had been on. they were moving quite slow but the speed was constant. as they moved pass me the object which was to the right of the other object change it's position from slightly below and to the rear of the other object suddenly changed it's position from the rear and took up a position in front of the other object which was to it's left. the position change was almost instantaneous. a split second. really weired. and it resumed it's previous speed. the objects were dull gray, spherical and quite large. large enough to carry two normal size people or three smaller people. they continued on their way whith out increasing speed. i watched these objects slowly move across the sky until they were beyond the horizon and i could not see therm anymore. a few seconds later air traffic to the airport resumed. the even scared the hell out of me. i wanted to run and hide after i realized i was watching two ufos. but curiosity made me stay and watch. the entire event took about a minute or two. i can make drawings of the objects if you want to see them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

to have a cigarette and i had brought my binoculars with me because of a previous time about a month or so before had seen something in the sky. so i am looking at the sky with my binoculars and i feel my friend grab me from my shoulders and literally pick me up to face me at his back yard instead of his side yard and he tells me i'm looking the wrong way. well my mouth dropped. a couple houses back right above the treetops was a huge sun like object glowing red n orange. it's hard to describe, it had the brightness of the sun so you could not see a physical shape as if it blinded you however it didn't light up the night sky like a sun would if that makes sense. it made no noise at all and just kept coming towards my friends house very slow motion kind of a hovering motion a slight up and down forward movement. my friend said he was going to run inside to grab his dad's binoculars which i did not want him to leave me,if i had to give a distance at that point i would say maybe a house away as he went through his sliding back door to shut it i had turned around to see him when i turned back the orb/object was now almost direct above me and i could now see it was a round object with very tiny lights that went around the entire bottom every color you could imagine. now as i'm watching the red/ orange glow was dimming out at the same time the lights and shape started to show and within seconds it appeared to go in an upwards motion while dimming all lights and just disappeared completely. my friend came out a few seconds after and asked me where it was, i pointed up, lol. a minute later we both heard a couple of helicopters which sounded like the military but we never saw anything even though they sounded like they could just about land in the back yard. we should have been able to see the helicopters, i still think about that.

these parts, i see a lot of meteors, and this was very different, in part because the trail behind it was so clean looking, and not like something was breaking up. as it raced to maybe 15 degrees

campsite near the neversink river, in cuddebackville, ny.  my brother (15-17 yrs old at the time), my boyfriend, and i (18-20yrs old) were returning home late one night (probably a sunday between @ 11pm - 1am) after a weekend there.  my boyfriend was driving his toyota land cruiser with the roof and doors off. the area was very rural and heavily wooded on both sides of the two lane road, with the river to our right. at one point, my boyfriend braked suddenly and stopped the jeep without pulling over. he jumped out of the vehicle and as i turned to look at him, i could see in the far back left corner of a field (to the left of our jeep) an illuminated silver craft.  it was approximately 200 - 300 ft away from us.  the field was slightly inclined, with a forest just behind it. there was a mountain beyond the forest.  barbed wire fencing and a stone wall ran along its perimeter.\r\n     as soon as i realized that my boyfriend was going toward the craft, i screamed at him to not go near it! i was instantly terrified and feared for our lives!!! i ran from the jeep, leaving my brother sitting in the back seat, and headed down the road in front of us, screaming for help.  i finally came up to a house on the right side of the road.  there were no lights on inside or out.  i banged on the door.  without anyone turning a light on, coming to the door, or peeking out of a window, i heard a man's voice say, \"it's just the kids!\"  instantly, i heard 2 - 3 young children giggling from somewhere outside.\r\n     i do not remember walking/running back to the jeep, however the next memory i have is of standing next to the craft.  if my brother were looking up toward us from the jeep, he would have seen me standing to the leftside of the craft.  i could sense someone standing behind me and believe it was my boyfriend. i remember being amazed at how the surface of the craft seemed \"lit up\" as if something above us was shining a light down on it, but the surface didn't appear to be reflecting light.  i do not remember looking up to see if there was something up there.  the immediate area around the craft was illuminated as well, but the light did not reach out beyond a few inches or so. it was as though the craft's surface was emitting some sort of diffused light.  there were a series of multiple lights (the size of grapefruits - maybe a tad larger) around the middle circumference of the craft.  they were different colors.  i could not see over the craft, (i am 5.9ft), but it wasn't much higher than me - maybe a foot or two. i do not remember walking around the craft, but i feel as though it may have been @ 20 - 25ft in circumference.  nor do i feel as though i knew or was thinking about how it was the prank of \"the kids\" as i stood next to it. i was amazed this craft, but no longer terrified. \r\n     i have no other memory of the event - i do not recall walking back to the jeep, driving home, being home, or talking about what had happened!!  my boyfriend and i broke up soon afterwards.  i have asked my brother several times about that night over the years, and to this day...I can not remember what he tells me, which i find unnerving. that night has been bothering me for over 30 years. was it just kids playing around? why can't i remember laughing along with them or at myself for being so gullible? why are my memories so

family dollar parking lot, in crystal falls,mi. waiting for my fiance to return from the store, when i noticed a strange zigzagging contrail in the southern skies out my front windshield in front of me.\r\n\r\n at first, i thought it might be a meteor, because the trail seemed to come from nowhere, but i haven't ever seen a meteor change directions so sharply before...\r\n\r\n so, i kept watching it for a few minutes and tried to figure out what it was. then, the contrail straightened out and continued moving forward in a north to south motion. fluently. it seemed to remain at the same speed the whole time, as it had, when it zigzagged. at this point, i felt very confused and intrigued, as to, what it might be.\r\n\r\n looking closely at it, i could see a white point of light with a contrail following it, but the object was too far for me to clearly see what it was. now, my fiance returned to the car and i showed her what i was looking at, but the zigzagged section of the contrail had already dissipated leaving only the normal looking straight contrail...\r\n\r\n so, i had to describe to her what it looked like when it first showed up and, as i did so, it continued moving forward in a southern direction. as far as we could tell, it looked like it was descending towards the mi/wi border, which was south of us about 10 miles.\r\n \r\n while we watched this, wondering what it could possibly be, the object, or point of light, got brighter and the light trailed a bit before becoming the contrail. it was a white/yellow/orange/red color (in that order) and the way the light stretched was like a candle flame, starting small, then growing larger. \r\n\r\n then, the object reached the tree line on the horizon ahead of us and we lost sight of it. at this time, it was 1pm cst and i looked to the eastern skies, there was a large normal contrail following what looked like an airplane, but it was too high to tell. this was heading in a southwest direction, towards the object that we witnessed.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path

westward toward telegraph road/ burgundy village heating water for a cup of coffee. i look out the the window of the kitchen door and notice how blue and clear the sky was,  esp. after 3 days of rain. i opened the door to get a little fresh air and take a better view of the sky. i saw several people working in the yard next door. i was about to close the door when i saw them; two long silver craft moving from north to south flying over the midtown south high-rise  on huntington ave. which is about 3 blocks from my house. the craft i could see clearly, did not have any wings nor tail rudders, did not see any markings but saw flash of red on the lower flying craft. the two craft flew together at the same speed but separated by from what i could tell less than 1/8 or less distance from each other. the higher one was flying between 2-3 o’clock, the lower was at between 6-7 o’clock. their speed they were traveling between 25-35 miles an hour and the hight less than a half mile maybe closer. they traveled towards south towards huntington metro where they suddenly turned  in a sharp graceful u-turn westward heading in the direction of rose hill. as they turned, i saw a bright intense light coming from the rear of the lower craft. at that point i turn to the left and looked into the yard next door and was about to yell something to the two guys working on the porch but when i turned back to sky, they both were gone. a little more detail of the craft was that the front end of each was rounded, i saw no windows, the tail end was slightly  bulbous and both craft were as far as i could see were of the same make/size/shape. the only sounds i could hear was traffic from huntington ave and from the metro. i was a little freak out about seeing the two crafts- i don’t know what they were and i hope others that saw them would come forward and report them.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

getting ready to turn onto e walton ave, near the dollar general. \r\n\r\ni saw what i though was the medevac helicopter from the upmc altoona hospital, i said to my mom who works at the hospital \"there's the helicopter, there must've been a trauma.\" upmc altoona is the local trauma center. \r\n\r\nshe said \"that's not the helicopter\" what we saw was a blue light, with a blinking white light. it was moving south, and appeared to over, and following interstate 99.  we turned left on east walton for a block, and lost sight of it. we then turned right (east) onto kettle street for a block. it was directly in front of us on kettle street, at the intersection of kettle street and e pleasant valley blvd near burger king (about 5 blocks east of us). it was now a blue-green and hovering roughly 300-400 feet in the air. i thought it was drone. however, what i saw next, makes me think this is probably not a drone. \r\n\r\nwe turned left, (north) onto east grant ave to get home. my mom pulled in and i got out (with my coffee in hand) and walked toward kettle street to get a good look at what i saw. i made it halfway there when the object flew westbound, directly over kettle street. it was now a little higher up maybe 500-600 feet up. i could make out a black cylindrical shape, roughly ten feet tall by about 40-50 feet long with two white lights, one on each end.  the blue light was gone, and the white lights were solid. it was silent, the only noise i heard was a dog barking in the distance and cars traveling down east walton ave, a block away. \r\n\r\ni pulled out my cellphone (lg g3) to try to get a picture. my phone would not let me put in my passcode. i was finally able to get it unlocked and snapped three pictures. there was nothing in the first photo i took, and it's hard to make out what it was in the other two. \r\nit disappeared behind homes and trees, still on the westward course, toward downtown and buckhorn mountain. \r\n\r\nit total from the time i first saw the object to the last time i saw it, was about 2 minutes. the amount of time i watched it glide over kettle street just a few hundred yards from was maybe 30-40 seconds.
