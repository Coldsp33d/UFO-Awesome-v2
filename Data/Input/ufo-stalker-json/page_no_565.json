the sky offshore. i remember thinking \"how pretty, looks like the star of bethlehem.\" upon closer examination, it was actually four lights in a diamond pattern, each glowing at the same intensity. lots of airplanes in sky at the same time, maybe four or five as the cemetery is on the approach to runway 22n at o'hare (hubby is a pilot). this did not look like a plane, it looked kind of like the pleides, only much brighter and a bit bigger (and besides the pleides has seven stars with only six usually visible). this was really very bright. it was completely stationary. another dimmer diamond moved north to south toward the first diamond. it wasn't as bright. but when it \"passed\" the first diamond (about 2-3 degrees underneath, difficult to estimate speed), it changed color to bright red and kept going. it wasn't a plane, nor was it a helicopter. we have those frequently (we are on the flight path between two major trauma centers). these things made no sound, and the bright white one hovered for at least 10 - 15 minutes. another person came walking along and i pointed it out to her. just then a cloud covered it, but you could still see the lights for another minute or two and then the cloud completely covered it. helicopters sometimes show four lights (usually only three) and their lights are more \"linear;\" they also have a green and/or red light to indicate port and starboard. this thing looked like a diamond on a playing card, very precisely spaced lights at each corner. and it never moved or changed shape, just disappeared when the clouds covered it. i felt awe

couchã©e dans le lit de ma fille parce qu'elle recevait une amie pour passer la nuit. je leur ai donc laissã© mon lit ( double ). aprã¨s une pã©riode de lecture, j'ai ã©teint la lampe de chevet, je me sentais trã¨s bien car je venais de lire un passage d'un livre sur la pensã©e positive qui m'avait agrã©ablement touchã©e. j'ã©tais tournã© face au mur de la chambre qui ã©tait ã©clairã© par la lumiã¨re du passage derriã¨re moi. dã¨s que j'ai fermã© les yeux, j'ai ã©tã© au prise avec cette sensation familiã¨re et affreuse d'ãªtre totalement paralysã©e quoique trã¨s consciente. comme habituellement dans ces moments, je me sentais submergã© par une intense et lourde vibration qui m'emplissais d'une profonde terreur. lors de mes prã©cã©dentes expã©riences ( depuis la petite enfance ), je combattais de toutes mes forces pour sortir de cet ã©tat mais cette fois-ci, vu le bien ãªtre ressenti avant de fermer les yeux, je me suis dit d'essayer pour une fois de me laisser aller, sans combattre pour voir ce qui allait ce passer. dã¨s que j'ai eu cette pensã©e, j'ai ressenti ( entendu ) un gran claquement au niveau de la base de ma nuque et j'ai ouvert les yeux. j'ai vu ( ã  la hauteur de mes yeux puisque j'ã©tais couchã©e sur le cã´tã© ), un vãªtement beige pã¢le ( genre robe lã¢che ou soutane ) mon regard ã  suivi vers le haut et est arrivã© au niveau du visage. la peau de la \" crã©ature \" ã©tait presque blanche si ce n'est d'une teine ã  peine rosã©e. la mã¢choire ã©tait forte ( carrã©e ) ce qui me fait dire que cet ãªtre devait ãªtre du genre masculin. la bouche, dã©pourvue de lã¨vres me faisait penser ã  un trou et il me semblait apercevoir ã  l'intã©rieur quelques \" filaments \" que je pourrait dã©crire comme les fanions que l'on voit dans la bouches des baleines sur les photos. ã€ la place du nez il y avait deux fentes perpendiculaires. mon regard ã  ã©tã© alors attirã© vers le crã¢ne ( cette crã©ature etait totalement exempte de poils ), crã¢ne trã¨s large, osseux et gros sã©parã© sur le dessus et au centre par une cavitã© longitudinale de l'avant vers l'arriã¨re. le front ã©tait long et large avec des arcades sourciliã¨re proã©minentes surmontã©es par des espã¨ces d'excroissances ( que je pourrais dã©crire comme ayant approximativement le diamã¨tre d'un auriculaire de femme et la longueur de une ou deux jointures ) ã€ ce stade, je me sentais terrifiã©e et j'ai senti que cette terreur prenait origine du bas de mon ventre et remontait lentement  comme dans un cylindre du bas vers le haut. c'est ã  ce moment que nous avons eu un contact visuel. ces yeux ( de la grosseur de ceux d'un humain ã©tait entiã¨rement noirs ( sans le blanc de nos conjonctives ). juste avant ce contact, je croyais que la terreur que je ressentais allait me tuer mais je ne comprend pas pourquoi, je crois que cet ãªtre ã  interagi sur ma peur ( d'une maniã¨re ou d'une autre ) , car j'ai senti qu'il ã©tait bienveillant et j'ai senti la terreur refluã©e vers le bas le long du \" cylindre \" en ce qui ma paru une fraction de seconde, tout est devenu noir et puis blanc, et je me suis retrouvã©e marchant ã  cã´tã© de cet ãªtre dans un endroit (

as i looked at it       i saw it moving at a very high rate of speed, silent and in two seconds it passed at about 55 degrees  to the north above me and abruptly did a right turn. it made a slight and very tight curve to the north and shot away in another second. nearly a sharp 90 degree turn. i have never seen any plane or chopper ever do that. i am a former navy aircraft mechanic, 1977 honorable discharge usn, last duty station was nas, north island, san diego, calif. my father is a  air force master sergeant/tail gunner on b-52. i know aircraft and what they can do and this seemed impossible. the g-force of that turn would have been brutal. not a sound at all. it took approx. 6 seconds to go from east of yuma about 4 miles when i first saw it, to about ten o'clock to my left and shoot north and was gone. not any sound at all. three lights fairly close together. it may have been very large but it was difficult to tell. if it was small it was very close to me. if it was very large it could have been several miles away. i ran inside and told my mother i care for about it and posted it on my facebook and then ran back out to see if there was any other sign of it. after looking and watching and waiting for about five minutes i went back in and added some more to my facebook post and then it suddenly dawned on me that i should report this to mufon.  i once saw a craft above the rocky mountains as a teenage in high school with several friends in 1974. it was gigantic and was casting a shadow over several peaks in the mountains to the west of denver and almost as quick as i saw it and pointed it out to my friends and they saw it, it went from gigantic to a pin point in less than two seconds and was gone west from denver. then one other time in 1983, at night walking my wife home from her bus stop i saw something making a swishing sound going over head but could not see what was making the air noise until i looked really hard and could see an oblong/oval shape of stars moving across the sky above us. i pointed out to my wife sheryl and she bill holnesssaid she saw something moving but wanted to know what it was. it was silent as well and seemed to be very large and appeared to recreate the stars that were behind it on it's surface. the only way i even realized it was there was because the pattern of  stars were shifting slightly as it went over our heads. it moved slowly compared to this sighting and the one in 1974. i seemed  to feel ok at first after it flew away but within a half hour i felt sick, like severe indigestion and heartburn

in separate vehicles observed three airplanes that were a very dark grey in color without any markings. they were large four engine planes with approximately 100' wingspans.  what was most unusual was that they were flying at about 40mph and were less than 100' off of the ground.  i was certain the first one i saw was going to crash because it seemed impossible for such a large craft to stay airborn at such a slow speed.  the second plane came towards me at about the same speed but was tilting the wings about 80 degrees as it flew over a power line nearly hitting the line with its wing.  these craft seemed to be without weight.  the strangest part was they made no sound of any kind. two of them flew directly over my vehicle at less than 40' of altitude.  i opened my window a little and there was no wind or exhaust from the large jet engines and absolutely no sound.  i was in a moving van with my wife following in her car and she observed the very same things. there were another 3 or 4 cars that must have seen them too.  they seemed to be almost playing as they swung back and fourth tilting there wings at angles that should have stalled any aircraft i know of. i have not been able to identify the planes.  the outer 10-15 feet of the wings sloped down about 5 degrees.  i called 911 and was told that us military planes often practiced in that area.  these planes must have had anti-gravity and a different type of propulsion than forced air through jet turbines.  i have asked around my town in southern utah and others claim to have seen the same planes.  they were in sight for quite a while.  i was traveling 60mph eastbound and they were flying westbound at extremely slow speeds.  the one that banked 80 degrees over the power lines must have slowed to 20mph or less.  it almost seemed to hover at that steep angle.  the things they did were not possible by conventional craft.  again there was no sound or wind of any kind. i'm certain they were ours but not anything i can find on any sight.  i could clearly see the cockpit windows but because of glare could not see inside. these were very large planes.","distance":"21-100

lewiston, id.  most of them are seen at night, but we've also seen 3 cylinder shaped objects during the day now. during the day, the cylinders have appeared to be white, hovering, and then continuing on a path. no lights, no sound. we've witnessed several cylinders at night that have various strange lights, usually white/red/green that pulsate in an odd sequence.  there are also still bright orbs that appear suddenly. some stay stationary, other flicker and disappear or go on a straight path. still seeing these nightly. i've taken several videos, and would like to know what they are. i'm hoping they're just some sort of surveillance (although that's not exactly a good thing), and not something unexplained. we have watched the stars a few times a month for years, and had never seen anything like this until recently. my mother and sister have also witnessed these a couple of times, too. a weird sphere has flown near the highway above my car a couple of times now. if i pull over, it seems to \"disappear\" or turn off it's lights and not be visible anymore.   i'm going to attach a few different videos of various types of things we've seen. i have several more, if interested. if anyone has answers or guesses as to what these things are, i'd love to know.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500
