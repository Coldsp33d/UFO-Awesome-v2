pops/explosions sounds that at first seemed like fireworks or gun shots. when we looked out the window we observed this rather strange star-like object hovering and dropping star-like objects  directly under it that seemed to be making these explosions and disappearing. it looked like fireworks but still oddly was very different, as it seemed a rather strange display of fireworks. the ufo would suddenly get brighter and revert back seemingly without much order. it was a bit higher than where we were and approximately 2km away. this happened for about 5 minutes, slowly diminishing the amount of objects that exploded being dropped. at one point during this it seemed to cast a light which made us think it might have been a helicopter. we tried to decipher what it was as it sometimes seemed to exhibit a helicopters behavior, a comet, a drone or balloon with fireworks, but we ended ruling those things out to due to its strange behavior. after or maybe even during this it started moving horizontally west, while still leaving some of these objects behind, but this time it seemed more like star dust and no explosions were made. some of these \"stars\"would veer to the right and left of the object. this happened for another couple of minutes or so until it seemed like it was consumed by this fire with many sparks, like if it were exploding, emitting a lot of light. but it emerged out of this like nothing happened and continued on its path west. we then went to the balcony of the apartment to be able to see the rest of its path. at this point it seemed to seemingly interchange many colors without much order. it would usually be white/silver light but sometimes it would station at a red like glow. it then changed direction and seemed to come toward us, but then just seemed to rise and move to the north east towards the moon and orions belt. at this point it rose to the height of the clouds, maybe even a little higher. when it reached that height it started changing direction at will, moving up or down, and at one point it seemed to zig-zag/slither. after a while we lost track of it as it seemed to blend in with the stars.\r\n\r\napproximately 30 minutes later of the occurrence it appeared again at what seemed to be the same place. it behaved exactly the same way and did the same things as in the other occurrence. this time we were able to capture video of it, since during the first occurrence we were a bit shocked and the battery of our phones went out. also, i was able to see it before it started dropping the objects, so we had more time to capture its initial behavior. before it started dropping the objects it seemed to drop some star like objects which would some times glow a lot or simply looked like a star. the ufo also would seemingly glow a lot and go back to its \"original\"state. since we were capturing these videos through our phones, it is hard to see what truly happened, and after it started going further away it became harder and harder to capture on video, so we only recorded the when it appeared. the footage captures about i would say 30% of the magnitude of what we saw with our naked eye.\r\n\r\nlater in the night, maybe also 30-45 minutes after the second occurrence it seemed to appear again, this time much further away near the horizon. the light it emitted was red. it then moved to the west and slowly disappeared. \r\n\r\nthis event was by far the weirdest thing me and my 2 friends ever saw. nothing we have ever seen remotely behaved like this. at first i was particularly scared because the explosions seemed bizarre and could be releasing something in the air, but eventually we all calmed down. after the event we did some studying to try and see the distance the object was by the time sound took to reach us, which we came to the conclusion it was about 2km away. we ruled out chinese lanterns and drones as it would have to be pretty big to be able to carry the objects it dropped and also since it got to the height of the clouds it'd be very hard maybe even impossible for a balloon or drone to achieve those heights.\r\n\r\nthe first video 2502 is of the first occurrence. the second one 2504 is of when it appeared again. the third 2506 is right after that when it started dropping the objects that seemed to explode. the last 2505 is when it started going to the west and leaving behind some star like objects which you can see when zoomed in.

morning out in the countryside around 1:00am - 3:00am. i did not have a ride home and needed to be back by 6:00am to wake my brother up for school. i was in the middle of a backroad in the countryside no cars around no street lights or people it was just me and my phone was almost dead so i was truely alone. i was looking up in the sky at all the stars just thinking about whats out there and how little we know. i continued gazing at the sky for a long period of time when i caught eye to a group of larger appering bright white lights they kinda looked like stars although they were not ordarny looking considering they wer much closer than all the other ones and appeared inside our atmosphere and so close togher. about 3 minutes had passed and all of a sudden a red light flashes in the middle of all 3 white lights and has an uneven but simetric pattern. to put it in simple words it would flash once every 5 seconds but on some 10 or 15 seconds would pass before the flash. i found this very odd as the object was in the same spot for over 2 minutes no flashing then this starts, as i continued to watch it for another minute or so just sitting there clueless of what it was, it started to move at a rapid speed. after about 5 seconds of this object in movement it went from 0km/h to well over 250km/h and vanished leaving behind a bright flash and blue faze, i think the blue faze was the ufo going through our atmosphere at an incredable speed. ive seen thousands of planes, helicopters and sattalites in my life over and over every day but ive never seen anything like this

com minha esposa, quando levantei para fechar a cortina da varanda, e percebi alguns pontos de iluminaã§ã£o na base do morro sã£o joã£o que fica de frente para o meu apartamento(3km). pensei ser farã³is de carros trafegando na auto estrada, mas descartei logo, pois estavam estacionã¡rios e movimentando se de maneira lenta mas regular e sincronizada. quando notei que realmente era uma anomalia luminosa ali naquele local, eu imediatamente comecei a descartar hipã³teses de que seria qualquer objeto conhecido como aviãµes, helicã³pteros, drones, balãµes, sinalizadores(aã©reos e marã­timos) enfim, e logo entã£o mudei de posiã§ã£o para melhor ver aquela luz. subi para 3âº andar do prã©dio e de lã¡ avistei com muita clareza o evento de que se tratava aquela luminosidade. percebi que eram na verdade vã¡rias luzes pairando entre 200mt da base do morro e acima do nã­vel do mar de 100 a 150mt. estavam sobre o rio sã£o joã£o, em uma curva situada a lateral do morro. tinha uma luz muito mais forte do que as outras que circulava ao redor das menores, essa maior tinha a coloraã§ã£o branca mas porã©m um pouco avermelhada laranja, que oscilava entre o vermelho forte e o branco. neste ponto do evento, eu desci e confirmei a minha esposa que se tratava realmente de algo incomum naquela noite escura. peguei minha luneta e atravessei a rua e subi em cima de um morro que fica em frente a minha residencia(25/30 metros de altura). quando cheguei lã¡ em cima pude ver com muita clareza pois as luzes ambientes da rua nem do prã©dio podiam mais interferir. na sequencia a luz maior que circundava as outras parou, e as menores por sua vez posicionaram se ao redor formando um triangulo obtusã¢ngulo, dai entã£o apareceu mais uma luz que vinha direto do morro e se juntou a formaã§ã£o, demorou algo em torno de 20 minutos a mesma luz que saiu direto do morro, voltou lentamente para a base do morro e em sequencia as outras menores foram seguindo em fila indiana excepcionalmente metrados, muito bem divididos, que fiquei impressionado com aquela exatidã£o na formaã§ã£o. as luzes seguiam atã© a luz que veio direto do morro e iam sumindo, uma a uma, sendo que a luz mais intensa ficou na mesma posiã§ã£o em que estava quando se formou o triangulo, ela permanecia oscilando entre vermelho laranja e branco, quando todas as luzes chegaram a base do morro e sumiram, restou apenas a luz maior e a luz que estava na base do morro \" recepcionando\" as outras luzes menores. por fim essa luz se apagou lentamente, e a luz maior ficou estã¡tica e foi se apagando lentamente, mas nã£o completamente, com a luneta dava pra perceber que ela ainda estava lã¡, porã©m sem luz acesa forte, mas uma luz de baixa emissã£o de luminosidade, era quase imperceptã­vel, as vezes ela piscava forte e apagava, e oscilou modestamente, atã© eu estar completamente cheio de picadas de insetos, e nã£o aguentar mais ficar ali.\r\n enquanto refletia sobre oque tinha acabado de ver, olhei em direã§ã£o ao local onde elas estavam e pensei, \"eu vejo vocãªs, eu sei que estã£o ai\" incrivelmente a luz da base e a luz maior piscaram  sequencialmente e se apagaram por completo, que nã£o dava mais para ver reflexos e nem sobras. ali percebi que realmente tinha se finalizado o evento. na noite seguinte acordei(3:15 am)com a persiana do meu quarto aberta, entã£o levantei e fui fechar, quando percebi que em cima das caixas de ã¡gua da fazenda que fica no morro sã£o joã£o, pairavam as mesmas luzes da noite anterior, a vermelha forte e as mesmas que a cercavam noutro evento. ficaram por cerca de 30 minutos atã© seguirem em fila para outro ponto do morro ao qual eu nã£o tive acesso visual. desde entã£o fico vigiando essa ã¡rea, jã¡ pensei em ir atã© lã¡ investigar, fazer uma entrevista com os moradores da fazenda, que estã£o diretamente envolvidos no fenã´meno, pois essas luzes passam por cima da cabeã§a deles, pairam sobre a caixa da ã¡gua deles, algum contato jã¡ deve ter sido feito com eles, creio eu.\r\n esse foi o relato mais detalhado que eu pude dar. \r\nobs.: jã¡ tive muitas outras experiencias com esse tipo de fenã´meno aui na minha regiã£o a qual moro jã¡ faz mais de 18 anos, e acreditem aqui ã© um hotspot ufolã³gico certificado.\r\ngrato pela atenã§ã£o.","distance":"Over One

explaining to him what the gardener needed to attend to for the day when a rowdy flock of birds - swallows it seemed, were flocking and screeching agitatedly - like birds do when insects are around. i glanced up to see what the fuss was about and as they cleared, i noticed a pinpoint of light in the sky - like s star. i thought 'that cant be right - the sun's too high for a star to be visible'. i turned to my husband to ask him if he could see it, but he couldnt focus on what i was pointing at.\r\nthen i noticed a second pinpoint of light. then a third. and a fourth. i thought 'what the heck is this? am i really seeing what i'm seeing?' then more appeared to the left of those and over the course of about 5-10 minutes the bunch to the left clustered together in the centre which freaked me out. i counted 14 at one point and kept recounting to keep track which became impossible as they were drifting across the sky - becoming separated as some moved and others trailed behind. at one point i ran to get my cellphone to call the local radio station to report it and hopefully that others could see what i was seeing. my husband could make out some of what i was seeing, but his eyesight at that distance wasn't great. these objects were far. high. as far as one would judge the stars at night.\r\nthey moved across the sky in a high arc from se to nw. i called the neighbours to come and see. her son saw it as well, but she couldn't make anything out clearly. and neither could another neighbour. the talk radio host must have thought i was nuts when i eventually spoke to him...\r\ntwo clusters had formed an identical pattern - like an arrow with a tail (like a christmas tree) still moving further north, with two loosely positioned in between. one of the objects, i noticed, looked a bit longer vertically, than the rest. after the clusters formed and drifted for several minutes, they faded from sight - possibly from the sun behind me as it created a white haze. when i eventually went back inside it was just before 9am. i've felt gobsmacked for the entire day - wondering who i could relate this to that would take me seriously. but, whether believed or not, i saw what i saw. i kept going outside the entire day to see if it would appear again. if i had to offer a thought i would say the mood was like a casual morning outing, trailing across our morning sky. i reckon they thought they wouldnt be noticed because of the sun's white haze. i wondered at the time what this meant for the human race. anything that can enter our space - without detection? - surely has better technology than we do and is therefore intelligent. if they pose a threat then what chance would we stand? i'm still freaked out when i think of that first cluster. what do they want

flashing lights.  i work doing home health and smoke so i go outside to smoke. the first time i kept feeling like being watched but thought it was animals. two weeks prior i kept seeing what i thought were fireworks around nine thirty at night off to the south. then saw a colorful circle shape across from where i slept the following week i saw what i thought were fireworks on the ocean horizon. then it became white and  move south so thought was a barge.  then i saw three diamond shapes combine to two to one then three ect.  i did not know what was going on so it scared me and i was talking to a guy i use to date at the time so he knew the fear i had.  the colorful circle stayed across from where i slept the whole night.  i got up as client need to go to bathroom and would look over the ocean and it still was there.  i was scared but went back the following week.  when i went back i was out smoking around 8 pm and from behind me over the roof of the house a black triangle plan flew slowly over my head with no sound.  i did not know what it was but knew it was not an american plane.  no lights flashing and it proceed to go over the ocean faster.  about an hr or hr and half later i went back to the room where i sleep and saw a beam of light come down on the deck outside where i sleep.I also saw about 10 white orbs on the ocean horizon spread across the ocean with and additional one going back and forth flashing lights.  the ones on the ocean just pulsated. this really scared me and i went to the other side of the house and was afraid to go back to the bedroom.  when i did go back i closed the curtain which i never did as i love falling asleep to the ocean waves prior to these events.  i of course prayed as i was scared to death at this point and contacted my boss the next day to tell her what i saw and that i did not want to continue going there on sat. nights and was taken off the schedule. i did show several co workers the pics i took and when blow them up u see faces.  i will add that seeing these orbs started during the blue moon.  my cell camera picked it up but u could not see to the naked eye. i went to another clients house two streets from long sands beach and continued to see craft up in the air on the ocean. i just watched them and at some points i saw them coming from ne at dusk heading to the ocean and some would go s and some would go n along the beach and those that headed out stayed stationary on the ocean horizon spread apart like i noticed earlier at other clients house.  i would pick up orbs blue, white and i think yellow to when ever i took picks outside no matter where i was.  even inland and visiting people.  it also affected my phone made lines and a circle that moved every time i turned on my phone.  i have been taking pics then videos for months as proof to what i have seen and started talking to others and showing them these and showing if saw them when with family and friends  the activity i saw when working on the ocean has been crazy and scary at times.  i also saw lights in a house the next street over from clients house they would dim the get really bright and had a flash that appeared to go around like a light house light and one of the orbs or ships whatever it is was not on ocean horizon but was at the house next store to this house appearing to be on the ground.  i have been seeing this stuff for months and see them where ever i go.  was at my oldest sons house and needed something at the grocery store i parked and looked up to see a craft hovering for maybe a min then it flew off.  it seemed like they want me to know they are there and watching me.  i do not have any mental issues and a very strong smart woman but we all know how some people feel about ufos.  where i live not i showed my sister one stationary in the sky  appearing to be a star and then two planes came over head seconds apart.  i told her no plane flies that close together unless military.  to me it seems like every time i went out day or night there were planes in my area or the star like stationary orbs and this is everywhere i go.  i use to see  one or two of the white planes leaving a trail behind. the past few weeks i have seen six one day as i traveled to work in the sky all heading south as i was and a few went south east.  the day before thanksgiving brought my client to get a hair cut and saw at least eight or the trail of them.. i do have video of this as well.  she thought it was them bringing back troops overseas but again planes do not fly that close as these were. i also have a  video of two of them with alot or trails from other ones one going south one going north.  the activity in the york beach area is crazy esp dusk as they all head to the area.. but they are active throughout the night going north to south over the ocean area.  i do not have pics on my computer to send but if u contact me with an email address i will send u pics and videos taken over the past few months.   \r\nthanks and if u need to contact me the phone is best way to do this\r\njulie   ","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1
