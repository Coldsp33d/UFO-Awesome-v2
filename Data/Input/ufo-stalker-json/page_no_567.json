towards california city ca about to drive over the trona train tracks. it was day light out still and very close to my 7th birthday.\r\n\r\n2. as we hit the train tracks we were engulfed in a blinding white light, and a powerful roaring noise.\r\n\r\n3. i thought i was going to die from being hit by a train was my first reaction, until i realized i wasn't dead but could see nothing but the white light everywhere and the roaring noise was so loud i blacked out as everything disappeared.\r\n\r\n4. i never seen a object do to the initial contact being the white light and noise directly above us. the light was so bright. brighter then 50 suns. i could not see my mom or my hand in my face. the whole car and everything around me disappeared in a flash of light and noise. \r\n\r\n5. during the sighting i thought i was going to be ran over and killed until i knew i wasn't dead and blacked out. i woke and it was dark out and i was sitting in the passenger seat in my moms camaro and all the lights were blinking as well as the radio was going in and out. we were stopped on the other side of the tracks on the right side of the road. my mom was sitting in the drivers seat with a blank stare on her face with her eyes open and not moving. she remained like this for several minutes and then came too screaming and yelling. she grabbed me by my shirt and violently shook me screaming \"are you alright?\" over and over again. i responded i was ok, closed my car door and we drove off.\r\n\r\n6. while i was blacked out, the object had already left the scene.","distance":"20 Feet or

was asleep when i suddenly awoke on hearing door open(hypervigilint). my body was paralyzed, but i could move my head slightly to see my closet door slowly open. once open i saw a small dot of light that spread horizontal then vertically to take the shape of rectangle asit formed was like looking at stars then turned white. then two dark energy bipedal figures looked out at me and around room , after a second or so they came through and grabbed me and tried to pull me to the entrance that opened. i mustered all my mental strength and with a burst of energy i was able to pull away from their grip and screamed.They fled back through the portal and it turned back to stary appearance then closed opposite as it open to small speck then disappeared. i got up and checked the closet door as it was left slightly ajar. the door was completely closed before event. my wife then girlfriend was unable to be woken up for some time after event. i have experienced many occurances throughout my life. and as a child i had been impressed with idea to train my mind while sleeping. these creatures were different than those i have interacted with. i have had my neurology tested and was found i have an increased electrical function. i often see dancing stars that move in zigzag movements, usually 3 at a time. on rare occasions i have ,what i can only explain as ,piggybacked on another's thoughts. limited sight no hearing or speak but impressions of communication that last from a few moments to a couple minutes that always end in a gray type entity looking at my direction with impression imprinted about realization of what i was doing then it stops and i no longer connected. as in my other reporting i have time traveled many times and believe it is assisted by other entity's. often my sightings and thought piggybacking happens before events like communication disturbances, earthquakes like the bc north coast 7+ ,russian metor.Also when i am in a certain physiology or i am in jeopardy of harm i experience the time travel the most. u can not count how many times it has happened as too numerous, but when connected in thought piggybacking i never feel fear, but empathy. the couple occasions i have encountered the dark energy entity's i always feel extream fear.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

glossy white that i've never seen before, it was flying in a little zigzag movement can not be an ordinary plane to fly like that, and high speed i've never seen before, especially at this

dark and did not help me picking up the lighting for something clear as well that this was the body quickly. i went immediately afterwards to report on this website.\r\ni could not follow it because

day\r\nlocation of sighting: west on eisenhower ave\r\ntime: 4:25 pm\r\nwitness: les thomas\r\n\r\nwhile traveling west on eisenhower ave. as passenger in the back seat of the car driven by robin b.  w/ her husband cabin on the passenger side. we were on our way to a local restaurant when i happened to look out the window on the driver side in the back when i just glanced up.  what i saw was several jets (i assumed) flying several miles over-head, saw their contrail which seemed normal in their shape. i was about to look away when a bright, shinning silvery object caught my eye. it was traveling southward towards ft. belvoir/ lorton area as far as i could tell. the object left its own contrail but it was different from those of a passenger jet. unlike the thick white exhaust that cones out from behind the jet, the object left a thin wispy trail that had a swirling/distroted effect, the object was circular-like, i could not tell its exact shape but it was not a jet, plane, blimp, balloon or kite. it gave off its own light and was not reflecting sunlight. i heard no sound because of the noise from the traffic, plus i had the window up. the object was moving slowly compared to the jets  higher up. we drove pass a row of trees that blocked out the object, i looked away for just a moment, looked back up and it was gone. i watched the skies for a few minutes more, but never saw it again. i told the others in the car what i saw, they did not see anything at all. the total time i viewed the object was about 3-5 minutes tops. i would like to known if anyone else saw anything weird in the skies of south fairfax county on veterans day? if so please respond. ps: i took pictures but, it was on a flip phone- if you ever try to take a pic of some super bright with one you know things can blur. the object can't be clearly seen because of the intensity of the objects glow. also remember, i'm in a moving car heading away from the object.","distance":"Over One

with my father and uncle. the sky was completely clear, the temps stayed in the upper 50s all day as we have been experiencing an artic chill, and i was just staring out the window as i often do from the passenger seat. i noticed what appeared to be a very short jet contrail at a high altitude that would disappear quickly and reappear in puffs or pulses as the object, which was very hard to see, seemed to be descending because the contrail was vertical, not horizontal as it would normally be. the contrail was far more visible to the naked eye, and i only saw a very brief split second reflection of light off a solid object at the front of the trail. i had never seen short bursts of contrail like that before and asked, \"what is that?\" \r\nmy uncle, who was driving, asked what i was looking at, not being one to take his eyes off the road. i described it to him and he said it was probably a pulse jet. though i had never heard of a pulse jet, it seemed plausible and i left it at that. i continued to watch as disappear, never taking my eyes off it. considering the object was nearly invisible and most of all i witnessed was the trail, i assumed it was a jet descending and as it did, less contrail was visible until i could no longer see any thing. it really did just seem to vanish. the whole sighting lasted no longer than 3 min. how ever some research in to pulse jet engines revealed that there has been little to no success with using them for air craft, except in the hypothetical case of the aurora project. while i believe what i saw may have been some sort of jet, it seemed a tad bit mysterious and maybe worth reporting.
