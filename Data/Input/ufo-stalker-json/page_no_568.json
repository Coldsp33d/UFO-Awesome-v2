remember scanning the night sky thinking how this would be my last night home. i had walked to the end of the drive-way.  i was a delayed entry soldier that the very next day was going to boot camp.  it is when i turned to look back towards the house, that something stood out to me.  the stars were gone in my view and disappearing.  then came the lights.  i estimate the light panels to have been 12 tall and 6 foot wide, touching seem lessly side by side. this was a circular type craft so these giant light panels were on the outside edge.  they started in a clockwise motion very slowly.  the colors they were giving off was mesmerizing and beautiful.  my focus then shifted to the bottom of this craft.  running lights had come on, but not as you would expect.  the glow came from crevices and glowed on the bottom.  what i am staring at is not metallic in nature, it is stone.  rocks the size of a cargo container or a semi tractor trailer. the entire circumference of the craft i estimate to be the size of a football stadium.  the rocks on the bottom were not smooth but jutting at various angles but seemingly as an upside down pyramid with no tip.  the craft slowed to a stop above me.  as i face my home, the craft floated in at treetop level from the west.  there was no sound.  a buzz or energy seemed to be in the air.  my next memory i am now facing in the direction north  watching it slowly creep over a row of trees.  it had done a change of trajectory over my head.  i ran into the house and found my father more than a bit pissed. saying he had been all around the house yelling my name.  30 minutes had passed.  my father has not really ever talked to me since that night.  i often wondered if he might have seen something.  in boot camp i was a squad leader and was given what i think were like a 4-5 man room separate from the main dorm that housed the rest of the men.  it was then that i would catch myself sleep walking, even the fire guard would catch me, saying i was making no sense.  i do not know if it was shock from my encounter, or a side affect of it.  i was given a top secret clearance and assigned the to air defense artillery. my job was to field test a new radar system trying to feed real time data to the toc's. the use of this new system would also integrate  the avenger systems to lock onto the deemed enemy targets the radar specified.  also was expandable by linking up to awacs.  the radar system was the anmpq-64 gbs ground based sensor.  i want to comment this is peace time.  i did 6 ntc rotations, including time at white sands.  working with the techs from hughes aircraft company.   i did my first 3 years 1/5th ada ft. stewart ga.  was given an honorable discharge, and re-enlisted to ft. hood tx.  as my honor and pride set in as a patriot that ran the same woods as george washington as a child, my guilt over carrying the burden for years set in.  i found myself driving the battery commander one day and i brought up my concerns that our radar system would not catch something like what i had witnessed.   remember this is 1998 and i have just told my superior officer that i have had a ufo experience.   and we happen to be in a military air defense battalion, oh and i have a top secret clearance, and was the first team to field the system.  i was told to take some leave time.  which was no issue for me had allot saved up.  so took 45 days.  went up the coast of california with some friends into upper cali and oregon.  nothing was out of the ordinary when i signed out for leave.   on day 33 i received a call from a friend still at the base telling me i was considered awol the mps had been by the house.  my battalion commander and s-4 had pulled my leave form from the cq desk, saying it was unapproved.  so in one sweep my security clearance was pulled, i was wanted.   i turned myself in a couple months later.  they bought me a bus ticket to ft. sill to out process.  i was given a less than honorable discharge for my second tour.  inability to adapt.   history will remember me as a un desirable, unrecognized by the same country whom i tried to warn, and help.   i personally view this matter is 1 of nation security.  at the very least we are being monitored as our technology advances.  my mos was a 14j  my job was to not only run the radar system, but to visually identify every known craft in the world's flying arsenal.  this was not a man made craft unless it is time travel in some form or matter.

i am extremely scientific and logical but i feel it is worth being told as i have harbored an uneasy feeling since the sighting.\r\n\r\nin late october of 2015, a friend and i were walking towards a familiar park at approximately 12am to play frisby.  my friend had just purchased a fairly powerful green laser pointer and we were pointing at stars and planets in the night sky.  almost immediately upon our arrival to the park, we spotted a single white light traveling directly overhead at about 90° at what seemed a very high altitude and a rate of speed that did not seem possible.  my first thought was a meteorite, however the light followed a straight sw course over the mountains and out of sight.  it covered the entire breadth of the sky in roughly 3 seconds.  this single sighting had us veey excited and we scanned the sky even more intensely probably out of a heightened sense of paranoia.  about 30-40 seconds after the single bright light was out of sight, we both spotted an extremely bizarre aircraft that had no lights, sound, trail and moved at what seemed to be a standard speed for modern planes.  it travelled the identical sw course until we lost sight of it.  i would estimate its altitude to be around 3000-4000 feet and blended into the dark sky reasonably well.\r\n\r\nthe second craft can be explained most likely as a military stealth plane and i would think it to be coincidental that we spotted it heading the same direction as the first.  the difference in speed and elevation between the two objects was substantial.\r\n\r\nthe first object, a single white light i would think was a heat shield that was producing the light.  although it was so far away we couldnt make out a shape, the speed alone is the most frightening part.  it was as fast as the fastest meteorites i have ever witnessed only it followed a perfectly straight course over the mountains and out of sight.\r\n\r\nagain, i have no reason to believe either object was extraterrestrial, but simply cannot grasp how humans have developed a craft that rivals the speed of the fastest meteorites within our atmosphere.\r\n\r\ni should also note that my friend tried to reflect his laser off of the second, lower object and no light was reflected.  im quite sure it would have reflected the green light if it was within a mile or two as we have tested the laser in the mountains, proving it can be seen from several miles.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

ago, when i was fourteen years old. i awoke one morning and floating outside my window was a yellow glowing orb about the size of a bowling ball. as soon as i looked at it it shot straight up into the sky, it didn't seem to be propelled by anything as if it were attached to a string. for the past year now me and my mother have watched as more and more of these orbs have started appearing around the surrounding mountains. there is one large orb that appears in the same spot every night at the top of a mountain, i have watched with binoculars as smaller orbs jolt back and fourth around the large orb, while the do this the orbs start to glow very brightly, they also sometimes absorb into the large orb. it is the craziest thing i have ever seen. i have also notices sets  of orbs that look like the headlights of a car turned on its side, one on top of the other. they seem to know when they are being watched because they sometimes blink off when me and my mm try and observe them. this needs to be investigated, they have shown up every night for over a year now. i'm willing to take a polygraph, whatever. all i know is something very strange is happening in canoncito new mexico. please please contact me, also i have seen two sets of  six unmarked black apache helicopters fly over my house, i will take a lie detector test. i have tried to obtain quality footage of these orbs but my camera sucks on my phone, i will try to purchase a camera with a zoom good enough to zoom in on them. thanks.......","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500

direction. shortly after (possibly thirty seconds to a minute later) another light appeared in almost exactly the same place. the light faded in from a blue sky. it took two to three seconds to fade in. it was in motion while it faded in. like the previous object, it was also near the cloud and was moving \"down.\" due to parallax it could be moving either down or southwesterly. it's uncertain to me. the descent was slow. it covered roughly  3 angular degrees in five to seven seconds in it's observed flight path. it disappeared behind the cloud. then a third light was observed in the almost exactly the same location. it was observed to do basically the same thing. i hurriedly went inside to tell someone what i saw. they came outside. they did not see anything and went back inside. i stood in the parking lot for another few minutes and saw the fourth light. it was in the same place and did almost exactly what the other three lights did (slowly descend behind a cloud.) i stayed outside for a few more minutes. shorly after, a small aircraft flew overhead. it had a light on it that was white. the light was periodic and gradual like a sine wave. the light on the plane seemed to repeat every three seconds from off to on and back again. it also had a smaller strobe light. as it flew over me i could hear it's propeller engine. it was travelling from north to south and flew below cloud cover over me about 50 degrees from the horizon. it was probably less than a mile away.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

(i am a professional photographer with more than 40 years experience. this was not a reflection.)\r\n\r\nthe object consisted of nine bright lights (the red in my drawing is about right, the blue should be as bright); three red above three blue above three red. there were no other lights. the lights were equidistant horizontally and vertically and aligned. the vertical spacing was somewhat tighter so the lights formed a horizontal rectangle of about 4:3 ratio.\r\n\r\nwhen spotted the lights were in motion moving horizontally from right to left. i first saw them behind the clump of trees that in the drawing they appear to be in front of. they were definitely behind them. they passed behind the pine and disappeared behind the apartment building. the yellow arrow indicates the movement as i saw it.\r\n\r\nthis camera view to the corner of that apartment building is almost directly due south. its movement was not rapid, but it was only in view for 4 or 5 seconds. i changed my vantage point to see if it appeared at the end of the building, but did not see it again. it had gone behind the building when my wife and son came out. i was the only observer.\r\n\r\n2. because it was so unusual and obvious and the weather was pleasant, i remained outside for a while to see if it would reappear. at about 1905 i began watching an aircraft light moving as per the arrow in no. 2. it was obviously an aircraft; the red port wingtip light was readily visible.  a few seconds after first seeing that aircraft, i noticed no. 3.\r\n\r\n3. this looked identical; the white light was apparently of the same size and brightness. it also moved at a similar speed to aircraft no. 2. suddenly, however, it stopped, and then began to move vertically downward. it moved at a constant rate, about the same speed as the aircraft.\r\n\r\n4. when it stopped the red-blue-red colored lights appeared. i could not see the nine of the original, just three, but they seemed elongated. i had the sense that the object had rotated slightly on its vertical axis. i believe that had it continued the rotation, the nine would have been visible. however, it did not. it continued downward at the same rate to no. 5.\r\n\r\n5. here it sat for 3 or 4 minutes. at no time was there ever any waver or variance in position or variance in the lights. there was absolutely no movement or change in what i observed. the lights simply stopped and stayed in one place. during this time i was able to change my viewing position in several directions attempting to get a better view and some sense of distance.\r\n\r\n6. after that time, the object continued the descent and disappeared once again behind the apartment building.\r\n\r\nmy wife had come out to see it this time and saw it for about 2 minutes until it disappeared.\r\n\r\ncomments: \r\n•\tthe skies were perfectly clear. the full moon was about 10-15 degrees above the eastern horizon to my left. \r\n•\ti am very familiar with aircraft of all types and observations under all weather conditions, day and night. \r\n•\ti am also familiar with both military and civilian drones. \r\n•\tthe size of the light grouping at no. 1 could not have been a hobbyist’s drone. to be the size i saw, the lights would have had to been on the near side of the apartment, not behind it. \r\n•\twhen i changed perspective at no. 5, there was a large change in apparent relationship between distant intervening trees.\r\n•\ti noticed no sound other than normal vehicle traffic. i saw no one else outside.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the little tease in the distance. in the recording u even hear me say \" what no motherships\".  i recorded for about 1 minute and 47 seconds.  i figured i was wasting my time so i gave up looking and reviewed the video.  upon observation i noticed that the moon grew over double the size, and i didn't hit zoom one time, there was no glare around the moon for auto focus and there are even clouds that r going in front or it during the moons enlargement, they do not change size. this happens about 47 seconds into the video right after u hear me say come on to the ship in the distance.  i know for a fact that the moon does not grow especially in a second and in the same place, and after it grows is when i say i'm very unsatisfied.  so it has to be a ufo do to the fact it was really going along with me while i was complaining to the craft in the distance.  i have always wanted something to send to mufon hoping to one day be apart of the ufo craze.  i have pointed out to people and even friends ufos on many occasions and not only have i pointed them out but they go along with what i'm thinking on a personal level.  like i said before they stick around when people r with me and even if i pull my phone out so if i get a good camera or even get up with someone from any ufo investigation company such as mufon we could get some hard evidence, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.  i also have some more interesting things to show not ufo related and on a way bigger scale that really can't be explained but that's for another place and time.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:01:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":72778,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.49904283964007,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11272015-0002","longitude":-72.0746996344828,"occurred":1448146080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1448587838000,"summary":"Was
