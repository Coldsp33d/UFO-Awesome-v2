clouds. i did not hear any sound from the object nor did i see any surface features. i have no idea what it was ( but this is not the first time i saw something strange in the sky... when i was very young i saw what i remember as a string of lights in the sky. i remember thinking it was like a necklace and my mom saw it too ) this one was different. it was large and solid and did not blink or pulsate or change colour ... it just moved across the sky. i do not know how long i was looking at it.. i watched it disappear behind a cloud. i did not see it again. as a student of physics and chemistry i tried to get some idea of size and all i can say was it was huge. i did not get the impression that it was low in the sky. i can still see this thing in my mind... but never spoke to

late night shop because i realised that i had run out of nappies for the baby.Whilst walking back home after just catching the shop which closed at 11pm,we were walking past northbrook college & i looked up pointing out the stars to my daughter as it was a very cold & clear night,we spotted one that seemed massive & brighter than the others & i pointed it out to my daughter;just as i ponted at it the star/light suddenly moved across the sky faster than anything i ever saw move!I said to her wow did you see that?That was no star was it!My daughter said mum look up above our heads & to my amazement there was this massive,gigantic object rectangular in shape & jet black but absolutely covered in multi coloured lights which appeared to be pulsating & changing colour constantly.This thing was gigantic i really cannot emphasise that enough,i mean like three football pitches in length.The underneath reminded me of a gigantic chessboard really as the extremely large number of lights were all in squares but as i said pulsating & changing colour all the time.I could see some kind of shapes sticking out above the rectangle base a bit like turrets or arms sticking out.I was transfixed looking at the object in fascination to start with but then quickly became very afraid & felt an overwhelming need to get my children away from this object & get back home.I remember telling my daughter to hold on to the handle of her brothers pram & run faster with me than she had ever run before.I was too afraid to look back & i do not remember the journey home at all,which is odd when i think about it now the next thing i can remember is being outside my front door & shaking with fear so much that i could not get my door key into the lock.When i got back indoors i realised with a shock that it was about 12.20am & that journey from the shop to my house should only have taken 20 - 25 minutes maximum;i had left the shop at about 11.05pm.But then i am not sure how long i stood gazing at the craft above our heads for but not long probably because we were very afraid!I should have reported this ages ago probably but my life went into a few problems soon after this sighting happened,it was only when i told my dad about it that rather than laughing as i had thought he might he got quite serious &said this must be reported as i think it sounds like a real ufo

waited to see if maybe it would stop, but it didnt. i finally go brave enough and took my cell phone with me. its dark out there with only a couple lights. when i went out the door to investigate there were some strange lizard/snake like beings running away into the dark. i chased them probably a little more than 20 yards and also trying to photograph themwith my cell phone. ive also heard them comunicating to each other in a very strange language and in very non- human sounding verbalization. i have learrned many things from these and other \"strange \" beings. mostl and from just from watching them and trying to understand their symbolic and other means of communication. i know what the great pyramid and perhaps many others were used for and were they have originated from. they were originally referred to as \" the vessels of the gods\" also the oldest know ufo's in the history of the earth. they've been used on our world in ways they weren't meant to be. mostly they were used as \"reanimation chambers, so in other words they were to clone or something similar to that and even genetic hybridzation amongst many species. there's even an hierglyph on the pyramid showing one of the incubator/birthing pods. i've also learned what the mayan crystal skulls were used for and even how to use them. there is just so much that i need to share with someone that will atleast listen to me with an open mind and i have tons of photos and other means of proof. otherwise all these i just keep to myself as i believe most people will think i'm crazy whether i have proof or not.

a clearing, and i wasn't driving (my mother was) so i was watching out the window. as we drove by the clearing, i noticed what i thought to be a meteor falling from the sky. it fell for a few seconds, but at a rate much steeper than most meteors i had observed before (it was close to perpendicular with the ground). i also noticed a greenish hue. while small, it was much slower and larger than any shooting star i had seen. after falling for a few seconds, the object performed a move that appeared to be a combination of a loop and a roll. it then seemed to disappear entirely. as it \"disappeared\" i completely lost sight of it due to more trees. by then, there was no way to see if it was still in the area or not. i immediately thought of the two options besides a ufo that the object might have been. first, a meteor, which is entirely possible, but like no meteor i've seen. second, some sort of bug, but since it was sub-freezing that night, i found that hard to believe. my personal opinion in the matter is that it was a meteor burning out in the atmosphere, with something causing the greenish hue, and my own poor eyesight (i'm a touch near-sighted and was tired that night) accounting for the erratic behavior of said-same object.

usually sleep late at night and i came out at night to have a smoke i saw a shooting star recently and wishing to see another one i looked up to see a star glowing very bright as i kept looking i saw that it was moving i have never seen a star moving caught with curiosity i kept on looking and suddenly i noticed another star brighter than the previous one but triple the size i was confused but then i noticed they two were looking the same but in different sizes i brushed my eyes to see if i am seeing the conical light due to some dust in my eyes but not they were totally clear just to confirm i washed my face and came back again to see them i was more amazed to see the second star has risen near to the second one and even it was hovering in the same way like the first now i was sure they were not stars as stars never change positions so quickly i kept on staring at them for another half an hour and i saw two plane s fly by as i saw the second plane i struck to another star which was very faint but was. moving in a constant straight line it was just moving steady without any flickr of light i watced it move across the sky and then suddenly 10-15 smaller light came out of it and started flying around it in a circle and they kept on flying i watched in astonishment and watched till they disappeared from sight due to distance i was now sure these star like objects are not aircrafts and i clicked 3 photos with my mobile of the brightest one among those. after 2 hours of seeing them i called one of my friend to have. a look and he was also amazed to see the bright light. he also claimed he has never seen anything such bright in the sky. to make sure i traced them for  2 nights  but i never saw them again.Earlier that day i read the news that many other residents have seen ufo and a re posting them  so i decided to share my experience too.

sitting in a small cove at around 10-11 pm watching the plankten sparkling in the ocean.  on the horizon opposite us, just above a large peninsula that reaches out into the ocean, we saw a glowing green orb which appeared to our left (north) and slowly traveled to the right (south) along the tree line.  at first we thought it might have something to do with the 4th of july fireworks, but it was soon clear that it wasn't.  it took quite a while to travel the length of the peninsula, and then it disappeared behind the right hand edge of our little cove.  so it's journey formed the right half of a large u.  we both heard or sensed something - can't remember exactly - and looked behind us, and there was the orb, pulsating just above the tops of the dense trees, maybe 20 ft away - more or less - it was hard to tell.  we simultaneously heard a sight splashing sound and saw a large, white raccoon emerging from the water, headed right for us.  in the moonlight, with the water dripping off of it and the plankten sparkling, it was a beautiful sight.  also scary - to me, anyway. my friend reached out her hand and said, \"hello little raccoon\", and at the same time i grabbed her wrist, yanked her up and we made a dash for the cabin we were staying in, which was close by.  something about that raccoon's purposeful march toward us didn't feel right.  we stayed on the cabin's porch for a while before going back outside.  the green orb and the raccoon were both gone.  we never made an effort to look for the area over which it had hovered.  keep in mind this was in maine, in a sparsely populated coastal area, and most of it was covered in dense woods.\r\n\r\ni have never forgotten this experience.  i have since lost touch with my friend, who - as far as i know - was the only other person to see it.  i am convinced that this was paranormal.  the whole thing - even the air - felt charged with some kind of unfamiliar energy.\r\n\r\nthe map i am attaching (or trying to!) shows the area.  we were just a bit north of where the \"d\" is in \"rd\", opposite the little peninsula that juts out just to the east.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1
