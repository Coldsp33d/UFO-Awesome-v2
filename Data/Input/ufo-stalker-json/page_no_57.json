me and my family were living in an apartment complex at the time near sandy springs/dunwoody, ga. i was walking with my mother to the bus stop to go to school, holding her left hand with my right, as she was on my right side. suddenly, about 5 to 10 ft away (there was an apartment building about 15 to 20 ft being them) to the right side of my mother and i, there were what seemed to be 2 or 3 of these humanoid beings which were covered in what seemed to be white robes and emitting bright light around their bodies. this bright light is what probably caught my attention in the first place. i pointed to them and asked my mother what those people were, something a long those lines. my mother remembered me asking her this but she did not see anything, she told me she just felt a very strong presence. the fact that she was there with me and remembers me asking her these questions is proof to me that it was not a hallucination or dream. one of these beings was standing in front of the other 1 or 2 beings behind it. i cannot remember the appearance of the beings in the back but i could clearly see the face of the one standing in front. it seemed very human-like, youthful, it had curly hair and a blank stare until it noticed that i was looking at it and then its eyes widened as if it was surprised that i had noticed it observing us. like i was not suppose to be able to see them once me and the being in front made eye contact. everything on their upper torso was white with a grey tone kind of mixture, including their faces, they were almost transparent like one would imagine a typical ghostly figure to be. i mentioned only 'upper torso' because i don't recall them having any hands or legs, including feet. they also seemed to be floating because of this. i turned my head for one sec and then quickly back but as i did i remember seeing them sort of float or hover away back down some stairs that were in the vicinity. i lost site after that. these beings seemed to be conscience of some sort, aware of their surroundings and did not want to be seen by me or anyone else but they did seem to be there for a reason. i do not remember anything before or after this event but my mother told me it started off as a normal day and after i got back from school she told me i asked her again about the beings. i have sketches that i have drawn but can't find them at the moment, when i do i will be sure to send them if needed. in the mean time if you have any useful information that i could use about what on earth i saw that day please send me anything as this has been on my mind ever since my early teens. i am now in my mid 20s and although i have had a few unexplained occurrences throughout my life, non of which were as vivid as this was. i have not seen anything, on that level, like that since. thanks for your time and hope to be hearing back from someone soon. have a great day.\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\nandres levy leon","distance":"20 Feet or

we used to do every night. when we left the house and started making our way to the car, he told me to look at how beautiful the sky was tonight and how there were no clouds and it was like you could see every star in the sky. so we both looked up at the sky for about 10 seconds and started making our way to the car to leave. before getting into the car i looked up at the stars again and i saw what first appeared to be some sort of plane or helicopter flying high in the sky. all i could see were the two red lights flying one in front of the other. i thought it was a plane, but the lights were not flashing, and they were also flying unusually slow for a plane. it was also completely silent, no sounds of a plane or helicopter whatsoever. i started to watch as the first light in front started accelerating faster than the one behind and started separating from each other. that's when i realised that whatever this thing was, it wasn't a plane or helicopter... i told my family member who was already in the car waiting for me to get in to get out and look at what i'm seeing in the sky. i told him that at first i thought it was a plane but now the lights a separating from each other. he chuckled and said \"don't worry, its not a ufo\" and then demanded that i get in the car before it gets too late. so i got in the car and watched this craft from the windows of the car until i couldn't see it anymore because it got to far away and then the trees blocked my view also. i couldn't record this event because i didn't own a phone at the

trough the clouds after it shot north. it was hard to tell if it was above the clouds or in them, and it's size grew from the first sight. i can't confirm if it was stationary upon first glance but i would be inclined to say it was charging up for take off.\r\n\r\ni walk my dog and watch the airplanes take off from rsw all the time. always hoping it's something else, planes generally ascend from the east and head west at a far slower speed with sound arriving before they go overhead.\r\n\r\ni've seen a similar instance in 2000 or 2001 on i95 south, it happened north of west palm beach. my friend and i were driving and i observed what i thought was a star that grabbed my attention and i was fixated on it. it began to shake and turned bright blue and shot straight down (south). as if it was charging up for take off or reaching critical mass to travel at a specific speed. i've seen shooting stars since then and nothing ever compared to that. i recently read (audio book) sekret machines which described a similar triangle/blue light craft, before that i dismissed this event as a bizarre shooting

started south i noticed the object within seconds of making the turn. it was just off to the left and above me. i could see it clearly looking up at the top left corner of the windshield. what was strange was that i was trying to identify it as something familiar and explainable i was thinking helicopter at first but could not fit the shape of what i was seeing with anything that i had seen before. as i drove into the countryside the light pollution diminished and it became much easier to see. it was very large and moved very slowly i was travelling at about fifty to sixty miles an hour and did not seem to be falling much behind it. for the most part i was behind it. the surface of it appeared darker than the night it had what looked like four blue flames coming from each of the rear corners there was a fair separation between the flames. there was a large glowing light in the middle of it which made it difficult at first to determine what the true shape of it was. i was thinking at first it might have been a diamond shape but after watching it for a while i can say with certainty that it was triangular. the illumination of the central light was not that bright but was visible there looked to be a glowing band of orange or red lights that followed the contour of the sides. none of the illumination was strobing and it was constant more like a series of lights or an glow showing up through a series of vents along the sides. i kept it in sight for the entire trip home from carleton place to smihs falls when i turned west at the junction of hwy 15 and roger stevens rd. it remained visible as i drove down the main street it slowly made a westerly turn no banking just a change of direction. i kept it in sight as i came to a stop light on beckwith street. there was no traffic other than myself on the main street when the stop light changed and i started off i noticed a young guy walking on the side walk i came to a stop rolled down my window and got his attention. the object was clearly visible and still fairly low so i wanted to draw it to his attention, i said take a look to your left and up what do you make of that he said what the expletive is that thing, i told him i had been following it for about a half an hour. in all honest i wanted to make sure that i was really seeing this and it gave me great comfort to know that he could see it as well. i continued down brockville street and it remained in sight i drove out of town and turned onto my road hoping that it would stay visible long enough to grab a camera and try and get a picture.  i had tried to use my phone to get a shot of it but didnt think it would get anything given that it was in the distance and pitch black outside and i was driving down the road at 60 miles and hour. i pulled into my driveway and hurried inside and got my wife and daughter to come out and take a look just so that i would have witnesses and that they would not think i was nuts. i also told my daughter to grab my camera so that i could take some pictures. i took some pics and some video the video was crap because it was to far away to focus, a couple of the pics came out but they are very far away telephoto shots. i went on the internet and looked at photos i am pretty certain that what i was observing was a tr3b. but i will leave that up to you to decide.

to me now? last year i finally spoke to my sister about the incident. she was worried we were not supposed to talk about it(she is now 64 yrs old). we were amazed to find we each had the same exact memory! we remember every thing including the military jeeps and being told to go to the club house. there a military man told all of us this was to be top secret. we were threatened and told never to speak to anyone including each other. never again did anyone of us speak of this incident.\r\n  in the summer of 1963 i was 12 and my sister was 10. we were sent to sebastopol,california to stay the summer with aunt lou and uncle alex.They had a summer camp on putah creek river. they went to it each year.I guess they had bought a lot on the river. uncle alex had built a shower house,a kitchen,and sleeping area that was all screened in, large enough to accommodate several large beds. the area between the kitchen and sleeping area was very large and lots of lawn chairs were always in a semi circle facing the river.All the camps were built by different people.A dusty road ran past to all the camps.The camps were all on one side of the road. my sister, myself and other kids would walk down the road to the \"club house\" to get a soda or ice cream.\r\n  on the first day, it was almost dusk,all us kids had played all day. there was a large tree that hung out over the river with a rope swing, we took turns for hours, swinging out and swimming back to go again. we were just told to get out of the water and get dried off for dinner. we were standing there with our towels around us watching the deer coming down to drink. to the left of us there was something happening. coming down the river was a huge object. it was about 20 or 30 feet above the water. it followed the river, as it got close to us, every thing stopped and stood still. i remember the deer standing still, looking at us. everything stopped for a few moments, no bird sounds, no campers, nothing except a quite swishing sound. it was so quite you weren't even sure if you were hearing it or feeling it. it was large, kind of like an egg that had been smashed almost flat. around the center were the most beautiful colors,reds,pinks,blues purples,white. the colors went all the way around the craft and changed all the time, kind of pulsating. we were all transfixed as it went slowly past us and continued down the river until it was out of sight. we felt no fear. all the grown ups were talking and all of us walked up to the club house. connie francis was playing, where the boys are, on the load speaker.I just know something important just happened.\r\n  the second day i woke up to see army jeeps going up and down the road. seems like the sheriff was also there. i don't remember much of that day. around dusk all up and down the river people were lined up on the shore in case it came back. only one deer was across the river. sure enough here it came hovering over the water no sound at all. as it past us i remember looking looking into the deers eyes as it also watched. again no sound but beautiful colors in a circular motion around the middle. when it was a few hundred yards past it shot up into the air and disappeared. then the sounds of helicopters, planes and jeeps, men yelling, and dust in the air. the army came racing by on mega phones telling us to walk to the club house immediately. road blocks were set up and no one was allowed to leave. now we were scared. as every one crowded into the club house area soldiers stood around with guns. a \"general\" or someone of rank talked to the grown ups. then he looked at each one of us and said \" no one is ever allowed to speak of what you think you saw. grown ups were threatened with jail time or worse. never again was a word ever spoken, even to each other as far as i know.\r\n  the third day we left the river and headed to my uncle's cattle ranch. i think it was around one or two hours away. when we arrived the military was there. several dead cows laid around. a huge round burnt circle was a few hundred yards from the house. men in white suits and geiger counters for radiation. after a few days they left and life went back to \" normal\". before we went back to school we all went to his ranch on the coast.\r\n  so that is my true story. thank you for letting me tell it before i get dementia, or die. lol maybe there is someone out there who can also remember this event.","distance":"21-100

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was climbing elevation as a passenger on a commercial airline that initiated from milwaukee to austin texas i believe en route to san juan puerto rico. i was attempting to relax in my seat as flying made me very nervous so i was seated with my eyes closed and was in this position for approximately 5 minutes possibly a bit more. i believe we were at a elevation of between 10-20 k feet and climbing still when i decided to open my eyes as the bumps and such were making me more nervous as i was in a feeling mode instead of a visual mode which is why i choose to always book the window seat as my ability to look out the window and see the beauty of the clouds and sky usually will give me some what of a calming affect it takes me from visualizing the beauty i'm seeing as to opposed to only feeling bumps and shakes of the plane and the unknown. as i decided to consciously look out the window i began to scan as far out as i could see as i could see for most likely hundreds of miles as we were minutes and hundreds or thousands of feet above the cloud cover below. while scanning the majesty of the sky and clouds below i happened to look down and back at about my 7-8 o clock position i saw a relatively large sphere or complete circular object. this object was at the 7-8 position as mentioned but also below us and out quite a distance. i would guess it was between 1-3k feet below us and out away from the plane about the same distance 1-3k feet away. as we all know everything is relative and with nothing to compare it to in the sky and at that altitude exact size and distance cannot be exact. however i believe if i were to place a bet on my estimates i would be in the ball park of what i have stated. if i were to guess the overall distance away from the plane i would guess it to be between 3-5k feet away at a diagonal down and out away from from the plane. i will note i was also sitting on the left side of the plane about mid plane. if i were to guess at the size of the object i would guess from 25-50ft in diameter. i cannot say with certainty although it must have been relatively big as i could see it clear as day and from the distance i indicated but without anything to compare it to i cannot say with 100 % certainty. what i can say is i believe if it were a full size airline at that distance it would have been alarming to me as i know there is a 2 mile bubble of which planes must keep at a minimum. so i believe i am very close with my estimates. i cannot say with certainty as to the speed of the ufo but what i can say definitively is that the object had to be traveling at a speed less than us as we were increasing speed as we continued to climb and were at a speed i'm guessing to be at around 350-450 miles per hour and we continued to pull away from this object. if the object was stationary it would lead me to 2 conclusions and that is 1) we would have been pulling away from it at a greater speed and 2) if it were stationary it would have to be much larger than what i estimated because of the rate at which the airplane began to pull away from the object and as the object began to give the sense that it was shrinking as the distance increased. when i initially saw the object i immediately alerted my girlfriend who was sitting next to me at the time and i believe i did not use the term ufo at the time but rather a big round metallic silver object. although i knew of the ufo phenomena at that time i was not interested or \"into\" the subject of ufo's at that time like i'am today. if i were i surely would have attempted to video it as well as alert the other passengers. lastly i will note at the time of my siting i was a part time scout for a mlb baseball team so my attention to detail was paramount and my job depended on my ability to evaluate things from top to bottom or head to toes. i will end by saying would give anything to be able to see such a thing now that i'm very much into the subject. i will also say i have since encountered other ufo's traveling across the skies but all were at night and nothing as clear or definitive as the one one noted above. thank you for your time.

while i stare at them. being too young i wasn’t scared but just curious starring at them from my crib. it happened sometime in the middle of the night(unsure of the time as i was too young but i know it was dark. on one occasion they just stared at me. these 2 shadow figures. a second time i was playing in my room about the same time 2-3 years old. this time i could see the hallight on from under my door when i felt scared and went towards my room door which i found out did not have a lock when i attempted to open it the door would resist. i could not open it and when i tried crying out i could not hear my voice no matter how loud i cried out. i don’t know how long it lasted but all of a sudden just stopped and my door once again opened and the lights which had gone off only in my room i’m assuming since i saw the lights on in the hall and could hear the tv my parents were watching in the living room. as a child from age 6-12 i would draw what i thought was a new alphabet i invented which is strange in itself but i would get the urge to draw out a new alphabet an example a would be a dot b would be 2 dots side by side c would be 2 vertical lines  but tilted forward like the forward slash on a keyboard and so on. then as a teenager around 1995-99 i would have these intense dreams of this global battle. i don’t know where but the landscape was unfamiliar and the only building was a plain square building with what looked like  egyptian hieroglyphics covering the front of the building. the building itself was large but looked like 3-5 stories tall. i remember i was part of the battle and was able to either jump far or fly but i was in battle with these reptile people who looked to be invading. another dream would be this giant eyeball bigger then me looking at me as i play i. my cousins back yard like i would do when i’d visit him.  fast forward to 2010 i go to sleep like any other night when i wake up to see a grey or light beige alien figure. he’s standing on my right hand side and i know i wasn’t in my room because the wall was on the right side of my bed. my eyes focus and i see it and shocked i make a  low ugggh! noise. it stops whatever it was doing and looks at me as it noticed i had woken up it waves it’s hand over my face and i don’t remeber anything after that. i woke up the next morning still thinking about what i had seen when i noticed a sharp pain with a burning sensation on my left inner forearm sort of like when you burn yourself the pain you feel after and the pain you feel the next day to where it’s still hurting but what i saw is what really freaked me out. i had a small v shaped scare about a half in wide and not like a cut but like a cut that had been laser sealed which would explain the sharp burning pain. i had that scar for 5 months and the burning pain never going away. then from one night to the next it had totally vanished but not before getting a picture. i haven’t had any expeirences that i know of to date. the dreams subsided and it seems they were done with me until a few months back when i start hearing these high pitched noise like a microphone coming in contact with a speaker. they last about 1 or 2 seconds and are nothing like the ringing in the ears. i’ve also noticed my body has been generating static shock to where i’m getting shocked from touching anything and not even on rug but in my kitchen with tile and bathroom with linoleum. it seems to last a couple of weeks then stops for months. overall the experience has left me with that of a victim and the feeling of being powerless with the fear it can happen again at anytime. i am confident putting this on an fbi polygraph because i know the results will be in my favor. i am of hispanic origin and am type o negative  blood same as my mother.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":89475,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.200654799999995,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01102018-0023","longitude":-119.1730116,"occurred":1269475200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1515614114000,"summary":"Didn’t

nevada county ca. with a third friend, old buddies from the 1970's in school. aug 17, 2007 around 9:30pm the first friend leaves and goes to sleep. mike and i are star gazing, warm and clear night, sitting behind his cabin looking to the east toward \"grouse ridge and north over the yuba river canyon. first we saw an abnormally bright star above the east horizon. it caught our attention, and it didn't move for at least 10 min's when 2 pinkish, fuzzy orbs appeared above it at 10:00 and 2:00. we were both glued to the sight when both orbs started descending toward the star both stopping below it. after 15 seconds the orbs started back up to their original spots and a little beyond, the star suddenly started rapidly moving towards us. it looked to be many miles away, possibly 50 or more when within seconds it was hovering right above us. we were in a small clearing next to some 50 to 75 foot cedar trees, the perfect triangle craft was hovering about 5 to 10 feet above a tree 20 feet to our left. we were both glued to our chairs stunned. it made a very prominent humming sound, no propellers. the perfect triangle underbelly was three bright frosty circular lights that covered all i could see. for only a minute or two, we looked up at asking the obvious, what was it. we knew what it was, when the last i remember happened, i remember suddenly being really scared i shielded the left side of my face with my hand as i cowered and whispered to my friend \"they know we're here\" repeatedly 3 or 4 times. i was too scared to look. then, suddenly, not afraid i sat up straight and declared f**k it, it's just an airplane. we agreed, and without even looking back up a single time, we left to the front of the cabin to gaze at the southern stars. after about 15 to 20 minutes, both really tired, saw the time at 12:15pm and both went to our places and went to sleep. several hours had passed, yet i only remember the first 20 and last 20 minutes. my friend has never spoken about it. i developer a boil type welt the following week 1 inch into hair on center of back of neck.","distance":"21-100
