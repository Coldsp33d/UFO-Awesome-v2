craft was there because it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. the two men then watched the object for approximately 8 to 10 seconds, as it flew from east to west towards the setting sun. as it went into the sunlight they lost sight of it.  the third man on the scene did not see the craft since he was not near them at the time.\r\n\r\nthe witness said that he thought the object was at least Â¼ mile wide and was flying at approximately 5,000 feet at least 200 mph. the object was a dark grey or black color and had no lights on it. it was a triangular shape and it flew with the point of the

in the afternoon, my mother in law received a call from a friend across town saying that something was flying over the town. we all went out into the back yard. a large black object was overhead. it was so low, seemed just over the tree tops and so large that all but the leading edge could be seen. the sides and far side were obscured by the trees and houses. there were no lights or sound. it was flying in a straight line very slowly. we knew it was not anything man made. this was the early 70s, nothing could stay airborne and move that slowly. i did not feel frightened, a little in awe but not enough to remain out there to watch it pass fully overhead. i had a baby at the time and may have had to go in and tend to him; i don't remember that part. but i do remember that my mother in law was calling everyone she knew to go out and look. the whole town had to have known about it. \r\ni don't think any reporting was involved. who would you call? no one seemed to make a big deal about it including myself. \r\nover the years, i never really thought about it until i sat the movie, independence day. the bottom surface of the mother ship was what i remembered seeing flying over

object. when i first sighted the object, i asked him if he could see it and he said that he could. we both watched the object for a few minutes, which would hover, then fly very quickly towards us and then away, then it would wobble from side to side. it then descended very quickly in the area between euclid and taft. i looked at the young man and said \"i don't know what that was.\" after a few more minutes, it ascended again and performed the same manuevers, and then once again descended to the same spot as before. i don't know if it actually landed or not, but i told the young man that i

it was a cloudless sky around 7:30 am, and i saw what looked like a star in the glow of the sun. that was obviously odd as no other stars were visible/would be visible at that time. i noticed it would glow occasionally, and i first thought it might be a blimp/plane reflecting the sun as it's so high up and there are no clouds. i lose sight of it but about 20 minutes down the road i see it again, this time with more glowing. the glow was a cooler color, almost white blue, not like what it would look like if the sun was reflecting off of it which would be of a warmer/orangey color. i continue to see it as i progress down route 2, east bound, on and off. this is also when i begin to noticed that it disappears randomly. i have seen this thing two days last week, and two days this past week, only during the daytime. my commute consists of when the sun is coming up and right when it's going down. as of november 24, i've noticed seeing it closer to where i live, as well as it disappearing and reappearing more frequently. november 23, i saw it for the first time on my commute home from work. heading northbound, always a cloudless sky. driving west through gardner, roughly 3:30pm it appears out of nowhere in the middle of the sky as a bright light, like a star, then dims, and then suddenly vanishes again. was probably about 5 seconds altogether. i only see them when i'm driving so i don't dare try and take any pictures. however i have seen planes and helicopters during these experiences and i can rule out what i'm seeing as being those. there are no contrails, and no visible recognizable shape.\r\n\r\ni've never seen anything like this and i've grown up in this area never seeing this before. white orbish light, about the size of a star that changes in intensity with whiteish/blueish glowing, dims, and is able to disappear/appear out of nothing. it's getting to the point i almost dread my commute now, because i know i'm most likely going to see these strange things again.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"     i was illegally burning garbage in the city of wausau with two other guys. one of the guys told me to look at the sky just over my house, so i did. i was shocked to see a huge black triangle silently floating just over my house. i stood frozen as it turned and slowly came at us. it dropped even lower as it descended on us. it blocked out the sky and i didn't even turn my head to see all three corners. i just stared at it's center and noticed the lights changing color and intensity, but didn't turn my head. i was frozen or seemingly caught in a time warp where nothing changed. the bugs didn't make sounds, the wind stopped, i couldn't even think...Just like time had stopped. after what seemed like only 20 seconds, the triangle turned and slowly drifted south of us and silently disappeared behind the fox55 television towers.\r\n    the two guys were friends of mine. however, after this happened, i never spoke to either friend ever again. ken walked away and went home, dave stumbled away and never heard from again. i couldn't walk right so i slowly locked the gate to the yard and went straight to bed. \r\n    the next morning i couldn't remember anything. i tried for hours, but no memory. i walked to the yard to look around. then i went home and still couldn't remember anything from the night before. i finally had a feeling of seeing something in the sky, so i really thought about it until i remember seeing a triangle. \r\n     within a week or so, all the veins in my left leg blew up and collapsed. they hung out of my leg like water balloons. the first two doctors wanted to remove my leg from the knee down. a third doctor in marshfield's st. joseph hospital removed the affected veins and i can still walk. \r\n    i still have never heard from my drummer dave or my neighbor ken. i have this feeling that something really bad happened to me that night, but i can't remember. i wish someone would hypnotize me to find out, but i don't know who will do this for me. \r\n    also, when i woke up the next morning, my girlfriend told me that i went to bed really late. i remember opening a beer at 10:00 at night and starting burning the roofing material. all the piles were still scattered around the yard, all the beer still in the case, and the fire pit was entirely out when the triangle floated away. usually my fire pit would take an hour or more to burn off enough that i could add more.\r\n    when i left, i remember thinking, \"they let me live\". \r\nif there is any way of finding out what happened to me for about a 2 hour loss of time, please let me know. i have had the feeling since that they are still taking me. i've had the strangest injuries in the last few years. things that wouldn't hurt someone, can cause me great injury. please help me get some answers.\r\nthank you:\r\nkevin boyles\r\n ","distance":"21-100
