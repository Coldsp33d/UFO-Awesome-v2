it would make me tired. the temperature was 27degrees, a bit chilly with a slight wind coming from the east. i stood behind my garden shed to block the breeze and then decided to play with my phone camera and photograph the moon, since it was so clear out. only a few high thin clouds. i propped my phone up on a post and took multiple photos. upon reviewing them i noticed a blue round light near the moon which appears to have moved from above the moon to the right hand side then it blurs out. all the photos were taken within seconds of each other. not sure what it was but neat

were shinning and disappearing when they turned. regardless i filmed for a bit, i could not figure out what kind of birds they were. at the end of the video, i look up because a bird flew right over my head. i only filmed for 1 minute. nothing seemed to happen.  later that night i went to show my mom the birds. curious as to what kind that were. so i watch the film, to my surprise i see no birds at all!!??!! for the entire minute you see no birds ?! not even the one that flew 15 feet over me head at the end of the clip. but if you look closely from 10-14 seconds you will see an orb appear on the right side of the screen above the tree.  then it makes some weird movements in front of the tree,  and shoots downward off the camera. also another orb is seen near the very end of the video, at

enormous size of the orb.  it was immediately obvious it was not the moon.\r\n\r\nit appeared 50 to 100 times the size of the normal moon size.  it was fiery orange in color and brilliant in contrast

would estimate the distance from earth to be fairly close as in possible flight levels around 35 to 40,000 feet.\r\n\r\ni can not stress enough how big it was and how quickly it really moved while appearing to be motionless.  i was in total awe.  i drove from in 231 to 1000 s as fast as possible and drove west on 1000 s until it disappeared over the horizon, approximately 4,5 miles a total

eastern time. i observed two bright white lights with no sound and cigar shaped moving east northeast with no sound. then i watched it move higher in elevation then just stop. i watched it for little over an hour. then i could see 4 to 5 other craft in a circle formation around the larger cigar shape craft. not the first time seeing these things but it was the first time that i saw the cigar shape craft so close. i think the reason i see so many ufo here is because of brookhaven labs and the tests that they do there. i can tell you that until you see it,you just might doubt it,but here over long island i see a lot of strange ufos.Even as i write this the cigar shape object is still out there. i don't have anyway of capturing these objects,well,because im poor.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

this one was a bit odd, as it was vertical - straight up and down with no visible object leading it. i do understand light refraction works and that often what we think we see is most times just our eyes playing tricks on us, but something about this  just seemed weird. i continued to glance at the vertical trail as i drove, and then noticed as i got closer to my destination that there was now an object that was moving horizontally across the sky, with the trail coming out behind it. i realized that it would pass me if i didn't park soon and get a picture, so i pulled over and zoomed in as much as my camera would allow. i took 4 rapid fire pictures with my iphone, and actually stopped taking pictures as it passed over me, and got back in my car because i got a very uneasy feeling. while i was taking the pictures, i was looking directly at the object (not through the phone) and i swear it was changing shapes as it moved across the sky. if i hadn't seen the trail, and the sun hadn't been setting, i don't know that i would have even seen the object, i feel like the sun's light was affecting its perceivable \"shape\". i got back in my car and proceeded down a driveway, got back out the car and (literally) 20 seconds later, it was gone. the trail was gone. there was no trace of it in the sky. what i saw looked like a small pink/red/orange orb that appeared to morph as it moved from a clam shape, to a cylinder to an oval. pictures included are labeled in the order they were taken.

the view was amazing, so i got out of the car to take a few shots of the early sunset over orange county. didn't notice this until later. but i have to say that a lot of strange things have been going on in our skies and otherwise since at least jan. 2015, which is when i started taking notice.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":72682,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.84848936378696,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11232015-0007","longitude":-118.094990682732,"occurred":1447863300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1448248071000,"summary":"Taking

to the south west, i noticed some strangely bright lights. i pointed them out to him by saying, \"see, look, i told you there have been weird things in the sky lately!\" i figured he would write off the objects but didnt,instead he told me to get some pictures for him because he didn't know what he was seeing. as i tried to get pictures he pulled off the road for me. i took a regular sun set photo and then turned the lighting down so there was no oranges or reds. they stayed still it seemed, but were far enough away it was hard to tell. we could tell based on the landscape whatever they were, they were big. we headed homemail and i tried to keep my eyes on them, they seemed to fade into the orange of the sunset, like, the coloring was so closely the same it was hard to see until i eventually lost them. \r\n\r\nwe were traveling south, off 626th ave, taking highway 30 west until county road 14, and could see them clearly from all angles for approximately 15 minutes.
