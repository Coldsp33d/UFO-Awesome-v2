have a rubber ball with a bell inside of it attached to my front door knob. my dog has been trained to ring the bell if he wants to go outside to go potty. friday night at about 11 pm, which is routine, my dog rang the bell to go outside.  as a side note, i am ex military and lived up at ki sawyer afb for many years in upper michigan. i know aircraft. years ago i used to watch satellites, staring up at them in the night sky. i loved it... \r\n i have lived in the appleton, wi area just outside of town for about five years now, i look for satellites every time the night sky is clear. i have not seen one since i moved here which i find very odd. point is, i'm looking up at the sky every night while i wait for my dog to do his business. two days ago, the bell rings, so i bundle up. the weather was cold, around 32 degrees outside. i hooked up my dog outside, hooked him to his rope and sucked deep breaths of the stunning cool evening air into my lungs. looking up i faced to the southwest and did what i usually do, which is to focus on a star and wait for my eyes to capture any other movement ( looking for satellites ) but never see anything accept an airplane or hillicopter around this area, never any stars... something did capture my eye this night. it was exactly like the scene in alien vs predator when the predator ship flew over the whaling camp cloaked!!!!!!!!!!  i watched it fly from the southwest for six seconds, moving rapidly across the sky to the southeast to be lost because of my tree tops. the object was silent. no sound at all. i was able to see through the object. it was a beautiful, clear, starry night... \r\nanother example to describe what i saw would be it looked like a cloaked klingon bird of prey.... i have never seen anything like this and can not stop thinking about it...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

moving south at a low rate of speed which was somewhat against the local prevailing winds which were coming very lightly from the south-southwest.  the object passed over the constellation canis major and after about 20 seconds i lost sight as it passed behind a large tree in my yard.  i picked it up again a few seconds later on the other side of the tree and started to observe through binoculars.  the object then made a leisurely turn to the west and faded from view as it became more distant.\r\n\r\nat first glance i thought it was a deflated translucent balloon or plastic bag debris.  as i observed further i noticed the object had an angular shape and was not rotating or changing shape as you would expect with paper/plastic debris in the wind.\r\n\r\nobservation through the binoculars confirmed it was the shape of a chevron or sharp boomerang and the object appeared to be a dark blue-gray very similar to the color of the sky.  it looked like there were 2 very dim and diffuse white lights on each \"wing\" or else these lights were bands of dim reflected light. \r\n \r\nit appeared to be quite large but did not fill the entire field of view in the binoculars.  i would estimate within 2000 feet of my location at an altitude of under 1000 feet but i cannot be certain of that estimate.  the object emitted no sound and appeared to be on a controlled flight

ballons given the speed they were traveling. the wind that night was variable at maybe 2-3 mph. this was nothing we have ever seen. after losing sight of the first orb to the wsw 2 more with a few hundred yards separation flew over in a similar flight path. through the course of the next 20-30 minutes we witnessed a total of 10 ufos flying all in the same general flight path with minimal deviations in altitude and range from our viewpoint. there was no sound emitting from any of the objects, no major course or speed changes and no pulsating of light or strobes seen. in the one picture you can clearly see the p8 on a 5 mile final inbound for landing with the object above it.

even with the person on the ground and the alien within the ufo miles above in the atmosphere. for about 30 minutes one afternoon, i stood out in the back yard of my residence and continually tried to project the thought that i believed that the aliens were there, but that i would like for them to make themselves viewable to me. after about 30 minutes with no noticeable results, i abandoned my efforts and went back inside. i wasn't aware of experiencing anything different or unusual for the next two days, so i went back to the same spot outside in the back yard and spent close to an hour trying to project similar thoughts as i had done two days before, thinking that i couldn't see anything in the sky, but would like for the aliens to make themselves visible to me. maybe it was a crazy thing to do, but several times, i let them know that i wasn't afraid and would like for them to visit me soon. i also told them that i had firearms nearby in my bedroom, but had no intentions of using them if they decided to visit. the hour passed, but nothing else really happened the rest of the afternoon. as a matter of fact, after all was over with, i came to the realization that i couldn't recall anything specific that i had done the whole afternoon, evening and night.....Nothing. it was as if i had a mental block of anything i did from the time i was walking back in from the back yard to about 2:30am the following morning, when i groggily realized that my back was only inches from a fully closed and locked front door. it was a strange \"awakening\" as i immediately realized i didn't slowly open my eyes such as i normally do when awakening in the mornings. it was just as if i merely became aware of my surroundings again and that i also seemed to be in mid step, walking away from the front door. in other words, it felt like i had just walked through the front door, became aware of my surroundings and was continuing to walk, not missing a step. i had no idea where i was when i fell asleep or lost consciousness. over the next 24-36 hours i racked my mind, trying (unsuccessfully) to piece together information that had led up to the point i was standing with my back to the front door. there was just nothing there. while i don't recall any events involving sighting a ufo, i honestly feel i underwent an abduction all the same. this was the only way i knew how to report it to someone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":72661,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.46058500614936,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11222015-0007","longitude":-77.37194414780106,"occurred":1440901800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

this silver triangle shaped craft with a dark (black) triangle in the middle, about a quarter or a third full size in the middle of it, just watched as it traversed from north to south in the matter of about a minute, maybe less.  it appeared to be very high up and compared to watching a jet pass in the sky, this object must have been moving extremely fast to cover the range of my view of the sky so quickly.\r\n\r\ni didn't want to interrupt while she was talking and once it'd passed, there wasn't much use in mentioning it to her i figured.  i don't recall what the conversation was about but, it didn't seem worthwhile to mention it to her and cause any interruption.\r\n\r\nthat's pretty much it.  i only recently mentioned it to a friend a few days ago who thought i ought to report it.\r\n\r\nfrom what i could see, it had none of the features that i keep seeing on hangar 1 or other programs i watch regularly on tv.  the silver color of it was not a shiny silver but what i'd describe as a matte finish.  it had no windows, doors or any other visible marking from my vantage point.\r\n\r\nother than seeing a triangle flying across the sky, there was just nothing of interest to it at all.  it didn't change path, speed or direction.\r\n\r\nyou can contact me if you have any questions.  sorry i waited so long to report this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

food and left barstow 25 minutes earlier. very desolate route, mostly transport truck use. was a transport about a mile ahead of me on same route. i had my glasses on which gives me 20/15 vision. i noticed directly ahead of me about 15 degrees above ground an object starting to glow slightly, and i just thought it was the moon as i knew the moon was just less than half that week. it was noticeably descending in the sky, and every second got brighter, until it was extremely bright white lights, triangle shaped with 2 distinct rows of lights on the underside around the edge of the craft.  the lights became continuous around the craft but not joined to each other. it was extremely dark outside, and i could only see what was around me for a couple of hundred feet at that time. as this craft descended slightly to the south it began to light up the terrain, and then i noticed 4 mountain peaks lighting up, as it descended down on them, and then continued descending, and went directly behind the tallest peak of the 4. the peak began splitting the lights of the craft in the center, and the air all around began glowing from behind the mountain.  it continued to descend until its' lights were no longer visible, however, the 4 peaks were still visible with the air lit up behind them. within about another 15 seconds, there was no light at all and the view of the peaks also dissappeared, and everything went black again. the whole event lasted only about a minute, and there was no time to use my video camera to document it. i have no idea whether the us gov't has this technology, and using it, but as far as i am concerned, this is and was a ufo sighting, and i feel extremely privileged to have witnessed this event, as it was so clearly visible even from 7 or 8 miles away. this unit obviously was travelling in the sky completely not visible until it descended and began lighting up. the size was no less than 300-400 feet from the front to the rear of the craft, with the one point extending further out than the other 2 and to the south, so i assume this was the front of the craft. also 3 protruding domes underneath the craft were visible slightly, one in each corner of the craft, and lit up by the two rows oflights around the underside of the craft.Everything else about the craft was black as it appeared to me.","distance":"Over One

ga. as we were walking we could neighboring dogs barking loudly and my dog standing at attention looking into the woodline. as we walked to a certain point in the yard facing west you could see an orange/yellow light, seaming to stay in place, through the trees. my boyfriend and i have taken hikes behind the house and know for a fact that there is nothing that could produce light in that direction, there isn't anything back there for several miles. my dog started to freak out so we went inside and as we came inside and proceeded to lay in bed we heard coyotes howling louder and closer than usual, we opened the blinds in the bedroom and turned out the lights, we noticed that the original light was still in the approximate position as before but it was now fading in and out and would move from left to right. a few minutes later we noticed this v shaped flying craft with lights on and underneath, flying above the house, my boyfriend being ex military concluded that it was a stealth bomber, which after looking at night time photos i agree. after the stealth bomber flew over we noticed another light above and to the left of the original light seen. both lights moving from side to side and up and down slowly. these light were about two miles from the back of the house. the objects didn't make any noise, if they were helicopters we would have heard them from the distance the lights were located. note that no lights are ever seen from behind the house because there are no residences or structures for several miles, and it's a little too cold to be camping, and no legal to camp and on someone else's property. a few minutes later another light appears to the right and below the original. we tried to find some form of logic such as helicopters but the lighting, and hovering patter and fading in and out just didn't seem consistent. at around 12:07am the lights got brighter and seemed to be coming closer but instead followed each other to the north west and disappeared. at the time of them disappearing all animal noises seemed to stop. we aren't sure what we saw but we can not make any since of it at all. and we are confused as to why a stealth bomber would be in the area.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional
