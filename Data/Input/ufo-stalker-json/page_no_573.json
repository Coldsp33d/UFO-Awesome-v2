States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Some time in 1995 my girlfriend and i got into my car, which was parked in front of my parents house. the car was facing south, and there was a clear view of the sky facing the direction. there are trees that line the east and west sides of the street, but the view is unobstructed to the south. it was very dark on the street with no street lights present. my girlfriend turned on the interior light to pull a cd out of the case, and as i was waiting i noticed a bright light coming over the trees at the end of the road, which were a little less than a quarter mile to the south. as i was watching the light, it changed from moving in a straight path to a zig zag. it wasn't moving very fast and i thought it was a helicopter. what first really piqued my interest was the abruptness that the object made each change of direction as it zig sagged. it didn't make a sort of circular arc as you'd expect a helicopter to make as it changed direction, they were very sudden movements from ne to nw and back again. at this point i told my girlfriend to look at the object. she agreed that it was unusual. when the object was about 45 to 50 in viewing angle to the south, it stopped all movement. i couldn't see any shape or even determine how high or far away it was, just that the light it was giving off was much brighter than any of the stars or planets viewable that night. the object remained stationary for about one minute, and then began moving at the same speed as before. it travelled 20 degrees to the wnw and stopped again. it remained stationary for about 20 seconds and took off from that position at a speed that literally took my breath away. it covered about 50 degrees of sky in about 1 second and my view was obstructed by trees and my parent's house.\r\nthere were two navy bases within 15 miles of my parent's house, and i grew up seeing military aircraft on a daily basis.  nothing i have every seen moved with the speed that this object did at the end of my observation. the object appeared to be at a fairly high elevation for the duration that i viewed it, but even if it were 1000 ft high, the speed that it moved at the end would have been incredible. the point being that words really don't properly convey how absolutely amazing watching this object move across the sky was.\r\n  i should also say that i am a staunch skeptic of all things paranormal,  and if i hadn't seen this myself i'm not sure that i would've believed someone if they described this event with no real corroborating evidence besides a second witness, but i know what i saw and it changed me in some way. i don't think that the technology to make a craft, or whatever it was, accelerate from a stop to those speeds will be available in our lifetime. but suspending disbelief and assuming it was possible, i know without a doubt that a human being inside of it would have no chance whatsoever of surviving that type of acceleration.\r\n  thank you for taking the time to evaluate this experience that i had. also, i didn't include my girlfriend's reactions to this event because i didn't want to speak for her, but suffice it to say she was as astonished by what we witnessed as much as i was. \r\n\r\nthank you again,\r\nscott brandle

at the picture and noticed something bright blue. \r\nit was hardly noticeable but it caught my eye and took a closer look.   \r\ni zoomed in on it and i can clearly see a cluster of bluish green lights. i immediately text my son about what i saw. he replied, saying that he noticed it but thought it was coming from his phone screen. \r\ni forwarded the image to my ipad, to view the image on a larger screen. it definitely has a bell shaped, or triangular/pyramid shape. the image can be enhanced with a filter, black and white is striking. i took more pics of the sky right away but the object had disappeared. i have many pics on my phone, i have never had any unusual spots or flares on any saved images prior or after this day.\r\n i do want to note that i did not see it with my own two

my right side of my truck to in front of me moving slow motion. a few cars in front of me at a short distance and no one behind me. i should have pulled over & took a picture with my cell phone! \r\n\r\nthe last time in my life i saw something of the magnitude & shape was a stealth craft in s.A. during desert storm!\r\n\r\nwhat caught my attention with alarm was it was quite unusual to see so many lights outlining the wing structure- maybe like a boomerang shape with a solid center because that's the area i saw a red pulse-like flashing light-similar to what you'd see on our airplanes. the white lights were bright not dull.\r\n\r\nthat morning before i left my house already felt quiet, a bit strange, unsettling so to speak.\r\n\r\nthe 1st thing i thought to myself was \"what the hell is that!\" i was waiting for a beam of light to appear then i would have panicked. at a glance i thought it was an airplane flying low towards bwi but our planes don't have wings lined with white lights. our planes have lights on wing-tips. i did see a red pulsed light underbelly as one would see on an aircraft but again, our planes have a few not just one.\r\n\r\nthe weather was drizzling lightly but visibility was clear, no fog ~a craft flying that low would be loud and produce noise-sound waves, i heard none. no other objects or crafts seen. i see air traffic- normal planes all the time. this was certainly different.\r\n\r\nlast night my oldest daughter, kimberly robeson said she too witnessed a similar situation the night before and too, filed this info with mufon.\r\n\r\nthe question i have is who does one call in a situation  like this? abnormal craft that look of an unknown origin? it's frightening! what do you do?\r\n\r\ni have always been level-headed, well ground, alert and oriented healthcare professional. weird stuff doesn't come to me that often. but this left me a bit shaken inside. i am a believer too, that we are not alone in this universe. we are fools to believe

corona, ca. it was very clear out that night so before going inside i decided to scan the skies for any activity. this was something i've been in the habit of doing many times a week since november of 2011 when i had my first ufo sighting. i've had quite a few over the past 4 years. never the same object, different hours of the day and both day and night, all of them from the driveway of my home. i'm convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this area, for whatever reason, is a ufo hotspot.\r\n standing in my driveway facing north i was looking up and slightly east in the area surrounding the cassiopeia constellation. there always seems to be activity in that general area. but even knowing this i wasn't expecting what came next.\r\n  from the east came a v formation of light green, sort of flourecent, lights. one leading, with two on the south side, and three on the north. the last of the three on the north side was slightly trailing the others throwing the formation off a bit. they were flying at a moderately fast pace from east to west and i was able to get a good look at them for probably four seconds. being that they weren't brightly lit i lost them in the darkness as opposed to them flying behind an obstruction. there was also a moment where my brain was trying to convince me that what i was seeing was a flock of birds. this thought kicked in as soon as i percieved no sound from the group as they passed overhead. but i dismissed that notion quickly as i recalled the rounded off arrowhead shape of the matching crafts and the distance that they covered in the four seconds. i figured it was probably close to two miles which converts to approximately 1800 mph. unfortunately, i had no reference to help me determine their correct altitude. but the v formation was probably slightly smaller than my palm when i extend my arm. i do believe they were flying in our atmosphere, rather than distant space.\r\n i immediately noted the time of the sighting. i stayed outside for a few more minutes before going inside and checking the internet for similar sightings. but as of right now, 5 days later, no matches. i'm hoping that someone who may have experienced these same crafts will feel more inclined to share their experience if they see someone has posted before them. many times, fear of ridicule is an unfortunate by-product of these types of experiences. post your experience, everyone. it's important that you do so.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

we're moving in an indistinct pattern changing shape while remaining clustered. halfway through the observable flight path the entire formation  changed direction very distinctly at almost a 35 degree

be round, or spherical, in shape. it didn't really have a shape, but was merely a ball of bright orange light with no distinct shape, somewhat like looking at a flare. it seemed to be brighter in the center, more whitish. there was no noise and the motion was in a straight line - approximately north to south. because the speed seemed similar to an airplane on approach to an airport, i thought maybe it was a plane with an engine fire, but, again, no noise. not knowing what it was or how big it was, it would be difficult to estimate its altitude, but it did not seem to be very high. i eventually lost sight of it as some houses blocked my view. the entire observation lasted for approximately two minutes, or so.\r\n\r\nhaving followed ufo reports for many years, this object was
