(note: there were no faa mandated strobes or red/green wing tip running lights) glancing around i notice there were cars that were also slowing down or had pulled over. i restarted the monza, and basically got out of there. my girlfriend, who incidently was lying down in the backseat suffering from the flu amoung other things and the eterenal skeptic thought it was a helicopter but her brother, who always thought flying saucers nothing but bunk, immediatly became a true believer. \r\n\r\nbut, this is not the end of the story. \r\n\r\nseveral day later i stopped in at a local gas station and the owner, a former korean war marine vet came out. the owner of the station, at the time,had  usually let me pump my own gas. by the way. after a couple minutes of awkward silence, he started out by saying \"jim, your an engineer and a stargazer.\" (i am an amature astronomer)\"i saw something other other night i can't explain. to make a long story short. he also was on i-180 that night with his wife, daughter and son-in-law. i didn't ask any leading questions all i said was, \"you saw the ship.\" he answered yes. he too was one of those who thought prople who claimed to see ufos were crack pots. he also was positivley certain that it wasn't and airplane or helicopter. he said he saw plently of choppers in korea to know the difference and was one of the cars which pulled over to watch it, remarking that there was no noise. \r\n\r\ni know this is report happed nearly 40 years ago but i almost feel an obligation to report it and get it off my chest. i was 23 at the time

fast.Strange to see a plane going that slow. as i got closer to mechanicsville (between westminster & sykesville) i noticed that the two would hover and go up a bit and switched sides of the road. as i traveled it almost seemed as though the one on my left was the same rate of speed as i, 30 mph. i was behind a line of cars & i know they saw the same activity as i. we were all looking. the one on the left seemed to stop in mid air, go backwards about 10 feet then move far left and came back again to follow traffic then sped up a bit towards baltimore. there was no sound from them what so ever. now, i also noticed in the far distance there were two helicopters and possibly a third but i was more interested in the one closest to me. im no aviation expert but i have never seen any type of aircraft do what these two did. they were at least as big as a football field. boomerang in shape on the outside and triangular in the middle. by the time i got home. i just saw helicopters patrolling the areas i described above. its better to explain in person but if you have questions feel free to call. but this is not my only experience seeing ufos.

i’ve looked to the sky hoping to see something that would affirm my belief that there was life other than here on earth.\r\nall my life, i’ve been looking for fast and erratic moving lights.  last thanksgiving week, i observed something that was all the contrary.\r\nbehind my home, i have a man-cave where i spend much of my time in that my wife and i have totally different tastes in tv programming.  this particular evening which i think was the weekend after thanksgiving, 2012, i exited my man-cave, locked it, and turned for the house.  as i cleared the overhang of the covered patio and stepped onto the pavement around the pool, i looked up slightly to my right, and there it was as vivid as anything i’d ever seen in my life.  it’s like my eyes went straight to it.  \r\nmy house is due west of my man-cave, and on this evening, the moon was about ¾ full and hadn’t been up very long, and the air was very crisp, clear and cool.  the sky (for south louisiana) was unusually crystal clear.   the sight of the craft stopped me dead in my tracks.  it was as clear and vivid as anything these cat-surgery eyes had ever seen. \r\nat about a 30 degree angle from horizon and about the same degrees north of west, there was a v-shaped craft.  not knowing the size, if i had held a ruler up to the sky, it would have measured probably about an inch long, so i’m guessing it was pretty far up there.  if i were to guess, i would say it was about 2 miles horizontally and i’m guessing 1 mile vertically from my vantage point, or positioned somewhere between carencro and cankton, la., just nw of lafayette, la.  \r\nthe craft was facing due north with a bright star (or planet) just off its nose…. i’m thinking kind of bottom right.   as i said, i’ve been looking for fast moving bright objects all these years, but this craft was not moving at all.  it was dead stopped!!  i could tell this by its relativity to that bright star.  it was just sitting there!!  and the other thing that caught my eyes was the fact that there were no lights – none.  i know i would have seen any strobes from my vantage point because i see them all the time in that my home is directly under a major east/west flyway, and i can see the strobe lights on commercial jets 5 miles up.  additionally, there was no noise, and once again, i can hear those jets 5 miles up on a clear night.\r\n  \r\nas i said, the craft was v-shaped (about 60 degrees) and very majestic looking.  the outside v and inside v looked to be parallel to one another, and the tail of each wing was somewhat tapered inward.  the end of the tails also appeared to be flat.  the bottom of the left wing was black and the right wing (toward me) appeared soft matted texture gray texture.  the one toward me (left wing) was probably reflecting the moonlight.  this also makes me think the wings were slanted upward slightly (about 5-10 degrees) and that the belly was not round because of the distinct separation of the two colors.  it was a very sharp line from the point of the craft the inside of the v.  all i could see was the bottom of the wings, but the craft appeared to be level, and i could see no openings or contour marks.  also, i didn’t see anything that would have suggested an engine or engines, and i really don’t know of anything that large that can hover in one place that long and do so without making a bunch of noise.\r\n\r\nat no time was i startled, and i really don’t know why.  i knew at the time i was looking at something that i had never seen before anywhere, not even on tv.  i watched it for a good 3 to 4 minutes, and at no time did it deviate from its relativity to that bright star.  it was almost boring.  \r\nas i said earlier, it was cool outside, and i had short sleeves on, so i thought i’d go in the house, get a jacket and wake up the wife to come look at it with me.  my wife locks the back door, even with me in the back and with a pair of dobermans at her bedside.  so, i reached in my pocket for my keys, looked down momentarily to pick out the house key (the moon was really bright), and when i looked back up, it was gone!!  i quickly looked all around the sky, and nothing.  i don’t know if it just disappeared or took off like a bat out of hell.   it’s almost like it knew i was watching it waiting its chance to do whatever it did.  i’m still kicking myself in the ass knowing that i’ll probably never know!!\r\n \r\ntrying to take a picture with the cell phone for whatever reason never crossed my mind.  after all those years of wanting to see something, for whatever reason, when it did happen, it seemed almost non-eventful.  but, i did tell the wife about it when i crawled into bed.\r\n\r\ni really wanted to share this with someone who can relate.  i tried sending this to george noory several years back, but heard nothing.  \r\n\r\nthis is the absolute truth, and i would have no problem taking a lie detector test on this.  i would be very interested in knowing if the lafayette, la. airport may have caught something on radar around this time that seemed strange, but it's probably too long ago.  the craft would have been somewhat northwest of the airport about 6-10 miles, it would have been dead stopped for a while, and as i said, it would have either simply disappeared on the screen or took off very quickly.  i don’t think there’s anything in or out of that airport that late at night (around midnight), so i don’t even know if anyone would be in the airport tower or observing the radar, but they may have it in some radar memory banks.  it may be worth researching.  i’m thinking the friday or saturday night after thanksgiving, 2012, but definitely sometime that week between the hours of 10 pm and 1:00 am.\r\n","distance":"Over One

rainbow so we decided to pull over, into the empty mercantile bank parking lot to take photos and get a good look at it.  with my iphone's camera, i took 2 photos of my daughter and the rainbow behind her.  i then took 2 more photos of the rainbow, trying to get a good shot of the different colors because they were so vibrant. after 2 photos, i looked up to see what my daughter was doing and if i had the best spot of the rainbow to get a picture and then noticed what looked like a diamond shape of 4 very bright flickering white/goldish/redish lights moving first from east to west (toward us) then the lights banked quickly to the south and continued banking all the way back to the east, at a lower altitude.  as their initial turn to the south, the lights started shifting and it was then very evident that this was 4 separate lights which were now flying in a straight line with 3 in a row and 1 a little off-set like ( * * *    * ).  as the lights flew away from us, the outside one broke away and took off to the south, southeast at a very high rate of speed while the others continued east at an increased rate of speed.  the whole time the lights were brilliantly bright, just unreal bright from all angles that we saw them from and continued to flash in a random manner, not together and with no noticeable pattern.  the flashing of the lights was really fast between the different colors and the only reason i am able to describe 3 different colors is that i could make out white and orange, my daughter saw goldish yellow and my wife saw reddish orange. we finally lost sight of the objects as they flew behind the tree line.  we were super excited upon seeing this because you hear stories and read things but never get to actually see it.  every photo i tried to get, once i noticed them turned out like garbage and they didn't even show up; however, the 2 photos that i took before i noticed the lights did capture the objects (they look small and far away because of the crappy phone camera, like when trying to take a picture of the moon and then that looks tiny on camera).  the photos that i have show the lights when they were in their initial diamond shaped flight pattern.  i'm attaching the photos and i haven't monkeyed with them, didn't even want to circle them or rotate the picture because i don't want anybody saying they're faked.  the pictures show the lights on the inside of the rainbow and the lights are bright white but small.  still really excited about the whole thing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

and thousand oaks blvd called the tipsy goat. i arrived and was there for about an hour and a half before my friend decided not to show up. i had then made plans to meet a friend across town the opposite direction to play pool at a local dive bar called pjs pub. i finally left the tipsy goat at approximately 9:00pm. i drove onto moorpark rd to head my way to the pjs pub on the way there i needed to get gas for my car ,which is old and the gages don't work so i need to estimate my gas when to fill up.I knew it was about time to, but planned on getting gas after the pjs pub. on my way down moorpark rd i had my radio on listening to 95.5 klos radio station. all of a sudden my radio shuts off completely. it didn't phase me because then i thought my car was going to die which was unfortunate, but it happens sometimes when i'm short on gas, but surprisingly my car was still on and functioning which was unusual. at this time i noticed my oil gage was moving quickly and this threw me off because they don't work as far as my gages go for my car. i then decided to pull over to a convenient gas station off moorpark rd and janss rd to put in gas. afterwards i carried onto moorpark rd to head to the pub. i was then coming up to the thousand oaks high school which has a football field and bright lights. i always notice these lights because they are bright and right off the main road moorpark. as i was driving up passing the high school the lights were on, but then i noticed a new set of lights bright\". i took a double take because these lights were in the sky and there were about 15 objects hovering over between city of moorpark and thousand oaks. i then pulled my car in between the thousand oaks high school and recreation center. with my keys still in the ignition i jumped out of my car and ran onto the grass of the park next to the recreation center to take a good look at what i was witnessing. these lights were very large and they were in a formation of a triangle with two more objects on two of the sides of this formation. it was unbelievable, i looked around for other witnesses, but no one but me. dogs were barking and going crazy around the neighbor hood. i was so freaked i called my father and told him to come quick and witness what i was seeing he then was on his way with my uncle from out of town. mind you when i had called my dad i told him i was completely sober and hadn't had any drinks. he knew i was telling the truth by the way i spoke because i was freaking out. as he was on his way i noticed a plane flying closer to the formation of objects in the sky. this plane was moving more faster then a normal plane, i can only assume this was a jet. as it got close enough each of the 15 objects starting to dim off their lights and there were the only two objects remaining that were on the sides of this formation, these two objects starting moving towards the city of moorpark. when my father arrived i explained what i just witnessed and we decided to drive toward the direction the 2 objects were moving to. at this time he nor my uncle were able to witness the remaining objects, which is why we drove towards the direction they moved toward. we then were passed the intersection of moorpark rd and olsen rd and pulled over into a neighbor hood to see if we can see anything in the sky, but they were gone. after our talk my father and uncle headed back home. but then i noticed something else in the sky something completely different, this object was a lot lower in elevation and was red and not stable. my dad called me and noticed the same object on his way back home, it looked like it had a flame in it and was wavy\" it ascended higher into the atmosphere or which then looked like it burnt out\". my dad understood that this was completely different from the objects i had witnessed, which were higher in elevation and extremely larger in size plus the brightness of light coming off each object. he then just went home and i stayed to do some more investigating. i then noticed another object ascending into the sky very low in elevation same as what my dad and i had witnessed red and flame inside which was odd. as i drove around the neighbor hoods close to these events i came across these 2 bags on the street . i pulled over and picked one up and it was a bag people would use to light a candle or torch to float this into the sky for events or celebrations. i was very confused, and disturbed because the first objects i had seen were huge and high as a plane in elevation and were stable in a perfect formation and had total control of them selves. today i have this  bag of proof of somebody trying to throw witnesses off from the real things out there. from this day forward i know what i

just above the crest of my roofline. i parked the car, and rushed to get out. once out of the car i looked to see if they had moved, but they were still there. it was then that it finally registered in my mind to note the characteristics of them. they were 3 white lights in a triangle formation that were slowly pulsing on and off. each one was about the size of an 1/8\" ball berring held at arms length and the whole formation was about the size of a 3/8\" berring at arms length. i was very excited to see it, but still had the frame of mind to pull my phone out and try to record video of the object. when i started recording i noticed that the lights were not appearing on my screen at all, and then they started moving towards the south west. i kept recording anyway until the object disappeared behind my roof line. my house faces directly north, and the lights started about 1/4\" above the roof line. there was a nearby star that i used as reference to tell that they started out non moving, but it started moving when i started recording. after they had gone behind the roof and i stopped recording i noticed that i had no recording saved on my phone. i managed to successfully do a test record of the ground afterword. i then called my best friend and told him what i had seen. when i first saw it i figured it was a plane, however i soon realized it wasn't moving and the lights weren't blinking like a planes do. not to mention that most planes have multicolored lights, but these were all white, and they all pulsed in unison. given the evidence my only conclusion is that they are not any known craft or object.
