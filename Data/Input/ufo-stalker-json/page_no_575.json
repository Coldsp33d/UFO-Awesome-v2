observed two white landing lights on what i first thought was a large jet plane. i first thought it was flying away from me as i was driving north but its size did not diminish after driving about ½ mile. i thought if it was a large jet plane it was moving far too slowly. i was travelling at 45 mph so it should have been traveling much faster.Then i realized it was actually coming towards me not flying away. all i could see at this point were its two bright white lights and pulsating white “tail light” intermittently obscured by tall trees. at this point i pulled the car over and stopped while looking at it. i estimate its altitude at 500 to 1000 feet with a span of 100 to 200+ feet. as i sat pulled over, it slowly and noiselessly flew above me and continued south along rt. 47. as it passed i stepped on the gas and took off north. when i reached the intersection of rt 47 and turnpike rd. in just a few seconds, i looked back and saw it continuing south above rt 47 at the same slow pace. from the rear angle i could not see the two landing lights but only the white pulsating “tail light” at the rear. note: there was no vertical tail. from this angle the object looked like a giant diamond shaped kite deep black with its outlines glowing or shimmering. it's possible it was a b-2 spirit stealth bomber, although it made no noise and did not display the typical red and green running lights most plane use while flying at night. i am very familiar with all kinds of aircraft and i am not sure what this was.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a couple weeks ago. when i transferred my camera pictures to my computer yesterday i was surprised to see what i had forgotten about.. here's what happened.. it was about 4 hours after my mom had died and i couldn't sleep.. so i went into my dining area and stared out my patio door into the dark moonless nite. after about a half hour i noticed what looked like blue lines in space going south at a slow pace. i know they were going south as the stars behind them were going from east to west because of the earth's rotation. curious about what i was looking at i grabbed my binoculars and a camera. i took one picture in the general direction not really being able to see the blue lines on my camera view finder. i started looking thru my binoculars and was surprised to see the two brightest blue orbs were connected with a blue haze in between making it look like a line in space with the naked eye. i have no way to judge how large what appeared to look like a tube was, but it was far out in space and had to be huge. i captured that image on my camera as well as the other blue orb that was far to the left looking like a bell shaped object and going in the same southernly direction, on my pictures most everything looks black except the blue orbs. when the pictures are enlarged with the slide in the lower right corner, everything comes into focus as i have described, with pulling the images to the center of the picture even the stars behind start to show and without a heavy pixilation, the clarity is there. i have one other picture that i thought was weird that these orbs went towards and into. i kept watching thru my binoculars as the blue orbs went farther south towards what looked like a real faint almost round cluster of stars. the blue orbs didn't slow as they got close but seemed to go into the star cluster with the bright blue orbs disappearing as soon as the last one was in. they didn't appear to come out the other side if they were just passing thru. i snapped a picture of this really faint round star like cluster right after the orbs disappeared. i have this picture too although you have to really look to see the round cluster in the blackness of the lower part of picture when it is enlarged. with all theory i have heard about over the years about time travel and worm holes, i can not help but to believe that was what i saw happen with those blue orbs going into a worm hole. the first picture i took in the general direction without looking thru my binoculars captured a strange image in space that when enlarged becomes heavily pixilated earlier while looking strangle like the side profile of the space shuttle. i am baffled by that image. i can't believe i forgot about what i saw so quickly after i opened my pictures up yesterday and enlarged the blackness to see what i saw then. i guess i was just exhausted with being with my mom the last 10 days before she passed. i tried loading the pictures on twice  for scrutinization but couldn't do just the specific pictures only--it wants to take all my files and i won't do that. i can e-mail these photos to anyone with a direct email address who would like to see them. you have my email address.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

had an encounter. a newly built shed would be unused for a couple of weeks , so i was given the privilege of moving my drums into the place and i could stay there. it was way back even further than the barn.\r\n  one evening , i left my folks house , walked passed the barn , and got to my shed.\r\n  the smell of the new wood , as i entered the shed was amazing . and there was my wonderful drum set glistening in the moonlight , which shown through the big side door. \r\n  i lit a candle and tapped around a bit. i found it funny to tap the snare to the same beat that the hogs do when they throw down the lids of there feeders. tap ..Tap......Tap..Tap.\r\n  i finally got tired so i climed onto the old army cot and the two quilts and dozed off. \r\n  about the time i was almost totally asleep a shock hit the back of my ear. i turned over to find out what the heck , and there as i rubbed my eyes trying to focus on things in the dim moonlight , was a strange figure. it startled me at first and i blinked more to try and focus. it was still there. almost see through grey. black eyes , thin body , big head , thin mouth , tiny nose , it may have had some cape on , couldn`t focus well enough to tell. it`s shoulders and cheek bones seemed to stick out more. i focused on its eyes , and they were still there. this was very scary , but i felt it was a being also , so i didn`t freak out or look away , and so staring at each other for a moment i was curious and so i laid my arm out towards it in a friendly gesture. about that same speed it glided back. a floating motion. staring still at each other and me being tired and nothing happening , and still being pretty freaked out , i decided to roll over , forget about it , and go back to sleep.\r\n  so that`s what i did , and when i woke up , one of the pigs had slashes on its side. perhaps the alien was taking refuge in my shed because there was a cougar around. \r\n  some people didn't know if they believed me , because i had just seen e.T. the extra terrestrial. that`s understandable , but i reassured them that this wasn`t e.T. , and actually was differant in many ways. \r\n  i am glad this happened to me. it has always

stars were unusually bright.  as i was looking up at the sky, i noticed and extremely bright star.  it first appeared to be round with beams of light emitted from it in bright white (as one would envision the christmas star).  it was the only star that bright, all the others were \"normal\". \r\n     after almost half a minute of keeping an eye on just that \"star\", i noticed that the rays it produced were only forming on the top half of the orb.  looking closer, i noticed that it was not just white with a hint of blue.  two different shades of blue were present with flashes of red and green. when a flash ended, the space it had been in was more amber than yellow or white.  \r\n    i thought, even at this point, my eyes were playing tricks on me. so, i waited and thought i saw it move up then down.  the dog started pulling on his leash, so i went inside.  \r\n     about 10 minuets later, i decided that i wanted to take another look and headed back outside.  it was sill there, and the color activity was more intense.  the shape was more disc like, but i could not see the actual bottom.  it looked like the light illuminated the outline of the top of the disc, with the light being emitted from the top.  now when the colors appeared, they ran from left to right along the rim of the disc, and came one after the other.  one color would get just past the middle of the object and another would begin it's trip around.  \r\n     again, i thought i noticed movement, so i purposely stepped into an area where there were low tree branches.  since there was no wind, i could use this vantage point as a marker to see if there really was movement.  \r\n    the object swayed left to right, like it was in a hammock.  then it traveled up from below a branch to well above it, then back down, not going fast and never going back to the exact same space.  i knew this was not me moving as i had sat down in a chair to be sure to be steady and not rock or sway as i stood looking up.  \r\n     i stood watching it become more mobile for 5 minuets more then headed inside for 5 minuets.  when i went back outside to check on it again, it was further south than it had been. very little light activity was happening at this point, and the swaying had stopped.  i immediately came in to report this.\r\n    something very similar happened south of us two months ago and my husband saw it with me.  i believe it is the same object.

we were driving a chevy tahoe at approximately 45 mph behind a school bus which was 1/4 a mile ahead with driving lights on. it was very dark, so we were driving with our high beams on. the area we were traveling through is known to have many deer crossing the road so we were alert, but talking to one another as we traveled through the area. i was in the driver's seat and my sister was seated in the passenger seat. my son was seated on the rear, center seat in his carseat. we had the local radio playing at a low volume. suddenly my sister stopped talking my sentence. i noticed her sudden silence and just at that moment i saw a yellow-orange light approximately the size of a basketball retreating down the hill away from us down the center of the road. i immediately said, \"did you see that?\" she gasped and yelled,  \"yes!!\" my immediate response was to ask her if she saw a light. she told me she had. she was scared. shaken up. i asked her where it came from. she told me it had come out of the woods toward the car, then abruptly turned left and then went out of sight. that had been when i saw it in the rear view mirror. \r\n\r\nwe continued on the way home, talking about it the whole way. we speculated on whether it was the headlight of an atv, but ruled that out. my sister said it wasn't attached to anything,  and also pointed out that the atv s tend to have reflective lights and tailights, of which we had not seen any. it had maintained it's round sphere shape throughout.  of it had been an atv it would have cast a light. this did not. it maintained a steady shape and dull, orangish light. it had a slight yellow aura, almost like a streetlight casting light in the distance. 5hat had been my initial thinking when i had seen it in my rear view mirror. it was larger and much lower than a streetlight, however, which is what prompted me to ask my sister whether she had seen it. \r\n\r\nit never made a noise that we could hear. the radio continued to play, so if it had made a noise we never heard it.\r\n\r\nmy sister was scared. i never felt fear, or anxiety or anything. i had tried to figure out what it was, to logic it. i am not sure what it could have been. it didn't seem natural in origin. it wasn't particularly bright, however. it seemed to be as bright as a candle or an old, bulb style flashlight. we couldn't see any details on it. when it came out of the woods it was nearly parallel with the passenger side window and seemed to continue to keep that altitude as it receded down the mountain. the location we witnessed it at was heading uphill, nearly to owl's head, right before we made it to the top of the hill. \r\n\r\nthank you for letting me report this, and thank you for all that you and your organization do.

like i usually do. just listening to music and just star gazing.\r\n2. i dont know how and i still don't know how to explain but it was as if i distinguished it from all the stars; it was bigger and brighter and sure enough a stared at it long enough and it started to show intelligent movement.\r\n3. at first i thought it could've been my imagination, or a satellite, or even a shooting star but no it wasn't any of those; and it couldn't be a plane and helicopters because those were passing along at the same time this was occurring. the anomaly was way too high, it looked like a star.\r\n4. okay i saw 4 orb like, star-like anamolies that reacted to my awareness of them! i know it sounds crazy and outlandish but i know what i saw. i also saw one of them eject a camouflaged boomerang looking thing, and also saw 3 different shooting white spheres with a bluish after glow when the shot downward and faded out! however the 4 starlike spheres, all four of them i kept track and didn't lose them and each of them stayed. they weren't scared they trusted me or something because none of them left not even when i got home to look once more. i concentrated on one of them and sure enough when they realized i was looking at them they showed movement and sometimes eratic movement.\r\n5. i felt like crying and was scared and happy and awestricken; i couldn't believe this was actually happening to me. i tested my hypothesis of this sort of telepathic communication several times within the whole 1 of this event. it worked every single time.\r\n6. i didn't lose sight of any of them!!! it's insane. they didn't leave. they stayed in their \"frozen star like\" parking until i got home until i looked up again. sure enough they moved. but only the 4 white orbs, the other things i saw like i said just either faded out or disappeared.\r\n\r\n-i know this sounds crazy, but please you'll be the only ones to believe me even slightly-","distance":"Over One
