what i saw. i have already submitted something in 2014 about the same ufo but never pursued the case. after seeing it once or twice a week i've finally decided to do something about it. it always comes from the same place (north, from the lake, towards somewhere south) tonight i just saw it while driving. here is my last account that may give more insight from may 2 2014 \r\n\"we were driving down bullheadly road (this is in tallahassee florida) at about 9 pm when i saw two bright lights, brighter and different from any airplane lights i've seen. i told the driver of the car to keep going and not turn so we can see what it was. as we got closer and closer (we are on a road heading right for a lake called lake iamonia) we noticed that it was not moving, seemingly hovering. we went right to the lake from and parked with our lights on. it was hovering at the center of the lake. i am not sure how big it exactly was, but it wasn't small, and it was hovering about 200 feet up. it had two main bright lights on its wings and a smaller white light on the front. we watched it for about 5 minutes, just sitting there hovering. i decided to take a picture of it to show people, but i forgot to turn off the flash. right after i flashed the camera (the photo is not that good) it started coming toward us. we were still interested, so we rolled down the window to get a look. the sound was a quiet drone, almost like an airplane that is very, very high up in the sky ( just a reminder again, it wasn't high in the sky at all). it wasn't going fast to start out with, but when it went over us and we turned around to follow it, it spend up gradually to a speed we could not even match with our car. we also noticed as it was over us that there definitely was two wings, on the side of it there was small red lights, and it was a sharp triangle. that was the last we saw of it, going out into the distance.\"\r\nthis and the rest of my accounts have been nearly identical, it is very clearly not a plane. it is too low and too slowly moving. my only explanation is an oddly large drone. considering it is about the size of about two compact cars, it would have to be one unique drone and would not be some civilian tech. it is here all the time around the same time, i just want to know what it is.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

it was odd because unlike the other planes, this one had no strobe lights or colored lights, it was the color of a flare. i thought it might be the iss, but the time i saw that it was white reflecting the sun and traveling west to east. it looked very much like a meteor except if it was then it was very high up because its apparent speed was like that of an aircraft. i thought it might be a missile being launched from the east coast of florida, but it was further north than the space shuttles i've seen launching almost due east from my location. since it looked like it was near the airport's approach path i thought it might be a sam except that it flew in a straight line and did not waver. i kept watching it for about 30 seconds until it either went behind a cloud in the west, burnt out,

wrote about my aunt and the comparison to what the priest had said...But it wasnt till later when i enlarged the 2 pictures that i noticed i caught something pretty amazing.I have enclosed 4 pictures.

deny it being a drone. it appeared right over our heads about 20 or so feet above us. it had a tail that was glowing. it did not look like a flame (it was a lot whiter(brighter) than the orb that was more the color of a light bulb) but was about 12 inches long following the orb that seemed to be the size of a baseball.It only lasted a few seconds and either accelerated or just blinked out. it happened so fast. there were 3 airplanes in the sky while this happened but they were way up in the sky and were east of where we were.\r\ni do not know if the noise i heard came from the orb but could not find any source for the noise that got my attention to turn around.","distance":"21-100

on tv, and due to the fact that it has continued to bother my fiance and i quite a bit sense. i wanted to report this when it happened but she persuaded me not to,for one i am friends with the sheriff and a little league coach in our community! although we did tell some relatives. first i would like to say that i am not in any way some person looking for attention or some ufo person that might make things up, i never believed in too much of it although have been open to the idea of other life but what we seen that night could (not) and was not either from this world or a technology that we are unaware of. my fiance and i were fishing one night on a small lake in central michigan around 3 am in the morning, and no we we were not drinking  (yet) it was a completely beautiful evening with not a single cloud in the sky we had just launched the boat and had just made our first cast when i just seem to be lucky or unlucky when i was looking up at the stars out of nowhere it seemed as if this light that came out of a black hole if i could describe it that way and it was brighter than anything i've ever seen i then went to  scream to my fiance but at the same time she was screaming back to me do you see this it was coming straight down and getting brighter and brighter and bigger and bigger when it started making a pulsating sound that we could almost feel kind of like a woomp woomp woomp sound, when coming to a stop.It stayed stationary for about 2 seconds,then a different sound was made and it shot off to the west i would say covering a 100 miles or so within a second then it stopped again and came back the exact same path at the same speed, my fiance at that point screamed and dropped her phone because she was trying to record.It then made another sound almost directly above us got really really bright again and then ascended almost immediately out of sight! i do give my  word that everything i have stated is 100% the truth nor is exaggerated i consider myself to be an intelligent man and can differentiate things that go in a straight line that others might perceive as a ufo this was in no way  meteor asteroid nor was it anything man made as far as i know militarily speaking. just decided to make this report now to get it our my chest. i do not have any mental disorders nor does my fiance we know what we saw that evening and unfortunately now can not drive walk outside go fishing or do anything at night without staring at the sky,lol well thanks for reading sincerely and truthfully shawn vanhoose and jackylin chamberlin","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were camping in black kaspian campgrounds outside of tahoe city ca. noticed an unfamiliar glow filtering through the dense pine trees. we began to hike towards the light, curious to what it was. the light seemed to elude us as we navigated through the trees. coming to a clearing at the bottom of a fairly steep hill, the light(s) appeared to radiate from a ridge approx. 100 yards up the rise. we hiked upward in random direction, separating by a distance of a few hundred feet. i began experiencing chills and a sensation of dread. my girl was climbing at a faster pace than me, and angling off at a greater distance. i noticed very bright lights streaming from above. they scanned back and forth from my position to where my friend was, blinding me as they focused on me. my friend was enveloped in a glowing haze as the lights brushed past her. i was overcome by a intense fear and a sense of warning to leave the area. reluctantly, my girl started down toward me,angry that i had been screaming 'let's go'. she also had witnessed the intense lights, but reasoned it to be sunlight filtering through the brush. the sun was setting low behind the mountain, so i didn't accept her explanation and convinced her that we should return to our camp before dark.\r\nat approx. 3 am we decided to hike a little in the woods. i took my camera,an average priced vivitar digital flash.We had a couple of halogen flashlights that put out bright light. the moonlight was enough to adjust our eyes to be able to see. the flashlights we used at random when we heard noises or such. i held my camera at arms length and snapped pictures at random. the bright flash of the camera lit up the forest in random direction every minute or so. after an hour or so, we headed back toward camp. it was at this time a light swooshed overhead and 'melted' into the trees ahead. it hovered a few hundred feet away in the forest, but three distinct lights shone through the darkness. i took some photos and hurried towards camp. in the final half a mile or so i snapped random pictures in every direction.\r\nback at camp we set up a makeshift perimeter that encircled our tent. viewing the photos that night produced nothing but sleep for our tired eyes.\r\nseveral times until the daylight arrived, we heard the snap crackle of footsteps around the tent, but were not up to investigating. we were in bear and big cat country, so decided the tent was safety.\r\nit wasn't until i returned home and downloaded my camera onto my computer that i discovered what we experienced. the random photographs taken that night in the woods had captured images of what i believe are alien beings. these photos are 100% legitimate, real and unadulterated. the photos clearly show an alien staring at us from behind a tree. the face is captured in the realism you would expect from someone who had a flashbulb erupt in their face. undeniable evidence. i have photos that show this , or more, aliens that presumably followed or trailed us to camp. a total of seven snapshots clearly show non human entities. these pictures are not faked photo shopped, or confused with something else. expert analysis will verify that indeed something other than human has been captured on film and exist as living beings.
