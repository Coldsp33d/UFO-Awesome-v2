what i had seen so i wasn't really paying attention to exactly where i was.  but it was somewhere between the coordinates listed above and the coordinates of the third appearance.\r\n\tthird appearance:  at roughly the following coordinates, 31.9639032,-98.920559\r\n\twhat i saw:  two objects, possibly one, above the road.  one long, oval shaped object with a shorter oval shaped object directly below it.  the reason i say 'possibly one' object is because each time i saw it, it was identical in shape (though not in size) to the time before.  which leads me to consider the possibility that what i saw was a singular object with two oval shapes or projections that may have simply been more obvious than the remainder of the object which i may not have been able to see.\r\n\ton the first appearance, the object about 20 feet away from me.  it was directly above the road.  from the top of the larger oval shape, to the bottom of the smaller oval shape it was possibly 10 feet long.  it was stationary as i drove directly under it.  if i had got out of the car and approached it i might have been able to just reach the bottom of it and touch it.  however, when i turned back to see what it was, the object(s) had gone.  the first time i saw it, the object(s) was not particularly bright.  that is, it did not seem to shine its own light, but was well illuminated by my headlights.  there was another car behind me who had to have seen it as well.\r\n\toddly, i hardly remember the second appearance.  i only remember that i saw it and it looked was smaller.  as i sit here writing this, i'm trying to remember, but i just can't.\r\n\ton the third appearance the object(s) was to my left, about 5 feet from the ground and about 10 feet away.  this time it seemed about 15 feet tall from top to bottom and seemed to be brightly illuminated from within.  i went back to try to get a better look, but again, the object(s) had gone.  during this drive i was traveling at about 55mph.  when i turned off of hwy 183 onto the road that leads to my house, i drove at about 30mph, hoping that i would see the object again and be able to stop before i passed it, but the object(s) did not reappear.","distance":"20 Feet or

copied fb email i sent tonight to local fb chapter)\r\n\r\n\"urgent message, can somebody please call me???  my cell number is (left out intentionally)\r\n\r\nbefore this week, i counted sightings by the number i witnessed in my lifetime which was five sightings (5).  today saturday, its impossible to use that as a standard of measuring, i have to count in hours!!!  i've had easily over 12 hours of sightings here in (left out intentionally).  i have become terrified, i have witnesses (3) but could have more except for my concerns for their psychological wellbeing, i would pull in more people.  everything going on here is something that i've already heard of, but never before in the magnitude and the in-your-face-ness (qty of craft, clarity, sustained timeframe of visibility, depth of activity witnessed from 1)large semi-cloaked vessels continuously visible from after dark to sunrise  2) vessels (same kind, but smaller percentage switching their function in the operation to mimic stars effectively unless you look hard and long enough to realize they are not stars, 3) interactive physically when possibly additional type become suddenly visible at roof level of homes in neighborhood, and amazingly (also point where i first became terrified, and understood also i never knew what it meant to be terrified) run a sustained procedure with densely number of participant crafts, working cohesively to do what it is they are here for (do i need to say this?).  this phase starts at approximately 3:15am and lasts as long as until 5:49am, as i witnessed on three days this week.  i am not seeking attention (reason i have not called police or anyone, and told only two neighbors so as not to adversely affect my daughter socially if i tell everyone and get tagged as \"crazy\",  i also am concerned why they can get away with this without anyone else viewing it like me?  are the cops aware of it?  i am really sorry to dump this on you two hours before dark on a saturday, but i assumed each time they would not return, so what good is a story so unusual as to make the extreme unusualness of it a factor against credibility.  it may be possible they will do this again tonight and if so, i welcome (and nearly beg you) to come over and film this.  at about 2am it has been so thick that large triangle semi-cloaked were easily viewable from my kitchen window for almost four hours last night.  also i am certain my not sleeping was the only obstacle between them and my 16 year old daughter (said because i believe the human fertility/dna manipulation technology the most plausible purpose of their retrieving and replacing tissue donors (taking and returning people from their homes) which is why i stayed awake entire time again last night with legit reason for concern their activity would migrate from hot spot group of homes to mine, adding to this that its impossible they are not aware of my intense monitoring of them each night, the first time especially i had a sustained window of time one craft stayed on me as i traveled the area to understand the scope of this (i will not leave my house again during the peak activity time, but 1st time was not aware how extensive it was until i drove in on the house contact part of it).  fyi, i may paste a copy of this to main mufon sight in case it increases the chance of getting a call tonight with the hope somebody can film this.  my buddy already photo'd in earlier part but each time thought it was the last so now not making that assumption again. thank you.\" (end of message to local chapter fb email)\r\n\r\nmy buddy took pictures on 2nd night, couple good ones, didnt think it would repeat, but did last night 3rd time (they last about 8 hours non-stop as they perform their operation in

5:49am (time range they descend on rooftops and do a mass abduction/replacement operation in a clustered area)\r\n\r\ni am so terrifed. this is beyond a movie level of depth and scope of

but we also raise chickens and i got up to investigate the noise with a flashlight and a 20 gauge shotgun. (in case there was a predator) i walked to the south end of my yard and next to our property, there is a large tract of land (3200 acres) that has been cleared to farm. i observed a large glowing disk very slowly descending on the western horizon. i had worked that day at my job at a local resturant. i was tired. but i was also extremely curious about this sighting. if i had had a 4 wheeler, i would have rode back on the balfour property and looked at what had landed back there. it was approximately 1/2 mile behind my house on the western horizon where this disk shaped object landed. it made absolutely no noise. it was not a man made aircratft. i am absolutely certain with absolutely no doubt in my mind that i witnessed a ufo land in the field on the western horizon on the balfour property. i am certain of this. i am 56 and have never ever seen anything like this before. my property is vector for aircraft. i see jets, planes, blimps, ultralights fly over. this was something i have never ever saw before. also, a neighbor's son witnessed the same event. his name is logan toole. he works on the balfour property for glen heard, the farmer renting the farmland. i have not talked to him personally, but his aunt-joan smith is my sister-in-law and was telling me he saw the same event. also, last night, i got up to go outside because i am of a certain age and have hotflashes and i saw 2 glowing objects slowly hovering and slightly moving over the sorghum planted next to my property on the south end of my property. i got my husband up to look at it. i watched for over 15-20 minutes with a pair of binoculars. it looked almost upright, glowing, and hovering over the middle of the sorghum field. at first, when my husband looked at it, he said it was a truck. i said why would a truck or 4 wheeler or atv be in the middle of a field driving around. he said that he did not know. we talked this morning. he retracted what he said last night. it was 2 glowing disklike, upright structures hovering over the middle of the sorghum field. it was not touching the ground. my sister-in-law has observed pink orbs that change color and glow green, red, and amber on several occasions in the field. she lives on the next highway (three notch road) to the west of my property. something is going on. we have seen these objects and i am the only person willing to give an account of it. most are so sarcastic that they think it is an agricultural drone. i do not. a drone would probably make a chain-saw like noise and have a strobe light on its bottom. i saw no stobe light and heard absolutely no noise. there was no wind on the night i got up in may and went outside.","distance":"501 Feet -
