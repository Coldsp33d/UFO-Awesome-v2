quickly, and getting larger in size as well. the object stopped right over the rail yard which was located right next to my grandmother's house. it was about 50' across. it hovered there, and we all just stood in amazement, wondering what the heck it was. after a few minutes more objects appeared. they came from far away in the sky and stopped on the left and right sides of the large object. the other objects were very small and there were a lot of them, maybe 20 or 30 total. they were all very bright white and you could tell there was a structure to them but the lights were so bright we could not see what the structure was. then all of a sudden, they all shot straight up and out of sight in a second. the whole town saw it and talked about it for years afterwards. no one knew was the

21:50 i saw summat weird.\r\n\r\nsaw a very low light on the horizon sw, was very bright and i assumed it was the iss (international space station) as it can be quite bright and low. grabbed my binoculars but saw the first pic, a bright yellow light with 4 red lights. this changed as i watched to 3 red lights.\r\n\r\nit headed south in an arc then eastwards and i noticed it was being tailed by a smaller object that i presumed was a jet, we get a lot of military aircraft flying here from local military bases but rarely of an evening.\r\n\r\nthis was much smaller than the larger object though, it was only a few miles away, i could hear the smaller jet but something as big as the thing it was following should, that late at night, have made quite a bit of loud engine noise...It didnt....  it \"looked\" like a small jet tailing a large aircraft, but the large aircraft made no noise. the small jet ( i could hear its noise) suddenly went bright for approx 5 seconds then dimmed to normal.I'd say the smaller jet was approx an open hand width away from the object in front if you held your hand up to the sky.\r\n\r\nthe larger lights circled round slowly and headed north, turning still to head back to the west. i looked again through the binoculars to see the second image. it was a chevron shape of yellow and red lights and it definitely wasn't multiple jets in formation as there were no navigational lights or flashing strobe lights.\r\n\r\ni looked at the smaller jet and it was emitting a very bright light, on and off as if signalling the object in front. ive only ever seen lights that bright on landing gear on aircraft and they were going too fast to have the landing gear down, plus those lights are designed to be bright from the front not from the side as i was observing it. only other thought was afterburners but that would have been exceptionally loud even from that distance.\r\n\r\nalso, the smaller jet was made up of two red and two white lights, not flashing, just constant. both headed off west around 22:00 and as far as i am aware it hasn't come round again.\r\n\r\nreally strange though that there was no noise from the lead larger

Matthew, Bost","country":"GB","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My sighting occurred during my summer school holidays f i recall correct an early weekend in august 1987.\r\n\r\nmy mother and my step father had recently separated. my mother, brother and i had moved about 45 minutes away for a new start. \r\n\r\nmy stepfather also had to change his residence to another farm house in the local area.\r\n\r\nit had been agreed that i would go and stay with my stepfather and help him with the move.\r\n\r\nwe had spent around 5 years living at thimbleby cottage, st marks road, holbeach st matthew. lincs. pe12 8eq\r\n\r\nour house was situated pretty much in the middle of nowhere in the holbeach fens, and pretty much one of the last occupied houses before the raf holbeach bombing range.\r\n\r\nthe raf holbeach bombing range was used most week days for raf and usaf bombing and gun range exercise and practice.\r\n\r\nat this time in my life of was 12 years old and really wanted to join the airforce and dreamed of being a pilot as most kids do.\r\n\r\nbut because where we lived the sound of military aircraft was an absolute constant in our lives.\r\nand as a child my younger brother and i who both played outside every minute we were not in school (one tv, no home phone and no video games in our house back then) we would play a game to identify every aircraft bombing on the range by sound alone.\r\n\r\nnow when you hear these thing daily, it becomes easier than you think to tell the difference between the planes in service at that time.\r\n\r\nplanes heard on a daily basis were\r\n\r\na10 thunderbolt usaf(distinct turbine engine and cannon burst) best sound in the sky as kids... a real gun, and amusing at times as boys.\r\n\r\nf111 usaf swing wing bomber (was quite modern at the time)\r\n\r\ntornado ids raf bomber\r\nf4 phantom  raf\r\nharrier   raf\r\njaguar   raf\r\n\r\nwe even saw the vulcan training before the falklands (last combat service)\r\n\r\ni aslo rember walking home from school when i was just 7 years old i saw a plane crash on the range in 1981.\r\n\r\nthe reason i say all this is when you are living out there there are no hills, its the one of the flattest and most un-populated places in the uk. no street lights, few buildings, and the highest structures are trees.\r\n\r\nso at night it is pitch black and nothing but sky, and the stars are so clear and bright. \r\n\r\nand again as kids living with this sky we were taught what was in the sky with regard to planets and constellations etc.\r\n\r\nso even as kids we knew the night sky... as stunning as it was i gather it would be heavily restricted airspace.\r\n\r\nyou would on occasion see and hear other high flying aircraft at night, but you could hear the rumble and see the very distinct strobe lights.\r\n\r\n\r\non the night in question we had just returned from bemrose farm about 2-3 miles away back to thimbleby cottage late in the evening. i recall the time would be between 11pm and midnight.\r\n\r\nwe pulled into our driveway infront of our detached garage.\r\n\r\ni would always look up at the stars on a clear night, and muse over the milky way, and look for the familiar shapes and dots of light in the sky.\r\n\r\ni had never previously seen anything before i couldn't explain away. i would often see shooting stars, the occasional satellite, the planets etc.\r\n\r\nbut nothing different.\r\n\r\nbut this night as i look up into the sky i saw a single light that looked like a star, high in the sky moving from behind my left shoulder side. i was facing the house, so i was roughly stood facing north.\r\n\r\ni remember pointing it out to my step father, who found it in the sky and stood and watched.\r\n\r\nafter maybe 15-20 seconds another light appeared behind it and following it.\r\nthe second light seemed to be moving slightly quicker and i expected to see the second light pass the first light. \r\nthis in itself was quite unusual to see two lights or stars at the same time, but it could have been two object illuminated in low space orbit or higher and lit by the sun.\r\n\r\nbut i was amazed as the first light just stopped moving.\r\nthe second light then very closely passed the first. maybe 2-3 seconds later the first light set off after the second. i was in awe at what i was seeing. i asked if my step father was seeing what i was seeing, which he confirmed. then the two lights started making sharp turns without any visible reduction in speed. the two lights then spent several minutes chasing each other across the sky (the nearest way i could describe it was when two butterflies chase each other).\r\n\r\nwe continued to watch this until we could see them no longer. it may have been 10mins, 15mins, or 20mins.\r\n\r\ni asked my stepdad what he thought he had seen, and he said as i did ufo.\r\n\r\nwe knew by definition they were unidentified flying objects.\r\n\r\nbut we didn't jump to any conclusions.\r\nhowever with my interest in space because of living under the sky as we did, in my opinion it is ridiculous to think we are the only object with life suspended in space.\r\nalthough i didn't jump to the alien conclusion either.\r\nall i know is the two objects that i watch for a significant period of time were high altitude, intelligently controlled, moving at speeds and making direction changes and maneuvers relative to each other that no known aircraft to the public could make back then nearly 30 years ago, and still cannot today.\r\n\r\ni don't know what they were, but i know they were no illusion or light anomaly. \r\nthey were not any civil nor military aircraft known of the time, nor any of the stealth projects that even back then we knew about.\r\nthose flight characteristics are no possible with wing and airflow.\r\n\r\nsince this time i have been fascinated with anything like this.\r\nhowever i have never been suckered into many of the sightings that i myself can debunk and identify, which include many televised videos and and pictures. so many objects, especially anything in the sky that appears luminescent is all too often wrongly labelled.\r\ni watch them all, and frown at too many.\r\n\r\nall i know is what i saw that night can not be dismissed as misidentification,  it can only be one of two things.\r\nextra terrestrial craft flying above or in our atmosphere, or highly advanced military technology being tested over the bombing range in military airspace. i could only hazard a guess to where we got the technology if it is ours. but i saw them.\r\n\r\ni have carried these memories as clear as day with me all this time.\r\ni didn't report it at the time as i had many other more important things happening in my life. in the years shortly after i was in the air training corp (air cadets). basically for teenagers wanting to join the raf.\r\nand talking like this was not a good idea.\r\n\r\nas it happens my life took a different direction. \r\nit was just time for me to record what i saw.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

was tons of ambiance.  ambiance everywhere, in the pig man's voice, the buzzing and clanging, even in the screams buried far off in the background somewhere. i know the am band can skip, but i have to

right-angle turn (90 degrees) quicker than you can blink your eyes. it then continued at the same speed directly north. we watched it until it passed over the horizon. we were stunned, of course, since we both realized nothing made by man could make a turn like that. we estimated its altitude at over fifty miles, perhaps in low earth orbit. the object was approximately the brightness and size of the planet venus.

different/odd.\r\n\r\nhaving lived here all my life i am very familiar with various types of military helicopters due to the close proximity of ft. hood and am familiar with the way they fly. these lights had a solid red light that was periodically obscured by a white flash, again, not unlike helicopters. however, when i first noticed them i realized how slow they were moving and i could not hear any rotor noise at all. i estimate that they were roughly about a mile away, i can usually hear helicopters from this distance in the area.\r\n\r\ni turned down johnson dr toward them and stopped at the intersection with blue bonnet pkwy and estimate i was now within about 1/4 mile or less, still i could hear no rotor noise. i could hear cheers from the football field about 3/4 of a mile away. as i approached, the lead two lights that were originally lower that the two trailing lights slowly ascended and the trailing lights descended correspondingly while the middle light held position, as if all were attached to a single large object. i stayed put and watched the lights (craft?) head almost parallel to blue bonnet pkwy fairly slowly then the lead lights seemed to become one and the trailing two lights got closer together (possible optical illusion due to increasing distance?)\r\n\r\nthere was a lot of traffic headed to the rodeo arena to my sw and the combination of oncoming headlights making further observation difficult and not being able to pull all the way out of traffic due to the soggy and therefore soft ground made me feel as if i should move along at this point.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
