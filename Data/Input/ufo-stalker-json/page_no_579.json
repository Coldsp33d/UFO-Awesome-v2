down the main (public) part of the beach and then around the island onto some private properties, with private beach fronts.  i used to go there sometimes in the middle of the night and sit in the grass under a few large trees, thinking about things and enjoying the serenity of the ocean at night.  i know i was probably trespassing, but it was a private part of the beach and i liked to relax at night on the beach without the occasional person or flashlight of a vacationing late night beach goers.\r\n\r\nwhile laying in the grass on a lot elevated a bit above the shoreline, i noticed movement in the sky and saw a cigar shaped craft about maybe 1000-2000 feet in the air, about 1-3 miles away, flying towards the shore, but off in the distance.   it made no noise and was a dull silver color, cigar shaped, maybe 20-40 feet in height and about 100 feet long.  since it was dark and only the moonlight was providing light, i could not make out any details of this craft, only that it was cigar shaped and obviously under intelligent control.  when it got about a quarter mile away, the craft simply vanished.  i was scared because i observed this craft flying in this flight path for about 2 minutes.  then, it was gone. my heart raced.  \r\n\r\nas i was trying to process what had just happened, maybe 30 seconds to a minute later, i again saw movement in the sky and about 1-3 miles away, flying in about the same flight path, although slightly descending and ascending while on this path and moving a little from side to side.  descending and ascending maybe a few hundred feet and moving maybe 100 feet from side to side.  definitely not a completely straight flight path.  again, after the object had flown this flight path over the ocean and was about a quarter mile from the shore, it again vanished, only to appear about a minute later miles away, again flying a flight path similar to the last.  wether this was the same craft or multiple craft is unknown.  they looked exactly the same, from what i could see in the dark, at 2am.\r\n\r\ni wanted this happen at least 10-15 times, over the course of 30-45 minutes.  then, the craft vanished as it had done before and never reappeared.  i wanted about 10 minutes for it to reappear and it didn't.  i left the beach and never returned to that private area of the beach, although i did live on the island for another 2 years, visiting other areas of the public beach often.  i had no other sightings during the time i lived there.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
