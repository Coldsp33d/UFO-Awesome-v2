i was in a landing track for seeing plane models flying.\r\n\r\n2. i took my binoculars for seeing better a model plane. when it landed i looked at the distance. nobody ever parks there. very strange, i thouht.\r\n\r\n3. there was a black car. at its side there was a man, naked torso throwing a large pole.\r\n\r\n4. about the fellow: athletic man, naked torso, tight long trousers, black boots, throwing a large pole out of human capabilities (1150 feet), no parabole, no taking a career, efortless like throwing a small dart. repetitive movements, all day. i believe  that pole/pertiga created a passive antigravity shield without visible external devices, as if it were a coating or a painting.\r\nnote: his appearance is identical to the \"long man from wilmington\" (england), an ancient hill figure\r\n\r\nabout the car: black color, tinted windows, stopped near the man, closed doors, high-end car, very important: without license plate. parked in an unusual place. the man didnt visit the car.\r\n\r\n5.I surprised myself at the first moment. i looked at him, i could see him about an hour, doing the same routine. throwing, walking, and picking up his  pole. i thought of that large distance was totally explainable. so i walked towards him, but he approached i dont know how, but he materialized in front of me (i did not see the moment) and he caused me a mental conmotion like a grogi state. then i backed up, i circled twice around me and returned to my car. i lost my memory of all this for three days, then i remembered it.\r\n\r\n6. i dont know how i lost sight of the object . when i returned to my car i did not remember anything and i left the landing field about 9 pm with the lights car on. the man and the car remained at the same place, i suppose.\r\n\r\nfinal consideration: i would have preferred not to have lived this experience that has marked my life forever.","distance":"101-500

eve, waiting for my partner to get out of the shower. we have a skylight in our bedroom of our three storey house. our garden faces north, i noticed the moon was very bright, larger than normal and was also a full moon. looking at the moon to my right at about 2oclock( location wise) and stars for a few minutes it began to cloud over, quite breezy but blowing the clouds across the moon. i could see the usual planes high up, flashing red lights at different altitudes through the clouds. the wind direction was blowing north, cloud levels were at different heights, some blowing north easterly, i then noticed out the corner of my eye to the left( approx. 9 o'clock direction) traveling from north easterly to west, in the lower cloud line, a purple orb / tear drop giving off a florescent green / turquoise tail. if the object was the size of an aspirin the tail was an inch long. there was no vapour or smoke trail like you would get from a jet.  firstly i thought a shooting star, but this was too low, too vivid in colour and was going through the lower clouds and much lower than a helicopter, and thousands of feet lower than any aircraft. it had direction, straight then swerved , then straight again. the colours were breath taking, the clouds reflected the colours and magnified within. at a guess i would say it was below 1000ft. 2 miles away, we have houses along the ridge horizontally and this was between us and them. i've seen shooting stars and this definitely wasn't one! i watched the object travel out of sight, as the rate of speed was incredible, i was like wow, in awe of this beautiful object, speechless but excited. it seemed as though it was shielded at the front appearing like a car in a wind tunnel, deflecting clouds that were in front of it, similar to a space rocket re entering earths atmosphere is probably the nearest analogy. \r\n two days later, i came into work and was speaking to one of my staff about the incident. he lives 8 miles away and backs onto an army barracks (forge lodge in sutton coldfield) that is very low key, has us military staff and uk alike....Admin apparently!!!  very residential area. his wife works at the base and knows the (admin officers) very well.\r\n on new years eve they had a thunder storm around 20.00pm, that lit up the house followed by a large boom, unlike thunder. this was then followed by two army helicopters a few minutes later from out of no where. the following day after we had spoken, he had mentioned to his wife about my viewing of an object and she replied \"funny that, an object had been reported flying around the west midlands on new years eve.\" this was mentioned to her by an army officer. tamworth, birmingham and cannock are all in the west midlands uk.

the iss. at the time it was passing over the earth in daylight and as i watched i thought i noticed 2 marks on my screen and actually tried to wipe them off. i then realised they were actual small objects which were not always easy to see in the light. however when the iss went into darkness i could see a oblong/cylinder object a long way off in the distance. although it looked small i decided to try film it on my phone not sure if it would pick it up. i only filmed it briefly however you can actually make it out in the distance.\r\ni carried on my conversation and kept an eye on the screen and noticed that 2 objects seem to be very slowly rising up towards the iss.\r\none was the cylinder the other a sphere. it went on like this for a while when suddenly the sphere started moving quickly towards the iss. i was so surprised i panicked told my sister i would phone her back and tried to film it but in my rush and not being use to the phone i managed to turn the flash on at the same time!\r\nso what looks like the sun is actually the flash on my camera however you can still see clearly the sphere at the end of the arm of the iss.\r\ni was not sure if my flash would wash out the sphere on screen so decided to try and turn it off. however by the time i had done so the sphere had already quickly left\r\n i could still make out the cylinder so decided if it got closer i would be ready.\r\nwhoever was in charge of pressing the button for the blue screen must have been on their break because i filmed it for almost 6 minutes dont think i've seen one that lasts that long!\r\nin that time it definately moves closer to the iss and to me it looks like it has some kind of pulsing light running down the length of it.\r\nafterwards i decided to go online to see if anyone had caught anything like it and discovered a video on youtube titled iss-possible alien craft downloaded by streetcap1 in 2014 to me it looks like the same object.\r\nin some of the comments under his video someone says its just a atmoshere reading climate device tethered to the iss \r\nwhile another says its solar panel adhesive tape!\r\nhowever the fact that i caught this object earlier a long way off in the distance puts an end to those ideas.\r\nit is clearly not just light reflections so i would like to know what else it could possibly be?\r\nif these are crafts i've never seen any like them.\r\nsorry for the short jerky videos i must say they looked better on my phone.\r\nthanks for your time.\r\nregards\r\nclive

noise. it stops whatever it was doing and looks at me as it noticed i had woken up it waves it’s hand over my face and i don’t remeber anything after that. i woke up the next morning still thinking about what i had seen when i noticed a sharp pain with a burning sensation on my left inner forearm sort of like when you burn yourself the pain you feel after and the pain you feel the next day to where it’s still hurting but what i saw is what really freaked me out. i had a small v shaped scare about a half in wide and not like a cut but like a cut that had been laser sealed which would explain the sharp burning pain. i had that scar for 5 months and the burning pain never going away. then from one night to the next it had totally vanished but not before getting a picture. i haven’t had any expeirences that i know of to date. the dreams subsided and it seems they were done with me until a few months back when i start hearing these high pitched noise like a microphone coming in contact with a speaker. they last about 1 or 2 seconds and are nothing like the ringing in the ears. i’ve also noticed my body has been generating static shock to where i’m getting shocked from touching anything and not even on rug but in my kitchen with tile and bathroom with linoleum. it seems to last a couple of weeks then stops for months. overall the experience has left me with that of a victim and the feeling of being powerless with the fear it can happen again at anytime. i am confident putting this on an fbi polygraph because i know the results will be in my favor. i am of hispanic origin and am type o negative  blood same as my mother.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":89456,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.2070048,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01102018-0005","longitude":-119.1673716,"occurred":1269475200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1515564127000,"summary":"Didn’t see the outside and it was so dark inside i only saw the being directly to my right","tags":["lights","contact"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1515723050561,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":17,"maxtempi":62,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":57,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":11,"mintempi":52,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":17,"maxtempi":62,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":57,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":11,"mintempi":52,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2848,"locationName":"Oxnard, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3362"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Sedona","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live in sedona az. my wife,brother in-law and myself were sitting in my backyard stargazing. i was just telling my b.I.L about this light that i've  seen on several occasions over the past few years. no sooner did i say it and there it was roughly in the same area of the sky.. i got my night vision and laser pointer and began to record.. i recorded for 8 minutes or so... but the actual  time the light remained in view was 45 minutes .. it moved very slowly thru the constellation ophiuchus. it moved in a staggered path and seemed to remain still for several minutes at a time while traveling. it didn't just disappear it turned away and just became fainter until we lost sight if it..

mile marker 47.5 saw large boomerang shaped plane looking thing, the rest of traffic must have also noticed as everyone was drifting lanes staring at object. at first i thought it mustve been a very large/tall street light, but as i got closer i noticed it was not on a pole and was much farther into the air and was above a dark field no where near any street did not think to take pictures, just kept going, it was hovering over there with the white lights towards the front of the boomerang and as i continued on before getting up to where the thing was, it started slowly moving southbound still facing its white lights dead to the west, it was like it was on ice slowly sliding sideways, did not turn or lean when it moved and made no sound as i approached the section of the highway nearest it, it was still moving southbound, but then white lights still facing west, started moving quickly, at what looked like east/south east without turning the light side in that direction, i looked up and back to see if i could see it and all i saw were small red lights facing the eastern direction as if it was still facing west and was moving around without turning to face its direction of motion. on the front of it you could see small vertical lines of different color than the body of the object, but i couldnt tell it those were outlines of windows or not. nothing else could be seen on that sode other than the shape/lights/lines and on the back/inner side of the boomerang you only saw small dim red lights, nothing comparible in brightness to the bright white front lights. i only noticed the object because i was looking for a sign for a gas station/truck stop that usually tower near exits. i felt like it may have been a plane at first landing directly towards me, but once it slid sideways and stated moving backwards i knew there was no way it was a plane, i lost sight of it as i kept driving and did not stop, i dont know if the object stayed in the area and its movements were pretty slow, i thought it might've even been a helicopter, but then i realized, if it was a helicopter the 3 vertical lights would have tilted/raised and lowered to be able to move around in the air, and this object remained flat and facing west the entire time it was moving. i didnt think to take any pictures, and my dash camera is not installed in my current vehicle as i've just switched vehicles i'll do my best to make a sketch and hopefully one of the other motorists on the road thought to take pictures or video","distance":"101-500

did not see the object visually. we cannot say conclusively that it was invisible to the naked eye, but we did not see it and we think we should have been able to had it been visible. the object is clearly moving left to right (roughly east to west) based on the first two photos showing it over a rooftop. based on the last two photos it apparently increased markedly in altitude and moved from right to left while gaining altitude. again looking at the first two photos, it appears that the object is solid because it obscures a tiny portion of the cloud behind it. in the last two photos, the object displays an obvious aura that may be indicative of radiated heat or energy. the episode lasted less than 30 seconds, as she took the photos in quick succession. if there are any probable

pattern. noticed large glowing yellow rod of light that i thought was a airplane exhaust trail being lit by sun. very bright, but it didn't change or dissipate or move with the clouds. kept watching it and realized it wasn't moving or changing. it was several miles away and to the southwest. noticed a airplane exhaust trail headed towards it coming from the east, at which time the object ceased to be glowing yellow, and was grey but kept it's shape. object began to move away keeping a vertical bearing staying in front of the airplane. it kept it's rod like shape but appeared smaller as it moved away. after object was out of sight, multiple jet engine exhaust trails criss crossed the area for about 30 minutes. the last unusual thing was a long exhaust trail coming up from the horizon after the small jet engine trails. exhaust trail moved slowly and directly vertical, more like a missle taking off than a plane exhaust. the initial glowing object seemed quite large considering it was very far away and much larger than the jet trails from the criss crossing planes that came after the rod left. the original \"rod\" had clear borders and did not dissipate like a chemical trail from a plane would, and it had a definite top and bottom border both while glowing and when turned grey. i was approximately 1/2 way between pratt kansas and dodge city ks, with the object to the west and south of my position. i stopped to try and photograph it when it was a grey rod moving away, but my camera phone would not zoom in enough to clearly see the object. based on the distance away, i believe the object was quite large, and sat on top of the lowest band if clouds. the whole episode lasted close to an hour from the time i noticed the object, until the last vertical chem trail. attached picture is not of the object i saw, but the closest image i found on the internet that looked like the object. however, the object i saw never moved into a horizontal or slanted position, but stayed perfectly vertical the entire time even while moving away.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me and three other people were setting inside my single wide mobile home on my 11 acres of land. we were talking when i heard a very soft (all most inaudible) hum. recently tornados had gone through my county and i was quite weary of storms so i walked to my back door and opened it to check the weather. there was no sound outside but a lot of cloud to cloud lightning in the distance. i stood there a moment and noticed something moving above my tree line (a hundred yards or so away). i couldn’t see it very well at that moment just a black silhouette against the lightning in the back ground (no thunder). it was shaped like a black domino, the size of a few football fields, floating silently, horizontally at the speed of an ultralight, perhaps even slower but much bigger, its altitude must have been as high as two or three fully grown pine trees. the object was directly in front of me traveling from my left to my right. one of my friends walked over to me and i asked them what they thought it was. after a moment watching it we could see the rear of the object (i’m assuming the rear since it was going away from us now) there were two red/orange lights like engines from a star wars movie, no glow just the color, like it was a red/orange sticker stuck to the rear (i don’t know if they were engines though) they were the complete height of the object which i’m guessing was about a two-story building. as if you put your thumb in the center of a rectangle and to the left and right side of your thumb was red/orange light and where your thumb is it was black like the rest of the object. my friend looked at me and we both agreed we never seen anything like that before (warner robins air force base is about 30 minutes away so we see planes and the such all the time.) we watched as it tilted 45 degrees like a plane banking left but it stayed on the same course it had been on. we watched the back end of it (the engines) until it passed behind some trees (we could only make out the shape of the object with each flash of lightning in the distance of which there was an abundant amount). awe struck we walked back to the living room and started to explain to the two-other people hanging out what we just saw. i was ecstatic telling them how i’ve never seen anything like that before. a few minutes later (less then five) while we are describing the object i heard the same vague hum. i asked if anyone else could hear the hum, they could not. excited i ran to the back door but there was nothing there, disappointed i walked around to the front of my mobile home to take a look and to my surprise there it was, a giant black rectangle moving very slowly, about 5 acers away, across my field, above more tree lines. coming from my left to my right again (as if it had circled my property while we were inside). it was very large, completely silent (i could only hear the hum both times inside the mobile home). the object was horizontal again and i could see the front since it was so far to my left. there were no lights of any kind on the front, bottom and side. i watched it slowly crossing my field. a few minutes passed and i realized the other three had come out side and they were watching it, not saying a word. the object made a slow turn to the right (never banking) as if it was following a giant half circle. realizing i was not alone and others were witnessing the same thing i began jumping up and down screaming “what the expletive is that? what is that? do yall expletive see that” no one said a word. we watched it for a few more minutes until it was going away from us in the direction of warner robins airforce base that’s when we could see the rear and there were the red/orange engines again. it never made a sound and moved way to slowly to be able to stay in the air for its rectangular shape and size. perhaps it was some weird blimp i’ve never seen before. the next day my friend that saw it the first time with me refused to talk about it saying over and over it was just a c-130, though it moved way to slow and c-130’s are super loud that close. the other two swore it was an alien craft (one friend, my future wife, claimed to be very frightened during the whole ordeal) which made me laugh (though it could have been, not doubting that possibility). i didn’t even think about aliens, i was thinking it was some piece of technology the u.S government had that we have not been told about yet, something similar to how people thought the stealth bomber years ago was an alien craft. i never felt endangered the entire time. i just find it so odd that a day or two later my friend (that saw it with me first) was so reluctant to talk about the experience saying it was just a c-130 even though all the rest of that night he was flabbergasted as the rest of us. that was in 2009, at the time of me writing this it is 2018 and i have never seen the object again. i apologize for the description being so lengthy.","distance":"101-500

light if you want to see those too.  i called my son who watching a high school football game a few miles closer to the object and told him to look and he saw it clearly.  strobing green blue red yellow... mostly remaining relatively still but he and i both could it see it moving up and down and side to side.  \r\nwhen i watched the videos on my computer i saw something streak by so i rewound and hit play/pause quickly and repeatedly.  you can clearly see what looks like a fast moving disc or orb.  it appears to be heading in downward direction but then it looks to turn and go up at an angle.  lasts about second.  look around at about the 1;43 mark. in comes into the screen to the left and above the strobing orb.  you may not notice it coming across but look to the bottom  right of the screen, just above the street light.   i also slowed that part of the video to 10% speed and changed the lighting so you can it more clearly.\r\n (when i saw the light flash by on my screen it reminded of another odd experience on jan 29 2017   i was taking a photo of the moon for my gf (it was smiley face).  when i snapped the picture i notice a light whiz by.  i looked the the photo i took and there is what appears to be a series of lights which looks like a craft of some kind.  i submitted that event and photos to mufon .\r\n\r\n*****  i have tried to submit the full length videos to no avail.  please contact me for this as well as other very compelling video of unknown crafts in the sky, both from dallas tx as well as crested butte co.","distance":"101-500
