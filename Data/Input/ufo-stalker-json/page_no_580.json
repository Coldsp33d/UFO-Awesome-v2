about november, 1985. at christmas she spoke about what she saw, and was very upset and unnerved. she came down her street from work, pulled in her driveway. as she started to get out of her car she noticed 3 very small blue beings walking across the street toward her house. they continued to walk between her house and the neighbors house toward the back yards- not fenced. she observed that they were blue in color, very small- about 3' high, they stayed together and walked to the back. she said she was so distraught, she just went into her house, and did not follow them to see where they went. she passed away in 2008, i asked her about this event before she died, and she said it absolutely happened, and she was never able to forget what she saw. no lights, no craft-- just these 3 small beings.I am her niece, and felt compelled to report what she told our entire family. i have used my aunt's address, so you have the correct location. i live  at a different address in  the same

black eyes. i thought they were ghosts and it was a dream/nightmare. they wer so short, and my room so dark i could only see they were light colored, dark eyes, their mouths were opened in an \"o\" shape and they had skinny arms that moved so fat they were blurred. i was hovering next to my twin bed above the ground at bed level and they were performing what i thought to be an operation of some sort over my torso. i could move nothing but my eyes and could not scream. my room was so dark then i passed out.\r\n\r\nat approx 3:15am this morning i started dreaming about them. i never dream about them unless they are close by. at first they were all over the audience in a concert by some 80's rock type band. then when i saw them all in hoods this time i ran but could not escape. then i found myself in a darkened neighborhood. no street lights on, no lights from houses, everything darkened except for what appeared to be a bright star directly over me illuminating my area where i was standing and some exteriors of darkened houses. then i felt like it came closer and closer and suddenly i was in my current room. lying in the exact position i was lying in and unable to open my eyes or move and they were in my room between the bed and the window. my bed is about 2 feet from the window wall. there were multiple and in the dark a green flash came from the corner wall where my feet were. and i could feel an energy source what i would describe as pulling my body but not moving me . it did not hurt. more like an intense internal tickling but not so tickly. dont know how to describe it. it jus was. i dont know what the hell they wee doing but they were in my room again almost 40 years later. i believe the dream preceded what was really happening. i could not wake up but was able to eventually wake myself up and did not stay passed out this time until morning. i could not sleep and checked the clock it was just about 3:30am. i woke up my son and made him get in bed with me. hes just 13. i didnt want them effing with him. his room is way darker and secluded. i fell back to sleep about 4:15am with a light strip on and my son beside me. they came back with him in the room at some point after and i could see it all but could not move or get myself up this time i was paralyzed and could see them in the glow of the strip light coming from my floor. they were on that side of the bed again near my son. i fought it and eventually forced my way up in bed. then they were gone. i had a sense that i felt they wee harrassing me at that point. what ever that could mean ! they were singing a weird song in my head. \"we missed you, we really really really really missed you\". f weird. maybe i dreamt the song part but if anyone knows what its like to be visited , when they are near your dreams will suddenly shift to incorporate them , then somewhere along the line you wake to understand the experience you are having with them is real and you crossed over the blur of your dreams into what is happening current. weird s---. i know it all sounds weird and fake but this is true. and though they have not visited me that im aware for about 40 years , over the years when they are near (flying over) i feel like i can sense that and then i dream of them. but they were in my f room i saw and felt it all.

girlfriend and i were enjoying a cold november night under the milky way. there was absolutely zero cloud cover. i am obsessed with aviation, a paragliding pilot, and work at our local airport. i can readily pick out conventional aircraft during any time of the day. i can recognize aviation lights and determine direction of flight. \r\n\r\nall that being said, we were in the hot tub. i looked up in the northern sky at about 45+ degrees from horizon. i witnessed a bright larger than normal star appear and then disappear. i had enough time to say, \"what was that?\" my girlfriend said, \"what was what?\" i said, \" i don't know, i saw a light turn on and then turn off!\" \"it was like a large star. it turned on! then turned off! right there in the sky!\" right when i finished saying all of that it happened again and she saw it.\r\n\r\nnow, i do believe in ufo's et. but, this couldn't be explained away. was it an aircraft. no! no visible navigation lights were seen at that instant as we saw many prior and after. also, this object wasn't moving. was it a satellite. no! again, there was no flight path and it never reappeared in the clear night sky. the only thing it could have been was two separate shooting stars traveling perfectly straight at us. i am no rocket scientist, but that would be impossible. that argument would mean there would have to be a second one traveling the exact trajectory, burn time, and color for my lady to witness the same thing. \r\n\r\none last thing, three hours prior while at the barn. we saw two military re-fueling jets @ 20k feet flying to the north along the same path where the stationary lights appeared. it was like someone from far away took a picture with a flash, but due to the distance it appeared as a single light source. a large star. \r\n\r\nhope there are other accounts to provide an explanation.

kitchen where i was sweeping. i said have you been out jogging? i said this because my son appeared to be dripping wet yet it was not raining outside.  he didn't say a word. put his head to my head and i was out cold. lost track of time. was out of it. my son actually did get home around 6:30 or 7:00 a.M on june 17, 2015. got in trouble at work for no call no show.  boss complained that i kept forgetting things and stop acting like a retard.  unlike him.  so, i went to near by hospital er for a check up on june 20, 2015.  they said i was fine.\r\n\r\nbut, i just knew something wasn't right.  so i reviewed all phone messages. videos and pictures.By the way my sons phone stopped working that night then got lost altogether.  \r\n\r\ni had called son to see if he was ok at the precise moment the entity burst in.  so i heard what should have been a voicemail message. recording has since changed, then vanished.  i still have bits and pieces of it.  but not what i heard on the original.\r\n\r\noriginal voicemail message:\r\n\r\ncrash door opening.  me: have you been out jogging? then: falling struggleing dog barked a few times.\r\n\r\nentity: said my name three times in a growling garble voice that sounded just like the one in the movie forth encounters with that supermodel in it mia poltovich (can't spell her name) also heard frequencies like someone trying to tune in a radio.  all that recording has vanished.  now all you can hear is me; have you been out jogging? struggling, sniffling like i had a runny nose and dog barking..\r\n\r\nmy phone video:  shows an entity with a big nose and scraggly hair doing something to me (blowing gas or operating on me as i'm coming back in to conscienceness)  i saw: why is that woman screaming? (i believe a video (the devils reject was playing in the living room) entity backs up quickly on moves off to my right.  at first it looks like a man, but when i print off a picture it looks like a big nosed entity resembling that charachter in that tv show in the 80's called alf.\r\n\r\ni have another video of something making a growling noise.  will try to send it to.  it took months in my free time to print even a picture of this thing. videos will not send, print, turn green screen etc. phone kept saying it doesn't support that file type or extension.  started with an e\r\n like eix.\r\n\r\nwhen my son arrived home everything was normal.  didn't remember a thing and wouldn't have even bothered checking in to the events of june 17 if i hadn't almost lost my job due to absent mindedness that week.\r\n\r\nwent to hospital again with stomach pains. as i do have a hernia.  more test were run in more detail. as i was came in on a ambulance and was admitted to hospitaql for 3 days.  a few odd things did show up which i'm still researching, requesting records and x rays.  \r\n\r\n1. abnormal findings  (were found, but dr. won't explain)\r\n2. cylinder shaped object with air in it was visible on x-ray\r\n\r\nreceived a odd phone call from head nurse seeing if i was ok after i was discharged.  she hinted around to request my medical records especially x-rays.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

above my neighbors house across the street. i just remembered seeing this before i had observed the plane.  which is why i looked up at the plane.  the plane was very loud, but the glowing red light,i noticed was silent. and the red light was coming closer and brighter. it was now about the size of a quarter or 50 cent piece. slowly, like a crawl, coming closer. i thought about my phone camera but did not have it....So, i quickly walked and pounder on my neighbor's door. he is a former vietnam doctor in the air force.  surely, i thought he would recognize this flying craft. in less than 45 seconds, we were both looking at this object which must have traveled 500 miles in the other direction.  it was red and was traveling like a leaf would, up and away, in a swirling wind.A single, long, lazy loop. this would be the second ufo i have ever seen.  the first time scared me, this one did not. there was also the color white inside the red glow and i remember it turning sideways, or just the bottom half turning, and seeing two long, what i guess were, landing legs. and then after it disappeared a plane with a red flashing light, far off in the distant, but in the same direction was observed and decided that we knew for sure that it was a plane. compared thar with what we both saw, wasn't even close.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
