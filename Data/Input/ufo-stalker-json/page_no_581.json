to the store or something, like we do on some nights. anyways we where at the intersection of woodridge dr and bellfort st getting ready to turn left on bellfort street, when all of a sudden i saw a bright light in the sky, at first i thought that it might be a plane or a helicopter with there searchlight on because there is an airport not far from the location i saw the ufo but helicopters and planes often have other lights flashing on its sides or tails like a red or blue or white lights flashing but not this, it was just there like a bright star in the sky then i thought this cant be a star its too bright and too close almost looked like it was about a mile in the dark sky where the clouds are plus the stars around here are never that bright or close like that. whatever it was it certainly wasnt a plane helicopter or star or tower of any sort im positive. i pointed out to my mom after i was positive it was a ufo, she also thought that it was a airplane or a helicopter but after i got done explaining to her that planes or helicopter also have other lights flashing she became convinced that it was a ufo. we lost sight of it because we kept driving, we shouldve pulled over and investigated further but we didnt:( the whole sighting lasted for like 15 seconds while we were driving past it, it wasnt following us or anything it was just posted there in the sky like it was supposed to be there like a very very bright star. still cant explain what was that that super bright light in the sky on that summer night but im glad i was able to witnnessed it and have and

the sky and told me she saw something in the sky. i looked up to where she was pointing and observed what i can only describe as a solid white spotlight shining into a cloud with a green light in it. i stood there staring at this bright light to see if it would move or if it were a helicopter but there were no other lights on it at all and the object did not move or flash. this light was shining into a cloud with a green light in the middle of the cloud. there were no other clouds in the sky. the light from the object with the bright light was bright a reflected off the cloud with the green light in it. the bright light then seemed to detach or move away backward from the cloud in a straight line and slowly. we watched the bright light move away for quite awhile while the cloud with the green light remained. i am sure you have gotten lots of call on this but what me and my daughter saw defined anything i've seen. it was not the triton missile after researching what a trident launch looks like on youtube. my phone was charging and i was to be honest to amazed as what i was seeing to even think about going to grab it. i was just more amazed at whst me and my daughter were observing. that all i could think was to call my mother and wife to see what i was seeing. my wife got pictures of it after the light began to slowly move away from the cloud. what i saw was no triton missile launch or any missile launch i have seen or researched after i saw what i saw. i would really appreciate and hope someone calls or visits me and my daughter so we can better explain what we

p.M.\r\n\r\n2.  i first noticed the object because of it's unusually bright light in that direction for any stars, then i observed it moving around a bit.\r\n\r\n3.  not sure what it was at first -- maybe a helicopter or plane way in the distance, yet it's variable movement did not appear to be the typical maneuvers of those aircraft, yet there was no sound, either.  my other thought is that this could be a privately-owned drone.  however, to my knowledge, the battery packs don't last the duration that i observed it both nights. \r\n\r\n4.  the object over time followed the general stars in the night sky.  however, it would hover in the same direction i spotted it, then swerve to the left and right by a 1-3 degrees at most (if you were to compare it to the distance between celestial objects.) it would also go up and down slightly, but somewhat less than the left-to-right movement.  \r\n\r\n5.  it just really made me wonder what it could be.  it could possibly be a simple private drone, although it appeared to be way above the 500-ft. limit the faa recently mandated.  secondly, why would someone be flying it at night?  trying to put myself in someone's shoes, maybe it was to capture footage of the taurid meteor shower?  i tried waiting around for a terminal drop in the object to corroborate a dead or draining battery power.  i did not observe this on either night.  other than that, i rather appreciate the notion that we do not know the answers to everything.\r\n\r\n6.  simply put, i got cold and went inside.  i figured that if it's clear tonight (which it is), i'll

one of awe, it was gorgeous, the color and gigantic.\r\nwe live in the hillside and have only one neighbor who is two football fields away, but we had a water truck up here filling our cistern and the two guys doing that saw it as well.\r\ni have zero speculation of what is was. it definitely wasn't normal.\r\ni must say i have never believed in aliens, ufo's etc., until moving here. over the years, past ten, we have seen some really bizarre stuff in the night sky.\r\nthe strangest thing is not only did the photos i know i took not show up on my lgg3 phone but all of my photos not on sd card were gone. remain gone. about 130 important pictures were somehow deleted but obnly from phones internal memory not sd card.\r\ni am interested if anyone knows what it

direction towards devizes,returning to my works depot after night time deliveries in the local area.When i noticed a orange discus shaped object hovering,about 20ft of the ground, below the horizon about 400ft away from me in  front of the road i was travelling on.\r\nmy first thoughts were \"that's not right\" or \"that shouldn't be there\" as i'm very familiar with surrounding area.The object was a solid vivid orange,like a discus cut in half with a very small round light of the same colour next to it a fraction of the size of main object. it was a very vivid orange but it did not appear to illuminate the surrounding area which i thought was odd.\r\nand the whole time i was travelling straight towards this object at speed of 50-60 mph.\r\ni remember thinking at the time as i was rushing towards it the small light could be a street light but there's never been any street lights there and what is the other object?\r\n\r\nthat's my last memory of approaching the objects, the next thing i remember is the road rushing underneath me in my van and i pull into a lay-by on the outskirts of west ashton, 12 miles the other side of the event!.It was then daylight and over 1 hour has passed. why i pulled over was unusual as i was so close to getting back to work only 10 miles away, i normally would not have bothered. but i got out and whilst smoking a cigarette and looking at the sky (now daytime)in a n/ne direction i noticed a orange flash to my right in amongst the layers of cumulus clouds which only lit up some of the cloud. this was then followed by two flashes on my left in different cumulus clouds.\r\ni finished my cigarette, smiled to myself (which anybody who knows me would say that's out of character and i found it odd myself) and drove back to work and then home only ever telling my wife what happened.\r\n\r\nfourteen years went by and i never gave it a second thought,but over the past two years it's really played on my mind, in my waking/daily/sleeping thoughts.\r\nthat's my story i know it sounds mad but i know what i saw and experienced and it's doing my head in!\r\n","distance":"101-500

heights condo complex in north caldwell, nj. proceeded up steep main driveway of complex and caught sight of object hovering approx. 15-30 feet over treetops. object resembled two walnuts - an upper and lower - joined by a vertical \"slat.\" object was dark brown or black, displayed a slight horizontal highlight across its midline, possible had a segmented texture, no visible propulsion, no noise, no additional objects entering or leaving, no lights, no other known witnesses, no apparent interaction with environment. object was first viewed while driving south. as object floated very slowly (not sure if it ascended; if so, did this quite gradually), toward southwest, i lost sight due to trees. i drove west along side street to \"catch up\" with object, and caught a glimpse as it slowly entered low-lying fog.\r\nobject did not appear to be drone. object did not appear to be solar balloon (homemade or purchased) due to its shape. in any case, the foggy morning precluded sufficient sunlight from warming such a device. when first sighted, the larger walnut sat beneath a smaller version. after recapturing the object during the second sighting, the config. changed: both spheres adopted a more horizontal position. at maximum height, object approached about 300 feet. the smaller walnut was either truly smaller, or simply farther away from me (perspective effect), so this confounded an accurate size estimate. all in all, the object resembled a musical note with a smaller sphere at the top, instead of the familiar \"flag.\" it did not demonstrate the rapid ascent or wind-blown course of a\r\nfully inflated balloon (like a child's science project). the object appeared to move deliberately and without regard to witnesses. i have searched a variety of ufo shapes on the internet. this object did not fall into any of those categories.\r\n\r\nthank you  ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

rest of the sky was empty reflections of the sun showed vessel to be high metallic silver which was pretty to look at. any ways tracking for close to 30 seconds she went behind a small thin cloud and should have reappeared within 3-4 seconds but never did which struck me very odd because a plane traveling at that rate of speed and such a thin low laying cloud could not have provided enough cover for a plane to change direction. i have not told anybody about what i saw due to criticism but heard about this sight due to the missle launch event in california which mentioned this sight. i am a
