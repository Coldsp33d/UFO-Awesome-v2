States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 6:00 pm i was standing in the front yard,with my seven year old son. we were looking west,toward lax, the landing strips are 1.9 miles from us. my son said \"daddy,what's that?\" i observed a large orange ball moving from south to north at approximately 2 o clock in the sky(65 degrees) i said,\" that's just a plane with a con trail\". the object then accelerated and turned brilliant white. i said \"oh no it's not, look!\" at this point the object appeared to \"blossom\"? bright white and then a spiraling vortex appeared with complete blackness in the middle. it looked very much like the spiral over norway in 2010, but on a smaller scale. then a bright white pinpoint like object came out of the center of the black hole and continued northward. this object had a solid looking white egg shaped cloud trailing it. rather suddenly the cloud turned a brilliant aqua blue color and the cloud seemed to envelop the white pin point of light that preceded it. cloud and object continued northward and began to fade,eventually fading out. this whole part of the process took about three minutes, which is really long, but we observed the object before it displayed any odd characteristics for at least 45 seconds to a minute. the blue aura remained after the object faded out, and eventually became indistinct at about 6:08.I had a cell phone without a video camera, just a still camera, and the phone malfunctioned repeatedly as i tried to take pictures of the vortex. eventually i got one still photo of the white pinpoint object after the vortex disappeared. there were multiple witnesses across the street and one of them captured some video. i have their contact info and they are willing to also share their experience.\r\n i waited over 24 hours to file this report because i took detailed notes last night and i wanted to do some research. none of the videos i have seen on youtube captured the spiraling vortex part of the phenomena or the initial brilliant aqua blue color burst. this event was reported on local news stations ktla,channel 5 and nbc$-la before 6:30, both reporting at that time that even norad did not know what it was. both lax and ontario airports were shut down briefly after this event. by 7:53 pm & maybe before the flight patterns over lax had been changed or diverted. by this morning(11/08/15) the navy said they had conducted a secret test and fired a three stage trident missile from a nuclear sub and detonated it over los angeles international airport, one of the busiest airports in the nation at 6:00 pm on a saturday evening,with no prior warning or notification. i spoke to a former navy employee today who informed me that this is not navy protocol, and it sounds like a concocted cover story. later today the navy stated that they had forewarned lax of military exercises and that flight patterns had been changed since mid week. i know this information to be false. i live about 1.9 miles from the landing strips @ lax and i observe the skies every night. flight patterns were not changed until after this event last night, sometime between 6:08 and 7:53 pm.\r\n this event was seen from san francisco to san diego. if the military was going to conduct secret explosions in restricted air space over the second busiest airport in the nation, why would they do it at 6:00 pm on a saturday evening, one of the busiest travel times at that airport? did they want everyone to see it? that's not very secret is it? why not on a tuesday at 9:00 pm? are military officials exploding bombs that open strange spiral looking vortexs and emit massive luminescent blue gas clouds over huge populated areas? if this was a secret missile test,it is certainly no longer secret and all the navy would need to do was release time stamped video of the missile launching from the sub. certainly they are in possession of such video if this is not a cover story,after the fact, for a massive multiple witness sighting of a truly extraordinary aerial phenomena.\r\n  finally, considering the proximity of this event to lax, i would expect that there would have to be multiple professional pilots who witnessed all or more of what i have described above and would hope that mufon attempts to locate these witnesses. as much as i hope no one possesses weapons that do what i describe above; i would be perfectly happy to be proven incorrect in my belief that this was and is an unidentified flying object sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

was christmas eve and we were sitting on top of my moms beat up oldsmobile on the trunk leaning up against the back windshield looking up at the sky. we were talking while our parents and family were inside enjoying the party. then we started to look straight into the distance, no longer looking upward and ad our conversation continued my neighbor noticed a red light inside my moms car. he was surprised that she had placed an alarm on such a beat up vehicle that wasn't even able to run. at that moment as we were both looking inside the car he turned around and froze while staeibg up at the sky. i tried to talking to him but he was jot reacting. at that moment i looked up above us and realized that the red light was in actuality a reflection of a giant craft hovering above us. the object was smaller than the roof of my family's 4 bedroom house, but larger than the car we sat atop. i would estimate it was around 20-30ft long and circular in shape. a dull grey colored saucer now hovered over us with a red circular light that shined down upon us. the saucer was close enough to us that i could have stood up on top of the car and touched it. there was no sound, and i knew i'd never seen anything like it in my life. we were unable to move. my neighbor and i were paralyzed, i couldn't scream or yell. i could however look around and see that my friend was not moving either, my eyes were able to move. at the moment i began to pray, as i was raised catholic and thru pure force i was able to disconnect myself from the hold that light had on us and the power was do great that i fell off the car and landed on my knees and hands. at that moment the light was no longer shining a bean on us and my neighbor was able to move, to which he yelled at me to run inside and get help. i ran towards the house, our front lawn was very long and before i reached the door the craft had begun to rise slowly. i was able to see a slight edge to the craft, and nothing else. i ran inside and started telling everyone that there was a ufo outside and that they should come look, but nonone listened. i ran back outside, because no one was paying attention to me and i didn't want to miss what it would do. i ran outside and my neighbor now stood next to the car directly underneath the saucer as it continued to rise high into the air. i ran inside again and no one once again listened, and at this time the craft was so far up in the air that it seemed the size of a basketball. finally my neighbor ran inside and told my family to come see an emergency. as everyone started to come outside the object was now the size of a star and as they stepped outside it sped out horizontally like a shooting star.","distance":"20 Feet or

seen this.  i just want the truth.  i know what i saw. i'm not crazy,    what is going on ?????    \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

the light was so bright like i never seen before.  my wife left to work i kept watching the. i went in my place got my phone came back took video and some photos then went back to my place and ever 10 minutes i would go out and look, not moving, last time i looked it moved farther but i still could see it standing still in the new location.\r\nobject looked big taking in consideration the distance and it was standing still.  then i went back to my place and i don't know what happened this took about an hour.  first i thought large star but it was too large then i noteced the red light in center.  also there was an airplane flying by so i was able to compare that this thing is stay still and not moving and big and way up there.  when i point my phone on it the camera did not show the red and green ray coming out of the object.  then i was able to see the shape of the object. my feeling is why the governed keeps denying, and why those who are flying this object don't try to contact us and trying to hide.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":72320,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5700242,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082015-0046","longitude":-117.7183383,"occurred":1446958860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1447008775000,"summary":"High

decided to lay down and look at the stars. all of a sudden we both saw what looked like hundreds of stars in a perfect triangle shape. the whole triangle where filled with the star like lights. it appeared to be in space. it looked exactly like stars in the triangle formation. the crazier thing about it was the fact the it crossed the entire expanse of the sky. almost as far as the north was from the south. the object would be the largest thing i have seen in my life. if it were here on earth it would easily cover a large city. it moved from east to west in about 10 seconds with no sound until it left our sight. if it was a ufo it had to be the master mothership. i have never heard any reports of anyone else seeing it nor have i seen anything else from other peoples sightings of something similar. we were 14 at the time and no one believed us.\r\n\r\nwe were in extreme awe and the first thing we did was get off the trampoline and run down the street trying to see it as long as we could. but it left our sight within a few seconds.
