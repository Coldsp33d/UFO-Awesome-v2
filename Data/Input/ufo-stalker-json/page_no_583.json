hope i can describe it.\r\n\r\nlast evening i left a friend's house in north central phoenix, heading home. when i got in the truck, i happened to look up, facing west. i saw something like i'd never seen before. the moon was low in the western sky, giving off a full-moon level of light, but the moon itself showed one thin vertical strip of light, that was it. as i backed out i looked i stopped and looked again (i should have gotten my friend). the strip of light was divided in half giving off two bright rays that shined down thickly to the left. black dark clouds were roiling over it, thick enough to channel the light downward and the light shined against more moving clouds beneath the moon. something seemed really wrong and creepy about that whole scenario.I felt it as i saw it, it was something i couldn't decipher, justify or even explain well.\r\n\r\na thick mass of clouds circled upward overcoming the scene. for a second the light of the moon around the mass of black clouds gave the impression of some type of portal, a clear and bright contrast between darkness and light. i even thought of cern. i also was thinking about how bold they've gotten dropping nasty junk on us from the air, i'd never seen anything this thick and active in chemtrails.\r\n\r\nas i drove it was behind me a few minutes. when next i was able to see it the light of the moon was gone. while there were no clouds distinguishable the whole lower sky to the west was bathed in darkness. a friend says he's seen nibiru with the naked eye, and i though \"if they can darken the sky this fast maybe they are trying to hide what's going on out there. if they can darken the entire moon in a few minutes... it was bizarre.\r\n\r\nthis morning i walked outside at about 5:30. the moon is up rising in the east ahead of the sun, right now. two bright stars are ahead of it in a straight line. it is a sliver, a crescent at the bottom.\r\n\r\nso i'm a little shaken up because what i saw to the west last night was not the moon.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":72310,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5712364,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082015-0036","longitude":-112.0933812,"occurred":1446924600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1446999248000,"summary":"Large

cluster of 7+ white/reflective obects heading from south to north. \r\n\r\nthe objects were twinkling somewhat, some blinking. at first i thought it was debris caught high up in a air current.  however, the objects were displaying up/down, angular/banking movents.  their moments were independent from one another.  \r\n\r\ni then thought they were seagulls.  by this time, i became very curious, and walked further out my back yard, to watch them straight on as they moved away from.  i focused on a few and saw that they were making steep banks from left to right, and some were just punching straight ahead moving up/down, but always as a group.  \r\n\r\nit was then i realized that they were not seagulls, because they moved to fast overhead, and the banks they were making moved to quickly across the sky to be birds.  i used telephone wires as a reference point, so i was able to observe their movements very well.  most of them simply disappeared as they headed north.  \r\n\r\nif they were regular objects i would have been able to watch them longer, and get smaller and smaller as they headed north. the last one i saw, before it disappeared, i framed up with a telephone pole and a wire, as an axis reference. it moved up and down, while moving away, casting a reflective/white light pulsation. \r\n\r\nit then simply disappeared.  all the objects disappeared, rather than moving ahead with their the average speed i witnessed.  \r\n\r\nthese objects were crafts.  not one doubt in my mind.  as a personal side note, i am educated (law school) and a professional.  i rate

appeared to be the brightest star i had ever seen. i live out in the \"high desert\" of mojave, ca within 10 miles of edwards air force base where many jets of unusual characteristics are seen, but this star made no noise as it grew in size from a normal size star in the sky to about 10 times that size. it was so bright (sun like) that i couldn't look at it for very long. it traveled very slowly (slower than any airplane can) going north west from first sight. it slowly left a sort of milder glow emanating from its' path and left that glowing oval trail that remained like a smoke cloud for at least 1/2 hour. the milder glowing oval was about 10% of the brightest portion of the \"star\". the \"star\" then reversed direction traveling again slowly towards the south east. the entire path (left to right reversing from right to left took about 15 minutes. i couldn't take my eyes off this spectacle and am convinced that this was truly something \"not from mankind\" because 1) it made no noise, 2) was so slow that even a hovering craft would have moved faster, 3)emitted an extremely large glowing oval surround that was enormous and many, many times larger than the bright glowing \"star\" like initial shape, 4) reversed direction going back to the place in the sky where i first saw it.5) disappeared in a second (at the end).\r\nonce the bright spot finally went out (away), the softer glowing oval remained in the sky, slowly diminishing taking about another 1/2 hour to disappear.\r\nthe entire incident left me with conviction because i see many \"different crafts\" in this

large yellow/orangeish fireball with a large tail falling from the sky at a 45 degree angle, it was moving very slowly if it were a meteor. as it fell it light up my entire property. i regularly watch meteor showers, and have seen many fireballs, and meteor before, this was far slower, brighter, and a different color than anything ive ever seen. right before the object fell i was shinning a very bright green laser pointer into the night sky, and i thought to myself wouldn't it be weird if something in the sky reacted to my beam, and as soon as i had that thought, the fireball appeared. because of this coincidence, the appearance of the object startled me, and watched it as it traveled through the sky and vanished behind the treeline. within minutes of this sighting i saw several white streaking meteors, in the same general area, but coming from the opposite direction. i don't know if there is any connection between the white light object witnessed the next night, but i thought i would include it in the report in case there have been similar events witnessed by others.\r\n\r\nnow on to what i saw that led me to file this report. last night, my girlfriend and i were out chopping firewood. it was around 5-6pm, and it was dark out, and it was overcast and raining. as we were getting ready to go back inside, i heard a strange whooshing sound, kind of like a strong breeze through the trees, though it didn't sound quit right, and the air was very still. it was different enough that i took notice of it. right after we heard a noise all five of our dogs started growling and barking, and ran towards a stand of overgrown christmas trees on our property. they kept barking for a couple of minutes until we called them back. we then gathered the rest of our tools and made our way back to house. after we got inside and took off our raingear, it was a little chilly inside so i grabbed a couple of logs and put them in our woodstove. i noticed that we didnt have enough wood for the night so i put my coat back on to go get some more firewood. as i walked outside i heard the same whooshing noise as i did earlier only a little louder than before, again i thought it was odd, but didnt think much of it. i made my way back to where we had been chopping wood, and filled the baskets on my atv with firewood, hopped back on my atv, and just then i noticed our german shepherd in front of me, she was looking to the sw and growling, as i looked towards the direction she was looking i saw a very bright white light about the size of a basket ball, it was bright enough that it was uncomfortable to look at. the light startled me, at first i thought maybe it was a neighbor pointing a floodlight at our property, but quickly realized that wouldn't have been possible as we have a really thick tree cover surrounding us, and we have never been able to see any of our neighbors houses, or lights before. the light was just to the left of a cottage on our property, and a few feet below the peak of the roof. the cottage is on the top of a hill, and behind the cottage the hill drops by 100ft or so down to our property line which is lined by a thick row of very large fir trees. i could not tell how close the object was to me, it could have been behind the small walnut trees to the right of the cottage, but glowing bright enough that i didnt see an outline of the branches it was glowing through, or it was in front of them. i feel like it was behind them, the tops of the trees leaves have fallen off, so you can see pretty well through them. when i realized that the light was indeed on my property, i had a sudden rush of fear, and sped back to the house. when i got back inside i told my girlfriend i had seen a bright light, and before i could continue describing what i saw, she said \"you saw the light?\". i asked her when she saw the light, and she told me that when the dogs were barking earlier when we were chopping wood, she saw a light up in the christmas tree stand across from us. she thought it was odd, but decided it must be the neighbors. i then explained where i saw the light i saw, and how large it appeared. she said the light she saw was much smaller but moving through the trees. at that point i said we should go back out side and check it out. while she was getting her coat and boots on i went outside and sat on my atv, as soon as i sat down, i heard the whoosh sound again, and the sound intensified, then faded away. by the time we got out to where we saw the lights, they were gone. we drove around the perimeter of our property and saw nothing. i drove back to where we were chopping wood, and explained to my girlfriend where i saw the object, and she showed me where she say the object. \r\n\r\ni went out this morning to take pictures of where the incident took place and drew glowing dots on the photos approximately where they objects we saw were.  what startled me when i looked at the area where my girlfriend saw the light, was that the light must have been in the middle of the canopy of the christmas tree stand, the canopy is so dense you can not see through it. \r\n\r\nso thats my report, i am sorry if it is a little long, and not very exciting, but i wanted to give as much detail as i could while it was still fresh in my mind.

low maybe 100 feet altitude flew almost directly but not quite over the surfs edge.The object size i can only describe that if you held a dime straight up over your head it would be about 3/4 the

","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At about 6:45 pm my buddy and i saw lights to the left of highway 80 last night while driving towards auburn ca. we were coming from nevada. it was well above auburn, but i am not sure of exactly where we were, certainly above colfax.\r\n\r\nwhat was observed was definitely over the hills.\r\n\r\nit was much more intense and strange than the one reported in san diego but occurred at about the same time. the one reported in san diego looks like the upper point light source.\r\n\r\nit started as a single extremely intense point light source where the emitted light turned into a cone then in maybe ten or twenty seconds later another more diffused light source formed below it, at maybe a 30 degree or so angle to the left.\r\n\r\nwhen forming the cone from the upper light, the light seemed to move slowly outward, taking a few seconds. it didn't just turn on like a flashlight light.\r\n\r\nthen the two light cones met in about the middle, the one from the point source, and the one from the diffused lower light source, met in the middle between them. the two light cones were well defined and seemed to be confined into cones. the upper light looked like a high flying point of light, almost like a search light while the lower originally looked like it was coming from the ground or above the ground. i first thought it must be coming from ground level but later realized it was coming from above ground, in what seemed like empty space. the lower light source was more diffused, not a single point source, but like a soft parabolic shape with the opening pointing towards the point source above it. there was no light pointing in any other direction, just confined to a parabola. hard to describe since i have nothing to relate to. it was directed towards the upper light.\r\n\r\nthe thing is that the light beams were confined and as the upper point of light moved away, the light where the two cones of light interacted seemed to stay as a diffused light source in a mist. it was like a glowing cloud of light that slowly diminished as the upper light source moved away while still giving off a directed light that almost looked like a search light, but not quite, pointing down at maybe a 20 degree angle from vertical.\r\n\r\nafter the interaction between the two light sources, during which time the point source was stationary, the upper point source moved from left to right over the freeway, at quite a distance, and continued going until it disappeared into the distance, taking a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nthe light seemed to be controlled and where it should have diffused, it was contained in a defined shape and got narrower rather than wider in a parabola.\r\n\r\nwhere the upper and lower light cones connected, there was what looked like a toroid of light, not just the two lights hitting one another, but like they were interacting in some way and the toroidal light seemed to emit even more light. it was like the two cones of light hit one another and interacted in what would probably be a circle if it was observed from either light source. it just seemed to interact at the edges of the cones, but not in the area of the formed toroid. it was just the edges that interacted.\r\n\r\nwe pulled over and there was another gentleman who also saw it. didn't get his name and just talked about reporting it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

being shot off for the utah pioneer day.  we were looking out west toward utah lake in orem utah.  we had only been outside laying on the grass for a few minutes before right above our heads appeared a winged like craft with small exterior lights all over it.  the lights were not emitting light projecting in front of the craft but were there and looked like some kind of lighting pattern?  the craft was completely silent as it flew over us and was just above the cotton wood trees were we were laying looking up at the sky.  the craft moved to the north very slowly as if it were observing us or wanted us to observe it.  after this thing passed over us, my brother and i looked at each other with stunned faces and ran inside as fast as we could.  our parents didn't believe us and we never talked about the incident again...Until about three weeks ago my brother and i are talking on the phone because i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 98 and he has recently been diagnosed too.  after talking for awhile about our ms and experiences with it, i suddenly had this vague memory pop into my head from that time in 1993 and decided to find out if my memory was serving me well or if i was remember something that didn't happen because i was so young.  nathan being older than me by two years said, \"no i was there too and you did not hallucinate that. we saw it together!\" about a week after that, i am randomly looking at google news and see a report about a ufo from ohio kentucky border that looks exactly like what we saw back in 1993.  i thought i was going crazy because i have never seen this ufo again since that night until now and after we talked about it and both have ms. i am wondering if this is a government craft emitting some kind of charge or something that made it so my brother and i now both have multiple sclerosis?  what is this thing and has anyone else seen this over the last 30 years?  any info would be great, thanks!","distance":"101-500

with a spotlight. then,we noticed there were actually two spotlights shining out and that the object was hovering very slowly and was completely silent. we rolled down the windows and turned off the car and headlights to listen. we heard nothing. we also noticed a large cloud-like oval shape in the sky to the left of the object that glowed a light blue. the entire sky was clear with stars and there were no other actual clouds anywhere. the object went behind the trees and the lights were not visible; however, the glowing misty cloud remained, but was slowly fading and dimming. after waiting a minute, we decided to get on hwy 89 and head back toward truckee. we drove about a mile or two and could still see the glowing oval cloud in the sky and then we spotted the object in the distance going west. we pulled the car over and got out to take pictures with a professional camera. as the pictures progressed, the object with the spot lights sort of dissipated as it continued to move west until it was out of view behind the mountain range. we took long exposures of the two objects so it would be clearly visible in the pictures (more than what the naked eye can see). the oval cloud remained in the sky and continued to fade into nothing within the next 15 minutes. it was definitely one of the strangest things we have ever seen! we were in awe. we continued to drive to donner pass rd. and drove to the lookout parking lot before the bridge to observe the night sky for a while and it was completely clear with stars visible everywhere. the strange glowing cloud was
