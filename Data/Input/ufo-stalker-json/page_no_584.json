dropping my boyfriend off at work. on my way home, driving west bound on foothill blvd. i saw three bright star-like objects forming a triangle and moving eastbound. i turned into a side street to get a closer look. at a closer look they appeared to be airplanes but they traveled at exactly the same distance apart form each other and retained distance. this seemed odd but i continued to drive home which at this point was only about 7 minutes away. while pulling into the drive way into my apartments which faces north, my younger brother (9 years old), in the backseat, noticed something in the sky, and given the past weird situation was incredibly enthused. i looked up, expecting to not see much since the three lights we saw earlier probably had his senses a little too heightened. when i did look up a noticed an very big, very bright light in the sky above the roofs of our apartment buildings. i was a bit awestruck. after pulling over to the side i got out of my car and attempted to record it. it was bright and i could not exactly tell what the light was coming from, but the light itself appeared to be cone shaped, except the part of the cone that would be a circle was instead an elongated oval. the oval part of the light was positioned vertically. initially i took it for an airplane with a searchlight, but the light was not facing downwards it was facing out, almost at a southeast direction. my brother also noticed what seemed to be a \"star\" like figure but which was moving southbound. i thought it was a plane but it had no red flicker light like planes usually do and  it seemed to be higher than a plane would be. it also moved incredibly slowly. i lost sight of this incredibly fast, being too fascinated with the greater light(which in direction to the \"star\" like figure was to it's right)i was able to acquire a video of it with my phone, but by that time it was beginning to fade out. while videoing, i also noticed there was what seemed to be a green fog (but with the light from the unknown object hitting it, it seemed more like green light)next to it. the more the light faded out, the less the green showed. the bright light was visible for about 30-40 seconds total during which it seemed to fade out into a fog, expand a bit, and then disappear completely. once it disappeared, i ran back to my car, parked it and ran back to the sight. the light was completely gone but as i looked up i noticed the green fog still lingering. it looked to be an almost transparent green cloud of mist. i never saw the mist leave, for i ran up to my apartments in hope to search and find any other similar findings that may have been reported that same day.","distance":"101-500

with a broom at my home at trinity drive, menlo park, ca my wife came out of the house with my 3 year old son, and said, \"okay, we're ready to go to dinner\" and then she immediately said, \"honey! what is that thing in the sky!?\". i looked up and was instantly amazed at what i was looking at. the 3 of us watched it in awe for several seconds before i pulled out my iphone 6s from my pocket and captured the following video: https://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=ll23lvbm-vo \r\n\r\nat the first moment i looked up and saw the object, a very bright white/blue beam of light emanated from the rear of the object and it shined through the center of a cone shaped cloud of light (maybe 60-70 degrees in angle from the source craft towards the rear). the cone shaped cloud of light was much brighter to the naked eye than it appears in my iphone video. it was white with a slight blue tint to it and a clear demarcation point at the edges of the cone. the main beam was more blue in color than the cloud around it and the light beam close to the craft, at the source, was bright white. very bright white - much brighter than commercial airliner landing lights. there is always lots of air traffic over my house for both sfo, sjc international airports and a host of smaller/light aircraft from the nearby local municipal airports. as i have seen ufos before, i am always careful to observe the sky and can easily discern conventional aircraft from non-conventional aircraft. this was a non-conventional aircraft. i did notice smaller aircraft in the vicinity both before, during, and after the incident. surely, a couple pilots noticed this phenomena.\r\n\r\nfrom the first instant i observed the object to the moment the bright light extinguished, the intensity of the light was slowly dimming. it was the most brilliant when i first noticed it and then became slowly \"dimmer\" as the object traveled in a north western direction until the light finally softly died out. once the bright light source died out, the trailing white-blue beam and the large \"plasma-like\" cone-shaped cloud remained glowing and very visible for a few minutes. the craft itself was also still visible as a dimly glowing object. again, no blinking lights or conventional aircraft lights. the shape of the craft was difficult to discern but my best guess was a triangular shape. no visible wings/tail structure could be observed and there was absolutely no sound. the craft seemed transparent or translucent with only a faint glow around it. i assume it was cloaked. my wife and i tracked the craft across the sky for several minutes until we could no longer see it. the craft's course did not seem to change.\r\n\r\nthis was the 3rd ufo sighting i have witnessed in the past 10 months and the first time i have reported a sighting. this sighting was the most profound i have witnessed of the 3 i have seen and it has strongly impacted me psychologically.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

came inside for a while then decided to sit outside because it was a beautiful clear evening.  i had my binoculars with me to look at birds. i observed a bright light hovering in the south, way brighter than a helicopter, larger and with a flamelike glow. at first i thought it was an aerial show for some event.  i observed other aircraft in the proximity in near miss flight paths but due to my viewpoint could not gauge the depth of field and since they were much smaller i assumed they were more distant than this object.  it was doing a slow but clumsy looping flight. i must say i thought this had unusual flight characteristics so i looked at it through the binoculars several times but could not detect any shape just flamelike light. it moved off in the distance and left my field of view, so i sat down to look at stars.\r\n\r\nfor quite a while i was looking at stars to the east, especially the pleiades. i was enjoying the beautiful dark sky view due to the exceptionally clear conditions and the power outage. i also observed every helicopter and fixed wing aircraft through my binoculars which i would describe as normal abundant san diego air traffic.  i often observe the abundant military aircraft in our area and say a thank you in my heart to our brave military, police, and firefighters.  i like to see our beautiful san diego \"fire one\" red helicopter and the miramar osprey and fighter jet flights. that is to say i frequently observe aircraft through my binoculars and i know what they look like. \r\n\r\nnow i began to feel cold and turn back to go inside about 6 p.M.  that is when things start going off the charts. i see a large slow moving object trailing a flamelike projection. i know it is the same object i saw before but much closer. in fact it is so close and big and silent, i think it is a drone. so i look at it through binocs. hey this isn't a drone, not a copter, plus it is trailing flame plus a bright blue light cone. now i think it is a rocket and i get scared...I start snapping pictures with my phone.  as an engineer, part of my brain is telling me rockets can't fly this slow and with no sound, but still i am trying to observe and note every nuance. i am toggling between binocs and phone, snapping a series of still photos.\r\n\r\nnow the object begins directing a bright beam of light, brighter than any search light, back and forth and the beam comes right at me and causes me to put down binocs, yell, think about hiding, but i feel it is my duty to just watch and snap pics.  at this point i am yelling to neighbors down the hill or anybody \"can you see that?!\" \"what is it?!\"  i want to call 911 but hesitate. i text my husband to call me because i am looking at a ufo. as the light intensifies i text him \"call mufon call mufon not kidding!\" then it explodes! only with no sound only light and a concentric light ring like a blast wave surrounding the most hypnotic iridescent aqua blue diffuse light cloud, easily three times the size of the moon.  now i call 911 and it is pegged busy.  i can hear neighbors in their yards.  i hang up, are you kidding me, they are busy?! i text my husband that 911 is pegged so this is real!\r\n\r\nnow sheriffs 911 responder calls me back so i describe what i am seeing. i tell her all the above plus that the power is out. she tells me everyone all over the county is calling but i am the first to report power outage.  she is asking me if it looks like a rocket and if i see any debris falling to ground. i'm describing details plus my viewing conditions (elevated hill with 360 views). i say i'm an engineer and if you can get a rocket to stay aloft at that slow speed, i want to know what your technology is. i am describing this huge luminous aqua cloud residue that is not dissipating just hanging in a perfect diffuse circle.  i ask her if she thinks it could be chemical.  i know i am not speaking to a person with the same technical background i have. i begin to feel bad about tying up the bandwidth so i reassure her, no debris, no injuries, no fire on ground. so i hang up and watch the cloud until it stops glowing, continue to take still photos.  i finally think of video, but by now the event is over. i keep watching the area for air response or reconnaissance. nothing. no responses. usually they send heavy air response with searchlights for fugitives and aggressive air response for any suspected fire because of our high fire danger. nothing.  now the power comes back on and jolts me out of my skin, approximately 6:20 p.M.\r\n\r\nlater i see on the news that this is already explained as a confirmed drill by the navy on behalf of the faa. not buying it. why:\r\n1. you do not explode a device over civilian airspace for a drill.\r\n2. 911 operators did not inform callers of drill in order to clear emergency lines.\r\n3. object had flight and light capabilities well exceeding normal parameters, namely stable silent low speed flight, and light candlepower way above sodium or any searchlight plus light control of the shape of the beam.\r\n4. you cannot have a soundless explosion with glowing diffuse residue that hangs in the air in a perfect circle with no odors, no drifting and having the brilliant color and luminous properties covering a diameter easily 3 times the size of the moon and stable for 10 minutes.\r\n5. the flight path prior to explosion can only be described as rogue, almost playful, but not purposeful like a drill.\r\n6. if this was an faa drill, where is the faa response? we have enough assets in this area to mount a massive response and they are good at what they do. no sirens no nothing.\r\n\r\nif any of the noted capabilities are in our grasp, i pledge to complete an advanced physics degree and work for the nsa or nasa for free for the rest of my life on behalf of humanity.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

my patio looking at the sky. the sky was clear and cloudless. it was after dark. first i noticed the beam, then a very large, round mass of blue-white light/mist appeared in the sky directly above me and hovered momentarily. there was a strong, bright beam of light coming from the front, pointing into the direction it was moving.  the beam  widened as a flashlight does and swept from side to side, slowly. the mist obscured whatever it was from view, and i could see the mist rolling away from it,  as it passed over the house. it was completely silent. it continued into the west, leaving behind an electric blue cloud of mist. we could see it far into the distance, though not clearly. the beam of light appeared to be directed downward as it continued west until it disappeared from sight. i thought it was a ufo because i am 58 years old and have only once seen anything else that resembled it, and that thing i believe to have been a ufo. i was curious. i called to my husband to come see it, too. we went to the front of the house so we could continue to watch it, which we did until it disappeared into the distance.  i called my neighbor who also saw it and also believed it to be a

like figure was to it's right)i was able to acquire a video of it with my phone, but by that time it was beginning to fade out. while videoing, i also noticed there was what seemed to be a green fog (but with the light from the unknown object hitting it, it seemed more like green light)next to it. the more the light faded out, the less the green showed. the bright light was visible for about 30-40 seconds total during which it seemed to fade out into a fog, expand a bit, and then disappear completely. once it disappeared, i ran back to my car, parked it and ran back to the sight. the light was completely gone but as i looked up i noticed the green fog still lingering. it looked to be an almost transparent green cloud of mist. i never saw the mist leave, for i ran up to my apartments in hope to search and find any other similar findings that may have been reported that same day.","distance":"21-100

montecito. as we approached our vehicle, we noticed an orange glowing oval shaped object with a flat bottom coming from the east. we thought it might be helicopter, as it was flying at that typical rate of speed, although it had no blinking lights, and it was silent. when the object arrived directly over us, it emitted a bright white light behind it that looked like a spot light, which was approximately 25 times the size of the object itself. the light then became hollow and strongly defined on the outer edges, like a bubble. the back end then opened and it turned into a massive conical shape. from the  center of the cone a blue green haze appeared. the white light was foggy or misty in appearance with strayations through out. the oval shaped object turned white, and broke away continuing on it's path to the west. it never made a sound, nor did it accelerate or decelerate. i felt a little uneasy after the event, as i have had encounters and lost time in the past which i have never reported. we continued to watch the object until it was too small to see. my son captured partial video on his phone, but we were not able to get quality imagery to show what we experienced. i know that the military is presently diverting air traffic at lax for undisclosed reasons, so perhaps it was experimental craft or a rocket of some kind.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

conical shape with a blue green hue in the center. as the light on the outer edges of the light dispersed it was strayated in appearance. the light that it produced was accompanied by something that looked like mist or fog. the orb in its process changed from orange to white, and broke away from the conical light, and continued on its path to the west. it never changed its rate of speed. our

food4less parking lot in torrance, ca (cross-streets: sepulveda blvd/vermont ave)\r\n - walking through food4less parking lot with my friend chepo going back to his place.\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n\r\n - kept seeing rows of 4 lights in single file on our walk to food4less and  i automatically assumed they were helicopters they were so close to the ground at first, then i thought about it again because the lights kept showing up and then it occurred to me that these 4 lights made no sound at all, and i don't know of any aircraft that doesn't make any noise. silent fireballs.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n - some type of aircraft\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n - there were multiple rows of 4 lights that would fly in single file and then they split in all different directions once they elevated a little further up but were still visible with the naked eye. i looked everywhere to see where they were going and i seen the lights were being spit into the sky one by one, then they'd fly in 4's and then they'd split up and each one just disappeared. going up at a 90 degree angle. i'm sure many people saw these fireballs in the sky too, they were so close to the ground in the city! then when my friend chepo and i got back to his place, we could still see these lights except now they weren't in single file. it's as if they positioned each fireball in place to surround us. and when i mean \"us,\" i mean surround a whole state or something. it looked like they just parked their fireballs in their assigned coordinates, then when everyone was present for the meeting, it was a circle that my friend and i live within. then they migrated further and further away in all different directions. there were so many of them, i'm sure many people seen all these fireball lights in the sky\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n - it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!! i couldn't believe it because the year before i had caught another ufo in a picture  during the april blood moon!!!! this would be my 2nd time seeing ufo's if this picture is indeed what i believe it is...\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n - it just shot straight up in a 90 degree angle into the nothingness of the skies' cosmic interdimensional cavities. \r\n\r\n(i took many pictures but i lost those, however i still have the video i recorded that night. it's 3 mins long and attached!)\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

no moon. all i saw was these two bright, slowly pulsating lights as the craft moved out of sight, over the ridgeline. nothing more to add, i know what we saw. it definitely did not look like any aircraft that we are familiar with. just a short look, then it was gone. not too much later, at work, i ran into a neighbor and told her my tale. she replied with a story from her childhood, where she and friends saw silver, metallic craft in broad daylight in the same area. they got scared and ran home; nothing much more said about that sighting. they are out there and now after so many years, i saw one.","distance":"501 Feet -
