between 5:00 and 6:00 a.M. - probably closer to 6:00 a.M., and this witness would have been seeing objects very likely at the beginning of nautical (mid) twilight before dawn  (sun rose at 6:50 a.M. on 11/4/2015.)\r\n\r\nwitness was lying awake in her indoor hammock looking through west-facing window when she saw two silent objects moving (very fast) n to s at about 10 degrees elevation above/beyond a treeline some ¼ to ½  mile land distance.  sun was not yet risen; it was near the beginning of mid-twilight before sunrise.  she could see lots of stars, and found herself wondering about two objects that were quickly moving from n to s.  “what is that?” she wondered.  “why does it seem like ‘twinkles’ through the bare tree branches and on over to a treeline some ¼ to ½ mile distant?”\r\nbright, lighted (or reflected light) round (disc) form was following behind, at a slightly higher altitude, a lower, dark, oval shaped  object.  as witness watched, the upper, lighted object seemed to “catch up” to the lower, dark object.  with one directly above the other, the two objects seemed to stop/hover, very briefly, then the lower, dark object emitted a lengthy fiery flame out its rear (like an ascending rocket).  witness describes flame as 1.25 degrees in length in a somewhat rectangular shape, in other words, it did not seem to narrow down or “tail off” at the rear of the flame. dark object seemed to then separate slightly from the flame, and begin a slanted ascent as if to continue on south.  at separation, flame persisted for perhaps 2 more seconds before disappearing.  however, at this point, both objects simply blinked out.  duration of sighting is estimated at 8 seconds, or less.   witness comments that objects seemed “far off,” yet thinks they were not very far away, and admits that she has problems in spatial perception.\r\n\r\nexperimenting with 10 degrees, at various land distances ranging from 1 to 3 miles, and using ¼ full moon (.125 degrees) yields various possible actual sizes ranging from 23 to 35 feet in diameter.  these guesstimates re land distance may be way off, and the witness could only offer an apparent size estimate of the objects as bigger than a bright planet.  she compares the objects’ size to airliner climb-outs during take-offs from the airport some 2 miles land distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

they built for me, it was an exact physical replica of me, but they said that it would far surpass any and all other human beings on earth. they explained that the body has been enhanced through genetic manipulation, making the bones extremely dense, improving my muscular system which in turn would increase my speed, strength, and endurance. they then explained that my new mind would also be enhanced, allowing me to use the mind's full capacity. the new body was floating in what i could only describe as a cloning tube, but i cannot be

smoke a cigarette because i was unable to sleep. i observed a bright object that looked like one of the closer planets to earth in our solar system. i thought this at first because the object was stationary for a short period of time, was extremely bright and appeared to change color like some of the closer planets appear to do in the night sky. when i got half way done smoking my cigarette i began to notice the object was moving at a extreme rate of speed, doing maneuvers that no man made aircraft can do. at this time i actually slapped myself in the face because i did not believe what i was whitnessing. i quickly grabbed my iphone and began recording the ufo. i immeadiatly yelled to my girlfriend who was asleep to come outside and make sure i was not losing my mind. she soon verified the object was moving at a very high rate of speed in every direction and was just as amazed as i was. the object continued to move erraticly for the two hours that i stayed outside. the object would do the most extreme and most awkward maneuvers. it almost looked as if it were teleporting through the sky; doing loops, going back and fourth, up and down moving in all directions (north,south,east,west) very quickly. the object would all the sudden appear to hover stationary and then quickly begin doing these same awkward maneuvers. the object appeared to be flashing random colors of red, white, blue and green during the whole sighting. i am a u.S. army veteran and deployed to afghanistan in support of operation enduring freedom (oef) 2012-2013. during my deployment and my four years of service, i never witnessed any military or civilian aircraft that could move anything like this ufo. i was in one of the army's elite combat avaition brigades (cab) and was stationed on many different airfields all around the world that had the army's and air forces most elite aircraft. with that being said, i've witnessed every aircraft that our military has to offer in the night sky and nothing comes even close to how this ufo moved in the sky. i have about a five minute video of the ufo and i'm glad to share it with the public and to mufon. the video was shot on my iphone 6 and the quality is not that great. i had to zoom all the way in to see the ufo on my camera phone. i really wish that i had a top of the line video camera available to record this, but all i had at the time was my iphone. thank you for your time!

make it look like there was a hole in the sky.  i know that sounds strange but it's true.  \r\n\r\ni was living in racine and driving my daughter and her friend to a store in waukegan, il... it was a gorgeous day, the sky was a beautiful blue yet i was a bit irritated because the sun started to glare off cars and i forgot my favorite sun glasses.  so i had to wear the only pair that i had, peach ones that i'd left in the glove box.  i never liked them because i have high cheek bones and they cut into my cheeks but i wore them anyway.\r\n\r\nso we're on hwy 31 going about 50 mph just passing kenosha and getting to the border when i looked up and saw a very large oval shape, it was way up there and within it was a very dark blue background.  it looked as if there was a hole in the sky, a perfect hole of oval shape. \r\n\r\nthe best way to describe it is how it looks like when you get a hole in your pantyhose and you see the skin.  \r\n\r\ni looked away at other parts of the sky which were normal and then looked back and yep, it was still there.  it was way up and it must have been huge... i'd say 3 football stadiums across and was actually very scary as it did seem like someone had ripped a hole in the atmosphere and whatever it was was beyond that.\r\n\r\nthinking i might be going crazy i took my glasses off and gave them to my daughter.  i asked her to put them on and tell me what she sees...  she did and it took a few moments but she finally looked in the direction where i'd seen the strange phenonenom and said, \"i see a hole in the sky\".\r\n\r\nwhat's really weird is i was thinking about it the other day and tried to find those glasses but now they are gone and i don't know where they went... but still i know it happened... \r\n\r\ni'd never seen it before that and haven't seen it since.   i will admit i've had a couple strange things happen to me... i'm a survivor of some very horrible child abuse and sometimes i think there's someone (or something) who does watch over me.  i have pictures of orbs which i could sense in my apartment (which i'm sending to you) and once i had an orb the size of a quarter come right at me and then disappear, leaving me with this amazing feeling of unconditional love.  i tried to get into same mindset to have them come to me again but that hasn't happened since either.  \r\n\r\nbut i have to admit the hole in the sky was about the scariest thing i've ever seen...  you can call me and i'll talk to you if you need.  thanks...\r\n\r\n- lisa swanson   ","distance":"Over One
