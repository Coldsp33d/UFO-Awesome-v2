campgrounds. i am retired military having served with naval air, army artillery and air force.\r\n\r\nwe have never reported this event and i will relate it to you in as much detail as i can recall as it occurred some years ago.. we where camping and north/south lake in the catskill mountains in new york. the year was late 70s or early 80s. our campsite was adjacent to the recreation field and offered a clear un-obstructed view of the night sky. at approximately  2800 feet above sea level, this remote primitive mountain top campground had not electric hookups (no lights) and offered spectacular clear views of the night sky and stars against a velvet backdrop.\r\n\r\nit was late and all was quiet in the campground. we had a small fire going and my wife and i where cuddling close to the fire to keep warm. i had one of the short chairs you use on the beach with my knees up and my wife was leaning back against my knees as we both gazed at the sky above.\r\n\r\nit was not unusual to see satellites passing thru the sky on these nights. they could be seen like  bright stars which moves slow and steady across the night sky and we had seen many in the past. we were both silent taking in the night sounds when they moved into view.\r\n\r\nfrom behind us i saw what looked like two satellites moving in perfect unison across the sky at the exact same pace, side by side, and about 1 inch apart. i thought to myself this was unusual as i had never seen two satellites moving this close and in unison. i thought that perhaps this was some type of stereoscopic mapping of the terrain, either optically or perhaps radar 3 dimensional imaging to provide elevation information.\r\n\r\nwhen the objects where directly over head they came to a crisp stop and paused for about 10 seconds at which time the moved at a hight rate of speed, left and right, away from each other. their speed was such that they crossed the entire sky and disappeared over the horizon and from my view in a second or two.\r\n\r\nmy wife then asked me “ did you just see those two satellites take off in different directions?”. i jokingly answered, “i didn’t see a thing”. as we talked about it she asked what i  thought it was and i told her i had no idea and knew of nothing that could accelerate to the great speed instantly and traverse the entire sky in seconds.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

that my friend and i should run to the gas station for energy drinks to keep us up. it had snowed all week so got dressed and ready for the snow outside. we went out to my car and started driving down to the end of our street. i took a left onto the next street and drove for three blocks. as i was looking at the road and noticed a bright red flaming ball just above the houses in front of us. i turned to my friend and told him to look. we stared at it for a few seconds before i pulled the car over to the side of the road. we both hopped out of the car and got our phones and started taking videos. the flaming ball slowly hovered above the houses across the street from where we parked about 500 feet above the ground. there was no noise to be heard coming the sky and upon examination the lights that it was omitting were not like that of any airplane or helicopter i had ever seen. the object seemed to spin and hover across the sky and as it spun it blinked a yellowish white light. the light would blink about twice every second. after a few seconds i realized that the flaming ball was actually a spherical orb in shape but with a silver or blackish center. it hovered above parallel to us across the street heading in towards the east when suddenly it started to freak out. the orb started making circles and then darting off into different directions as it ascended higher into the sky. after about five seconds it stopped and then shot off like a bullet up into a hole in the cloud cover where we watched it go farther into space until it got so small it vanished into the darkness of space. my friend and i looked at each other phones to see who got the best video but we both had only recorded it for a few seconds before stopping the videos just to watch the orb but my friend had gotten a great video of the orb as it hovered across the sky. we watched the video he had recorded and zoomed in as far as we could to the object. as i watched my friends video i noticed a strange pattern with the movement of the lights on the orb. i put the video into slow motion and played it through. a darkness fell over me as i gathered together what i just saw. as i moved frame by frame through each part of the video i saw that object was spinning in a cirlce. i was able to determine this by the light that was attached to the orb. it turned with the spinning from one position to the next in each frame in a clockwise motion. i was looking at the bottom of some type of u.F.O. i'm still not sure what i saw but when i got back to my house i started to research what i saw. i found multiple videos online with the same flashing orbs as the one i had seen that day.
