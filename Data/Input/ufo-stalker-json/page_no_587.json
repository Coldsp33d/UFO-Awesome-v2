had spent the last few hours of daylight exploring the ancient ruins there, taking photos of the ancient walls/kivas and observing/photographing the many petroglyphs.  around 7:00p we started a campfire, ate, and sat back in our chairs to stargaze before the moon came up.  to note, there was no alcohol on-site (not even a single beer, we had actually forgotten to grab anything to drink at the last store/gas station, as we were focused on buying firewood and using the restrooms).  we observed satellites, planes, and had an incredible view of the milky way, in addition to seeing several shooting stars.  at approximately 8:00p, i saw what i thought was another shooting star (streaking from the west/north west to the north/north east), and called out, \"shooter!\" while pointing toward it.  expecting it to disappear before my girlfriend and friend could react/see it (they initially thought the same thing), what i originally thought was a shooting star (calling out \"shooter!\" like i always do when i see the flash of a shooting star) stopped on a dime and was apparently a round (or spherical) light (green and white, almost as if it was a fried egg with a green yolk and blurred white rim/border, but all of it was illuminated).  it immediately began to slowly descend straight down (from our perspective), then stopped/hovered, disappeared (it may have still been there, but the lights/glow faded into complete blackness), then reappeared a few seconds later in the same spot, held its altitude for a few seconds, and then continued to descend behind a ridge.  we have no idea how far away from (or close to) us it actually was, but size-wise, if the middle belt star in orion's belt was, say, golf ball-sized, then the object that we witnessed (once it stopped...Descended/disappeared/reappeared/descended behindthe ridge) was roughly bowling ball sized, relatively speaking.  it was also completely silent.  the whole encounter, from the time i called out and pointed, thinking it was another shooting star, to the time it ddisappeared behind the ridge was 10-15 seconds.  the three of us looked at each other, shocked, as none of us had ever seen a ufo, or anything even close to this before.  we didn't see it again, or anything else out of the ordinary, during the balance of the

(my wife has night blindness.) \r\n\r\na v-shaped aircraft flying in a straight line, nw to se. there was absolutely no sound. there were no lights, but i could tell that the lights from the ground were reflecting off of the object. it was grey/metallic in color, with several black circles on each 'wing'.\r\n\r\nfrom the time i first spotted it until it disappeared was less than a minute.\r\n\r\nfor as long as i remember i have taken an occasion to look to the stars. i walk out every night that it is possible to watch the iss fly overhead. i am not given to jumping to conclusions, nor to letting my imagination or emotions get the best of me.\r\n\r\nhowever, all that being said, on the night of november 3, 2015 @ 10:10pm, i saw something flying in the sky directly over my head. after checking into military stealth aircraft possibilities and/or drone possibilites, i have come to one conclusion: what i saw was highly top secret or not of this earth.\r\n\r\ni made a drawing of the object right away on my computer.\r\n\r\ni hope you can tell me what this is.\r\n

silently and smoothly. 3 minutes into the sighting it made the sound similar to the sound of something mechanical moving into place, and it eventually dissipated into the sky. or maybe it just moved

while working in the capacity of a police officer, myself (detective sergeant) and two other officers (both k-9 officers) witnessed several bright green lights in the sky.\r\n\twhile standing on wilson ave. and snyder on the boarder of campbell and struthers, ohio, witnesses observed 2 triangular shaped objects in the northwest sky.  witness b was the first to notice them and advised the other two witnesses.  all looked to the northwestern sky to see 2 seemingly equilateral triangular-shaped objects with lights at each angle.  the lights appeared to be an unwavering bright lime-green, with one light forward and the other two in the rear.  due to the limited amount of stars in the night sky, witnesses were unable to determine at this time if the objects were solid or not.  the 2 triangular objects were traveling at a very low speed from northeast to southwest.  the two objects were also traveling very close together.  at this time the 2 objects had crossed over the wilson ave. reference point when witnesses observed a single, lime-green in color, orb-like object following the same flight path, but seemingly lower than the other two.  at this time the two triangular shaped objects further crossed the mahoning river reference point, and began to spread out.  the lead tip light stayed slightly ahead while the two rear lights moved up and further apart, causing an almost straight-line appearance.  the lone orb-light object still trailed in the same flight path and slow speed.  \r\n\tas the object flew farther away, witnesses retrieved a pair of binoculars to view the objects.  all that could be observed were the lime-green lights, no structure or other characteristics.  the objects were observed in the same almost straight-line pattern until they traveled so far that they could not be viewed with the binoculars.  witnesses attempted to obtain pictures and video with their cell phone cameras, however due to the objects altitude and distance from the witnesses, the lower focal power of the cameras could not pick up the objects.  due to the single object being of the same characteristics of the lights that created the triangular shape then broke apart, all witnesses believe that there were seven object in total.    \r\nall witnesses agreed that they had never seen aerial crafts with these characteristics before.  all three witnesses have extensive law enforcement careers and all three are military veterans with extensive service time.  one witness is a current mufon field investigator.  it is also to be noted that the youngstown-warren regional airport/vienna airbase (1453 youngstown kingsville rd\r\nvienna, oh 4447) is approximately 14 miles north of the sighting.  this region is also a very busy travel route for commercial and military planes arriving and departing at youngstown-warren regional airport/vienna airbase and the pittsburgh international airport.  during the sighting, which lasted approximately 9-10 minutes, there were several commercial airplanes flying in several different directions and altitudes over the immediate area.\r\n","distance":"Over One

photograph the wonderful sunrises. on this morning i was surprised to see the object. it looks like a hang glider, but out there at that time how could a hang glider be up there so far from land. also i checked with the coast guard to see if anything unusual had been reported. nothing had . \r\nthere is nothing on the 2 photos i took at 7.26am , so where had this thing come from so quickly.
