States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This happened a cpl years ago and i was never going to report it. what brought me here to do so some two years later started off because of youtube of all things and i wasn't even watching ufo stuff to begin with. i watched a vid about mars because of some story i read on the net and the suggested videos off of that video reminded me of my experience so i googled the description of the object i saw to see if anybody else had ever seen what i saw because it was pretty unique and different from the classic cliche ufo sightings that are out there and sure enough, people have.  \r\n\r\nwhat i looked up was \"triangular, transparent ufo\" and it brought me to a guy that had taped one in night vision.  the one i saw had no lights but the one this guy saw did. but here's the kicker that brought me to this site to report.. to his naked eye, there was no visible lights but through his night vision camera, there were.  that made me think \"if i would've had night vision too, would i have seen lights?\"  his story gets explained away as a plane up high being re-fueled by another. but i'm a 1000% confident that that is not what i saw.  let me explain why.\r\n\r\nnow this happened super fast.  approx 10-15 seconds at most, but probably a bit less that that in all reality. prob more like 7-10 seconds. i went outside to smoke a cigarette around midnightish. i was facing the east. i was staying at my girlfriends house and i live more in the inner city where you can't see the stars so well due to city lights.  where she lives is still in the city (suburbs) but her block is really dark with no lit up street lights on it and the lights from the surrounding busier streets are kind of blocked by her house so you can see the stars a lot better than at my house. it stood out to me because i'd go outside to smoke at both places. i like astronomy and that sort of stuff too so i'll commonly just look up at the moon and stars and think about the cosmos or just stuff going on in my life.  i was looking almost straight up at a brighter star and fixated on it when all the sudden this really low, triangle shaped, transparent object flies under the star i'm looking at (i could still see the star through it). without being tracked on that star i don't think i would've seen it for obvious reasons (it was transparent). i tracked it with my eyes and it was moving due east. completely silent. for the first few seconds it was moving relatively slow but as it got to about a 60-70 degree angle, it all ofl the sudden tripled in speed and quickly darted out of sight. it seemed to sort of curve downward with the natural curvature of the earth and the house i was at at sits at a higher elevation than the surrounding area so i my prospective was good. no trees right in front of me to block my view and there's a building next door, and her front yard is higher up than the roof of that building. it's like you're almost level with the tree tops in the surrounding distance so i didn't lose sight if it until it was just a little bit above the horizon line. it wasn't huge but it wasn't small either.  probably the size of a golf ball in relation to the sky and the star fit easily inside of it with room for 15-20 more stars to fit inside of it. i've seen planes super high up in the sky. it was clear that this was definitely closer due to size and speed and even how the star looked in relation to it. i'd say 1000-5000 feet with 5000 being very extreme.\r\n\r\nthis sighting isn't extreme or crazy like the kind of sightings you see on tv (seems not worthy of reporting really compared to those) but the reason i'm going ahead and putting this on here is just in case other people in my area might have seen the same thing at or around that time or just seen it ever period.. it has been so long that my date of this sighting is \"approximate\".  it really was strange. i kind of stood there weirded out for a few minutes and once 15-20 minutes passed, i started even second guessing myself if i actually saw something, but in all reality, i know i did. i mean, i tracked the thing steadily all the way to the horizon for several seconds. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

norwegian that has been staying in thailand for a while. i am 33 years old.\r\n\r\ntonight i witnessed something strange in the sky where i live in cha am. i was out driving on my motorbike with my wife. when i was going to make a right turn going into the village where we live i noticed something in the sky up to the left. \r\n\r\nit was a light. i was driving so i had i had to slow down to figure out what it was. when i slowed down and looked at it i saw a flying object and it took off in very high speed going out in the sea. i coul see it gain speed then just vanish.\r\n\r\nthe object was a light and it happened so fast to describe how it looked like, but how it was hovering with no sound and how it took off was the most unbeleivable thing.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object it immediatley cought my attention cause i havent seen anything like it before. hard to explain. just got the feeling. and its strange cause i just felt like looking up to the left for som reason. as if something inside me wanted me to see it. cause it's not normal to look up and to the left when im focusing on taking a right turn.\r\n\r\nit didnt last more then 4-5 seconds but i know what i saw. im all shook up. i never seen anything like it. it was just like a movie and things i have seen on youtube. \r\n\r\nnow its rainging heavy here with thunder storms.\r\n\r\n\r\nalso there has been many small flights hovering over cha am tonight. they have been going back and forth like they are looking for something. \r\ni have never seen any flights hovering over where i live as long as i have stayed here. and i been living here for 11 months now.\r\n\r\nmy wife did not see it and i havent said so much cause she just laugh it off.Maybe because she is thai and its out of her beleif. i can't understand why my reaction was so slow to point the thing out so my wife also could see it. \r\n\r\ni was shocked after witnessing this. it is hard to describe when you actually witness something like that but i was pretty shaky yesterday. and i felt the urge to go outside for a walk and not stay inside. i spotted at least three small flights hovering over cha am where i live. \r\n\r\ni also had a wierd dream tonight.I'll try to describe it:\r\ni was fixing some batteries on my telephone in the living room. my wife was in the shower. as i sat on my desk working on the phone i heard this clicking sound. like a needle falling somewhere. then i heard it on the front door window. like something was clicking on the glass. as i turned my head and looked at the window there was a black shadow figure outside the window. like a black force of something. i shouted to my wife in the shower and the next thing i remember i woke up.\r\n\r\npeter\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

trip home is on a dark road surrounded by woods that's the main road between my town and the next. it was still early enough for there to be a small amount of traffic and up until this point there had been a pretty steady supply of cars. \r\n\r\ni keep a close eye out for deer because they're common in the area, so i was driving while scanning the sides of the road when some lights caught my eye. i didn't think much of it because the lights from my dash always reflect in my windows but i took another look because they weren't the usual reflections. i slowed down and kept looking and realized they were definitely outside of my car. up near the tops of the trees were three, stacked lights. two white and then a red on the end. they were just balls of light, circular and steady. \r\n\r\ni looked ahead, because i was still driving and swerving all over the road, and when i looked back they had moved into a triangle! at that point a car came up behind me and i started driving faster again and looked over and it was gone. i don't think the globes of light were big enough to carry any entities on their own, and it's possible the change of shape was just a trick of the eye.\r\n\r\ni can think of no reasonable explanation what kind of stacked lights would be flying through the trees in ct so here i am, despite the fact that i detest the notion of aliens. i couldn't think of anyone else to report this too because i don't think the police would be exceptionally helpful in the matter and i know i'm not crazy. it made me extremely nervous and i ran into my house and locked the doors as soon as i got home, even though it now sounds irrational in hindsight. it even made me nervous while i was driving, which is why i didn't just stop. i could easily have stopped and stayed in my car and watched, but for some reason it just didn't feel safe.

one evening i stopped suddenly to observe what would turn out to be a glowing & pulsating orb. i proceed to take action & took out my iphone to record & document this strange event.\r\n\r\nover the next year & a half i have recorded many of my observations in sa and i have seen orbs do amazing feats such as, changing into many diffrent colours, accelerating , decelerating, morphing into various aircrafts & manipulating the forces of nature in particular matter & light evan the weather around them.\r\n\r\nwhen reviewing my footage i have noted a signature of the orbs & other crafts. this unique signature involves three white lights that revolve around the craft like an electron & a proton would. in all the videos you can see these dots flashing in various patterns but more commonly always three, although i have seen many more in the same particular piece of space.\r\n\r\nin this footage you can see a huge ship open up a door with bright orange polymers that burn a very bright orange/yellow. the ship seems to be grey & black .\r\n\r\nit is interesting to note the green silhouettes that come out and seem to vibrate intensely, flickering around rather iratticly yet with some sort of ultimate purpose.\r\n\r\nif you look at the light post or lamp in the video you can see a glowing aura around it, then in an instant it swirls & seems to be vacuumed & channeled. it would appear as if it sends the light energy to another orb that burn yellow/orange, sending & receiving energy from an ordinary lamp post.\r\n\r\nwhat happened next stunned me, it would appear that a large hand or animated object moves past the vessel as if to be some sort of tool to assist & interact with objects. i appears to be a rather massive shadow.\r\n\r\ni can honestly say i feel privileged to have observed so much activity in this time & i still see them often around the space around my home in southern africa eastern cape.\r\n

from me was a large cattle pasture. now this is the country where all sounds could be heard and  any air craft flying at this altitude was never seen at all. while watching tv i saw a very bright light coming toward our home. my first thought was a plane was going to crash into our home. i ran to the window to see what it was. it was moving very slowly going north it was cylindrical and passing over the west side of my property line passing out of my view. i ran quickly to the north window the object was still moving slowly north at maybe 40 miles per our. it appears to be cigar shaped with 4 square windows visible to me. it was close enough to me that i could see the silvery interior than it just disappeared. wondering how it could have gone out of sight i ran outside and it was simply gone.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line
