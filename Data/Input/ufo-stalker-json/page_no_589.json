betsy ross bridge i noticed 3 yellow lights northwest of where i was in the shape of a triangle. at first i thought maybe someone had set off fireworks as the lights were brighter, more yellow and larger than i am used to seeing with the planes on their landing path to philadelphia international. i then saw that the lights were not moving and were in the shape of an equilateral type triangle. i then started to see the lights move. they started to move towards each other, almost as if dancing. in the time it took me to look back at traffic and back up, they were moving into the shape of a right triangle, and continued to move into an isosceles triangle. by this point i had tried to set up my phone to see if it could record anything, which \r\ni believe it did.  as i got closer to the local shoprite i thought it was over, it was obvious it was further away to the north and west, maybe over the delaware river.  a couple of seconds later the lights disappeared.  at this point i wasn't feeling anything besides the normal sense of wonder at what i had seen. as i continued on to the rest of my short drive home i was pulling up to the jughandle to get to my street and i saw them again, further north and west. as i was waiting for the traffic light to turn green i started to feel uncomfortable. i wanted to get home and get someone else to see the lights so i didn't feel so crazy. after i pulled up to my house because of the trees around i could no longer see the lights, i could hear a helicopter though.  i had to take a bag in the house and come back out for something, and when i stepped back out it was unnaturally calm in the area.  i could't hear traffic from route 130 or anything. as i grabbed what i came out for i could see the lights moving south through the trees. i also started to hear what sounded like snapping branches and footsteps through the leaves on the ground. i was terrified by this point and got in my house as fast as i could.  for the video, it was shot on an iphone 6, and i think i got a shot of it around the 11 second mark, but i could be

the distance i had never seen before. working here for 5 years i know the sky line like the back of my hand so i watch for abnormal things in the sky all the time. when i looked out i saw this very bright white light that seemed to grow brighter every few moments then dim a little. i thought it might be a visible star getting ready to blow or something along those lines. after a few minutes the ball of light flashed a little brighter and out of the white ball a small gold light ejected from it's bottom part. it almost looked like a spark coming off of it, but it traveled up just a bit and out to its left side from my direction of view. then the gold ball stopped there and turned a deep red color and wasn't as bright. i watched it for another fifteen or so minutes. the whole time both balls stayed in the exact same spot. the little red ball from time to time would flash a bright white light then go back to its almost a blackish red. the whole time my radio kept fuzzing out and going to complete static on a station i never have issues with. the whole time i was just mesmerized by it. i've only ever seen something like this when i was young so it was kind of exhilarating. it was still in the sky when i headed in from my break at 3:45am. i pointed it out to a co-worker heading to his car. he said the same thing, that he had never seen that before in the sky and he had been

cassiopeia, the crooked \"w\", and a little further east looking ne about 45 degrees, a bright yellow/orange glowing object slowly descended about 5 degrees, for about 3 minutes, remained stationary about 1 minute, began ascending and became orange, then red, loosing brightness, then faded and disappeared. \r\n\r\nbrightest magnitude was 5 - 10 times venus magnitude in the morning sky. also 5-10 times larger than venus at her brightest. could easily judge descent and assent on well star light night. one or two light aircraft with red/green marker lights and normal engine noise in the same general direction, observed other passenger jet aircraft with dim white strobe lights at cruising altitude in different directions. \r\n\r\ndo not believe this to be aircraft or helicopter traffic, never observed those with lights of these colors. distance difficult to judge. should note that i live not too far from lake erie shoreline, which does run nne. also, about 20 miles nne from my

long stretch of highway near a national wildlife reserve so it was very dark and no other traffic or lights from any homes or businesses   we noticed that an object right above the tree line to our left was flying next to us,  our speed was 65 headed west.  the object would turn all lights out fly ahead and over us (have the video)  swoop over the trees down to the highway level close to the back of my suv and start to turn all different colors and lights almost like it was trying to look like a car behind us. this went on for 10 to 15 miles and we would just watch and speed up then slow down just to see how they may be tracking us.  about half way through the 45-50 min ride home we noticed that it was two behind us and at one time possibly three.   the movement of all were very quick and rapid constantly changing colors and then shutting off all lights.   as we were getting closer to the town we past two highway street lights blinking red (because of the time of morning) and two caution yellow lights that were blinking ahead of the intersection to warn you to stop for the upcoming traffic light.   when the objects past these lights still behind us they would try to emulate the color and timing of the lights   as we moved away from the intersection we noticed that the two caution yellow blinking lights were getting closer and closer two us.  they were obviously trying to blend in and not seem as noticeable.   we saw one fly from the highway over the trees and flew extremely fast ahead of us,   when we made it up the road about two miles i noticed a red blinking light hovering to my left about 40 ft in the air and it was blinking like a cell phone tower about 100 yards away it just monitored us as we drove by.   we were now getting into town where there are  houses businesses and lots more light and street lights .   they continued to follow at a slight distance behind but still very noticeable for us to see all there rapid movements and color change.   as we were getting closer to the city and the street lights we noticed that not all but a good portion of the street lights were brighter than we've ever seen them before,  so bright that you couldn't hardly look at them  we were getting close to home  and the same activity around us was still going on we made note of a street lamp very close to home that we passed hundreds of times that was so bright that you couldn't look directly at it.   we didn't want to go home ( i guess we didn't want them to know where we lived or something) so we turned around and headed back in the same direction we came from and we didn't see them again and we also made note that the street lights that were so bright before were now back to normal and some not even on.  that was our experience,  i'm attaching photos taken from the trip.  i couple of the photos i changed the exposure on to see the image better.  none of the images were changed or tampered with.  the video was to large to load.  the last image was supposedly from nasa but the dates match up with mine so....","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

park down the street. while i was walking i was watching all the aiplanes and helicopters flying around. i live a 15 minute drive from downtown houston, texas so there is quite a bit of air traffic around here. it was a clear night, not a cloud in sight. i was making my way around the walking path, which is a big oval, when i noticed what i thought was an airplane flying pretty low and not on any normal course ive ever seen them flying. it was just the yellow/orange glow of the front light the planes use. i didnt see any flashing lights on it but the direction it looked like it was coming, i wouldnt have been able to see them until it got closer because it was coming directly towards me. after about 20 seconds or so i stopped walking because it didnt look like it was moving and i thought it might just be because i was walking that i couldnt tell. it had to be about a minute of standing there that i noticed it was not moving but just sitting there. i had my phone in my pocket and was hesitant of pulling it out because of how long it takes for the camera to start up on it and i didnt want to take my eyes of it. after about 20 more seconds of thinking about it i decided i was going to try to film it anyway but as soon as i went to reach in my pocket the light just dimmed out and nothing was there. it was just like the light shrunk until there was nothing there. so weird. i started my camera and stayed at the park for about 30 more minutes hoping to see it again, or anything else, but i didnt. ive lived here my whole 36 years ive been alive and i have seen every kind of plane, helicopter and even the new drones. this was none of them. the area it was over is an industrial area with chemical plants along the port of houston. the light was brighter than all the planes so thats why it stuck out to me at first. it also looked like it was coming towards me but then just stopped and sat there. im back home now and im walking the park every night hoping to see something again, this time with my camera.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

dimensional, like two big sheets of paper. that looked very unreal, because such an perfectly side by side flight, you can only see in movies with computer animation. i lost the sighting after the objects were passing our hotel, because i could look in the south direction, but not to the north.\r\n\r\na short moment before there was a plane flying from north to a southerly direction with
