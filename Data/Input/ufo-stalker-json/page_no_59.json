no. methane gas from a leach field? no.  laser beam light show? no   there is nothing in their combined 127 years that comes even close.  \r\ni believe they saw something based on their reaction that night, and continued amazement. i live right behind them. so they called right after it happened to ask me if i saw it, but was not home at the time. i could sense the concern and confusion in their voices.\r\nfamily relative of witnesses is an artist. the rendering of what they described. they said it this very accurate.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":89429,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.3364704,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01082018-0022","longitude":-73.71015050000001,"occurred":1510253100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1515454781000,"summary":"Ufo with green windows","tags":["sound","ufo","lights","flash","floating"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1515551151740,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":7,"maxtempi":45,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":0,"meantempi":32,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-8,"mintempi":18,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":7,"maxtempi":45,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":0,"meantempi":32,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-8,"mintempi":18,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"12804","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":60,"locationName":"Queensbury, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3493"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Caxias do Sul","country":"Brazil","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1. on the balcony of my apartment.\r\n2. i was watching new year's fireworks.\r\n3. building antenna.\r\n4. the light changed in intensity and blinked. suddenly it moved down, beyond my vision field.\r\n5. i was calm, trying to get the best object's picture.\r\n6. it moved behind a building and i didn't see anymore.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":89428,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-29.1634031,"location":null,"logNumber":"BR-01082018-0021","longitude":-51.1796683,"occurred":1514764800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"State of Rio Grande do Sul","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1515452631000,"summary":"Red light, circle format, sometimes it blinked","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo","timeZoneName":"America/Sao_Paulo","tweeted":1515551151466,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89428_submitter_file1__DSC05827.JPG"],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"95080390","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Caxias do Sul, State of Rio Grande do Sul","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3494"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Genoa","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Noticed loud aircraft noises outside and saw 2 aircraft rapidly zig/zag or figure of 8.  watched for ~15seconds before out of sight, but noticed flashing white, blue, green, red lights like a star but brighter in same region aircraft were seen.  got in car to go to top of ridge to observe as no towers or other sources we could think of for source.  car acted very strangely, would not start, was turning over well and would continue to turn over without hand on key in ignition.  newer (2014) vehicle, well maintained, kept in heated garage never with battery issues.  took different car which did start.  on stop of ridge observed object through binoculars, however still appeared too distant to see details.  could only notice rapidly flashing blue, yellow/white, green and red lights.  did not appear to be moving relative to horizon or stars.  no further aircraft observed.  returned home and noticed identical object/light pattern to south.  have never witnessed similar event in past, nor the aircraft that low in this area.  also have never seen pattern of flight aircraft were preforming.  continued to check but lights remained present for 2 hours.

it did not seem to change altitude while on its flight path. as i continued observing for the next few seconds the object seemed to move out to sea before disappearing into a huge cloud system.  the event only lasted 5 seconds at most, due to the high speed of the object. there was no loud engine sound apparent at the first sighting and none after the object disappeared. in my life i have witnessed meteor showers and have observed high speed aircraft in practice manoeuvres. i’ve never seen a flying object or any other for that matter move at this speed whilst in the atmosphere. the

day.  i was heading north on i-83 at 4pm (4:03) and noticed what can only be described as a 'gash-like wound' in the clouds.  i make a study for a hobby of mine of clouds and it was highly unusual.  there was a steady cloud cover of altocumulus clouds but in the center, running perfectly north to south was an exceptionally large elliptical gash in the clouds.  it tapered at the points.  the edges were frayed, much as skin would be, showing disruption.  the center wound portion had a clear series of lines as if the sky had be pulled in that way by a pendulum of sorts.  the closest thing i could find online about the cloud type was a 'fallstreak' cloud.  i'd estimate the gash to be approximately 15 miles long.  i have a compass in my car and it practically overlapped north.\r\n\r\ni mention this because nearly exactly 2 hours later i was going south on the same interstate, approximately 10 miles north of where i'd initially spotted said cloud. at this point, it was dark out and i noticed four lights, moving in formation very slowly across the interstate.  i should mention we live near an airport.  air traffic is very common in this area and i know what airplane lights look like, how they fly, etc.  these lights had no flashing lights, no red markers like usual. they didn't seem to fly so much as glide.  initially i thought they were helicopters as they moved slowly, but their formation remained perfectly aligned as they traversed over me.  i passed directly under them as i fumbled to get my phone to do video while i was driving. i regrettably did not capture video as i passed under them too quickly and was too startled to think.  i should have pulled over.  it was over very quickly and i couldn't see them again after a few minutes.\r\n\r\nafter i had passed, i was looking in my rearview and noticed off to my east a standard helicopter with normal lighting hovering about 200-400 feet over the treeline near reeser's summit. i assume it was observing the event.\r\n\r\nthe formation these lights had was odd as well, they were moving in a pattern that i can describe as sort of a crescent.  i enclosed a badly done ms paint illustration to show you.\r\n\r\nthese lights had a color value that was unusual as well.  a lighting reference i have for my hobby (which is game development) i know these lights were very low kelvin (around 2600-2800) and resembled medium wattage tungsten bulbs or sodium lamps.\r\n\r\nthey were surrounded by a haze or mist and in the center i could barely make out a square-shaped blue-white light.  my son also witnessed some of this.\r\n\r\ni should mention i am a highly skeptical person.  i've seen hundreds of weird things that i can usually explain away via rational thinking.  in this case though, i have no explanation.  if they were aircraft: they were perfectly synchronized, were circular, had no normal lighting system for an aircraft, flew very slowly for aircraft, and appeared seemingly from nowhere.  their color was so low of a kelvin it reminded me of a candle flame, as did the way they illuminated the mist around them.  these are not things i can ascribe to any aircraft, firework, or man-made object such as a drone.  the fact there were four moving in formation over an area that had the described 'gash' in the sky mere hours earlier seems hardly coincidental as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

(1/7/18) lasting for 30 - 45 seconds, and it's currently 7:00 a.M. the next morning (1/8/18). the sighting occurred roughly 12 hours ago.\r\n\r\nthe temperature was around 40 degrees fahrenheit, and there was a mild breeze. the weather was overcast: the clouds were low and completely filled the sky. the sky was slightly brighter than usual because of this, but not much. due to the amount of cloud cover, the stars were not visible whatsoever. \r\n\r\nmy sister and i were outside our house taking a quick smoke break (cigarette) to relieve our studies (we're both college students). i noticed a green light stretching horizontally in the distance across the night sky, but this was emitting from a tall building less than five miles away. this building is covered in green lights, and come nighttime it turns on and basically becomes a gigantic green light bulb. the clouds were low and this is a building over 30 stories high, so the light was illuminating the sky above it. the clouds were above the building, but they weren't more than 200 ft. above it i would presume.\r\n\r\nour house is on a corner lot with two streets intersecting at the northeast corner (one running along the north side; one running along the east side). we were watching from the backyard which is on the south side of the house, and we were facing west (the location of the light). we were just talking as we looked up at the green light. we kept looking at it because honestly we hadn't seen it before. it was a night consisting of weather/cloud coverage that isn't typical in the memphis area. after a minute or so, i saw this dark figure seemingly emerge out of nowhere above the green light. my sister doesn't have great eyesight, but mine is 20/20. i knew just from the sheer size of it that it wasn't anything man made, so  i pointed it out to my sister and asked if she saw it. even with her sub-par eyesight, she saw it immediately. it remained behind the clouds, but the light emitted from the building and into the clouds resulted in the ufo being exposed for a brief moment. the craft did not reflect any light. the craft might have come from the left side of the light or simply farther behind it, and perhaps i just couldn't see it until it was right above the green light. from my perspective, though, it looked as though it just materialized out of thin air within a couple of seconds. \r\n\r\nit was an oval-shaped, disk-like shadow sticking out like a sore thumb in the sky. when i say it was oval-shaped, it was, but the outer edges of the craft were thinner and it was thicker in the middle (i'll draw a picture of it make sure the shape is understood). it seemed to slightly descend when it first came into view, but then it stopped and remained stationary for a couple of seconds. slowly thereafter, it made its way across the sky - starting above and slightly to the right of the light, and proceeding to travel northeast away from it. it seemed to be traveling in a straight line, but it did appear to have an extremely minor downward tilt. if going in a straight line is considered 180 degrees, it was at 175. it was much larger than any sort of airplane or aircraft that i'm aware of by a long shot. it didn't make any noise, at least from where we were (probably 5-7 miles away). across the street that runs along the north side of the house, there is an abundance of tall trees in the front yards of the properties. the craft was at an altitude low enough for me to know that as soon as it got to the tree line, we wouldn't be able to maintain visualization with it. starting when the craft appeared, it only took about 30-45 seconds for it to drift out of site. \r\n\r\nthroughout the experience, i had an enormous rush of adrenaline rushing through me. it wasn't because i was afraid, but rather a result of seeing something i had never seen before. i've always suspected the possibility of ufos to be more likely than not, given the amount of sightings each year, but this left me without a doubt in my mind that they exist. \r\n\r\nunfortunately, we didn't take a video which is something i never thought i would forget in an event like this, but my sister and i were both basically in shock while watching this. when i realized it was about to be out of sight, i snapped out of it and told my sister to record it, but she didn't get it in time. she got a photograph of the sky that shows the low hanging clouds and the green light, but the ufo in reference was behind the trees before she got the picture off.  there is an odd-looking gray mass in the photo, but i'm not sure what that is. we didn't notice it until we looked at the photo. using the photo as a reference, though, i can say very confidently that what we saw was many shades darker.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

sudden there was a blackout due to power cut in our locality. i have a rooftop apartment. i got up from my desk and moved out on to the roof to look around the extent of power cut. it seemed that the power was out only for a few blocks around my building. there is a multi-storeyed building opposite to my vantage point. an unusual glowing red light attracted my attention over the terrace of the building. it appeared like warning lights for planes like the ones they have on tall towers. it did not make sense on such a low altitude. i kept looking. the light slowly started to ascend vertically up. it was quite dark and so i could only see the movement of the light. i thought somebody might be testing their drone cameras or something. didn't pay much heed. after rising a meter or so the light just went off, disappeared. since it looked unusual somehow, i took out my cell phone (motorola moto e2) and pointed its camera towards the sky. few seconds later it showed up in the sky at the same altitude but between my vantage point and the building where it appeared. it came quite close to my vantage point. hovered there for two to three seconds then disappeared momentarily and reappeared again just above the same spot where it disappeared. i thought to myself that a drone doesn't fly this quick. it went off again and then reappeared at a spot perpendicular and what appears to be 50 to 60 m apart from the last location. hovered there for a while and then disappeared again. i got it on my cell phone and kept pointing it towards the sky and waited for it to reappear. few seconds later it reappeared again above the building where i spotted it first hovered there for few seconds and then flashed a green light. after that it immediately descended and disappeared. i kept recording hoping it would show up again but it didn't. a minute or two  later the power came back. i did come out later in the night to check whether i could spot it gain but to no avail.
