really up-close ufo this evening at 5:15 pm est over littleton, massachusetts by the groton / littleton route 119 exit off interstate highway route 495 (which runs north / south) ?????????...\r\n\r\nyes! ... three of us saw a ufo this evening at dusk time, in littleton, right before the sun set in the west. ... it was as close as 100 yards away, flying right over the new littleton police station on route 119 (which runs east / west), near the brand new demoulas market basket supermarket plaza on route 119, near littleton center! ... \r\n\r\nmy sister's boyfriend (who saw it first, and pointed it out, as he was standing in a westerly direction), myself, and my lifelong friend, were standing in my sister's driveway when her boyfriend said: \"wow! ... look at that! ... what is that?!\" ... my friend and i immediately looked up into the western / southwestern sky, and we all saw the exact same thing at the same time! ... it was a ufo !! ... \r\n\r\nit was flying no more than 100 feet, if that, over the tree lines on the southern side of route 119, heading west. ... the object was heading from the northeastern sky towards the southwestern sky just before sunset. the sun was shining on it from our left, in the southwest, as we looked due west. ... \r\n\r\nit came from out of nowhere! it made no sounds, at all. it was internally illuminated, colored a very bright white in the center. all around the perimeter of the object, it was surrounded by a fine bright metallic blue band of bright light. it was oval-shaped, but not perfectly oval-shaped from our vantage point. also, it was moving very fast !! it left no vapor trails or exhaust fumes behind it. it cast no shadow on the ground. it made no normal aviation type sounds that a jet, or an aeroplane, or a air liner, or a small propellor plane, or a weather helicopter, or a military chopper might make. nothing! no sounds! it zipped across the sky, coming from, virtually, out of nowhere! the whole perception of it, for all three of us, only lasted between two and three seconds, at the most, but that was enough to get a very good look at it. also, it appeared to be descending, as if it intended to land somewhere off to the southwest in a farm field in one of the western farms that run along both sides of route 119 on the west side of highways 495. ... \r\n\r\nit was right above the tree line! ... \r\n\r\nwe all thought it was going to crash, and we were expecting to hear a loud bang, and possibly see flames and smoke. ... \r\n\r\nbut just then, something really weird happened that none of us have ever seen before (and i have seen a ufo now, after this, for the third time in my life): instead of the bright, silent, wicked fast, descending, oval-shaped, and internally illuminated object crashing to the ground over and past the trees nearby the new, littleton police station, the object, amazingly, split apart into three separate flying round, white, oval lights with a blue tint around the perimeter, and in formation, these three objects all continued flying / zipping / floating / gliding / piercing west through the sky over the tree line by route 119, and then totally disappeared from our sight! ... \r\n\r\ngone! ... into thin air! ... \r\n\r\ndid they land? ... did they crash? ... did they change direction on a dime? ... did they hover even closer to the ground? ... did they zip off to the south or to the north behind the trees and beyond our sight so fast that we could not see them change direction? ... or, did they zoom up and out of our lower atmosphere instantly and so fast that the human eye cannot detect the exit path of their motion?! ... \r\n\r\nwe do not know! ... but, we do know this: we all saw it at the same time. we saw it appear from, apparently, out of nowhere. ... we saw it split into three separate ovals or spheres. ... lastly, we saw it then totally disappear beyond the tree line without a trace! ... it was real! ... did

went through the lake highlands baptist church parking lot, at the intersection of northcliff drive and parkhurst drive. \r\nthis church is about 1-mile northeast of white rock lake in northeast dallas, texas. \r\ndirectly to my southwest, about 20-degrees above the horizon, were about twelve orange lights, forming about six distinct pairs. \r\nthe lights were each uniformly as bright as a full venus, but were pure orange in color. \r\nno faa aircraft navigation colors were visible, specifically white, red and green. \r\nthe lights appeared to be over the fair park area, at about 5,000-feet in altitude and 5-miles distance. \r\nthe span inside each pair was comparable to a 737, from wingtip to wingtip. \r\neach two lights appeared to be mated, but i could not see any solid object between the lights. \r\nnone of the pairs seemed attached with a different pair, as they slowly moved around independently. \r\neach pair was separate of the other pairs and they appeared to be at various staggered distances. \r\ni only saw a flat-on view of these things from their northeast side, and do not know the other side. \r\nanother witness 71975 saw the lights from another angle and could give triangulation. \r\na jetliner was directly behind the lights to the southwest at about 10,000-feet altitude and 10-miles away.  \r\nthis aircraft apparently left d-fw airport and was traveling  in a southeast direction behind the lights. \r\nthe night was clear and the lights were steady for 5-minutes, so they were not natural phenomena. \r\nthey were much too large, bright, high and stable to be chinese lanterns. \r\nthese were illegally hovering near a love field flight path, five miles south of the runway, for five minutes without proper navigation colors; therefore, they were not man-made objects. \r\nthese orange lights should have been easily seen by love field aircraft and traffic control and recorded. \r\nthe pairs each slowly faded out one by one after about five minutes. \r\n","distance":"Over One

than what we did. the report described the following incident:\r\nwe were driving southbound on i-75 between tampa and bradenton, fl.\r\nabove us and to the right we observed two (2) jet planes that appeared to be flying in formation.\r\nthe odd thing that drew my attention was the vapor trail was getting longer behind only one of the planes. the other plane appeared to be pulling its vapor trail behind it.\r\nit was only later i realized the best explanation for the event is we were watching one (1) airplane, being shadowed by a reflection of itself. the reflective surface had to be \"shadowing\" another plane; and was flying at the same speed. that's why the vapor trail that ended at the edge of the reflective surface appeared to be pulled behind the reflection of the plane.\r\ni reported it here after i realized that was the case.\r\nhere's why i'm writing you now:\r\ni still think about that event, and i just now realized that whatever reflective surface was shadowing that jet was probably doing it to prevent detection by radar.\r\nthere was an unseen object flying in the same airspace as another visible aircraft that would all appear as one blip on radar to air traffic control in the metro-tampa area.\r\ni think this behavior, flying close to another craft, now seems like an attack strategy that was being utilized or tested. without knowing what the mission was i can't even guess if that object did anything after it was out of my sight.\r\nwho knows what might be flying over us if we can't see it or detect it with radar?\r\n","distance":"Over One

will appear over us.They will brighten extremely bright & then pulsate & looks kinda like a strobe light before dimming back down barely seeing it or sometimes dimming completely out of sight.They don't seem to be moving fast & you can tell they are under the clouds.When ever they start getting bright,they also seem to slow down before speeding back up along it's path.\r\nsaw 2 starlike objects close togetherwatching us & appearing to hover blending in with other stars before vanishing before our eyes.\r\n\r\ni took binoculars & zoomed right on them but,it was like looking directly into car headlights,no object seen. airplanes were really busy that night.These are no airplanes,planets or iss or anything else that we've saw all of our lives.If they are drones, they are not any type of drone the public can access or buy.These would have to be high tech drones that are either gov. or from out of this world.\r\n\r\non thursday night,around 8:00 p.M.,we was looking east & 2 stars appeared out of nowhere & was side by side fixed into the clear dark sky amongst many other stars.They were at eye level not high up at all. i thought this was strange & for a short moment i thought they were stars.I thought,they haven't been there the whole time though.We had all been outside since it had gotton dark.These 2 very bright star like objects appeared to be hovering or fixed but they could of actually been traveling toward us going west very slow.Anyway, within about 4 minutes of starring at them,they didn't appear to be getting closer & all of a sudden,they both vanished.\r\ni figured they were still there somewhere,without being lit up.Like being sneaky & spying.\r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes later,i shouted,\"hey where are you\"?)\"get bright for me,so we can see where your at\" & all of a sudden at that moment, low in the northern part of the sky, a really bright starlike object appeared & started moving slow going north away from us. oh & i had the heavens above app on my phone so there wasn't any type of satellites during the events stated.No noise only silence. i wanted to share my story with everyone.I guess we'll be looking every night for these strange objects now.Although it is creepy.From the stories i read on this site,it sounds a lot like what others have reported.Whatever we are seeing,it's really bizzare & seems to watching & spying on

direction change toward me. one 'zigged' this way while the other 'zagged' that way a bit, their turns were at the exact same time, but out of sync, that is, turning in different directions at the exact same time.\r\nit was as if they were flying in the same direction, but doing opposing zigzags as they followed their flight path, as in a search pattern.\r\nthey maintained the same distance from each other, one above the other.\r\n\r\nthe turns were quick and abrupt. the g-forces would have to be quite high during fast turns like that.\r\n\r\nthey moved from the sw to directly south of

some video.\r\ni didn't see the spheres again, but met two younger men who were quite excited as they told me they'd just seen all this fly overhead, and they said they saw them split up into six red

w light winds. my friend and i were sitting on the deck in my backyard. i live on a canal on padre island, so the deck is actually about 25 ft above the water on canal. all of a sudden my friend was startled by a bright light she noticed when she glanced to her left. when she noticed it, it caught my attention and we both jumped out of our seat in shock. there was a bright red/orange orb travelling in slow, straight path approx 100 ft above the water and travelling nw along the canal. we were in complete shock- could not speak and were scared to move. i had my phone in my hand, but it was so close to us as it was passing by us, i was scared to video it until it went past my house. the first thing my friend said was , \" oh my gosh, is that a chinese lantern?\" - at that time the object was about 2 houses down from mine and had not yet reached our location. as it got closer it was very obvious it was no chinese lantern or a drone of any type. first, it was too breezy for it to maintain straight flt path. also, as it got closer to us it made no noise at all, did not appear to have a specific structure or frame ( body). it was a large beachball size or slightly larger, bright sphere of red/orange light. the light was very bright and seemed to slightly pulsate never leave losing its vibrance but w no distinct pattern. as it passed my house i turned the video on my phone on and tried to videotape it as it flew steadily along the canal slowly ascending flying nw direction,  and all if a sudden it disappeared. the video and still shot i took is horrible in regard to clarity- i tried to zoom in and also include houses in video to show its proximity in sky to where we were. video did not capture the intense brightness. we have never seen anything like this ever! we are both very familiar w drone type crafts as they are getting more common these days- this was not a drone of any kind- it was startling, shocking, and slightly scary bc it was this bright large sphere of light. would def love to know what this was. now everytime we go outside at night we def pay more attention to what is in the sky. i have included video and two still photos taken that night, as well as two daytime pics to show area object was seen travelling.
