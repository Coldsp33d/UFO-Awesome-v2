trees. it flew south towards elevated railroad tracks about a block away. i thought for sure i would hear something about it in the news because it was such a strange sighting and someone else most likely would have spotted it also. it was after dark and its flight was silent, but i find it hard to believe i was the only person that seen it. i don't strongly believe one way or the other whether more ufos exist. i do know i did see this ufo many years ago. at the time i was a young teenager. i was sober and not under the influence of any medications or drugs of any kind. i talk about this

it was directly overhead in less than three seconds, which is where my wife picked it up visually.  we traversed our point of view to watch it continue moving southwest and after it passed overhead the lights grew faint and the object disappeared into the night sky.  at one point, i actually did think it might be a flock of birds because the triangle shape seemed to flex like a bow recovering its shape, before it solidified into a solid v again, but the speed was way too fast and the elevation way too high, plus the lights were not reflective but appeared to be very faint sources of light.  i've ruled out fighters flying in a \"v\" formation as well as there was no sound and fighters in formation at that elevation would have taken longer to traverse the sky.  the craft moved from one

morning so one of my guys decided to take a few pictures of the sunrise from the second story bed room window the date was 10/28/15, it was about 7:15 am, there was only about 1 minute between pictures, while taking the pictures nothing abnormal was noticed, it was only afterwards when viewing them that we noticed the large bright saucer shaped object with a brightly glowing dome on top, my guess is that the object was moving too fast to see it while taking the pictures, and the camera actually caught it in that one frame.I went to a vintage ww11 air show recently in new orleans and took many pics of the planes , i even flew in a b-17 and a b-25, while in the air i took many pics, and the camera actually stopped the props in each frame, this is what i think happened that morning, you can see that the ufo is quite large and is very clear, it is in the first picture taken and not the second, the camera angle for each picture is almost exactly the same.I have been interested and watch ufo shows for a great many years now, i was never convinced they were real, but this one picture has changed my mind only because i was there, i still can hardly believe it, but the photo doesnt

bright. to give you an idea of position let me say that the balcony from which i saw this object faces west. i went out to the balcony at approximately 7:30pm. the moon was sse of my location at approximately at 50 degree angle 0ver the horizon. i had full view of the night sky. \r\nafter 10 or so minutes from being outside, toward the west i saw what appeared to be ripples in the air (similar to those formed by a boat as it moves in water) being created by something moving forward behind them. from my position, i estimate that i saw these \"ripples\" at an elevation of 35-40 degrees above the horizon. these \"ripples\" appeared whitish in color perhaps because of the reflection of the city lights below. the \"ripples\" were visible for a couple of seconds sufficient time to eliminate the possibility of birds but plenty of times to keep me looking at whatever that was.\r\nas i stared at these \"ripples\" and watch them disappear to give view to an object traveling in the direction of my location. it was a v shaped craft with circles along each side of the v. it was a non-reflective type of black or dark grey color (contrasted with the night sky due to the shining moon). the circles (perhaps lights?) were gray-white but were not reflecting outside the craft similar to seeing the interior lights of a house from the outside. the craft had no nav lights at all which is rare when we consider the fact that it was flying in the airspace of the sfo, oak, sjc airports. the aircraf was absolutely silent and had no visible engines, afterburners or indication of a power source. from the first instant i saw the \"ripples\" to the time the craft went over the balcony where i was standing i estimate that it was perhaps 6 seconds. that said, i did have a perfect view of this craft to clearly identify the shape and the circles on each side and the tip because it passed almost overhead. i can not tell how high it was because i had no points of reference given the clear night. what i can say is that assuming that it was at the altitude of aircraft approaching sfo international this craft was much larger than a 747 cargo plane and moved a lot faster.\r\nonce the craft went over the balcony traveling west to east i lost visibility as it got obscured by the roof of the house. a few seconds later i saw it again this time heading north-north east. i do not know if it turned or did a loop to change directions while behind the house. at this stage i saw the back of the craft and followed it by looking at the white circles underneath for a few more seconds. not sure if it was going so fast that i lost visibility due to distance or if the craft turned off those under body lights that i was using as reference.  the total time i had this craft in sight was about 10-15 seconds. it took me a lot longer to write this report.  i'd be interested in hearing comments from people who have seen something similar to what i have described here. let me say that i had never seen anything like this before and, between you and i, i'd like to have the opportunity to see it again.\r\n \r\n

pointing at the sky so i looked up and saw the lights pulsating from a faint yellow then to red and back a glowing white. it was daytime so i assumed it was just a plane at first but there was not a cloud in the sky and i was unable to see what was in the middle. as if the lights were just there and the actual craft was invisible. after observing i pulled out my phone and it began to move back and forth. thats when i knew for a fact i was not looking at a plane considering planes cant move forward then move backward without turning around or at that speed. soon enough it was gone it didnt speed off into the sky it just disapeared. maybe 15 minutes later im back inside the house and i was able to hear helocopters so i looked out the window and sure enough there was two black helocopters side by side. and since that wasnt wierd enough the helocopters were almost circling the town as if it were looking for something. it wasnt a news helocopter it was not the coastgaurd which i do sometimes see. just pure black non writen on helocopters. during the sighting i was feeling more anxious then i beleive i ever have before not even a bad anxiety but just anxious for example im about to go on a trip somewhere i have always wanted to go. thats how i felt. for the next few days i could not stop thinking about it. i actually snapped a few pictures but i only actually caught the lights once so i do have one picture of what i was seeing. also before i forget the triangle lights had some sort of tail following it. another light that was going around it at some points but majority of the time behind it following it. the tail looked just like the other lights except when the triangle lights moved the never moved out of place from the triangle. just a perfect triangle the whole time while moving and while stationary. thank you i hope this helps feel few to email or whatever you want if you have anymore questions. \r\n\r\nin the photos it might seem like just a blue

diamond shaped sometimes and triangular in shape other times. i’m not sure what town it’s actually over but i assume it might be new haven but could be as far away as branford or even guilford. i usually see it between 2am and 4am and it’s usually out there for at least 1 hour before disappearing. it’s always high in the sky and does not move for that particular night, however every night that i see it, it’s not always in the same location that it was the prior night when seen. for the past 2 nights there were 2 of these lights out there not far from each other. i’m really not sure what these lights are but there is something out there and just wanted to report it.

stuff into a storage unit. we were less then a mile from home when i noticed what looked like 2 shooting stars falling from the sky. i was the passenger and my father in law was driving. i said look what is that and at that time he looked and saw what appeared to be 2 shooting stars as well. they were falling parallel to each other. as i observed them falling for about 5-10 seconds all of the sudden they seamed to come to a stop and became 1 object. i asked my father in law what is that are you seeing that this is really weird and he confirmed that he saw what i was seeing. then where the 2 stars has joined and hauled there was a triangle shaped craft hovering. i asked my father in law if he saw the triangular shaped object as well and he confirmed that he did. there were aqua bluish lights luminicing under the triangular shaped object and it appeared to be hovering. the shooting star object that emerged from 2 to 1 was kind of dancing around the triangular craft moving back and forth. i kept asking my father in law if he was seeing what i was seeing as well and he confirmed. we were driving so my view was obstructed periodically as we passed by trees or buildings but i kept my focus on the object until we were in our neighborhood which is covered with trees and i loss sight of it. as soon as we got home i got out of the car and tried to observe the object from my driveway for about 10 mins but i couldn't relocate the object. i desperately wanted to get the object on camera but it just never reappeared. when i went in the house my father in law was discussing with some family members what we had saw. i gave my account of what i saw as well. he was the one driving and i was the passenger so i observed the object longer. my spouse and i went out to dinner a few minutes later and i caught myself fixated on the sky although this time i was the one driving. i really wanted to see the triangular shape craft again so i could get it on camera but i never saw it again. i have watched tv shows about ufos such as ufo hunters, hangar 1,ufo files ect. i've never seen a ufo before but i have had interest in them for years. what was surprising to me was that although the triangular shaped craft was common amongst those shows the whole ordeal with the 2 shooting stars that became 1 object was what i considered unique. that wasn't a sight i was familiar with from watching any ufo subject tv shows. later that night and first thing this morning i looked online to see if anyone else had saw what my father in law and i had seen but no reports as of yet. there were a lot of people out and about it was 7:30ish on a friday night in an atlanta suburb and i know we weren't the only ones to see the ordeal there's just no way. anyway that is my story

the air traffic comes from the south by southeast. we continued watching and realized this thing was moving alow. real slow. we wat hdd somewhat dumbfounded until the light slowly appeard too split

100-150 yards, this thing was massive!As it krept closer and kept a south too north by north east trajectory it passed over the apartments. by now many people qho were outside or driving by stopped and seen it. even a sherriffs deputy got out of his car snapped some pics and radiod this ii. i also got photos. asit started too move over the trees out of site we jumped in the truck and followed it with about 10 other vehicles in tow.We followed it a out 4 miles and it started too decend to barely 200 or so feet off theground. we pulled over as did everyone behind us and watched as it emitted a silvery bluesh flash almost like a flash bulb or lightening that lit the entire area up brighter than day light. it made alow grumbling hum and started too asscend back up and too the north eventualy out of sight. a sherriffs helicopter was seen about 15 minutes later hauling ass in the direction of this thing wbich ws now barely visible.A highway potroleman who saw us all pulled over got out and exclaimed \" an you believe this crazy s#$%??\" upon further conversation he said the police band and 911 were being bombarded with chatter which was later confirmed by kbak eyewitness news own news

i went outside and it was a nice night, a very dark night because the moon was just a sliver. it was really clear so i got my binoculars to look at the stars. i noticed this bright large orange ball just atop my nieghbors house. at first i thought it was an outdoor light that the people next to them had for the party. about 5 minutes later i saw that it was no longer atop the house but a few inches higher, which would really be miles. i watched it thru my binocs for awhile. i thought that it must be venus, but the more i watched i changed my mind. besides that about 15 minutes after i first saw this ball another one appeared to the northeast of this one, lower, smaller, much farther away. that one i couldn't really get on my camera, but i thought maybe that one is venus and there couldn't be two.  \r\none thing about both of these balls is that they both had much smaller balls, one each, a few inches (again miles) above them that moved with them. these smaller ones were little more than dots compared to the big ones and they flashed red, blue, green in that order, red on the left blue in the center and green on the right.\r\ni saw this sunday morning oct 10th starting at approx 3:30 a.M. i watched it for about 15 minutes, filmed it for 7-8 minutes. what i watched thru my  camera on the camera's lcd screen did not look like what appeared after downloading it to my pc.\r\ni have an olympus sz-14/sz-12 digital camera. i was using optical zoom. i zoomed in and stayed zoomed in the entire time. so when it shrinks and then flares out again or changes color that's it's doing. there's a little bit of shakiness, but for the most part i had my elbows planted firmly on the top of my fence and kept pretty still. the object would move up and to the left so i would adjust myself to center object in the screen of the camera. at one point, when looking thru my binocs it was very white and there were red streaks coming out of the top sides meeting in the center continously flashing, it only lasted about 20-30 seconds. a couple times it seemed to change shape. that's when i went for my camera and started filming but those things didn't happen again. once i got it on my computer i saw a definite outer ring and several dark spots, lights? in the center. this is very wierd, is it venus, is it a star, are planets or stars capable of being so perfectly round and flashing like that?\r\nalso if they are a star or planet how come they haven't been out again yet since that night? i've been looking.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
