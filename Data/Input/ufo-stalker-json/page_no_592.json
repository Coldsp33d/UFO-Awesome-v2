{"content":[{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Rushsylvania","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I feel compelled to relate this incident (summer of 1959 or '60) even though so many years have passed.  one summer evening when i was in the explorer scouts our leader, after our meeting, asked if the unit would like to hike down to our local small-town reservoir to check out the night sky.  it was a beautiful clear and warm evening and a perfect time to go star searching.  at the reservoir there was a pumping station built out over the water with a concrete cat-walk leading out to the station, a perfect place for viewing.  we were gathered along the walkway when someone shouted \"there's a falling star.\"  a mega-bright glowing, reddish/orange/yellow circular orb of light appeared over the horizon, streaking through the sky, did not burn out or disappear, but instead, seemingly a second or less,  slowed and hovered almost directly over our heads. stationary only momentarily, it began to circle the periphery of the water, slightly above the treetops.  the reservoir is surrounded by trees and woods and the water area covers multiple acres. if memory serves it circled the area approximately 3 times and then as abruptly as it appeared it was gone in a flash streaking back over the horizon from the way it had come. i don't remember anyone speaking during the event or moving in the least.  i have never had a feeling quite like that; totally awestruck and immobile.  i do not think i could have moved to save my life and i was not able to speak until after the object had disappeared.  thinking back over the years, but even more so recently, i have thought it odd that walking home that evening from the reservoir i don't remember anyone really talking much about what we had just seen, neither our leader nor the 10-12 other boys in our group.  nor did we ever mention it again.  when back for a high school reunion in 2012 one boy who was present with us that startling  night had no memory of the event.  the others had either died or moved away or were otherwise unavailable and the troop leader was long deceased; no one else left to review our memories together.  it is also odd to me that when i got home that evening my mother had gone to bed, much earlier than usual and she ordinarily would wait up until i was home; the also my dad was home and he always worked very late.  timewise i should have arrived home no later than 9:30 or 10 p.M.  at the time i did not wonder why my father was home so early, several hours before his usual time and my mother in bed so early.  i can not now rationalize why there was such a discrepancy in what appears now as some lost hours.  i do not remember looking at a clock upon arriving home.  i did mention what i had seen to my father and he did not take my description of the event seriously to my utter disappointment and no one else to report it to; no significant police presence and calling the sheriff most certainly would have been a lost cause.  at the time there was an air force radar installation (hi-point area of bellefontaine, ohio) just a few miles away and in the direction from which the object appeared and afterward disappeared.  at 14 years old i could not even envision calling the air force.  so that is my  description of the event after all these years. so thank you for the opportunity to report an obvious unidentified flying object which made absolutely no sound,created no heat or wind drafts and definitely was not swamp gas, northern lights, an airplane or helicopter, weather balloon or other man-made body.  i am now retired, do consider myself somewhat accomplished, rational, intelligent with several advanced degrees and so far have avoided the dreaded alzheimers.  thank you so much for your efforts and for affording me the opportunity to finally report this incident.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

pond about nine miles east of huntington,ut.\r\ni noticed a beautiful moon rise over cedar mountain and shot some pictures with an 18-250mm lens.  next,at approximately 6:40pm,i used a 150-500 mm sigma optically stabilized lens with a 1.4 tele-converter attached.  with the 0.6x cropping factor of the sensor on the canon t4i camera the total focal length was 1160mm at the 500mm setting. as always, i quickly brushed any dust or artifacts off the lens glass before taking a picture using aperture priority mode. upon focusing on the nearly full moon, i noticed a triangular object moving in the bottom right corner of the moon and immediately suspected a bug and thought to myself, \"easily removed in photoshop\".  between the first and second photo, i switched the camera to manual in order to bracket exposures by changing shutter speeds.  i noticed the object  had moved across the face of the moon and snapped another picture which was  slightly over exposed.  the third and last image shows the object (shadow?) just right of top dead center of the moon's face and disappears as if it's actually following the moon's curvature.  these photos transpired over the course of about 10-15 seconds due to switching camera mode and slow auto focus. the iso for all images was 400 and shutter speeds were 1/20th of a second to 1/30th at an aperture of f-9. i sent a forth photo which shows a thin veil of cirrus clouds moving across the moon's top as a \"control shot.\"\r\non my way back to huntington, i thought about the object and determined it couldn't have been a conventional aircraft or bug and was eager to download the images.\r\n i've studied the images at magnifications beyond actual pixels, sharpened, and am convinced it's an opaque object because the pixels block light reflected from the moon; the  dark triangular area appears to be quite uniform in all the photos and clearly blocks reflected light. i thought it might be a contrail reflecting off clouds but have also ruled out that possibility. i've uploaded the original jpegs and if you want, i'll send the raws which would probably be better at determining what this anomaly is.  if you have any ideas, please notify me by e-mail.  i'll eagerly await a response.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

when -- as we crested a hill -- i saw, over the tree line to the south, five very bright yellow objects that appeared to be 'hanging' in the air over puget sound (as if they were lights strung together).  my fiancé did not see them.  as we went down the hill i lost sight of the lights.  i was very curious to see them again, and to have her see them. i wanted to see if i could rule out airplanes as an explanation. these lights were not 'normal' for the area, which has lots of air traffic but these did not appear to be aircraft lights.\r\n\r\nand they were not chinese lanterns, based on movement patterns and the duration of the sighting.  \r\n\r\nwe went to a beach called double bluff on south whidbey island.  the lights were still visible, and presented in varying degrees of brightness/intensity.  initially they just hovered. but literally as we walked from the car they seemed to move away, dimming as they did so.\r\n\r\nsome faded away, though two remained in view and gradually became much brighter (see photos).  eventually they all gradually faded and disappeared.  others appeared, and brightened.  of note is the fact that when the one object moved northeast, the light remained bright and did not vary, as an airplane would as it moved and turned. it's light remained constant.  no wing lights were visible.\r\n\r\nthere were aircraft visible as well, to the south, likely traveling to and from seatac airport.  these lights were decidedly different than the anomalous lights. they were white, with blinking running lights. it was good to have the comparison in real time.\r\n\r\nthrough binoculars the objects were emitting too much light to determine a shape, though one also appeared to suddenly 'morph' into a triangular form (seen through binoculars). this 'morphing' was the most surprising and shocking part of this observation, since the appearance had been vague and ill-defined prior to this (brief) change.  all seemed to have an amorphous, pulsing reddish light in the center.  \r\n\r\nthere was a low, constant pulsating sound in the bass range which neither of us had heard before. it did not get louder or quieter, but remained constant for as long as we observed the phenomenon.  the sound was not produced by a train or aircraft or boat. there could be other rational explanations for the noise (and for the lights, of course.  we are very skeptical, sober-minded people).  but it was also very unusual and strange.\r\n\r\nwe live in the puget sound region, and are familiar with aircraft of various descriptions.  while we cannot definitively rule out that these were aircraft, our experience seeing many different aircraft at night and in differing weather conditions from boeing plants, paine field, sea-tac airport, and whidbey island naval air station persuaded us that these were something else.\r\n\r\nour only guess is that atmospheric conditions might have had some extraordinary effect on normal aircraft lights. there were very few clouds, far to the south. \r\n\r\nwe've never seen lights like these.  they were exactly what the term 'ufo' means -- unidentified flying objects. we went away without any idea what they were. \r\n\r\nsteve ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then

playing around with the zoom on the camera and took some still shots before deciding to zoom all the way into the moon and then started to video record the moon, i was facing in a north easterly direction, (camera settings were 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second), i zoomed in and out of the moon several times and then zoomed back in fully and started to record the perimeter of the moon (the lower half) from right to left, as i got to the left side i noticed something dark for a split second on the lower part of the frame which was visible on the lcd viewfinder, initially i thought it was birds, anyway the next day i loaded the still shots and video recordings on my computer  to view on my 28\" 4k monitor and that's when i realized the recording i thought had birds in the lower frame was actually black round circles in a group that whizzed past in the lower part of the video frame, some of the circles were different sizes which indicates to me they were further away from the

intentionally at times. i was in awe of this glowing ball and overwhelmed. it finally glowed really bright and flickered once, became instantly smaller, and then faded out to a small dot and disappeared as if it had quickly zoomed away. we tried to capture it on our ipad and iphone, with one poor quality image to show for it.
