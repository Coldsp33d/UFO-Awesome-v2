States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This event occurred at about 1:10 am on march 14, 1997, about 18 miles southwest of tucson, arzona. at that time i was a 42 year old electronic engineer who operated a small home business, doing contract jobs for various clients. i had lived in tucson for some time, and felt that the city was too noisy for me to concentrate on my work. i wanted to live in a quiet rural area where i would not be disturbed, and in 1996 i purchased a house in a sparsly populated area southwest of town. i had a neighbor across the road from me, and there was an unoccupied house furthur to the north. my property extended about 100 feet from the front of the house, and then there was a barbed wire fence. it had 5 wires, the top one being about 4 feet high. it was usually quite dark at night out there, however i had installed some floodlights on the front of the house, which i could turn on if needed. i went to bed around 10 pm, march 13, and was sleeping soundly when the event began. i was awakened around 1:10 am, march 14 by the sound of someone attempting to open the bedroom window, about 6 feet away from me. the sound was like nails on a blackboard. the window was on the front of the house, and consisted of double-pane glass with track-locks on it, and a set of blinds which were closed. although i could not see who was trying to get in, i had a profound feeling of being in mortal danger... as if whoever was outside meant to do something terrible to me. i've always had a good sensitivity to the feelings of people and animals, and i was confident that what i felt was genuine. as quickly as i could, i rolled out of bed, away from the direction of the window, and grabbed a 12 gauge shotgun from the closet. at this time my emotions changed from fear to intense anger and a strong determination to kill the attempted intruder, if he got in. i pumped a shell into the chamber, which made an audiable noise, then ran to the living room window, which was only about 10 feet from the bedroom window, also on the front of the house. that was where the switch for the floodlights was located. i hit the switch, and was totally shocked when i saw this thing, which was now moving away from the house towards the fence. i got a pretty good look at the back of it, for about 5 seconds. it was definitely not human. it was about 6-7 feet tall and had a large head, similar in shape to a football helmet. it was very thin and the arms were quite long. it wasn't exactly running, but it was moving smoothly and very quickly. it reached the fence in just a few seconds, and then, without slowing down, it jumped right over the fence like a hurdle jumper in the olympics, and kept on going. it continued down to the wooded area where the unoccupied house was, and within about 30 seconds i saw a disk shaped object rise up from there, and move off towards the south. it was about 40 feet in diameter and passed by the front of my house at a distance of about 130 feet, about 60 feet above the ground. it had steady yellow-redish lights on the bottom of it and made no sound that i could hear. my state of mind collapsed into total shock and an overwhelming feeling of fear. all i could think of was what might happen if it came back. i spent the rest of the night virtually paralysed with fear, hiding behind a couch in the living room, clutching the shotgun. when the sun began to come up, i started to regain some of my senses. i carefully went outside and looked around. everything seemed normal, except that by my bedroom window i found some footprints. there hadn't been much rain and the ground was rather hard, but a few of the impressions were fairly clear. the prints were about 10-11 inches in length, very thin, and with 3 large toes. i should have photographed them, but at the time my only concern was my own safety, and i decided to go to a hardware store and get some bolt locks to secure the doors. this i did, and on the way back i stopped at a small cafe a few miles from my house, to pick up some coffee and breakfast. i entered the cafe, ordered some food, and then noticed that a casual friend of mine was there. he lived in a trailer a few miles to the south of me. when i saw him i simply said \"man, something really weird happened last night\" and he replied \"you're not kidding... a ufo came up the canyon\". i was startled to hear that, and asked him \"what time ?\" and he replied \"about a quarter past 1\". when he said that i panicked and left the cafe without even taking my coffee or food. (some months later i actually tried to find him, to ask him for some details, but i was told he had left the area back in march...) anyway, i returned to the house and installed the locks on the doors. the following day i went into town and purchased a bunch of heavy plywood, and boarded up every window in the house. i didn't have a television and didn't happen to catch any reports about the so-called \"phoenix lights\" until several years later. as to reporting the incident, i considered it but was doing some military contract jobs and was afraid that i might be typed as a lunatic or a security risk and lose my clearance... and in addition i simply had no desire to talk about it. the whole thing was just too disturbing. eventually i moved away from that area, and although it's been a number of years since it happened, i'm only recently feeling able to talk about it.\r\n","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On my drive home from work at washington dulles intl. airport i witnessed a light that was very low in the sky. i had just gotten off of the rt.28s - rt.66 front royal (westbound) exit just prior to passing under the highway sign for exit 52 centreville when i noted a rather large red, slowly pulsating orb of light that was quite low and moving west-southwest bound passing from over the highway and to the right. as i proceeded westbound i was very aware of the object and noted it's irregularities compared to what i'm familiar with seeing in regards to aircraft and airliners. i was first alerted to it's peculiar nature due to that fact that it was too low to be on the approach path to kiad's runways 01l/c/r. the lowest altitude an aircraft can be south of kiad enroute to runways 01l/c/r is from 2,900'-2,300' from 7.7 - 5.8nm and this object was just about 300' higher than the treetops in that particular area. additionally i mentally assessed the objects features and noted that the only visible light was the aforementioned slowly pulsating red light orb. all aircraft are required to have minimum external navigation lights operable before flying at night, these include red and green wingtip navigation lights, white steady burning position lights, amber/red burning quick/moderate flashing beacon lights on the ventral and dorsal portions of the fuselage. this object wouldn't have been legal to have flown or even be dispatched given its singular large centrally located red light. as i drove closer to it i slowed down and craned my head to get a better look at it, noticing that the red light was very clearly reflecting off of the bottom of the object. i noted that the surface of the object had none of the familiar features i know aircraft and airliners posses, instead it was flat with a very black and matte like surface that only just reflected the very edges of the red light in a manner not like that of aircraft grade aluminum. in addition to slowing down i also had put my drivers side window down to listen to it and to my surprise i heard no noise that an object that low and of that size would make. the objects speed was also quite slow such that i was able to rule out that it wasn't an airliner, corporate jet, ga aircraft or even a helicopter. i've been driving this route for 5 days a week for the past 6 years and am quite familiar with my environment but this was a very out of place observation. in addition i am a pilot who holds several licenses including a commercial pilots license and an aviation teaching license. i work for a major airline and am more than familiar with general aviation, military aviation and commercial aviation having been in the industry since i was 15 y/o.\r\n\r\nafter arriving home 10 min later in manassas i parked and pulled out my phone to check flightaware.Com to check flight paths and any aircraft that might've traversed the airspace, taken off or landed at iad but only noted one departure of a business jet northbound from rwy 01c. i checked khef as well but no aircraft on ifr flight plans had operated from the field as well. this was peculiar given that the weather conditions were low visibility and overcast ceilings. prominent ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

outside. the sky was clear that night which was nice after the bout of rain we had recently.The time was around 9:30-10:00 pm, and this is the time i take our three dogs outside to do their business as i try to stay warm and in a little bit of a hurry to get back inside where it’s warm. i noticed two of the dogs looking up, which normally they don’t, and i follow their gaze upward, and i notice through my neighbors trees at about 100 ft. above, three red lights blinking in order, vertically. the lights blink separately, yet as they blink there is a connective beam that weaves from one to the other(like a tesla light you see in those orbs when you touch it.) these lights are at about nw position, and moving to w. now, before it get’s very much further, the lights begin to rotate clockwise until they become horizontal. before it becomes fully horizontal, i can finally see a shape that i could’nt see before, and it is triangle-shaped and dull black in color. now, for this discripiton i have to let you know that there is a street light almost directly below this craft that is orange in color and is about 3 blocks away. at this distance, the object appears to be at least 35-40 feet long and 25 feet wide by 8-10 feet high. it has block shapes on top of it, and i can see 4-5 of these on top. at full horizontal, it is headed about west now, and though i can’t see the top of it anymore, i can still see the side of it. i can’t believe what i’m seeing, and i want to share this with someone before it goes away. so, i run to my son’s bedroom window (his corner bedroom windows faces nw & w) and i begin tapping on his window to get his attention and explain what i’ve been looking at. he looks and see’s what i see, and about this time my wife  comes outside to throw out the trash and notices me and my son. looking up and pointing to the sky. wife asks us what we are looking at, and she comes to the side of the house and see’s what we see , but by now it has moved from the west to heading south. it must have been moving slowly, because we could all still see the lights of it very clearly, and the time it took me to see it, go to my sons’s window, explain to him what i saw and show him, and have my wife come out and see it before it moved on must have taken some time. in my excitement, it seemed like it happened a little faster than that. oh, also, the third of our dogs, when this first happened, ran like crazy for the kitchen door, and i’ve never seen her run that fast!\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  i don’t recall hearing any sound, as low to the ground as it was. i asked my son. & wife the same thing, in fact i recall asking them right after it happened, and we all agree that none of us recall hearing any sound. the time involved seemed longer than it was. my son. said it felt like 20 min, wife said 15-20 min, and i would have to say 15 min. however, the actual time that went by was in reality probably about 3-5 minutes. when i looked at the clock, i kept thinking, man this had to have been longer than 5 minutes! \r\n\r\ni didn’t feel any vibrations, but i do remember that it seemed like the air stood still.","distance":"101-500

saw this really bright star. i looked at for a second, and then thought to myself 'it's just an airplane', and then it moved to the right a little bit, in a really weird way that didn't look like anything i've ever seen before. i opened the door and stepped outside to watch it, and it wasn't moving any closer or further away, it just hovered there in the sky, flashing. again i thought it was an airplane and i was just tired, but the lights looked different, and there were colors flashing that i'd never seen on any plane before. i sat down and just watched it, afraid to move because i might miss something. it hovered, and it would jump to the right, then to the left, and then it would go up and to the right, and i could swear even though i couldn't make out a definite shape that it was tilting at an angle. i stared and stared, and even walked down the street for a clearer view, just to be sure that it was moving, and not the trees in my yard blowing in the wind. it was definitely moving. when it hovered, it didn't sit perfectly still, it sort of wavered, like a quadrotor drone. so then i thought maybe it was a personal drone someone was flying, but i watched and watched and it stayed up there, and as far as i know, the battery life on those personal drones isn't very long. i sat outside watching it for 30 minutes, and then it looked like it was ejecting things from it, like tiny shooting stars. i thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me, and i was seeing some kind of glare that looked like things were coming out of it, but then one came out and made a big curve over the thing. it came out of what i can only assume was the top, went up and to the left, and then made a big arcing curve over the light, or craft, or whatever it was. they weren't bright like the thing itself, they had really faint tails as they came off. i've seen a few ufos in the last year or two, but this one is the only one i've been able to actually watch, instead of just seeing. the last one i saw there was a witness. the night of the lunar eclipse a few weeks ago we saw a blue light flying in a straight path, but it looked smoother than an airplane and it was just a solid blue light. it stopped mid flight, turned from blue to red, and then dropped straight down and we lost sight of it. there were at least 50 people outside looking at the eclipse, i know somebody else saw that.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

the object to my left which would be to the west.  it was a full moon out the sky was well lit and las vegas and the strip was to the west/north-west.  i first noticed the object by light and movement.  when i turned  my head to view the object there was no hesitation, no doubt in my mind what it was. it was clearly a outlined triangular craft, the lights of the craft and of the night sky gave it some depth as to its size and shape. it was not in any holding pattern or approach pattern to mccarran international airport, which i am very familiar with. along with my initial viewing of it and automatically able to identify it as being a triangular craft that was not an airplane.  i got the automatic impression that it was military or part of the ssp(secret space program).  it seemed to be in cruise mode and flying just as fast as any regular airplane could. it did not hover or zoom away it flew at nearly a constant rate of speed.  which was fast enough to get out of my range of view after 20-30 seconds of viewing it.  there was no power up or signs of power except for the illumination of the lights on the corners of the \"object\" and underneath it.  upon first seeing it i saw solid white lights on the corners of the craft.  they did not change colors nor did they blink/flashed/pulsed.  along with that there also was a red light on the underneath of the craft, just slightly off center, almost dead center but not quite.  this red  light how ever did flash/blinked on and off.   i was very excited upon seeing the object because i have seen  many things before but nothing so close and with such distinction.  i was following a friend of mine and i was flashing my lights at him, he didn't slow down so i called him and he could not locate it and it was quickly getting out of view.  after driving north on boulder highway i lost it as i was turning left, west bound on sunset rd.  i lost it off in the distance, which was to the north west.  if i had to guess at the size of
