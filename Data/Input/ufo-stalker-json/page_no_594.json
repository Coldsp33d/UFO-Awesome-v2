States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"“i’ve done seen more things throughout my life, more than any other child has in a lifetime!” it all started at the age of eleven, i just moved from angola, indiana planning to meet new people, and make new friends while finishing up my summer in muncie, indiana. it all started out great, on the third day i sought out to find new friends in the neighborhood, and eventually i was given a tour of the massive city on foot. although i can’t remember him and his brothers name, they had lived a couple houses down from me. they were much older than me, the one was tall and skinny, while his brother was short and stalky. supposedly their dad worked for the cia back in the day or something like that, i never really believed them! tom my mother's boyfriend worked at the popcorn factory making tons of different popcorn flavors, pretzels, with white chocolate, and dark chocolate covered pretzels. sometimes he would bring some home with him, after i was finally settled in with my mom and her new boyfriend we decided to watch american dad and eat some caramel popcorn that he had brought back from work. we had a blast at first until a few days have past, it was hot and humid the day it all began to unravel. tom came home from work, installed the air conditioner in my temporary bedroom, which was also our other living room, while my real bedroom was still a working progress at the time. he then took a shower and proceeded to go to bed with my mother as i sat up half the night watching family guy. \r\n\r\nafter a few hours of watching tv i began to get bored and yet tired, the air conditioner wasn’t working properly and it was really hot. i got up grabbed my blankets and pillows, turned off the lights and laid down on the couch in our living room. it felt like eternity trying to fall asleep. i eventually got so fed up with the heat, once again grabbed my blankets and pillows and headed to my bedroom, opened up my window and laid on the floor. again it felt like eternity just laying there listening to all silence, as i laid there staring at the clock i began to hear someone or something walking through our driveway made up of rocks. i then figured it was my friends dad coming home from the bar playing a game of pool with his buddies. i then got up and proceeded on my tippy toes to say hello, not even i could hear myself walking across the wooden floor, i stood there by the window and slowly aimed my head out. i heard my neighbors pitbull beginning to growl and bark, i seen her hairs literally crawl up her spine, as i stood there trying to understand what she was barking at. i knew what i was staring at from behind was not in fact, my friends dad! from behind whatever this thing was, it was tall, gray with long arms, long legs, big head, and walked faster than any other person i have ever seen in all my life. it then turned around, ducked behind my trashcan looking straight at me with them deadly looking eyes. \r\ni was baffled by the fact that it knew i was there looking at him from behind, questioning myself. “what is that, is this really happening, how did it know i was here”. i stood there feeling like it was forever, staring deep into it’s big black glossy eyes. i then pictured seeing myself from where he was at literally seeing myself standing by the window while getting this feeling that it knew i was a child and it wasn’t there to hurt me. it then stood up continually staring at me, finally blinking , its eyes moved from both the left and right side meeting the middle of it’s eyes. as i stood there shocked at what i was seeing, it then turned around and walked away fast again, i remembered tom had a camera in his office. i ran to his office to grab his camera trying to capture proof, i finally got to the room trying to get the camera to work and it was dead, and as for it, it disappeared into thin air…. literally! \r\nthe night wasn’t done just yet, that moment before it all happened it was silent, all of a sudden every car alarm in the neighborhood went off as if an earthquake went off. there was no trembling throughout my house at the time until i seen a black helicopter passing over my house with a bright white search light, afterwards when all the cars finally went silent, i began to hear this strange whistling sound from thin air. i will never forget the sky's blood red color afterwards, the creature i seen, the dog barking, and the way it looked at me. “of course i was scared, i was a child at the time, and didn’t know what the hell i seen”! till this day it has always remained a mystery, and i plan to know exactly what the hell it was. \r\n\r\nas the night ended i ran to my mother's room frantic about what i have seen, waking them up telling them everything, they did not believe me, leaving me with an answer “william you watch too many movies, go back to sleep”! i then stayed awake throughout the remainder of the night with my head under the covers in the living room. i finally fell asleep dreaming about 6 of them standing over me with a bright light doing unimaginable things to me, after that i woke up tired and nauseated, also shocked about everything i just witnessed, still convinced what i have seen was real. when i went to school, i told the kids about what happened on the first day, one kid called me crazy stating “yeah right”! months have past, even years, and i will never forget every last detail! i haven’t told many people about it since then, and i still see him in my dreams at times. no one can convince me that it was a man in a suit, me hallucinating or the simple fact that i watch too much movies. i know what i seen, i will never forget! i still ask myself to this day, was i infact abducted. i will never know because of the fact, people usually have no recognition of there abduction.  \r\nwhat do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s), Other,

garden area with my family. luckily i had my sony hd hand held camera. at first i noticed the object shining brightly in the sky, but not moving too quickly, that's what caught my attention. seems i had the camera i thought i'd film the object. my view at the time with the sunlight etc wasn't too great, but thought i'd get what footage i could, then have a further inspection when i returned to the uk on my wide screen hd tv. at the time i realised it was not an aircraft and wondered  if it was a large balloon reflecting the sunlight, but soon realised it seemed to be changing shape and colour. the colours were amazing and shapes formed were very strange with a beam/long piece hanging underneath which also seemed to changed shape.\r\n\r\ni felt very excited i had viewed this object, although my wife and son did not share the same feelings, like most people, they were not interested one bit.\r\n\r\ni only realised that i had viewed something special when i did a quick search on the net and noticed the odd comment or two regarding the object on that date.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object as it slowly carried on its path and as my misses was moaning at me, stopped paying attention to it.\r\n\r\nas i spotted the object a virgin 737 aircraft was approaching at a similar height and flight path, although when i finished filming i noticed that i couldn't see the aircraft

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"     on december 21, 2014 at approximately 7:37pm, at our house in monmouth, oregon; where my brother was out in our front yard taking a smoke break, i was in our living room, after bringing in groceries, with the door open when i heard my brother say, “my name\", what’s this?”  i immediately came out to the front yard.  my brother said, “look”, while pointing up.  i looked up and saw this unidentified flying object that measured about the length of our house, which is about 55-60 feet in length.  it was constructed much like a bus or a recreational vehicle or a travel trailer.  the experience was quite up front and personal.  it appeared to be holographic in nature, taking on a cloud form.  the craft looked quite huge.  it made me feel as though it were something that crawled out of a science-fiction novel.  i then called my mother, “mom, you should come out and see this!”  my mother came out and i pointed up.  we were all looking up at this huge craft that was zeroing down on our property and seemed to be photographing us, remote bio-sensing us or both.  my family and i are about as interesting as the simpsons.  i don’t know why this craft was so interested in us.  this craft hovered at about 500 feet from the ground, as if it were riding a magic carpet.  it made no engine sound and it had no lights, except for the amber dome on the front that emitted light from electrical sparks.  this amber dome seemed to be plated with something such as gold.  it seemed to be something similar to the plating of face plates on space helmets.  this plating in some areas looked like it had worn away, making it translucent in some areas of the dome.  the craft was pointing north-easterly towards the independence municipal airport in the bordering town of independence, oregon, where an airport beacon is rotating and can be seen from our house.  the craft was pointing in the direction of this beam as it was floating in the air.  monmouth and independence, oregon are two towns located about 34 and 36 miles respectively, south of mcminnville, oregon, where there has been a history of many ufo sightings and where an airport is located.  at the same time this craft was pointing in a north-easterly direction, the craft seemed to be focusing on us with this amber light that was not very bright.  this “light”, camera or bio-sensing device, was pointing right down on us.  it looked more like one of those security cameras you see under a dome in a department store.  a mechanism within the dome of this “light” would go from side-to-side and rotate back and forth as though it were photographing or remote bio-sensing us or doing some kind of remote sensing.  it was quite invasive, but i, nor others in our family really felt any fear, at least not enough to run away.  my mother did indicate later-on that she did feel afraid.  but at least i could speak for myself in stating that i was not afraid, i was fascinated.  as this mechanism moved, it would flash a faint amber light that appeared to spark at the base of the internal mechanism.  i could also hear this mechanism shifting from side-to-side as it was moving (“cachuck-cachuck”).\r\n     it was at the nose portion of this craft where the above mentioned amber dome was fixed.  i walked forward, to the end of our front yard patio, toward the craft, which was on the left side of me.  as i was looking up, i noticed the craft as the led street light shined against the bottom of the craft.  i noticed the bottom of this craft was coal black.  at this same time, i glanced at the side of the craft and saw a white skin, with a purple holographic effect.  i had good advantage of this led street light when looking at this craft.  it came down to a floating level of about 50-100 feet from the ground.  when the craft maneuvered over me, it moved back-and-forth, seeming to get coordinated as it was zeroing-in on me.  as i was standing closer to this craft, i was intensely looking into this dome.  i wanted to see how this dome mechanism was functioning.  as i stared into this dome, the craft shifted over to the right side of me and descended to a level of about 50 to 100 feet above the ground.  i was left obsessed by this event to the point that i didn’t want to let it go.  i would hear of others experiences of encountering ufos, now it was my turn and i was going to take full advantage of it!  as i continued to intently stare into the mechanism inside, the dome would move from side-to-side and rotate counter-clockwise to clockwise.  as i stared even more into this mechanism, it began rotating counter-clockwise to clockwise more and more rapidly, as though whoever was operating the mechanism was responding to my curiosity.  as this mechanism rotated, i saw this mechanism move.  i also saw amber sparks inside this dome and i heard a sliding sound as this mechanism rotated.  i backed away to go in the house to get my binoculars so i could get a better look at it.  as i backed away, the craft moved back over to the left and went back to its 500 foot level.  by the time i returned with my binoculars, my mother told me it was gone.  my mother told me it vanished in thin-air.  it was approximately a stretch of three minutes from the time it arrived, to the time it disappeared.  i have been having “flash-backs” of my experience.  just talking about this with others brings about memories of this object.  i can lay in bed at night and these “flash-backs” occur.  i had more of those “flash-backs”.  i remembered how i looked into this amber dome.  i remember watching this internal mechanism moving and began recalling in my mind how i saw the detailed areas of the mechanical parts.  at that point, in my own minds eye; i began visualizing the recessed fastening screws and the pivot joints that enabled this movable ring to turn counter-clockwise to clockwise.  i could see no mechanism in the middle of this ring to produce functionality- such as a camera.  i also saw a white tag or sticker on the side of the ring, or possibly a riveted metal tag to the side of the ring.  the ring also had rocking pivot joints along the side of the contraption, which allowed the ring to rock back-and-forth.  the device had a brown anodized coating on both the ring and brackets.  in my memory/”flash-backs”, the above, i took out some paper and a pencil and began making quick sketches.  that turned into my final refined drawings.\r\n     the craft itself was white.  it appeared to be man-made, due to what seems to be sheet metal fabricated and riveted.  the hardware itself looked as well as being man-made.  the amber dome with the movable mechanism, seems to be our technology, (like i mentioned above) with the similar structure of security cameras you see in a retail store.  the mechanism also made a sound as it was moving, suggesting to me, mechanical or analogue movement.  it did disappear in thin-air, so it appeared to have both present-day and advanced technology mixed together- otherwise, why would something like that just disappear?  towards the lower second-third of the craft, i noticed what appeared to be a communications antenna, which also suggests present-day technology.  the front-end of the craft had a forward pitch of 35 degrees.  it was on the under-side of this pitch that this amber light or camera is located.  the underside of the craft was black and had horizontal corrugated lines from front to rear.  the windows along the top portion of the craft where the glass portion would be, was recessed.  the color of the craft was white, but when i looked up at it from where i was standing, it gave-off a holographic purple color along the edge around the sides.  another striking feature, was the upper-third portion of the bottom.  it appeared to be recessed.  i am quite curious as to the function of this area.  maybe this is where the craft is navigated?\r\n     as i watched this craft, it was truly a jaw-dropping experience.  if i had dentures, they would have been on the patio.  we could not believe what we saw!\r\n     there is one thing that strikes my wonder.  the craft we saw that evening was not just a far-away craft.  it was close enough to see part of its technology.  i have been talking about this with neighbors and friends, but i have not been visited by the “men in black” (not that i am anxious to meet them) or any other government agents, telling me to “keep your mouth shut” type of threats; while others who have had not quite so profound sightings have had these types of threats from the above types of people.\r\n     i was late on reporting this issue, due to being given the “run-a-round” and “brushed-off” by agencies who made me feel ignored.  i just gave-up and did not continue pursuing, until the situation started bothering me so much that i continued my contacts.  after i gave-up pursuing, i spent my time doing research on the subject, such as trying to match my sightings of the craft i saw, with others who have possibly viewed the same object, with no success.  i got busy with writing my document and creating my sketches, which took a long time.  i have worked so hard on this material.  while the project has been fun, it has also been emotionally draining.  perhaps there will be other people who would be interested in my documentation and i am trying hard to get these sent.  i first want to make sure any material is plain and intelligible and legible.  i have an affinity for perfection and i want what i am taking the time to present, to count for something.\r\n     monmouth, oregon, with a population of 9,726 is 214 feet above sea level.  it is a city in polk county, oregon.  it is located about 34 miles south of mcminnville; 20 miles north of corvallis and 16 miles west of salem.  the coast is only a short drive of about 47 miles along us hi-way 20 to beautiful lincoln city.  monmouth is surrounded by a thriving farming community.  it is also home to the western oregon university “wolves”.\r\n\r\ni have sketches that i would like to submit.  i need to get to a digitizer and do this.  how can i continue below, with the multimedia attachment section?\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

i was no fast enough to catch up to the entity so i went back to painting when i heard the noise again a sonic boom it had done this 3 or 4 times before disappearing suddenly. out of curiosity i went to investigate the object and that's when things got weird i heard something rustling near some bushes. i froze in fear waiting for the entity to reveal it's self, camera ready it jumped out of the bush snarling and sniffing i snapped a photo and forgot to turn off the sound it heard the noise and went to investigate it got around 30 feet away from me and didn't notice me. out of fear , i was ready to turn back and get out of there. but the curiosity got to me, i knew of a local sewer that i thought it could have tried to take shelter at. so i brought a flashlight and got my camera. after what seemed about 200 yards of walking, i heard footsteps other than mine. i turned off the flashlight and yelled, \"i have a knife and i'm not afraid to use it.\" then i heard a roar and growl come from the end of tunnel. i froze in fear and dropped my flashlight. as it rolled back and fourth, flickering on and off. i waited for it to stop moving. i stood there the next thing that i saw haunted me... it was a human - reptile creature staring at me with eyes that reflected that light of flash light. i quickly started running until i was about a mile away from the area. i never went back, but for what i know it could still be hiding in the sewers waiting. for those who read this be warned ! it can still be out there in the elk grove sewer system waiting for its next prey, head my advice

memory of the siting. \r\ni was in my apartment home with my cats. at night i always open all blinds and curtains because my place is all windows on that side and i like to enjoy the evenings. i also have my sliding door open so the cats can go in and out on the patio.\r\ni was walking from the kitchen to my living room, went to sit on the couch, and suddenly saw these two super bright yellowish headlights, which people are calling \"orbes\". they appeared to be coming right toward me, and the were a decent size, coasting along maybe 20 mph.\r\nthe strangest thing is i always run get my cell phone to take photos of weird things i see, for example all of the drones in the area lately. i have seen several hovering around people's yards, etc. i have been taking photos of drones.\r\nthe strange thing about this \"thing\" is that i only remember seeing it at that moment for maybe a minute and i remember nothing else. i was sitting on the couch, and then went to my window and out on my balcony and there was nothing. i remember it looked like it was heading toward our building with the intention of going over our building. \r\nlike i said, i seem to have lost time or something because i definitely would have been very aware and snapping photos of this thing as it was so close to me right outside my window!\r\nalso, my cats were acting strange ripping through the house.\r\n\r\nthe other one that i saw later, within an hour or so...I was taking photos of it, and went inside and thought i better document the time so i can report it, and it was 5:45 am. i was in total shock. i could not believe it was 5:45 am, and what did i do the whole night? the weirdest feeling ever. i know it sounds totally crazy but at this point i don't even care what it sounds like. it happened!\r\n\r\ni took photos of the second siting, which looked like the exact same object but traveling a different direction and much higher up, still heading toward my place coming from the east. i lost time with both of them and my cats freaked with both of them.","distance":"21-100

plane. it had lights that seem to go around and also, a white strobe light flashed. the ufo went north, then seem to hover and went south, but not exact same path. then it seem that another one appeared more south, that traveled north and was hover for a while, then went south. these were far away. we went inside after about 1/2 hour. my husband brought to my attention, that there was something weird going on with the security camera. there were orbs flying around on our south and west cameras. these varied in size. they were several constantly flying around. also, a very weird shape that did appear, that was very bright white in color. it seem to change shape. my husband went, out there with his flashlight to see, if he could see these orbs. he did not see them. but, they were still flying around while he was out there, as you can see on the recording. there also, was a light in the distance, that blinked in a regular pattern, that was constant stationary. there has never been a light there. this went on, from dusk to dawn. i looked back on earlier that day, and there were things flying around that looked kind of like birds, but flew faster. this is all recorded.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path

on it an could see through part of it. thanks for looking oh an if i have it downloaded there is a picture of an orb that i went an changed the color of it to see if it showed anything an if you look
