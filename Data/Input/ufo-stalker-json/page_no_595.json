always get something in my shots. as i did this night. the only thing i actually saw was a huge bright white circular light up by the mountain top of cabbage hill an i had seen this light before. it looked as though it was getting bigger an bigger as it come closer to earth then just stayed the same for a short time then just seemed to glide away from earth at a steady pace. it never zoomed away but just at a cruising pace if this make sense. i just snapped some pictures of the dark sky an towards that light an this is what i got. i have several other pictures of different lights in the sky some of orbs an i believe ufo oh my gosh i have so many. i have taken through the years an showed my friends an have even sent some in but i never heard back from anyone so i just blew it off. as i never really cared who believed me or not i have always got to see what i wanted to see an didn't care who believed me or not. lol i have also up close seen one fly over the top of me while in hot tub an years later i was watching discovery channel i think an they had mentioned it on there that people had seen this same ufo. it was back when we had that huge disaster i think in 2004 or 2005 when thousands of people died from a tsunami i think it was. that was a fin nominal night for me to see this thing it was like it had reflector panels all over it an it was reflecting the orange street lights, very huge an was moving extreamlly slow across the sky. i believe that's why we cannot see them at night most of the time is because they reflect the color of the night sky. anyway here are also some other pictures i have taken at different times. ignore the date on them as i have put them on discs at different times also my camera date is wrong.  my pictures are slowly all disappearing as someone is getting them some how an making them go by by. please not most of the time i cannot see anything until i get home an look at my pictures. also there are pics of comet ison night you need to move up close to see what i see.  most all of them you need to move up close. hope you like my photo's if you do please let me know as my friend has one that cannot be explained if is an actual up close snapshot of one with detail. sorry could only fit the ones up by cabbage hill","distance":"Over One

beagle that loved to go out for a walk i dragged to our front door towards the glowing object on the top of the mountain(hill) and was so frozen in fright that it was spread eagle, dragged on its stomach and peed itself all the way to the door.\r\non this occassion, as a mechanical engineer student was also frightened and plans to go to the top of the hill the next morning with my dad was all forgotten the next morning and not remembered until after his death in 1986.  it was a live pulsating ellipse on the top of the desolate hill.  on another occurrence a dozen  of us were one our private ice pond and observed the white disc moving slowly/stopping/accelerating toward new york at incredible speed.\r\n  the third sighting was a few years later over culver lake in nj and i have three slides of it, the last slide distinctly showed a domed saucer shape with what appeared to have three small pods on the underside.  i was an aerospace/optical engineer at the time and had our laboratory study the slice for grain faults and such and there was not any signs of film problems.\r\n  very hard at my age to type so that is about it.  as this was in the 1950's and 1960's there was

ending about 9 minutes later. i was using my iphone app, iss spotter.  i had not used the app for at least 3 months but earlier that day as it appeared to be going to be a clear sky i thought i would set its alarm to remind me as there was a viewing opportunity that night.  at the time (late afternoon) i was considering using my nikon d700 camera with 300mm lens to photograph it but thought i wouldn’t bother as it would just probably end up being a white dot on the screen.  i was working on my pc when the alarm went off possibly 5 minutes before the iss was due to fly over.  i went down stairs and asked (half jokingly as i knew they would say no) my wife and daughter if they wanted to come out and see the iss fly over.  i was right they were watching a film.  i was in my garden and using the app located where i should stand to get the best view of it as i’m surrounded by houses.  to the predicted second i saw the iss in the west at 273 degrees about 40 degree elevation.  just as it peaked above my head i moved around to my patio (10 feet) to watch it go over my house directly above.  however, at 21:37 as i was looking directly up my gaze was diverted to 3 dim maroon coloured lights moving directly above heading south direction at a low altitude. possibly 1500-2000 feet north to south! these 3 round dim glowing red lights were silently moving in a perfect equilateral triangle formation with one of the points trailing behind.  each light was the apparent size of a traffic light viewed at 50 feet away. i saw the object for about 6-7 seconds as it flew overhead. whilst i could not see the object, it blacked out the stars thus giving the illusion it was a solid triangular shape.   i was also uncertain of its altitude until i notice the perspectives were changing.  suddenly from an equilateral shape of the triangle narrowed and the lights were no longer round but looked saucer shape (like an upturned saucer) bulging from underneath.  once they passed above and were at an elevation of about 55 degrees heading away from me in a southerly direction i noticed the trailing red light moved towards the right leading light as though it was going to barrel roll around it, again this was the illusion it gave but after consideration and trying to make sense of what i saw (as i have no explainable reference to compare it too)i think the object was slowly spinning. at that point i ran indoors to get witnesses (my wife and daughter) but when they both came out 10-15 seconds later it was gone.  the lights were not really bright but in size they we about a quarter the size of the moon.  the object was easily dismissed by its unique form and silence to be an aircraft or aircrafts and yes, it was silent! the size of the triangle if at 1500 feet away would have fitted inside the constellation, the great bear stars that form its quadrant (would make the craft 500-600 feet across, meaning the glowing 3 lights would have been about 30 feet in diameter).  if that makes sense.  the speed if at 1500 feet i would estimate to be about 300 mph but not sure except it was fast. i regularly look at the skies generally i can often see satellites, shooting stars, commercial airlines, light aircraft and helicopters flying at night as we have the london flights go past.  i’ve even seen chinese lanterns. the object i saw was heading north to south but there was a sw breeze that evening and therefore was not being blown by the wind.  the object i saw was totally unique. i would love to see it again!  i hope there are other witnesses who saw it to collaborate this statement. research on the internet lead me to believe this was the top secret tr3-b flying triangle operated by usa.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was highly confident that what i saw was a tr3a/b model\r\n\r\n4. at first the object was going in a straight line west bound.  however within a few minutes it turned due south and that is when i could see the shape of the object/aircraft.  the triangular shape and placement of the lights immediately gave it away.  having been excited at what i witnessed, i ran down stairs and could see the object through the tree lines.  it appeared that it was landing at one of the local county airports. it also sounded as though there was a slight hum.  10/25/15 was a very clear night with perfect visibility.  i stayed outside for another 15 minutes and than saw the object go in a circular direction (i cannot estimate the distance it was from where i was standing) and go east bound.  again the triangular white lights and red light (in the center of the object) gave it away.  i do not know of any current commercial or military aircraft that has this particular light pattern.  \r\n\r\n5.  i was very excited at what i had saw.  it confirmed what i have seen on your show plus doing my own research of top secret black project aircraft.\r\n\r\n6. the object flew out of site.

crosshairs of my telescope 114az by meade co. #2 i have been watching this same ufo now for a few years so i can pick it out pretty easily in the night sky i know its patterns. #3 the object in question always appears at first to be star like then shortly after watching its patterns in the sky i notice its the same thing i have been watching for sometime now.#4 this object always seems to have a flicker to it in that the lights that it has flicker and is small in the beginning and its pattern always seems to start in the northern sky and goes east,after spotting it in the northern sky it always goes south until it appears to stop and hover in the eastern sky.This object has a very strange hovering pattern in that it moves in circles then goes left then goes down and then back up at the same time moving very slowly towards the east .This object always appears just after dark and can be seen  until 7;30 or saw the following morning as it did this time.I do notice that as it becomes lighter in the morning hours it takes somewhat of a shape to it but it is hard to dtermine exactly what it is at this time. #5 i find this extremely interesting and can not fatham why this has never been noticed from an observitory.I completely understand how this must sound but this must be seen......As i have said before these sightings will cease as the winter months get further along however, i dont think this object ever goes away i believe we just cant see it because of the cloud cover that is asocciated with the winter months.What do i have to do here to get someone here to view this object !!!!!!! #6 i lose sight of this object as the morning sun climbs higher and higher,it is then i always see a sort of shape to it but cannot make it out with my telescope.This object as the sun gets brighter and brighter gets dimmer and dimmer however as i have noticed all along it is always the last thing seen in the morning sky when all the other stars have gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"08:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

talking about ufo's and such but basically let it go. at least i did. later i saw my friend doing his \"meditation thing\" and told him to knock it off because he was freaking me out. around 1am or so. i actually woke up due to a noise. it was a humming or pulsating type of noise but very low. i woke my friend up and he immediately went from his tent and stood where he could see the craft come from quite a ways away and stayed there until the craft came close enough to see it vividly and then, after the craft pointed a white and wide light around the area and then towards my friend, then a bluish, skinnier light on my friend. the craft then landed. i never left my tent but had a perfect view of the whole thing. unlike my friend, i was, and to this day i am, very afraid. there are reasons my friend is not afraid but, if your organization decides to speak with him, he can explain that. even though i have been telling my friend to report his experiences to your organization for a long time, i don't want any part of it because it is very upsetting. my friend finally allowed me to tell your organization about these events despite his mistrust of law enforcement, the media, etc because when he did report these items, he was ridiculed, embarrassed and at one point, was threatened. he's not afraid, as proven by the shootout he had some time back when the men who previously threatened him showed up at his home and shot at him until he started shooting back. my friend has told me that he had some type of conversation with the three beings who exited the craft that night. they kind of looked like humans but even the shortest one was probably around seven feet tall. my friend is 6'3\" and pretty big so i base my measures on that. \r\n\r\nthe \"writings\" my friend received right in front of me:\r\nmy friend is a physicist and developer of some technologies i don't even understand but they have to do with clean energy, water treatment, vehicle that don't use fuel or solar or batteries and a few other items. i am one of the few witnesses who saw his his tests where he created some cool but weird weather anomalies, has provided powe to two homes almost 20 miles from his technology and have seen the prototype vehicle that doesn't use batteries, fuel etc. the biggest item in my opinion is a formerly clear piece of plexiglass that has two very odd writings or carvings on it. we actually don't know what was used to put the designs on the plexiglass. this happened during a very cool experiment my friend was doing with another device he built. i don't understand the whole thing but it basically create a lot of energy and i think magnetism and created a kind of wavy area inside of the circular part of his device. among the many times i was helping me friend, he decided to, as he said, \"see if his calculations and theories were correct or not\", he kind of tossed the plexiglass into the center of the wavy part and almost immediately it popped out. he thought his device may have not worked until i picked up the plexiglass and was blown away by how this blank plexiglass now had some kind of carvings on it. \r\nmy friend has allowed me to contact your organization and allowed me to give you his contact info so if you would like to know more about our experiences and his technology and devices, you can contact him by using the information i filled out. if you don't, that's ok too. thank you for your time. by the way, neither my friend or i know what the writing or carvings mean so if you find out i know my friend would really appreciate it if you let him know.

got up,and went outside to check, i found no-one, but found a very large indention in the ground in the shape of a large foot print, where the grass had been pressed into the ground and the ground had been pressed down about 1/2 inch. i showed it to her but she told me she did not think it could be a track. later that evening i noticed my trail cam at the end of my drive way was blinking red indicating it had low/dead batteries. i thought that was strange as i had just changed them the day before. they normally last up to two weeks on a charge. so i retrieved the camera, and replaced the battery and took the memory card out of it to look at it. at 6:16 a.M. it showed a very weird set of lights that seemed to be moving at a high speed hovering above the ground, going past the camera, it got one shot of the object, then one shot of the light as it receded. then 19 seconds after the object passed the batteries in the camera went dead. this is not normal...I am not sure what went on

support engineer for an aviation company and understand flying aircraft- this was a rocket headed for orbit as it flickered and became smaller with accompanying rocket sounds. during the event, we noticed a small light separate from the rocket and go towards the west- it appeared like sparks at first. i observed the rocket until it disappeared as it climbed, growing smaller. my wife then commented that there was a parachute up in the sky. i looked up and saw what i would characterize as a jet airplane going from north to south at a high rate of speed towards the north of my location. i followed the craft visually and determined that 1) it was moving at a high rate of speed and 2) was illuminated as a bright light - not like any aircraft i am familiar with. i began to track the craft and videoed it with my iphone video. it sped to the south of my location and i videoed several clips. it then made a full circle maneuver in the sky and continued to the south. the light then disappeared. i reviewed the videos i took and was very surprised to see no view of the sky, but close up of the fence and grass. my daughter was in the hot tub behind me as i filmed and watched as i
