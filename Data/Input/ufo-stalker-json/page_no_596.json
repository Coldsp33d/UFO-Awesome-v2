family lived in an apartment complex in the city. our unit was 2 bedroom and 1 bath. my parent's bedroom and my bedroom were close to each other. at the time, i was the only child.\r\n\r\nevery night i had the same terrible dream. and i mean every night. it got so bad my parents had to take me to a specialist who attempted to treat me medically because of the same re-occurring night mares. never wavering in much detail of what would happen. i was so afraid i would crawl on the ground trying to sneak underneath my parents bed to sleep. it was the only time at night i felt somewhat safe. many times my parents would look under the bed to find me only to put me back in my room. i drove them crazy because of my fear of the dark and my night mare.\r\n\r\na few times i would see small weird white shaped lights up in the corners of the bedroom ceiling but it would always start like this...I would wake up in my bed. paralyzed, unable to move or speak. i knew something was coming down the right side of the hall way from my bedroom door. no matter how hard i tried to scream or run to my parents bedroom, i was unable to do so. even if i went to bed with the covers over my head, it would still happen. \r\n\r\na being/entity would appear in my doorway. always side profile at first. then it would wistfully (like a military 90 degree marching turn) face me. i was filled with terror and closed my eyes. i would then re-open my eyes and the entity would be standing over my bed. i never observed any arms or legs. only it's upper torso, head and face. it looked reptilian with big black solid eyes and big scaly skin. it would just stare at me and i would be in utter terror. there was never any communication between the two of us; just dead silence. \r\n\r\nsomehow i would get turned over onto my stomach; in one movement like i was floating on air. then out of the corner of my eyes i would see a small machine come into the room. like the size and shape of a small electric coffee grinder. it was floating in mid-air and it made a noise sounding similar to a hand-held egg beater. my shirt went get pulled partially way up my and my pants would get partially pulled down. it would then do something to my back, usually my lower back. i never felt any pain but i was so scarred and terrified. i always thought it was going to drill a hole into me or cut me in half but it never did. i then would pass out awaking the next morning.\r\n\r\nthe sunlight would be coming in through a window overlooking my bed and i would know and feel safe. i would then forget about the night's ordeal like it never happened. only to feel terror and fright when it was time for me to go to bed that night. \r\n\r\nbecause the nightmares were always the same, i gave the reptilian a name and the machine a name too. i told my parents their names as well. \r\n\"ho\" for the entity and \"noisy\" for the machine thing. in fact, my parents to this day remember ho and noisy; the 2 things from my re-occurring nightmares when i was small boy.\r\n\r\ni can't say for certain if this was an alien abduction because i have no re-collection of being taken inside a craft. but if i am not insane and this really did happen to me numerous times, then i would call it an alien visitation/experimentation.\r\n\r\nmy hope is someone from mufon will contact me. i would like a referral to a hypnotist. i believe i may still be suffering post-traumatic syndrome from these events. there is no logic to this. as i mentioned before, i am 45 years old but can still remember these events to this day.","distance":"20 Feet or

central standard time (saskatchewan), my mrs. and i where at friends place on the deck outside. i had been looking up into the eastern sky as i normally spend a lot of time looking into the night sky when we are out and about, when i had noticed there was a light moving at a rapid speed. i thought nothing of it, thinking it may be a satellite, small white light moving east. then all of a sudden as i had thought of the light being something other then a satellite it had stopped. i had got the attention of my mrs. and our friend, and pointed out the light. it then turned 90 degrees moving south to south west rapidly, i had noticed color changes in the light when it started moving south greens and blue with a possible violet color in the mix as well but staying mostly silverish in color . as the object had moved rapidly to the south, south west when i thought about it being a ufo it had stopped again and moved in a circular motion then darted east then north then west then moved south in the sky and suddenly disappeared, thus proving it was not any sort of airplane, bird, helicopter ect. the object seemed to move and change when i directed my thoughts to it. saying to myself in my head. what are you? are you a ufo? what are you doing or looking for? can we communicate to each other? are all questions i had asked in my head but where directed to the light. i was feeling a sort of awe, i was not shocked i was not scared i felt happy, i wanted to try communicate more with it. being in the city was a downfall though. i am quite aware of air traffic over our city and this was not of normal aircraft that you would find in our area.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

number of sightings that took place in or around this year and location, it could have very well been the same craft. i work 3rd shift at a local factory in flowery branch ga. my lunch break, at that time, would have been 4:00 am till 4:30 am. i had walked out to a friends car that i was riding back and forth to work with to eat lunch. i always eat lunch in my vehicle and listen to the radio. (coast to coast). as i cleared the north end of the building head to the car, i seen a red light off in the near distance. about 10 miles from my location. i didn't think much of it at first thinking it was a red warning like on a near by tower. i eat my lunch, and then walked 25 yards to a designated smoking area on the corner of the parking lot. as i left the car, i noticed the red light once again, but this time i felt it was something else. there were 2 other co-workers already siting on the curb as i walked up. i made a half hearted statement saying, \"i'm not taking my eye off that light till it moves!\" at that very moment, the object started moving straight at us and climbing to the right at the same time. it couldn't have been more then a 1000 feet over our heads. i got a clear view of what i was looking at. it had a spread v shape wing figure to it, dark, seemed to hardly make any noise. (i do wear hearing aids) my comment to the other co-workers with me was, \"it looks like a f117 stealth fighter jet!\" soon after, we all when back in to work. not much discussion was made about it. later the next day, it stuck in my mind that the craft was to low and seem smaller then what i would think the size of a f117 would be. so, i got on the internet and started doing a little research. what i found out was, we were looking at a x74 drone. at that time, it was still considered a top secret aircraft. \"why gainesville\", i asked myself. a few months later i was at a local shopping center (home depot) at the end of mcever rd. in gainesville, at the exact location i believed the craft was hovering at. (that's right, i said \"hovering\") behind the stores is a cliff hill. at the top of the cliff are communication towers. whether or not, that was the reason for a drone to be there is anyone's guess. it could have been no more then a training operation. but, here's my report of what i seen that night.\r\n","distance":"Over One

differently. he saw 3 very bright lights shining through the clouds and thought it was the sun trying to poke through. but there were 3 bright lights with beams coming from them and they were directed at the ground. it wasn't until he took a second picture that the 3 lights to the left were in a triangular shape. the middle lights out of the 3 with the beams looks as if it was merging with the light at the end on the right.\r\n\r\nthey are not street lights. you can see plainly the street lights below them and the shining lights are way higher then any lights on the ground. and it was a cloudy day. these lights are shining through the clouds.\r\nunfortunately he didn't know what he captured until after the fact and only got the two pictures before having to go into the building for his fathers dialysis treatment, so only two pictures were taken and he couldn't wait to see what happened because of his appointment but like i said he didn't even know what he captured. he thought it was a sunset but it was even way to early for the sun to be coming up anyway.\r\n\r\nmy brother & i are both ufo fanatics and always looking up. my brother lives in ca and has so many pictures of ufos

of time in the house alone at night as my grandad was usually  in the pub. my granny was the mother of 9 very straight and to the point . she was not one for making up stories or being  interested  in ufos she was only interested  in what she called real life. \r\nthe house they lived in backed on to fields leading up to hills and mountains  at the time it wad very dark and creepy for us kids at night. \r\nmy grandparents was in her kitchen tidying up when she opened  the back door to put the bin out. her story was relayed  to various  family  members a few days later in a very matter of fact way she said she opened the door and saw a silver space ship come down the door opened and 2 wee men got out and did as she worded it a wee dance. got in after a wee minute and flew away. \r\nwe asked her about raising the alarm or telling  the world her response was they weren't doing anybody any harm and it was none of her business.  \r\ni know it was a long time ago but i still  wish to this day i had been there. she had over 30 grandkids and none of us were there. her attitude  to the whole thing was as if she was telling you about the weather.

were now going to get a pie at marie calendars i saw what looked like 2 suns. i said look at that. we both saw it. the clouds were over this bright light and as we were driving looked again and the clouds were thinning out and i saw a small rainbow. i'm thinking spacecraft it's got to be a spacecraft. i was calm just thinking to myself and then i though oh take a picture of this because seeing 2 suns was not true. i took a picture and the sun was.In my eyes and i was hoping i a picture of the clouds, i looked up and thought i would take another picture just incase the firt one didn't show anything. i kept looking at that spot for maybe a minute and the car was changing position and i couldn't see it anymore. we got home, took the stuff out of the car and went and got my phone and

showed her the picture and she said well the air force is right here. mom said that i was watching way too much of the alien stuff and asked are you an alien? i knew that i might have something so i
