street from a government facility, the underground pentigon and down the road from camp david.\r\n\r\ni do not remember what time of night it was but i remember i was sleeping with my head at the end of the couch facing towards the entrance to my parents bedroom door.  at the time i slept in the living room because i had a fear to sleep by myself idk why.\r\n\r\ni remember feeling a tap on my shoulder.  i said  no let me sleep.   the tap got more powerful i said let me sleep and i turned to see a figure all blurry because i was not wearing my glasses not one but 2.  in what was a space suit i think greay metalic like.  the figured were skinny and somewhat shortish tall with grayish skin.  the heads looked like the shape of king tut with his hat on.. it had somewhat that shape.  the eyes were elongated and big.  i said let me sleep and i feel back asleep and turned back around.\r\n\r\ni remember one of them taking its hand and forcing me back around and i looked them directly in the face.  i said something like mom!! dad!!! and called for my dog at the time but i got no response it was like i was the only one in the room besides the beings.\r\n\r\ni picked up my glasses and they said we are taking you on a trip.  they didnt speak but i heard that said to me idk how.\r\n\r\ni remember stating i need to get changed first if that is okay and they agreed.  i got pants on i remember running down stairs and getting changed and they followed that part is a blur  but then i remember a cut seen like in a movie.\r\n\r\ni was inside the interior of a spacecraft.  the room had alot of futuristic electronics and a control panel.  i remember it like it was yesterday.  the wierd thing is i mentioned can i play a cd that i brought with me.  they said sure with a head nod.  i remember the exact cd it was.  it was nsync there first album which came out in 1998.  evidently they hated it because they ejected it right away.  i do remember i asked alot of questions and was very talkative and wanted to know about everything waht is this what does this do ect.\r\n\r\nwhen i looked outside the window, i remember passing the moon and a few other planets.  i do not remember which planet it was.. but it was either jupitor or the red planet mars.. i remember the space ship driving towards one of those planets.. mars it was mars.  when the ship landed i do not remember that but i do remember seeing the inside of what looked like a home base or a civilizxation of many creatures like them.  there was metalic everywhere.  i can picture it in my head but hard to describe.. i remember giant wizard of ozz like metalic doors that were open to what looked like a hanger with other ships just like there i dont remember wht they looked like otehr then i saw alot of other creatures like them walking around.  \r\n\r\nthey said to me we want you to become one of us.  we want you to be one of us.  i didnt know what that ment.  i said no  i dont want to..  thats all i can remember.. then i remember waking up the next morning in my parents bedroom on there bed away from the couch which i slept in the night before.  as i called out to my mother.. i remember that my body was stiff and i coudnt move my body and as i started to speak.. that even froze up for what seemed like almopst a good 5 to 6 minutes.. when i unfroze i got up in shock and went to my mother whos a nurse and said i coudnt move my body i was froxzen.  she explained something to me and said only senior citizens get that condition and your not old enough to have felt that.\r\n\r\nthe night before i do  remember being in my bedroom downstairs at night and seeing lights bright orb lights flashing into my room from outside i thought nothing of it because i was a kid.  then the incodent the following night.\r\n\r\nto this day, that memory has allways been in my memory.. and it was since that night.. i have this constant fear of looking up at the night sky as if im afraid something will come get me.  now that i am 30 years old... i have eased up a bit but im still afraid of the dark so i sleep with one light on when i sleep and i allways sleep a certain direction so i can see what is coming towards me andi ts allways facing towards my bedroom door.  that was a habit i picked up because of what i have descrivbed as probably a dream.  since then.. idk if my body has changed or if i noticed anything different in my life..  though at night i feel as i am constantly being watched so i d o not go out at night alone.","distance":"20 Feet or

daughter to work.  as i was driving into my driveway and got out of my car i happened to look up in the sky and noticed these zig zag lines in the sky (trails). it was a clear morning and the sun was just dawning, there was no wind and the trails looked like they were turning at 45 degree angles.  ive seen airplane con trails but these are like none that i have seen before. when i took out my phone to take pictures it was like the trails just stayed there usually the ones from the airplanes seem to fade but these didnt.  i went into the house and was curious about what i saw and after a few minutes i went outside and the trails were gone.  i shared the pictures with my sister and she streched the picture and at the beginning of the con trail there is a metallic orb that is something i didnt notice.  upon further review of the pictures there were five metallic orbs.  at first i could not believe what i was seeing i wasnt afraid i was more stunned than anything else, but at the same time for some reason i understood thast we are not alone in the universe. i know this sounds crazy but it was as if i was happy to see what i saw.  i dont know what to do because i dont know how

always showing her stuff in the sky, so without hesitastion she runs back outside with me. it was getting closer and we noticed the light was oblong, kinda like a twinkie standing on end, as it got closer we could see the ship below and in front of the light, it looked like panels with joint lines, or rivot lines is what came to mind, it got a little closer and i'm thinking i'm fixing to get a good look at this thing, and then it disappeared behind the moon,.. this thing is over 190,000 miles away and i'm thinking i'm going to get a good look at it... the ship must had been lit up by the reflection of the moon, and the light was a quarter the size of the moon... a second later it comes out the other side, and goes for a ways and the light goes out, i try to stay on the trajectory to see if i could see it again, then back where the light went out, another one comes on, and goes for a little ways and goes out, and again , about the same spot another light comes on and goes for a ways and goes out, and again back about the same spot another light comes on, but this one stays on until it just goes out of sight....The four of them together had to be the size of the moon... my

outside in the backyard looking up at sky to see if it would be a good night for star gazing. it was about 8-8:30 pm. there was the typical \"marine layer\" of clouds because we live right on the beach and it makes any star gazing impossible. i looked to the east because a bright orange light got my attention. it looked like maybe a helicopter, then 2 more joined it and they flew sse and formed a backwards \"c\" then 3 more after them formed like a boomerang shape. while the second set was forming the 1st 3 shot away into the cloud cover. the second set did the same thing traveling in formation then disappearing into the clouds. then real a big one by itself flew along the same path as the ones before, and another single one following the one before it and one more after that. they flew in a horizontal line went up sharply  like 45 degree angle then disappeared into clouds too. the last 3 did not do this at the same time but followed the same path each alone but following the same path. when i first saw them i yelled to my brother who ran and got binoculars. when viewed through them you couldn't make out anything but a round orange light.We couldn't see any light source, or craft of any kind. we knew they were not any kind of mexican aircraft like helicopters because baja calif  no one has reported this thats why i am doing itsimply does not own 9 of them. ever since childhood when our grandfather introduced us to the wonders of stargazing my brother and i are always looking up into the stars with anything we can get our hands on or just with the naked eye. we have never seen anything like this. we ruled out balloons of any kind, chinese paper lanterns, aircraft (no blinking lights) or noise plus flying below cloud cover so fast, satellites, lights reflecting off satellites.  from beginning to end lasted about 30-35 min. the last 3 were about 5 min apart. i have been looking to see if anyone saw this but  \r\n

conference. around 10:30 pm i decided to go to my hotel room and pack so that i could catch my flight in the morning. my roommate was already in the room and was watching tv. he had already packed his things. there was a strange bottle by my bed which had green liquid inside and a label which said bio cleaner on it. i commented to my roommate how odd it was for that bottle to be there and that the hotel staff would use bio cleaner to clean a hotel room. i then moved to bottle from beside my bed to behind the tv because i did not want to sleep next to it. we talked for approximately an hour as i packed my things and got ready for bed. then we both tried to sleep. about 30 minutes later my roommate asked if i was still awake. i said yes i could not sleep and he said he felt the same way. he got up got dressed and went downstairs to see who else was still awake. after he left the room i heard him loudly talking in the hallway with two other male voices. then i heard some oriental voices as well. i felt very afraid after hearing the escalated voices in the hallway and curled up in a ball in my bed and began to cry silently. as i was crying i heard the hotel room door began to open. i laid in bed and prayed for my roommate to come back quickly. i felt like i could not move i wanted to look at the door to see who was coming into the room but could not. i may have blacked out for a minute or two from the fear i was feeling. when i opened my eyes i saw three men in the room with me to or taller and one was shorter. one taller man was at the foot of the bed holding my legs.  one man was holding my arm down and one man was holding my head. at first i thought they were trying to have sex with me or raped me. i was very afraid and kept struggling to get free from them and asking them why they were doing this to me. as i looked at the faces they changed to people i had encountered at the conference. i began to question if these people were hurting me for some reason. then the faces changed again back to their original ones i had seen. the three men kept talking to me and telling me various things such as this is for your own good. we are not hurting you these people are hurting you. we need to know if there's anything left. you need to stop talking to people or bad things will happen to you.\r\nthen the man who was holding my arm pulled out a needle and tried to stick it into my arm i kept fighting him. the man who was holding my head kept trying to put a white pill into my mouth and make me swallow it. i kept spitting the white pill out and turning my head away from him to see what the man holding my arm down was doing. i'm not sure what the man who was holding my legs was doing to me. at one point the man holding my head push the white pill way into the back of my mouth and put some water in my mouth then tilted my head back and forced me to swallow. at the same time the man holding my arm gave me an injection and then i suddenly felt very calm and sleepy. the man by my head gently tilted my head toward him and told me he would make sure that i was ok and would not swallow my tongue but that it was best for me to sleep through the rest of this and not remember what was happening to me. i must have fallen asleep at this point. i could after a while feel my body being washed down. it felt as though i was being systematically washed for a reason. i was being moved in different positions and washed down with something and then my skin was dried off. then i must've fallen asleep again because the next thing i remember is the hotel room door opening and my roommate coming back into the room. i was still too afraid to move or talk to him but felt relieved that he was now in the room. he got back into bed and went to sleep. he kept waking up and asking me if i was ok because i kept sitting up in bed trying to stretch my legs and my body. i told him that i hurt really bad and felt like something bad had happened to me. he commented that you can feel like that after they visit you. i did not ask him what he meant by that. i laid down and tried to sleep but could not. my legs still hurt and i felt very raw vaginally inside as well as itchy and various parts of my body. i waited until i thought he was asleep and then went into the bathroom to check my body for bruises because i hurt so badly. i couldn't sleep so i left the hotel room and went for a walk downstairs and out by the pool to see if anyone else was still awake. the only other people a week in the hotel where the cleaning crew. i rode the elevator back up to the second floor and when i got off there was a sign by the elevator which said \"remember your manual do not forget your instructions. \" \r\nthe sign struck me as odd it also had a room name listed on it i decided to investigate. i went down the hallway and found the room and put my ear to the door. i could hear movement inside of the room and then decided to see if my room key wouldn't open the door. i inserted it into the slot and it did not open i tried it again. the noise inside the room stopped. i then slowly walked back to my hotel room stopping to use a public restroom on the way. after i use the bathroom i looked in the stool and noticed what appeared to be white tissue. i thought of reaching and grabbing it but then decided to just not. i had already had two mysterious pregnancies and did not want to go down the road of unexplained tissue again so i flushed the toilet. i then went back to my hotel room to try to sleep. i still could not sleep so got up and took my shaver and went back down to the public restroom to shave my legs. i then tried to sleep again in the hotel room i may have dozed off for a minute or two but mostly just laid there sore and wide-awake. at about 5:30 am i could not lay there any longer and decided it was time for me to get up. i got dressed my roommate woke up slightly and asked if i was leaving. i told him yes that i could not sleep and thought it best for me to just go to the airport. he wished me a safe flight and told me to be careful. as i waited in the lobby for the airport shuttle three other men also we're waiting. they looked very similar to the three men that i had seen in my hotel room earlier that night. they stood together outside of the hotel and kept looking at me as we were waiting for the shuttle. we all boarded the shuttle together. i sat behind the tall man in the back and the other two man sat on the left side of the shuttle. i felt very disorientated or drugged but tried to shake it off. a song came on the radio and i sang along silently to it still trying to make sense of what it happened to me earlier that evening. none of the men talk to each other on the shuttle to the airport. two of the men got off the shuttle with me. they followed me to the check in point and then told me to have a nice flight and try to forget or something to that extent. i looked down at my luggage and looked up and they were gone. i'm not sure if they disappeared into the crowd or just disappeared.\r\nskipping ahead to the airplane flight home my seat was in the back of the plane and a man sat next to me in the aisle seat with a seat between us. during the whole flight he never talk to me but i felt very tired and disorientated so i slept for most of the flight. i was aware of people moving around on the plane but just could not shake the tiredness that i was feeling. when the plane landed in minneapolis minnesota and we were getting off, the man who had sat next to me waited until it was time for me to get off then he got up and went out the back door of the airplane and disappeared. it struck me as odd for a passenger to exit through the rear of the plane. i got off the plane and waited for a minute or two in the ramp to the airport to see if the man would come this direction. no one else came off the plane. i just decided it was best to forget and went to find my luggage.\r\ni got my luggage and waited for the shuttle bus to bring me to my vehicle because i had parked away from the airport. two-man got onto the shuttle with me they reminded me of the two men that i had seen earlier that morning in california. they did not talk to each other much and did look at me from time to time. they got off the shuttle before me and then the driver brought me to my vehicle.\r\nas i drove away from minneapolis toward my home my body began to hurt again and i began to remember the night before- being touched and washed and talked to. the further i drove the more afraid i felt until finally i pulled over at a gas station and purchased a car charger for my phone because i had lost mine and then i called the mufon investigator who had worked with me on previous experiences i've had. i told her what i thought had happened and she advised me to go to the nearest hospital and get checked out, which i did.\r\n\r\nafter talking with other people from minnesota who had attended the conference they told me that at the time i was claiming to have been visited or assaulted that a group of them had been down in near the hotel lobby and that the hotel fire alarm system had gone off. a few of them had also joked about seeing a craft hovering near the hotel.","distance":"20 Feet or

being held. we have just finished the banquet. a few of us were sitting in the lounge talking and enjoying a drink. i ordered a beer but only drink a couple sips of it and did not have anymore to drink that evening. the dj who played music and a group of us started dancing. around 11pm i went to my hotel room because i was attending a workshop early the next morning and wanted to be well rested. i went into my hotel room and the person i was sharing it with was already in bed. i fell asleep quickly. around approximately midnight i was woken up and felt like i was floating out of the hotel room. i remembered standing outside of the hotel room on the rooftop looking back into the window at my roommate laying in bed.  inside the room with him i could see three gray aliens standing by his bed holding his leg and giving him some sort of an injection. i was pounding on the window yelling for him to wake up. i also was trying to find a way back into the hotel. when they were done working with my roommate they came back out to the rooftop where i was and then i noticed the large cigar shaped craft hovering above the hotel. i knew they were going to take me on board but i did not want to go without c coming with me. i begged for the grays to let me take c with. because i wanted him to be there so that he would remember this happening as well i did not want this to just be my memory. i had also asked because i was afraid and wanted c to be there and help talk me through this experience. c was then removed from his hotel room as well. at least seven other people were also removed from the hotel and boarded onto the cigar shaped craft. onboard all of us were placed in chairs which resembled beauty salon chairs with hairdryers above them. we were all restrained in the chairs and the parts that looked like a hairdryer was placed over each one of our heads and it fit very snuggly. i was placed in a slightly separate chair from everybody else. i was also restrained but they placed more sensors on me than they had used on the others present. \r\ni was afraid at this point of what was going to happen and begged for c to be brought over by me and help me to relax. c was brought over to me and i could tell that he was still sleeping but they made him talk to me which helped me to relax. then they started the procedure on all of us. it reminded me of a milking parlor but only it was a milking of the mind rather then anything sexual taking place. the machine and sensors that i was hooked up to where hooked up to the other people who had been taken. there were a couple of benefactors as well as some people higher up in mufon. it seems like they were taking their information and copying it from the other people. when they were done with that then i was made or told to remember my experiences and what i knew and that information was downloaded to the other people. it was as if they needed to know what i knew for some reason. none of us were injured in anyway. i do remember at one point during the procedure blood samples were taken from each of us for some reason. there were approximately 20 or more alien beings on board the craft in the room with us as the procedure was being done. when all of the information had been gathered and procedures were done i was put to sleep and we were all returned to our hotel rooms. at one point on saturday the 26th i was sitting in a seminar and had a memory flashback. i borrowed a black light from c and went up to my hotel room. my roommate was in the room watching tv and resting his leg. i asked him if he remembered anything happening last night. he told me that he slept like the dead and he felt very well rested but remembered nothing. i then looked at his left leg and noticed a red round mark about the size of a quarter. there were also what appeared to be bruises next to the mark. i then use the black light on my pajamas and my bed and various parts of the hotel room. then he used the black light on my roommates leg and flourestd. i became slightly afraid and called c on my phone and handed it to my roommate. he told c to come up to the room. c came up to the hotel room to find out what was going on. i told him what i remembered happening then showed him my roommates leg as well as my pajamas. we then checked the hotel room with the black light and tried to photograph various parts of the hotel room as well as the mark and bruises on my roommates leg. i began to panic and left the hotel room to go get some fresh air and clear my head. seeing my roommates leg made the experience more real than i was ready for. i went for a long walk out by the pool then gathered myself enough to go back to the seminar and try to forget the night before as well as the mark on my roommates leg.","distance":"101-500

been either late autumn or early spring.\r\n\r\ni was walking home from an evening college class in bilston, a suberb of wolverhampton. i was a full time college student, studying mechanical engineering at that time and was so, from 1965 to 1969. after leaving the college annex (an old school), i was walking home on my own. home was only about 3/4 mile away from the annex.\r\n\r\nwhilst walking down a footpath between two adjacent roads, i noticed a single multi-coloured flashing light in the sky, off to my right and in the distance. approximately from the direction of birmingham (se?). it was moving very slowly and just looked weird, so i stopped walking and watched it, until it flew past me and eventually disappeared, in the general direction of wolverhampton (nw?).\r\n\r\nas it came towards me, the single light at the front was continuously pulsing, changing from white, to red, to orange to yellow etc. as it drew side on to me, some several minutes later, the front light became not noticeable and i could make out the greyish cigar shape of the craft itself. at this point it became apparent, that what appeared to be something like a firework \"sparkler\", was continuously burning from the rear of the craft and the  silver \"sparks\" from it were continually falling downwards. i do not recall them actually reaching the ground. the sparkler effect was then visible from the rear of the craft, until it eventually disappeared into the distance.\r\n\r\nupon getting home, a short while later, i spoke to my parents of what i had seen and was met with a great degree of scepticesm and was told to ignore it. i decided to report this to the local police anyway and telephoned them a few minutes later. they were very interested in what i had to say and sent two policemen in a patrol car to my family home, to interview me and to take a statement from me. i have never heard anything since from anyone on this subject, but i have mentioned it, in the course of discussion, to my wife on occasion over the years, which has lead me to making this statement to you today and after watching several mufon programs on the tv.\r\n\r\nsome twenty years later, whilst with my teenaged daughter in a local library, i was browsing through some ufo books (as it has always stayed in my memory since the day that i saw it), with a view to seeing if i could see anything that looked even remotely like what i had seen that day. in one of the books that i was flicking through (book title unknown unfortunately), there was a picture/drawing of almost exactly what i had seen on that day and had reported to the police.\r\n\r\ni did telephone the police last year, after hearing that the uk had released information on many of the ufo reports that had been made over the years, to ask if there was any way that they may still have the report that i had made, all those years ago, but i was told no. documents from the 60's would not still be held locally at all. i did also make contact with the uk records office etc. to ask about the recently released ufo files, to ask if they could help me to uncover my original report, but i have to say that they were less than helpful. i would still love to know what it was that evening that i saw and if it had been reported by others as well.\r\n\r\ni hope that this information is of any use to you and would really be pleased if you have even the remotest information on this event.\r\n\r\nvery best regards....\r\n\r\njohn\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

hope airport to catch my flight home to santa rosa ca. the plane was boarding at about 4:45. it had taken me a few minutes to get onto the plane, burbank airport is an old airport and you walk out onto the tar mat and climb onto the plane. i was almost into the plane when i hard the sound of loud engines, i looked up and saw 2 air force one helicopters flying side by side and very low and there were 3 v22 osprey flying with them, one on either side and one in the rear. i pointed up and yelled out hey, its the presidents air force one and about 10 to 12 people that were there all looked up. i had never seen anything like that so i took out me cell phone to take a picture. i was too much in a hurry to take the picture as the helicopters were leaving and ended up taking a picture of myself in the door way of the plane i was boarding. i wasn't sure that i got the shot that i wanted and at that moment it seem like there was something else flying above me, i looked up and saw something else but it was for just a fraction of a second and it seemed to be fallowing the copters. it was kind of square and dark but then it was gone like it disappeared. at that moment i wasn't sure what just happened i was more interested in the presidents copters, but i did look to the man next to me and said what was that, he said he didn't know. i went into the plane and sat at my seat and went to look at the picture i had just taken and saw that i had just taken a picture of myself(my phone can take pictures front and back)i began to laugh and told the people next to me that all i got was a selfie. in the picture i saw that there was something above my head and thought i got one of the copters, i zoomed in on it and realized it was what i had saw for that split second after the copters had flown over and i had caught it on camera. a bunch of us looked at it and couldn't figure out what it was, but it seemed to be flying behind the presidents air force one. later i found out that the president was in pasadena that day. i will try an send this picture with this story and see if anyone has ever seen something like this.
